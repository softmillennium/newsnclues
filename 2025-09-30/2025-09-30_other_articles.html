                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jared Padalecki portrayed beloved younger brother Sam Winchester on Supernatural for 15 seasons and just as many years, and these 10 performances are his best overall on the show. Padalecki's true breakout role was on Gilmore Girls, in which he ironically played a character named Dean, although he had begun acting several years earlier. Padalecki has also starred in numerous shows in the last few years, but there's little question that Padalecki's best-known role to date is Sam Winchester, for which he also had many of his greatest acting moments of all time. In particular, these 10 Supernatural episodes represent Jared Padalecki's best performances as Sam Winchester—and number one is undeniable. Although Supernatural season 6, episode 6, "You Can't Handle the Truth" may not frequently be listed as one of Supernatural's best episodes, in terms of Padalecki's acting, it's a brilliant episode. Season 6 focused in part on Sam's return from Lucifer's cage with some odd behaviors, which the show eventually revealed was because Sam didn't have his soul; it remained trapped in the cage. It takes time for that information to come out, though, and by "You Can't Handle the Truth," Dean still didn't know his brother was missing his soul. It was surely no easy feat to play an entirely different version of Sam (and one that was so contrary to how Sam had been for five seasons), yet Padalecki pulls it off beautifully. Like "You Can't Handle the Truth," season 12, episode 1, "Keep Calm and Carry On" may not frequently be cited as one of Supernatural's strongest episodes, but it was undoubtedly a very tough episode for Padalecki. While Dean is dealing with the shocking return of his mother, Mary Winchester, Sam has been taken by the British Men of Letters. Torture scenes are always going to be physically and emotionally demanding for an actor, and Padalecki was facing some seriously challenging scenes. Yet, this stands out as one of Padalecki's best performances of all time, especially because he not only managed to believably play being tortured but also because, through it all, he maintained Sam's personality and captured how this nuanced character would have reacted to these awful circumstances. Before this discovery is made (including by Sam and Dean), Sam and Madison strike up a romance, and she is seemingly the first woman Sam fully opened his heart to following the tragic death of his girlfriend, Jessica, in the Supernatural pilot. This is one of the few times we see Dean flinch in Supernatural, which conveys how emotionally painful it was for Sam to have to kill Madison. Padalecki fully captures how devastating this was for Sam, and his tears before he kills her feel incredibly real. As a tonal shift from the first three episodes mentioned on this list, season 5, episode 12, "Swap Meat," sees Sam in a hilarious body swap situation, in which a teenager is inhabiting Sam's body, and Sam is inhabiting the teen's. This is a particularly impressive feat for Padalecki because of his multiple roles in the episode. At no point does the episode feel goofy or overstated in terms of Padalecki's performance, though. It shouldn't come as any surprise that season 5, episode 8, "Changing Channels," is also on this list, as it is easily one of Supernatural's most beloved episodes. In "Changing Channels," Sam and Dean are sent into various TV shows, including a game show called "Nutcracker," which involves Sam experiencing a rather unfortunate injury. Yet again, this episode could come off as just being goofy, but both Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles manage to make the stakes feel significant and real. For that reason, despite this being one of Supernatural's more comedic and even sillier episodes, it's one of Padalecki's best performances. Like "Changing Channels," season 3, episode 11, "Mystery Spot," (another Trickster episode) is one of Supernatural's best, and it leans heavily on Padalecki for the acting. In this episode, Sam is subjected to the same day over and over again, which always cuts off and begins again with Dean's death. The distress of being trapped in the same day and watching his brother die in myriad horrible ways more than one hundred times is palpable in Padalecki's performance, which manages to make a plot that has appeared in other shows and movies (like Groundhog Day) feel new again. A frankly underrated episode of Supernatural in terms of Jared Padalecki's performance is season 2, episode 14, "Born Under a Bad Sign." Sam Winchester goes through some harrowing emotional and physical moments in Supernatural, and one of the most brutal is in season 4, episode 21, "When the Levee Breaks." It's clear throughout the episode that Sam is in agonizing pain, and he also begins hallucinating horrible things, including that the demon who tortured Dean in Hell, Alastair, has come to torture him as well. What makes this particularly heartbreaking is that Sam, believing this torture to be real, is calling out to Dean and Bobby for help. Because they are waiting for Sam's withdrawal to end, though, neither Dean nor Bobby goes to Sam, leaving him feeling terrified and abandoned. Padalecki depicts all of these emotions perfectly, and he likewise captures just how violent and painful these withdrawal symptoms are for Sam. Although there's plenty of love for Supernatural's 15 seasons, there are many who argue that the season 5 finale would have been a better ending to the show. Among the most impressive moments is when Padalecki has to portray Lucifer in Sam's body speaking to Sam in a mirror. It would be all too easy for this scene to come off as a bit goofy, but that's far from the case. Finally, season 6, episode 15, "The French Mistake" is widely regarded as the greatest of Supernatural's masterpiece episodes, and that extends to Padalecki's acting. Incredibly, Padalecki (and Ackles as well) manages to completely pull this off, depicting Sam as a terrible actor and thoroughly confused by what has transpired. Although "The French Mistake" was taking a major risk with such an unusual plot, it completely paid off, and it's easily the best of Jared Padalecki's performances as Sam Winchester in Supernatural. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UNLV football coach Dan Mullen has the internet buzzing with jokes after sharing a video of something in the sky. As OutKick readers know, the UFO topic is a hot one. People can't get enough when it comes to videos and photos of unexplained things in the sky. Get ready for the rare crossover event setting social media on fire. The former Florida coach and current UNLV leader posted a video Sunday night of a very large white light racing through the air over Las Vegas. You can check out the footage below, and come to your own conclusions. Many were quick to point out it was likely a SpaceX-related launch, which is extremely common to see in that region. Others decided to start cracking jokes, and I have to admit that the responses were pretty funny. There's also plenty of people who are already tying Dan Mullen to the Arkansas job after Sam Pittman was kicked to the curb. Add in a Las Vegas angle, and it's like we stuck our favorite topics in a blender together. Dan Mullen is going viral after sharing a video of a massive white light racing through the sky.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These haunted towns in the U.S. all have a paranormal past that they just can't seem to shake. Whether you're intrigued by the paranormal or hoping to have your own encounter, there are plenty of haunted places in the U.S. that are perfect for spooky season. Some of these towns fully embrace their ghost stories and feature them prominently on their tourism boards with a sense of paranormal pride. Others take a more reserved approach, perhaps due to the ornery nature of whatever lurks around. If you're interested in attempting a connection with the other side, visit one of these haunted towns in the U.S. this spooky season. Salem might just be the best town for spooky season. You can't mention Salem and not think of the 1692 witch trials; it's certainly their “claim to fame.” During the fall (especially around Halloween), Salem becomes a mega-popular tourist attraction, with hundreds of travelers visiting to learn the lore. The Vieux Carré has an infamous history filled with ghosts, ghouls, and even a Voodoo Queen or two. Wander around the 78 square blocks of the French Quarter long enough, and you'll undoubtedly stumble into a building or two with a paranormal past. Swing by Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar and you might just catch a glimpse of the ghost of Jean Lafitte, America's most infamous pirate. The city's cemeteries also have a paranormal history. You can visit most cemeteries on your own, but there's one in particular that you'll need a licensed guide to enter—St. Savannah is a city overflowing with history, mystery, and intrigue. She is buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, and legend has it that the little girl's ghost lingers within the cemetery. Even if you're not looking for her ghost, the Bonaventure Cemetery is worth a visit. Its beautiful Spanish moss-draped live oak trees and beautiful Gothic statues were the inspiration for several literary and cinematic pieces, including John Berendt's 1994 best-selling book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Many cities and towns with a heavy Civil War history have some paranormal claim, and Gettysburg is no exception. The site of one of the most famous Civil War battles is renowned for its ghost stories, paranormal activity, and inexplicable occurrences. Many visitors to Gettysburg report seeing the apparitions of Civil War soldiers and even hearing the faint sounds of battle. There are plenty of Gettysburg ghost stories to keep you up at night. At its peak, the town had five hotels, dancing halls, saloons, a newspaper, and 2,000 residents. Surrounded by some of the most successful gold and silver mines in the area and being a stop on the Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad, St. Elmo was poised for continued growth. St. Elmo is considered to be one of the best-preserved ghost towns in the country (although a handful of people still live there). The sounds of a bustling town have been replaced with the sounds of chipmunks scurrying around (if you know, you know), yet the buildings remain a visible reminder of what once was. Cut off from the outside world, Annabelle began to make some questionable decisions. She would wander around the town with a rifle at her side, filthy from her lack of hygiene, claiming she was protecting the town. She earned the nickname “Dirty Annie,” and both she and her brother were taken to a mental institution, but were released. Annabelle passed away in a nursing home in 1960, though many have claimed to have seen her ghostly figure wander through the buildings of St. Elmo. Is anyone surprised that a town where Stephen King lived (pictured above) would have a ghost story or two? You can even take a tour of many of the places that inspired King's stories and actual film locations. Even if you don't have a paranormal encounter, there are plenty of things to do in Bangor to keep you entertained. Though you may have never heard of East Bethany before, you may have heard about the Rolling Hills Asylum that was built here. Originally called the Genesee County Poor Farm, this facility provided a home for orphans, widowed woman and their children, the disabled, mentally ill, and also minor criminals. Residents were called inmates, and had “chores” including everything from building coffins to raising farm animals. During spooky season, it is easily one of the most popular places in New York, and events sell out quickly. Visit the Rollings Hill Asylum website to learn more. Try planning your own trip to one of these haunted towns in the U.S. using Only In Your State's itinerary planner. The best urban legend in South Carolina evokes a fear that many of us share: being buried alive. With history and heart, it feels like stepping back in time. Step into a Southern town with charm and secrets. Moss-draped streets and eerie vibes make it feel straight out of a vampire story. Troy, Alabama feels like stepping back in time, where centuries-old homes and historic streets tell stories of the past. This small Southern town preserves its heritage while inviting visitors to experience history firsthand. Only In Your State is a Launch Potato brand</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They argued the teen's death was not fully investigated to rule out foul play. Since her death in July 2015, her parents have continued to say their daughter may have been murdered. The Valiantes filed their suit under the New Jersey Crime Victims' Bill of Rights, their attorney, Paul D'Amato, said at a news conference in July. A judge is expected to rule on both dismissal motions in early November, court records show. D'Amato did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday about the motions to dismiss the case. New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Jacob Stockton argued in court papers that the teen's parents had already litigated their daughter's death investigation in a 2019 lawsuit. The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to an NJ Advance Media request for comment. The statute of limitations to sue under that act has expired, the attorney general's office said in court papers. “Tiffany's parents now bring suit alleging that the ME's Office and New Jersey Transit Police failed to properly investigate her death and that there is evidence indicating that her death was not a suicide,” Stockton wrote in his motion. “However, they filed an essentially identical civil suit with this Court in 2019, which had been dismissed with prejudice in 2021.” Attorneys for NJ Transit made similar arguments in their court filing, adding that the family's claims under the state's victims' bill of rights have “no private right of action.” July's lawsuit was also the first time newly surfaced text messages from the teen's phone were used as evidence. Philadelphia-based Cornerstone Discovery reported recovering about 100,000 pieces of data. Tiffany Valiante, a volleyball star at Oakcrest High School in Mays Landing, was nearing the start of college when she died. Authorities said after a party, she discarded her phone at the end of her driveway, hiking more than four miles at night to the train tracks. Tiffany Valiante's death was featured in an episode of the Netflix series “Unsolved Mysteries.” The family has filed several lawsuits since the teen's death, including cases to obtain copies of investigative reports from NJ Transit Police and to have her official cause of death reclassified as undetermined.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a Sept. 30 news release, Good Boy, a paranormal horror film with music composed by award-winning teacher and musician Sam Boase-Miller, is set to open in theaters Oct. 3. The movie is being distributed by Independent Film Company and Shudder. The film, told from the perspective of Indy, a dog who can see supernatural forces, was shot over three years at a country home outside New York City. Director Ben Leonberg said his goal was to create a haunted house story from an entirely new viewpoint. “When we set out to make Good Boy, I wanted to create a haunted house movie from an entirely new perspective,” Leonberg said. The film premiered March 8 at the 2025 South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, where it sold out multiple screenings. Boase-Miller, who graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy and is now the coordinator of the audio technology department at Northwestern Michigan College, composed the score using both cello and experimental instruments. Among them is the “Celloscillator,” an eight-string spinning zither he designed and built with his stepfather, Conrad Kaufman. “Being able to watch the film with the creative team and an audience of hundreds reacting to it in real time made me fall in love with cinema all over again,” Boase-Miller said after the SXSW premiere. A special screening with a live question-and-answer session with Boase-Miller is scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at AMC Cherry Blossom 14 in Traverse City.</p>

The weeks are counting down until Tracker returns for Season 3 in the 2025 TV schedule, with a much smaller cast of series regulars this time around. On the plus side, Jensen Ackles is once again joining Justin Hartley as his on-screen brother, and he'll actually be around for more episodes than I expected. As the show hypes the upcoming return on social media, I'm not even a little bit surprised to see that Supernatural fans wasted no time in finding connections to Ackles' previous show. After news broke that he'd reunite with Justin Hartley for Season 3 after wrapping on Prime Video's Countdown, I'd assumed it would be another one-off like his appearances in each of the first two seasons. Instead, it appears that Colter will have his brother on hand in a big way to start out Season 3. Whether that's because Russell is around to help or Russell is in need of help remains to be seen, but I'm on board with two episodes of Ackles opposite Hartley. Tracker hasn't shied away from nodding to Jensen Ackles' fifteen seasons of Supernatural, with a bunch of Supernatural Easter eggs in just his first episode. Take a look at the video that had fans talking: Admittedly, there's no moment in the preview that's as obvious as Russell climbing into an Impala or sleeping in a cheap motel room a la the Winchester brothers, but that didn't stop Supernatural fans from hitting the comment section to weigh in on the rock-paper-scissors moment. A running joke from back in Jensen Ackles' CW days was that Dean almost always lost rock-paper-scissors because he almost always used scissors. Here are just some of the examples of Supernatural fans applying that lesson to Tracker in the Instagram comments (edited for clarity): Tracker returns to CBS with the Season 3 premiere on Sunday, October 19 at 8 p.m. You can revisit the first two seasons streaming on Paramount+ now, and if you're not in the mood to check out some Supernatural seasons, you can find all fifteen streaming with a Netflix subscription now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the second time this year, FBI Director Kash Patel has stepped forward to correct claims about a MAGA conspiracy theory he once played a key role in promoting. For the second time this year, he could be fighting a losing battle. Months ago, it was Patel's sudden move to downplay the Jeffrey Epstein files. As a right-wing commentator, he had played up a massive supposed conspiracy that suggested the government was hiding others who were involved in Epstein's crimes, saying at one point, “Put on your big boy pants, and let us know who the pedophiles are.” We got something of a repeat this weekend after conservative media and President Donald Trump seized on leaked information that said 274 FBI agents were dispatched amid the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump quickly cast it in the most scandalous terms. (CNN has not confirmed the veracity of the document and has previously reported that no undercover FBI agents were at the Capitol on January 6, according to a DOJ watchdog, but that 26 paid FBI informants were in Washington, DC, that day.) He emphasized that the agents were called in afterward. “Agents were sent into a crowd control mission after the riot was declared by Metro Police …” Patel told Fox News Digital on Saturday. He later promoted the story on X, again emphasizing these agents were responding to the attack – not being there “prior to” it. He said that “274 FBI agents were thrown into crowd control on Jan 6.” But almost immediately, his own appointed FBI director – a loyalist if there ever was one – stepped forward and completely undermined it. (He repeatedly said that went against FBI “standards.”) But the real point is that he was saying, contra Trump and others, that these agents were not “secretly placed” in the crowds beforehand to act as agitators. And it's all the more remarkable given Patel's own history with this particular conspiracy theory. In his 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” Patel claimed there were “strange agitators” at the Capitol on January 6. “All the signs of a cover-up are on full display …” Patel said. He  went even further on his podcast in November 2022, claiming the FBI had been “planning Jan. 6 for a year.” In September of that year, he suggested the FBI had entrapped rioters and that the FBI targeted January 6 “because they wanted a political target, a political prosecution, not one based on law and fact.” But at one point, he took issue with an FBI official who didn't directly respond when asked if federal agents were involved with January 6. As with the Epstein files, it's extremely telling that a man so steeped in these conspiracy theories would see fit to correct them when he's actually got the evidence at his fingertips. These theories are often built on innuendo, speculation and misinformation. But as with the Epstein files, it's clear even Patel  can only do so much. Despite the FBI director's corrective on Saturday night, some MAGA voices have gone right along claiming the new evidence is a bombshell. Appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson still spoke as if FBI could have been involved in spurring the attack. Even as CNN's Jake Tapper noted that Patel had said the agents came after the riot started and said it wasn't evidence of a “false flag,” Johnson was undeterred. There's a lot of questions,” Johnson said, adding: “Did they spur on the crowd? Did they open the gates to allow them in? Prominent conservative leader Matt Schlapp went on Newsmax and cited “300 undercover FBI agents in the January 6 crowd.” “Don't forget, we just found out about all of these FBI agents being there,” the president  said. He  didn't repeat his claim that the agents were there beforehand or that they might have instigated the riot. But Trump – who faced a second impeachment over his own role in January 6 — is clearly not done casting this as somehow suspicious. If nothing else, Patel's move to correct this misinformation will provide a counterpoint to anybody – including Trump – who brings this up in the future.</p>
