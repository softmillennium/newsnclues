                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learner Tien advanced to his first ATP Tour title match on Tuesday at the China Open in Beijing, where he became the second-youngest finalist in tournament history. The #NextGenATP American Tien was competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final and looked down and out when he trailed 1-4 and 3-5 in the second set. However, he capitalised on some Medvedev errors in the closing stages of the second set and then benefited from the 29-year-old's lack of movement in the decider to advance after two hours and 26 minutes. "I didn't think anything was wrong with him and then he came out of the bathroom break kind of limping, so I was not sure if he was cramping or if he was injured as he had tape on his leg. I think it was cramping and I have been there and it is not fun. All the best to him and it is not how you want to come through a match but I am happy to be in the final." Tien now holds a 7-5 record against Top 20 players and is 2-0 against Medvedev in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having beaten the former World No. 1 at the Australian Open earlier this year. Tien is up 16 spots to No. 36 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is also set to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the second consecutive year. 2 Jannik Sinner in the Beijing title match on Wednesday. Tien is the second-youngest finalist in Beijing history behind Rafael Nadal, while he is the third-youngest tour-level finalist this season. Only Miami winner Jakub Mensik and Buenos Aires champion Joao Fonseca were younger. Medvedev struggled with his movement in the third set and had taping on his right knee. 18 was aiming to reach his second final of the year and first on hard courts since Indian Wells in March 2024. 36 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is also set to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the second consecutive year. 2 Jannik Sinner in the Beijing title match on Wednesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just nine days removed from his Laver Cup defeat to Fritz, the World No. 1 stamped his authority with a classy 6-4, 6-4 championship-match performance in Tokyo, capping a remarkable debut run at the ATP 500 event. Now boasting a Tour-best 67 wins and eight trophies in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz is threatening to better his rival Jannik Sinner's tally of 73 wins from last year. ‚ÄúIt's been my best season so far without a doubt,‚Äù Alcaraz said. ‚ÄúEight titles, 10 finals‚Ä¶ That shows how hard I've worked just to be able to experience these moments and accomplish my goals. I didn't start the year that good, struggling emotionally, so how I came back from that, I'm just really proud of myself, and of all the people around me who have helped me to be in this position.‚Äù Another city, another crown üëëüèÜ@carlosalcaraz defeats Fritz 6-4 6-4 to conquer Tokyo for the first time and claim his 8th title of the season. Although Fritz, who twice took a medical timeout to receive treatment on his left thigh, was unable to contain Alcaraz's trademark firepower in the final, he has strengthened his bid to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. In the first ATP 500 final between two Top-5 players since October last year, there was no shortage of breathtaking winners and early entertainment. Yet it did not come without drama, and more fitness concerns for Alcaraz, who suffered an injury scare in his first-round win over Sebastian Baez. He received a time violation warning from ATP umpire Fergus Murphy before taking a few extra seconds to regroup, but he then found a trademark lob over Fritz to hold serve in the ensuing point. Watch Alcaraz leave Fritz out to dry with lob perfection: Armed with his typically explosive forehand and instinctive returns, Alcaraz overwhelmed Fritz from all corners of the court and eventually converted his sixth break point to serve for the opener. During the first set, the Spaniard clocked a 9.7 Shot Quality on his forehand wing, from which he fired seven winners to just four unforced errors. Even though Fritz drilled a low backhand winner down the line to earn one of the breaks back late on, Alcaraz recovered by serving out the match on his second attempt after 93 minutes. He now leads Fritz 4-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It would likely be fair to say that Coco Gauff had a solid day Tuesday in Beijing. Not only did she come from a set down to defeat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 and advance to the China Open quarterfinals, but she also continued her title defense and clinched a spot in the 2025 WTA Finals. Coco Gauff stepped onto the court Tuesday with more at stake than usual for a fourth-round match. And while it wasn't easy, the two-time Grand Slam champion checked every box, rallying for a gritty 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Belinda Bencic in 2 hours and 29 minutes. ‚ÄúIt was a tough match,‚Äù Gauff said afterward. She was being really aggressive, but I tried my best. Gauff came out firing, dominating on serve and racing to a 4-1 lead. Bencic stormed back, winning five straight games to steal the opening set and later went up a break in the second set. But as she so often does, Gauff dug in. Gauff entered the day with a 9-5 record in tiebreaks this year; Bencic was slightly better at 9-4. She broke twice as she improved to 12-2 in three-set matches this season, once again showing the resilience of a champion when it matters most. GAUFF GETS IT DONE üí™@CocoGauff completes the comeback against Bencic over three sets, 4-6, 7-6, 6-2 üëè#2025ChinaOpen pic.twitter.com/4wVgVFSXb0 Here are three fun facts from Thursday's match: Home away from home: Gauff says she loves playing in Beijing and given the number of gifts she continues to receive from fans, it's easy to see why. ‚ÄúI hope so,‚Äù Gauff said when asked if more presents might be coming. With Tuesday's win, Gauff has now beaten Bencic three times in four tries this season. The third win against each sent both players packing in their search for Beijing glory. And that she's also the youngest to play 14 matches, win 13 matches and reach three quarterfinals at the event -- all since its inception. It would likely be fair to say that Coco Gauff had a solid day Tuesday in Beijing. Not only did she come from a set down to defeat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 and advance to the China Open quarterfinals, but she also continued her title defense and clinched a spot in the 2025 WTA Finals.</p>
