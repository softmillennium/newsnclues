The memo directs the US Attorney's Office to “prosecute any individual” who “impedes or intimidates” ICE officers.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has issued a new memorandum instructing several agencies within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to aid in arresting and charging people with crimes if they protest or otherwise impede actions taken by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The memo is similar to one released last week by President Donald Trump, which details how his administration would target individuals deemed to be “Antifa,” following his designation of the nonexistent organization as a “domestic terrorist” group.

Like Trump's memo, Bondi's references supposed “riots” in American cities and a shooting at an ICE facility earlier this month, which killed two people who were being detained. Her memo also targets criticism of ICE by lawmakers, signaling that the directive will seek to quell speech rights.

The memo calls on multiple agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to aid in the arrest and prosecution of individuals acting against ICE's interests. It also establishes a “temporary ICE Protection Task Force” consisting of “state and local law enforcement officers protecting ICE facilities.”

“Enough is enough,” Bondi writes in her missive. “The Department of Justice will stand strong when federal law enforcement officers are attacked or threatened for doing their sworn duty.”

Bondi's memo doesn't elaborate on what it means for an agent to be “threatened,” but the fact that it includes criticism of ICE and the administration suggests that it could be broadly interpreted in a way that targets speech.

The memo directs the U.S. Attorney's Office to “prosecute any individual” who “impedes or intimidates” ICE officers to the “fullest extent of the law,” including any person who “aids, abets, or conspires to commit these crimes, whether through funding, coordination, planning, or other means.”

Many of the orders within Bondi's memo are already being carried out, Law Dork's Chris Geidner reported, adding that the document “could be more of a P.R. show” to emphasize Trump's orders last week.

Still, the barrage of memos and other orders from the Trump administration suggests an escalation of the government's crackdown on dissent may be on its way. In an article published on the White House website on Tuesday, the Trump administration tried to justify sending federal troops to Portland, Oregon, wrongly characterizing demonstrations in the city as acts of terrorism.

“The Radical Left's reign of terror in Portland ends now, with President Donald J. Trump mobilizing federal resources to stop Antifa-led hellfire in its tracks,” reads the article, entitled “President Trump Deploys Federal Resources to Crush Violent Radical Left Terrorism in Portland.”

City and state officials filed a joint lawsuit this week seeking to stop Trump from ordering National Guard troops to Portland.

Within that lawsuit, the city of Portland and the state of Oregon said that such a mobilization would be an “unlawful deployment.”

Trump “lacks authority” under federal law, the plaintiffs contend, because presidents can only summon troops with the request of governors or in “circumstance of invasion, rebellion, or when federal laws cannot otherwise be executed.”

“None of those circumstances exist in Oregon,” the suit adds.

Despite Trump's fearmongering, both the city and state are “stable,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said recently.

“Our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,” Rayfield explained in a statement. “Sending in 200 National Guard troops to guard a single building is not normal.”



As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Last month, HHS warned dozens of states to drop lessons on transgender health or face millions in funding cuts.

Multiple states are jointly suing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., over new rules restricting what can be taught in sexual education classes, including lessons that acknowledge the existence of transgender people. 

Last month, the Trump administration threatened to cut funding to states that acknowledge transgender or nonbinary people in their sex ed classes. The cuts would affect access to funds from two vital government programs — the Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) program and the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP).

The funding limitations could affect children's education in places with high teenage birth rates, potentially leading to higher numbers of teen pregnancies. Funding cuts could also limit education for kids who are unhoused or in the foster care system. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

In its warning that was published in August, HHS told 46 states and territories that their funding was in danger of being withheld due to lessons that included discussion of transgender people. The department baselessly claimed that teaching so-called “gender ideology” would “poison the minds of the next generation,” a reference to the false “social contagion” hypothesis that wrongly asserts children are only coming out as transgender or nonbinary because it is a fad.

Arguments based on the social contagion theory “[do] not hold up to scrutiny and should not be used to argue against the provision of gender-affirming medical care for adolescents,” wrote Alex S. Keuroghlian, former director of the National LGBTQIA+ Health Education Center at The Fenway Institute, in a study published in 2022.

Minnesota, Washington, and Oregon are leading a total of 16 states and Washington D.C. in the lawsuit against the administration over the funding cuts. The suit alleges that at least $35 million, perhaps more, could be withheld from sex ed programs within those states. 

The administration has already cut funding to California due to its curriculum that includes acknowledgment of transgender and nonbinary people. HHS withdrew $12 million in PREP funds after the state refused to change its lesson plans.

The lawsuit claims that “HHS's actions directly contradict the statutes creating these programs,” and that “PREP and SRAE require federally funded sexual health education content be ‘medically accurate and complete,' ‘culturally appropriate' or provided in the appropriate ‘cultural context,'” per federal law.

“Forcing Plaintiff States to remove medically supported, complete, and culturally appropriate content in the materials for PREP and SRAE is contrary to the laws that Congress adopted and is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,” the states' lawsuit contends. 

By potentially withholding funds over lessons that acknowledge transgender people, the states are “irreparably harm[ed],” the suit continues, adding that they are collectively forced “into an impossible position: lose critical funding for sexual health education programs, or violate federal and state laws requiring medically accurate, non-discriminatory information within those programs.” 

“Either course will harm the very at-risk adolescents and public health goals these programs are designed to protect,” the lawsuit adds.

Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, a father of four, ‘succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support' 

A second person who was shot recently at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility in Dallas, Texas, has died, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac), which is representing his family.

Lulac announced in a news release on Tuesday that Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, 32, had “succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support following the [24 September] sniper attack on the Dallas Ice facility”.

His wife, Stephany Gauffeny, said in a statement that her husband was “a good man, a loving father and the provider for our family”.

“We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed,” she added. “His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”

The organization said that García-Hernández, who is from Mexico, leaves behind four young children and his wife, who is expecting their fifth child. The statement added that the family had just recently moved into their first home.

Gauffeny told NPR over the weekend that her husband worked as a house painter before he was detained.

García-Hernández was one of three people shot at the Ice facility. The shooting initially left one detainee dead and two others critically wounded.

On Monday, Ice officials identified the other slain victim as 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador, who died the on day of the shooting.

A statement from Ice said that Guzman-Fuentes, while in custody, “suffered a senseless and tragic fatal gunshot wound during a senseless sniper assault” on the agency's field office in Dallas.

The third victim, identified in reports as Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, has reportedly been released from the hospital, according to CBS news, citing a Department of Homeland Security official.

The gunman, identified by authorities as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. No law enforcement officers were injured in the attack.

Authorities have described the shooting as a “targeted attack” on Ice and said that they believe that the suspect acted alone. Texas officials have said that they believe the shooting came after a “high degree of planning” – and noted that an “anti-Ice” shell casing was recovered at the scene.

They also said that investigators found handwritten notes at the suspect's residence outlining a “game plan” for the attack and to “target areas at the facility” – and that the suspect “called the Ice employees ‘people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck'”.

Authorities have said that the FBI is investigating the shooting as an act of targeted violence.

CBS also reported that the Dallas Ice field office is expected to reopen on Tuesday with increased security.

Metals analysts are cutting their estimates of global copper supplies for this year and next after an accident at the giant Grasberg mine dramatically tightened the outlook for the market.

Copper prices hit 15-month highs of $10,485 a metric ton last week after Freeport-McMoRan declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine and cut sales forecast from the Indonesian unit for this year and 2026.

Freeport's Grasberg operation located in Indonesia suspended operations on September 8 after a deadly mud slide.

The world's second-largest copper mine behind Chile's Escondida faces a lengthy damage assessment process and a clear-up while the search for missing workers continues.

“The scale of this disruption is very big,” said Albert Mackenzie, a copper analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

Benchmark's analysis suggests the disruption will amount to 591,000 tons of lost copper output between September 2025 and the end of 2026.

This amounts to 2.6% of the 2024 global mine production estimated at around 23 million tons by analysts.

Supply losses from Grasberg mean the global copper market is facing a significantly wider deficit of around 400,000 tons in 2025, according to Benchmark Minerals.

The disruption has shifted Goldman Sachs' 2025 copper market balance from a projected surplus of 105,000 tons to a deficit of 55,500 tons. It expects a small surplus in 2026.

With the losses in Grasberg's September-December production, the copper market faces the largest deficit since 2004, Societe Generale said on Monday.

The suspension at Grasberg follows other large disruptions this year including Kamoa-Kakula in the Democratic Republic of Congo and El Teniente mine in Chile.

This year's mine supply was already expected to come in below every forecast over the past 15 years and this is now exacerbated by unexpected supply disruptions, Bank of America analyst Michael Widmer said in a note.

BofA raised its estimate of the 2026 copper market deficit to 350,000 tons from a previous 162,000 tons and upgraded its 2026 and 2027 copper price forecast by 11% and 12.5% to $11,313 a ton and $13,500 respectively.

Copper's record high was in May 2024, when it hit $11,104.50 a ton.

SOCHI, September 30. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the issue of possible US Tomahawk cruise missiles for Ukraine has not been resolved.

"I think this is primarily the result of European pressure on Washington, and Washington wants to show that it takes into account the opinions of its allies. I don't think we have seen the final decision," Lavrov told reporters on the sidelines of the 22nd annual meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club.

He also said he would be surprised if the United States considered Ukraine a responsible state to receive Tomahawks.

"The Americans don't supply Tomahawks to everyone. Among Europeans, if I'm not mistaken, they supply them to Spain and the Netherlands; they're somewhat wary of the rest. If they believe that Ukraine is a responsible nation that will use them responsibly, that would be surprising to me," he added.

Lavrov cited remarks by US officials, including Keith Kellogg, the US Presidential Special Envoy for Ukraine, and Vice President JD Vance. He noted that Kellogg has taken a strongly pro-Ukraine stance, even as President Donald Trump has described himself as a mediator who says Ukraine and Russia should resolve issues directly. Kellogg recently advised Ukraine to accept reality and de facto acknowledge that the territory is what it is now, and to stop worrying about it, drawing an analogy about the Baltic states' status during the Soviet era and their later independence. Lavrov said such remarks contrast with Trump's position and indicated that many speakers at the meeting were promoting the Ukrainian agenda.

He concluded by saying that the Kremlin is confident that even if Tomahawks are deployed in Ukraine, they will not change the military equation.

“Republicans are still refusing to come to the table” regarding Democrats' demands, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal.

Anyone wondering “who owns” the looming government shutdown following negotiations between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders that went nowhere on Monday should “look no further” said one Democratic lawmaker, than the racist, artificial intelligence-created video posted by the president shortly after the meeting, which depicted House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries with a Mexican sombrero and fake mustache.

“Democrats came to the White House to keep the government open,” said Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.). “The president answered with a racist AI video.”

Trump posted the video of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Jeffries, also of New York, after they emerged from the meeting, where Schumer said “large differences” remained between Democrats and Republicans over healthcare provisions in a government spending bill.

“Bigotry will get you nowhere,” said Jeffries in response to Trump's posted video, before adding: “Cancel the Cuts. Lower the Cost. Save Healthcare. We are NOT backing down.”

Democrats have consistently called for an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are slated to expire at the end of the year and to reverse Medicaid cuts included in the Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Republicans including Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) have falsely claimed the Democrats are pushing to fund “free healthcare” for undocumented immigrants in their budget proposal to keep the government funded through October.

The Democratic proposal would restore the eligibility of “lawfully present” immigrants for ACA subsidies, but would not change the fact that undocumented immigrants are not eligible for healthcare plans through the ACA or coverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program.

In the fake video posted on Truth Social by Trump, Schumer was shown making statements he has never made about the Democrats needing to give undocumented immigrants free healthcare so they will vote for the party—which they're also not eligible to do.

Jeffries, who is Black, was also shown wearing a sombrero as mariachi music played in the background.

”This is peak Donald Trump and it's a goddamn tragedy for our country,” said Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.).

The Republicans need at least 60 votes in the Senate to pass their spending bill to keep the government funded through November 21, meaning they won't be able to pass it without at least eight Democrats joining them.

The GOP-controlled House passed the Republicans' funding extension this month, but it failed in the Senate. Johnson has adjourned the House until October 7.

On Monday, Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) posted a video on social media as she arrived at the Capitol for what had been scheduled to be a “voting day” for members of the House.

“Republicans cancelled votes and didn't show up for work tonight,” said Stansbury, “because they would rather see the government shut down than negotiate a bipartisan deal to save your healthcare, to keep the government open, and to keep federal workers working, which is exactly why we are here.”

We're here! But guess what? … All the doors are locked as the GOP cancelled votes and is pushing us towards a government shutdown. pic.twitter.com/7ugKtCYezQ

Democrats have warned that up to 15 million people could lose their healthcare coverage and 24 million could see their monthly insurance premiums rise by 75% — per an analysis by KFF — under the Republican spending plan.

Schumer said that at the White House meeting Monday, he and Jeffries “laid out to the president some of the consequences of what's happening in healthcare.”

“By his face, he looked like he heard about them for the first time,” said Schumer. “It's in the president's hands whether we avoid a shutdown or not. He has to convince the Republican leaders.”

Republicans are planning to force another vote in the Senate on the House-passed funding extension on Tuesday, ahead of the midnight shutdown deadline.

The Trump administration has said it will unleash a new wave of mass firings in the federal government if the government shuts down.

On social media Monday, The New Republic posted that the “tired punditry of shutdown politics doesn't adequately illustrate Republican villainy.”

“This shutdown is happening because the aforementioned party of dictatorship wants it to happen so it can destroy the federal government and vastly reduce the number of things it does for people,” said the magazine. “What that means: massive layoffs in many departments and agencies, with the hope of making as many as possible permanent. The Trump White House wants to cut the State Department by 84%, the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 43%, and the Labor Department by 35%. If the government shuts down Tuesday night, it wants to furlough as many people as it can get away with. Except, of course, in two areas: immigration enforcement and defense. There, it's party time.”

Republican leaders, including Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), have claimed Democrats will be responsible for a government shutdown, saying the two parties can negotiate over healthcare after the funding extension is passed.

But, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), “Republicans are still refusing to come to the table” regarding Democrats' demands.

“They control every chamber in Congress and the White House,” she said. “This shutdown is on them.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            South Africa's ambassador to France has been found dead at the foot of a high-rise hotel in Paris, hours after he was reported missing, prosecutors in the city told CNN.
    


            Nkosinathi Emmanuel “Nathi” Mthethwa, was “discovered directly below” a Hyatt Hotel in Paris on Tuesday, according to the prosecutor's office, which added that the envoy had booked a room on the 22nd floor. The secure window in the room “was forced open,” the office said, adding that the duty magistrate was on scene.
    


            Mthethwa's wife had reported him missing on Monday, saying she had received a “disturbing message” from him, according to the prosecutor's office.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Hyatt Group of hotels and the Hyatt Regency, but has not received any comment.
    


            South Africa's foreign ministry confirmed Mthethwa's death “with deep sorrow and profound regret” in a statement on Tuesday, expressing condolences to the ambassador's family.
    


            “I have no doubt that his passing is not only a national loss but is also felt within the international diplomatic community,” South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said, according to Tuesday's statement.
    


            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa eulogized Mthethwa in a post on social media on Tuesday, writing that the diplomat had “served our nation in diverse capacities during a lifetime that has ended prematurely and traumatically.”
    


            Mthethwa, 58, was appointed ambassador to France in December 2023. He had previously served as a member of South Africa's parliament and as minister of sports, arts and culture, according to his embassy profile.

MOSCOW, September 30. /TASS/. The Kiev regime is planning to carry out a provocation in Poland with sabotage and reconnaissance groups disguised as Russian and Belarusian special forces, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said in a statement made available to TASS.

It noted that Ukraine is orchestrating "another widely publicized provocation." "According to information obtained by Russia's SVR, the Kiev regime, following its attempts at provocations with unmanned aerial vehicles in Poland and Romania's airspace, continues its efforts to draw European NATO countries into an armed confrontation with Moscow. Another provocation is being prepared. This time, the scheme will revolve around a sabotage and reconnaissance group allegedly made up of servicemen from Russia and Belarus' special forces," the agency said.

It stressed that the candidates for the staged provocation had already been selected. "These are the militants from the Freedom of Russia legion (recognized as a terrorist organization and outlawed in Russia - TASS) fighting on the side of Ukraine and the Belarusian Kalinovsky regiment (recognized as a terrorist organization in Belarus - TASS)," the SVR press service said.

The SVR added that following the "detection and neutralization" of the sabotage and reconnaissance group by Polish special services, its members plan to talk to the media and "claim responsibility for Russia and Belarus' attempts to destabilize the situation in Poland." "Amid a series of incidents with ‘Russian drone incursions' into European countries, these developments should not leave any doubt among Polish and other European citizens that Moscow and Minsk are behind all hostile actions," the statement said.

The SVR press service underlined that the operation, masterminded by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) together with Polish intelligence, may involve simulated attacks on Poland's critical infrastructure facilities "in order to fuel public anger." "The provocation's objective is clear - to show the international community that Moscow is turning up the escalation spiral. Kiev expects to provoke European countries into delivering the harshest response to Russia, preferably militarily. Facing certain defeat, the Zelensky regime is prepared, shielded by Europeans, to go all out, even at the cost of sparking a 'major war,'" the statement emphasized.

Photojournalist Amber Bracken says that the Mounties' efforts to deny her bail and keep her in jail is frightening.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

The RCMP wanted a well-known photojournalist kept in custody for months or more after Mounties alleged she assaulted a sheriff following her high-profile arrest at the 2021 Wet'suwet'en pipeline standoff.

Documents filed with the B.C. Supreme Court as part of a civil suit launched by photographer Amber Bracken and The Narwhal media outlet against the RCMP showed how the Mounties tried – and quickly failed – to get Ms. Bracken charged and detained without bail for an incident related to her release from three nights in jail.

Ms. Bracken had been arrested in November, 2021, along with 14 others after RCMP moved in to remove protesters blocking access to a Coastal GasLink construction site near Houston, B.C., on Wet'suwet'en territory.

Ms. Bracken was arrested inside a cabin where some of the protesters were refusing to leave the pipeline project's so-called exclusion zone, which a special unit of the RCMP was tasked with clearing to make way for work crews. 

Her initial arrest prompted international concerns that heavy-handed police had violated the freedom of the press. 

Amber Bracken: Press credentials didn't help me against the RCMP in Wet'suwet'en territory. Who do they help, and who do they hinder?

In the lawsuit, Ms. Bracken and The Narwhal allege RCMP leadership knew she was a journalist and that she should not be arrested for contempt of an injunction as long as she was reporting on matters of public interest and not taking part in unlawful activity. 

Instead, she was taken to the nearby RCMP detachment on a Friday afternoon and spent the weekend in jail, according to the lawsuit.

During a civil hearing last Friday, court heard that upon Ms. Bracken's release from the Prince George jail, she got into an altercation with one of the sheriffs who was escorting her out of her cell.

CCTV of an alleged assault by Amber Bracken on a sheriff that her lawyer says amounted to Ms. Bracken pushing a finger into the officer's chest. The sheriff in question told police she had become “extremely agitated and struck him in the left shoulder with an aggressive punching/pushing motion." He told Mounties that evening that his shoulder hurt but he declined medical attention, according to court records. The Crown never approved the charge, and Ms. Bracken was released the next day.

The Globe and Mail

The sheriffs accused Ms. Bracken of assaulting a peace officer and called the RCMP. Mounties quickly determined she had committed the offence and recommended to the Crown that it was in the public interest to detain her until trial, according to police files entered into the civil proceedings.

It would take months for such a case to come to trial.

In the documents, the Prince George RCMP list several reasons why Crown counsel should order Ms. Bracken be kept in custody.

The RCMP argued that because Ms. Bracken lives in Edmonton, she would be unlikely to return for any future hearings and that her alleged assault of the sheriff “has interfered with the administration of justice.” 

The RCMP also claimed Ms. Bracken has shown “no regard for the laws under which she lives. Should Bracken be released it would place the justice system into disrepute.”

The Crown never approved the charge, and Ms. Bracken was released the next day. 

Ms. Bracken said after the court hearing last week that the Mounties' efforts to deny her bail and keep her in jail is frightening. 

“I value my personal freedom and I really wouldn't be a photojournalist if I didn't also value the checks on power that are foundational to a free society,” she said in an interview. 

“When that reality sinks in – the police would keep me in jail until trial on a charge like this – it's absolutely chilling.”

Secret Canada: Ottawa abusing access to information law to avoid releasing documents, watchdog says

On Monday, the RCMP declined comment on the incident and their internal files, stating the matter is now before the courts. 

A lawyer for the federal Department of Justice told the court last week the government wants the details of Ms. Bracken's second arrest struck from the current civil suit.

The court heard that hours before she was ultimately released for good, a Prince George detachment staff sergeant called a Crown prosecutor and then that prosecutor called him back 20 minutes later. The details of those conversations were redacted from the police files entered into court.

Sean Hern, the lawyer representing Ms. Bracken and The Narwhal, told the court she was admittedly not at her best when she argued with sheriffs after being told she had to then retrieve her expensive camera equipment from the local RCMP detachment. 

Before he played jail video of the incident, Mr. Hern told court the assault alleged by the sheriffs amounted to Ms. Bracken pushing a finger into the man's chest. 

But the sheriff told police Ms. Bracken had become “extremely agitated and struck him in the left shoulder with an aggressive punching/pushing motion,” according to court records.

The proceedings are set to continue this fall.

Exclusive: more than 100 members of Congress warn TPS cancellations will result in significant staff losses that US healthcare facilities will struggle to replace

The US healthcare system faces a “perfect storm”, more than 100 members of Congress warn today, as Donald Trump's administration risks exacerbating pressure on its workforce by stripping nearly one million US immigrants of work authorization and legal protection.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has granted about 570,000 US workers protection from deportation, as their home countries are regarded as dangerous, due to factors like war and natural disaster.

Under Trump, the federal government has sought to cancel this status for people from eight countries – Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, and Venezuela – raising concerns about the impact on key sectors of the US workforce.

In a letter sent today to senior Trump officials, seen by the Guardian, an array of Democratic lawmakers led by the veteran senator Elizabeth Warren caution that the US healthcare system “cannot withstand yet another blow” after broader cuts since Trump return to office. “The most vulnerable Americans in need of healthcare will pay the price,” they warn.

Signatories of the letter – sent to Kristi Noem, US homeland security secretary; Robert F Kennedy Jr, health and human services secretary; and Lori Chavez-DeRemer, labor secretary – include Warren, senators Chris Van Hollen, Ed Markey, Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth, andKirsten Gillibrand, as well as ongresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, and Jasmine Crockett.

Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, also signed the letter.

Immigrants make up between 32 to 40% of workers in US home care settings, they note in the letter, 24% in residential care, and 21% in nursing facilities. Some 15% of non-citizen healthcare workers originate from nations under temporary protected status.

“The TPS terminations, together with the massive cuts to Medicaid from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), will combine to create a perfect storm for Americans' health care,” the lawmakers write. “While the termination of TPS will remove thousands of health care workers from the workforce, the OBBBA will make deep cuts to Medicaid, force hospital and nursing home closures, and trigger health care workforce layoffs.”

The revocations could result in tens of thousands of immigrants reverting to being undocumented, and place them at risk of arrest and removal by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). They also raise questions about the administration's claims that they are only focused and targeting “criminals” and the “worst of the worst” in deportation efforts.

“The revocation of TPS belies the claim that they're going after criminals on its face, because everyone who has TPS has undergone rigorous and ongoing background checks,” said Chris Newman, legal director and general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), told the Guardian. “This is why it's so laughable on its face, that the Trump administration equates TPS with gang activity, because these are all people who have undergone background checks. It defies reality to make that claim.

“It's obvious the Trump administration is using the language of criminality as a justification to target and punish the innocent.”

Newman also represents the family of Kilmar Ábrego García, a father of three in Maryland whom the Trump administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March. A federal court later ordered his return to the US. The administration has continued in court to try to have Ábrego García deported again. He is being held in an immigration detention center in Pennsylvania.

In their letter, the lawmakers warn the TPS cancellations will result in significant staff losses that healthcare facilities across the US will struggle to replace, as the industry struggles to meet the growing demand for home healthcare and nursing workers for an ageing populace.

“Americans will pay the price if the health care workforce crisis is worsened by President Trump's TPS terminations,” the letter added. “As research on nursing home staffing shows, fewer nurses mean more medication errors, more falls, more delayed diagnoses, and increased patient mortality.

“Fewer nursing and home health professionals also have a ripple effect across the health care system, contributing to discharge backlogs in many other care settings – from post-acute rehabs to hospitals.”

The departments of homeland security; health and human services; and labor have been approached for comment.

A Russian National Guard senior officer and two other service members were killed in a Ukrainian intelligence operation in the North Caucasus on Sept. 27, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said.

The lieutenant colonel, his aide, and a driver were killed near the village of Tambukan in Russia's Stavropol Krai while traveling to a training ground, the agency revealed on Sept. 30.

HUR released footage of the Russian officer being watched from afar, and a subsequent explosion hitting his moving vehicle.

Ukraine's intelligence and security services have been linked to a number of assassinations targeting Russian military officers far from the front lines since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022.

The assassinated officer was identified as the commander of the Avangard unit of Russia's National Guard, tasked with maintaining public order and combating "terrorism" and "illegal armed groups."

The operation was carried out with the support of a group called the "Caucasus Liberation Movement," HUR said, without providing additional details.

The Kyiv Independent was unable to verify the claims.

Tambukan lies in southwestern Russia, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the Georgian border and about 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the front lines in Ukraine.

The North Caucasus is one of Russia's most volatile regions, with a long history of insurgency, radicalism, and ethnic tensions.

Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies.

According to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast Governor Serhii Lysak, 28 people were injured, including a 10-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl.  

The evacuation, carried out Sept. 29-30 in coordination with Ukraine's military intelligence, included 48 Ukrainian citizens, as well as nine Palestinian nationals.

Ukrenergo's supervisory board fired Zaichenko and three management board members on Sept. 26, just three months after appointing him — prompting questions about potential tensions between the government and the supervisory board or a possible move to seize control of the company.

"Sabotage operations are on the rise and we will not risk agents operating under diplomatic cover," Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky wrote on X. 



According to Russian budget documents, federal spending on police, the National Guard, and other law enforcement and intelligence services is set to rise 13% year-on-year to a record 3.91 trillion rubles ($47 billion).



The suspect, identified as Volodymyr Z., was apprehended in the town of Pruszkow in central-eastern Poland. He is wanted under a European arrest warrant issued by a German court in 2024.



Ukrainian specialists arrived in Denmark on Sept. 29 to join Danish forces in counter-drone exercises after recent airspace violations.

This was one of the reasons why the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian state airline Belavia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.

Orban made the comments even as he downplayed concerns over Russian drones violating the airspace of several European countries and criticized the "posture of Western Europeans."

"This allows Ukraine to scale up and to use its full capacity. And of course, it will also allow the EU to benefit from this technology," Ursula von der Leyen said.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos lauded Ukraine for completing the screening "at record speed" in "the most difficult circumstances."

            A necessity, a habit or an addiction, call it what you like: we're all on our phones. The research and data around smartphone addiction and its negative impact on sleep, mental performance and mental health is alarming. Studies have found even when we're not using them, if we're in the same room as our smartphone it's affecting our brains. Yet in less than a generation, they have become an indispensable part of our lives.
    


            Nevertheless, plenty of people are finding ways to disconnect. Some want a digital detox to boost performance and wellbeing; some are concerned parents; others cite data privacy fears, or are choosing to wall themselves off from the attention economy. At the extreme end, some youths are turning their backs on technology and proudly defining themselves as Luddites.
    


            Many are turning to “dumbphones” instead — a pre-smartphone, or a new model with limited functions, sometimes called a feature phone or brick phone. There is a bubbling, and highly invested community of users offering advice online about where to buy “deadstock” (old handsets no longer in production) and detailed specification comparisons of current models, for those with the inclination or the luxury to make the change.
    


            The feature phone market remains large according to Yang Wang, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, though it's gradually declining, as more people in developing countries upgrade to smartphones. Last year, around 15% of handsets sold globally were feature phones — nearly 210 million devices, with a value of $3.2 billion, he said. But only 1.7 million of that total were sold in North America, and only 12 million in Europe, largely in Central and Eastern Europe, Wang said.
    


‘Inconvenient,' ‘retrograde' and more popular than ever: The rise of instax cameras



            In these and other developed economies, niche manufacturers are creating premium alternatives, catering to a culture shift fuelled by online movements like Bring Back Blackberry, hashtag #BringBackFlipPhones and UK grassroots scheme Smartphone Free Childhood.



            As you might expect, some of these company founders have their own stories of disillusionment.
    


            Petter Neby founded Swiss company Punkt in 2008, inspired by his relationship with his Blackberry in the mid 2000s.
    


            “I was hooked,” he said. “It's Saturday, you just need to send a message to your wife that you're late and you're going to buy ice cream, and suddenly (you've written) three emails. It's problematic.”
    


            Punkt's initial solution was the MP01. Launched in 2015 with a tactile keypad and sturdy design , it was capable of calls and texts, with a calendar, alarm and some other basic functions. The MP01 set the tone for Punkt's “very strict and Lutheran” approach to product design, which Neby calls “digital minimalism.” But by giving users the ability to share a phone number with a paired smartphone, Punkt hinted the device was all about giving the user options, rather than forcing them to go cold turkey.
    


            Kaiwei Tang, cofounder of mobile phone company Light, said the firm sprang from a Google Creative Lab incubator in 2014. He and future business partner Joe Hollier were surrounded by entrepreneurs boasting about their apps' engagement time. “I asked myself,” said Tang, “What about me? What about my time?”
    


            “The problem is not the device, it's the business model: the attention economy,” he explained. “Every free app, every social media platform, every browser, is trying to maximize engagement so they can make money collecting data and categorizing people into different groups so they can sell it to advertisers.”
    


            The Light Phone was designed to shut out the attention economy. Tang and Hollier resolved to create a phone from the ground up; one that would not show users advertisements, that ensured every interaction had a clear ending, and that would never show you a feed to scroll through endlessly. When Tang pitched the phone to Foxconn, the Taiwanese manufacturer of iPhones and other smartphones, in 2015, an executive told him even his family might need one.
    


            The first models shipped in 2017. Today, The Light Phone is in its third generation, and features 5G connectivity, NFC chip and fingerprint ID. The company continues to build every tool (it prefers the term to apps) from scratch, from messaging to maps.
    


            “I want to make it boring,” Tang said of the user experience, which leans into a black and white, text-based display. (The same tactic is employed by Punkt's MP range — some research and a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggests switching to grayscale can reduce screen time.)
    


            The Light Phone is looking at adding more tools, like two-factor authentication and contactless payment, and is even exploring integrating an AI assistant.
    


            “We're not anti-technology,” Tang stressed. “We see ourselves as a lifestyle brand … We're promoting a lifestyle that's very different from a smartphone-centric lifestyle.”
    


            In the spring, Light launched The Light Phone III, and over 100,000 people are using its devices worldwide, said the cofounder, despite Light forgoing paid advertising and retailing for a premium price.
    


            Just because a phone is dumb, or has limited features, that doesn't mean it's cheap. Economies of scale mean smaller companies are paying a premium for materials, and working with fewer R&D resources than the likes of Apple or Samsung.
    


            Punkt's first dumbphone retailed for $229, raising eyebrows, and its fifth generation dumbphone, the MP02, sells for $299. Punkt sells around 50,000 units across its range annually, Neby said.
    


            The Light Phone III retails at $699. Tang is quick to defend the price: “$699 is not a huge investment (to) get hours of your time and attention back,” adding the repairable device has been designed to last 5-10 years.
    


            “You could obviously get a $5-10 flip phone from Alibaba or Amazon — if that works for you, I'm all for it,” he said. “(We're) not going back, we're moving forward.”
    


            Over in Finland, manufacturer HMD Global is asking the question: Can a company do both?
    


            HMD, which stands for Human Mobile Devices, took over the Nokia brand and began releasing feature phones in 2016, including revived classic models the Nokia 3210 and Nokia 2660 Flip.
    


            Between 2022 and 2023, its flip phone sales doubled, said head of product marketing Adam Ferguson, leaving HMD to wonder why. Research led the company to the #BringBackFlipPhones campaign on social media. “Last time I looked, something like 61 million people have used that hashtag. It's ridiculous,” he said.
    


            Alongside its feature phone output, like Light and Punkt, HMD has begun developing smarter devices that hint at a future middle ground in the mobile phone market.
    


            In August the HMD Fuse was released. A smartphone that starts life as a brick phone, it was designed for children, giving parents the power to unlock functions as their child gets older.
    


            It's the product of HMD's Better Phone Project, for which the company spoke to 37,000 children and parents about their relationship with their phones.
    


            “This huge thing has been bubbling underneath our industry for a number of years now,” said Ferguson. “People are incredibly discontent with the way devices are set up at the moment and they want change,” he added — particularly parents introducing their children to mobile phones for the first time.
    


            By default, every app on the Fuse is locked, including the camera. Caregivers can set the phone to only accept calls and messages from a set list of contacts. “Every family can tailor the experience to a child,” said Ferguson. “It forces those conversations, which is one of the big things that the research said was missing.”
    


            Its buzzy feature is the Fuse's integration of HarmBlock, which detects nudity on screen. An AI developed by SafeToNet in collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation, HarmBlock was trained on 22 million instances of inappropriate imagery, said Ferguson. Working in the background of the Fuse, the pixel recognition AI will shut down the camera if a user tries to take a sexual image, or blanks out nude content on a browser, or social or messaging apps.
    


            “We've been working with (HarmBlock) for over a year now to embed it deep into the device so that it can't be bypassed,” Ferguson explained.
    


            Punkt and Light say their typical buyer skews young — in their 20s and 30s — and in Punkt's case is male. By focusing on younger Gen Z and emerging Gen Alpha users, the Fuse wants to foster a healthier relationship with phones from the get-go.
    


            Devices like the Fuse, The Light Phone, and Punkt's first smartphone, the MC02 (which is marketed on its robust privacy and security features) point to a widening — or at least more conscientious — view of what consumers want from their phones.
    


            “Once you get to (market) maturity … then it starts to go into more niches,” said Neby, who foresees “more fragmentation” within the smartphone industry.
    


            Could the biggest smartphone manufacturers fill those niches and go “dumb” themselves? It's unlikely, said Wang, given how opposed it would be to their business model.
    


Reinvention and renewed energy: London Fashion Week enters a new era



            But there's always the chance the big guns could be swayed by rising consumer demand and start adopting new ideas. Ferguson believes in the case of the Fuse's child-safety functions, there's “money to be made” that could tempt manufacturers to introduce them. That could come at HMD's expense, but “if we can drive that kind of change, that is an absolute win,” he said.
    


            “It's not easy to be a dwarf in this field of giants,” said Neby. Though he argued there's a necessity for feature phone businesses like his to exist, and even thrive amid cultural change.
    


            “Punkt is not here to become the next Apple. Punkt is here to provide a choice,” he said.
    


            “We will always be a niche player. But we are trying to respond to the malaise of an industry. And since it's the most important consumer industry in the world, we have an obligation to act.”

            Japan's biggest beer maker Asahi Group says it has suspended orders and shipping services in the country after a cyberattack brought its production operations to a standstill.
    


            Production at some of its 30 domestic factories remained suspended on Tuesday as the company continued to investigate how many plants had been affected, Reuters reported, citing the group's spokesperson.
    


            The company, behind Asahi Super Dry Beer and Nikka Whisky and a raft of non-alcoholic beverages, said it cannot foresee when production will resume, according to the news agency.
    


            The attack first came to light on Monday, when Asahi released a statement saying its order and shipment operations at its Japan-based companies had been suspended, alongside its call center services, “due to the system failure.”
    


            The group has not elaborated on the possibly identity of the attacker but said the cyberattack had not led to leakage of customer data
    


            “We are actively investigating the cause and working to restore operations,” the company said in a statement Monday, adding that there was no estimated timeline for recovery. CNN has reached out to Asahi for comment.
    


            Asahi – which means “morning sun” in Japanese – was founded in 1889, with founder Komakichi Torii bottling the first Asahi Draft Beer in in Japan in 1900.
    


            It has grown to become one of the world's largest drinks companies and owns international brands including Peroni, London Pride and Grolsch and several non-alcoholic beverage brands.

Warsaw continues to fund the Starlink communications system in Ukraine, following the signing of the relevant legislation by Polish President Karol Nawrocki, Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on Sept. 29.

"During the war, this technology is of critical importance — to keep hospitals, schools, critical infrastructure, and front-line regions connected," Fedorov said on his Telegram channel.

There are currently over 50,000 Starlink terminals operating in Ukraine, with more than 29,000 supplied by Poland.

Last week, Nawrocki signed a bill extending the assistance to Ukraine amid the full-scale Russian invasion.

The historian-turned-politician, who took a tougher position toward Kyiv than his predecessor, first vetoed the bill in August, demanding stricter rules on benefits for Ukrainians and additional amendments about the border, history, and Ukrainian nationalism.

The Polish government warned at the time that the veto could effectively end Polish support for Starlink Internet in Ukraine as of Oct. 1, which is covered by the assistance bill.

Nawrocki later signed a revised version of the bill, in which the parliament agreed to limit benefits to employed Ukrainians only. 

As his proposals regarding historical issues were disregarded, the president introduced a bill on Sept. 29 that would make it a crime to disseminate "false claims" about the Volyn massacres, extend the period needed to obtain Polish citizenship, and introduce harsher penalties for illegal border crossings.

The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) members killed at least tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

The massacre remains one of the most contentious issues in present-day Polish-Ukrainian relations.

Ukrainian specialists arrived in Denmark on Sept. 29 to join Danish forces in counter-drone exercises after recent airspace violations.

This was one of the reasons why the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian state airline Belavia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.

"This allows Ukraine to scale up and to use its full capacity. And of course, it will also allow the EU to benefit from this technology," Ursula von der Leyen said.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos lauded Ukraine for completing the screening "at record speed" in "the most difficult circumstances."

A Russian National Guard lieutenant colonel and two other service members were killed in a Ukrainian intelligence operation in the North Caucasus on Sept. 27, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki introduced a bill on Sept. 29 criminalizing "false claims" about the Volyn massacre and historical crimes committed by certain Ukrainian groups during World War II. 

The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) members killed at least tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

The massacre remains one of the most contentious issues in present day Polish-Ukrainian relations. 

The bill Nawrocki proposed on Sept. 29 makes it a crime to disseminate "false claims" about the Volyn massacres and World War II-era Ukrainian nationalist groups. It also equates UPA symbols with Nazi and Communist symbols in Poland's criminal code, extends the period needed to obtain Polish citizenship, and calls for harsher penalties for illegal border crossings. 

Nawrocki first proposed these amendments a month ago after vetoing a bill extending support for Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Nawrocki stipulated that benefits should only go to employed Ukrainians and tacked on the additional amendments about the border, history, and Ukrainian nationalism. 

While parliament agreed to limit benefits to employed Ukrainians and passed a revised version of that bill, Nawrocki's other amendments were disregarded. 

Their omission from the previous legislation required Nawrocki to reintroduce these "solutions," the Polish Presidential Office said. 

A historian-turned-politician, Nawrocki has spoken out against Kyiv's EU and NATO aspirations, often drawing attention to past historical grievances. His narrow electoral victory in June 2025 heralded new challenges for Polish-Ukrainian relations. 

While Nawrocki has maintained support for Ukraine's fight against Russian aggression, equating Ukrainian nationalism with Nazism is a recurring narrative in Kremlin propaganda.

The suspect, identified as Volodymyr Z., was apprehended in the town of Pruszkow in central-eastern Poland. He is wanted under a European arrest warrant issued by a German court in 2024.



Ukrainian specialists arrived in Denmark on Sept. 29 to join Danish forces in counter-drone exercises after recent airspace violations.

This was one of the reasons why the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian state airline Belavia, U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.

Orban made the comments even as he downplayed concerns over Russian drones violating the airspace of several European countries and criticized the "posture of Western Europeans."

"This allows Ukraine to scale up and to use its full capacity. And of course, it will also allow the EU to benefit from this technology," Ursula von der Leyen said.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos lauded Ukraine for completing the screening "at record speed" in "the most difficult circumstances."

A Russian National Guard lieutenant colonel and two other service members were killed in a Ukrainian intelligence operation in the North Caucasus on Sept. 27, Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) said.

10:55 JST, September 30, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hardly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed his “Global Governance Initiative,” Beijing made its intent clear at the most global of forums — that it should, and is qualified to, help shape the world order even as the United States tips more inward under Donald Trump.

In a seemingly jargon-filled speech delivered to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the audience that “a China that bears in mind the greater good of humanity and stands ready to take up responsibilities will bring more positive energy into the world.” His words seized on the retreat by the American president from international organizations and on his apparent disdain towards the United Nations.

Li never once mentioned the United States by name. But in not-so-subtle swipes at recent actions by the United States, he touted his country's credentials: lowering tariffs to promote global economy, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and committing to safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.

It represents a shift in approach to global affairs that experts say reflects a China that sees itself on the ascent.

“Li's speech confirms that China's foreign policy posture today is firmly anchored in the ambition of turning a Western-dominant world order into one that is much more conducive to Chinese interests, values, and leadership,” said Olivia Cheung, lecturer in politics at King's College London. “China's foreign policy today is notably more confident, strategic, and coherent than how it was in 2017, where Beijing's presentation of global governance reform lacked content.”

The speech has come amid growing worries in Washington that China, the world's second-largest economy, might seek to unseat the United States as the global leader, even though Beijing has repeatedly assured Washington that it has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. Instead, Xi has said Beijing should enjoy a global say befitting of its economic might and global stature.

Li opened his speech by evoking the history of the United Nations and crediting it for the by-and-large peace and prosperity in the ensuing eight decades. Then, he lamented on the “chaos” the world is faced with today.

“The world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,” Li said, leveling his criticisms at “unilateralism and Cold War mentality” and repeated disruptions to the international system.

“How could we, when confronted with unscrupulous acts of hegemonism and bullying, remain silent and submissive for fear of might?” the Chinese premier asked. The terms “unilateralism,” “Cold War mentality,” “hegemonism” and “bullying” are usually associated with the U.S. in Beijing's diplomatic talks.

Then, the Chinese premier portrayed China as a desirable answer to such problems — a founding member of the United Nations that has in recent years shared “China's wisdom and solution for navigating global transformations and overcoming pressing challenges.”

The Global Governance Initiative, as proposed by Xi in early September, “points the right direction and provides an important pathway for building a more just and equitable global governance system,” Li said.

The reframing is, on some levels, fundamental.

In a podcast aired Sept. 26, Cheung told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that Beijing's strategic thinking has shifted under Xi — from maintaining good ties with the U.S. and other Western nations for China's economic growth to “reshaping the international system so that the rest of the world respect and accept China's interest in the way that Beijing defines it.”

She said Beijing has viewed the global governance system as “dominated by Western powers, especially the United States” and serving their interests in a way that is “often unfair or unrepresentative.”

What Beijing is most interested in, Cheung said, is “changing global governance in a way that puts the United Nations front and center” where China can have “a lot more involvement and influences and leverage in how it functions.”

Li's speech Friday conveys the impression that Xi's proposition of “forging the common destiny for humankind' is not only an aspiration but ”policy actions that are noble and urgent, with which China uniquely has strong technical competencies to lead,” Cheung told the Associated Press.

As the Trump administration imposes steep tariffs, threatens territorial annexations and goes after multilateral institutions, “China seeks to present itself as a key upholder of a postwar order in whose viability the United States seems to be losing confidence”, said Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy advisory for U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.

But China does not appear to have either the capacity or the desire to offer a wholesale alternative, Wyne said. Instead, he said, China appears interested in deepening its influences in certain areas and attempting to legitimize its longstanding contention that new norms are needed to reflect emerging geopolitical trends.

The gulf between Beijing's words and its actions is another question. Where the Chinese government is concerned, its action often fails to align with its word, said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

“Premier Li's remarks leaned heavily on multilateral language, but Beijing's track record tells a different story,” Singleton said. “China champions sovereignty at the U.N. while systematically eroding it in practice, from Hong Kong to the South China Sea.”

He added: “Li's calls for ‘cooperation' and ‘openness' sound constructive, but they're designed to blunt pressure on China's economy and technology sector.”

A day earlier, Li held a meeting with American businesspeople and scholars in New York. He assured the group that China would “continuously expand market access and increase imports” and provide foreign businesses with “the certainty they need to operate and develop in China,” according to a Chinese government statement.

The two countries are locked in a trade dispute, and Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of 21 economies, to be held at the end of October in South Korea, to help recalibrate bilateral relations.

The Chinese premier said the two countries “could and should” become partners and friends, and he repeated a line from Xi: “The Pacific Ocean is vast enough to accommodate both China and the United States, as well as other countries.”

Google's YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5-million to settle a lawsuit President Donald Trump brought after the video site suspended his account following the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the Capitol following the election that resulted in him leaving the White House for four years.

The settlement of the more than four-year-old case earmarks $22-million for Trump to contribute to the Trust for the National Mall and a construction of a White House ballroom, according to court documents filed Monday. The remaining $2.5-million will be paid to other parties involved in the case, including the writer Naomi Wolf and the American Conservative Union.

Alphabet, the parent of Google, is the third major technology company to settle a volley of lawsuits that Trump brought for what he alleged had unfairly muzzled him after his first term as president ended in January 2021. He filed similar cases against Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Twitter before it was bought by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022 and rebranded as X.

Meta agreed to pay $25-million to settle Trumps' lawsuit over his 2021 suspension from Facebook and X agreed to settle the lawsuit that Trump brought against Twitter for $10-million. When the lawsuits against Meta, Twitter and YouTube were filed, legal experts predicted Trump had little chance of prevailing.

Trump receives $16-million from Paramount in lawsuit settlement

After buying Twitter for $44.5-billion, Musk later became major contributor to Trump's successful 2024 campaign that resulted in his re-election and then spent several months leading a cost-cutting effort that purged thousands of workers from the federal government payroll before the two had a bitter falling out. Both Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg were among the tech leaders who lined up behind Trump during his second inauguration in January in a show of solidarity that was widely interpreted as a sign of the industry's intention to work more closely with the president than during his first administration.

ABC News, meanwhile, agreed to pay $15-million in December toward Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. And in July, Paramount decided to pay Trump $16-million to settle a lawsuit regarding editing at CBS's storied “60 Minutes” news program.

The settlement does not constitute an admission of liability, the filing says. Google confirmed the settlement but declined to comment beyond it.

Google declined to comment on the reasons for the settlement, but Trump's YouTube account has been restored since 2023. The settlement is will barely dent Alphabet, which has a market value of nearly $3-trillion – an increase of about $600-billion, or 25 per cent, since Trump's return to the White House.

The disclosure of the settlement came a week before a scheduled Oct. 6 court hearing to discuss the case with U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers in Oakland, California.

Congressional leaders failed to reach an agreement on a stopgap spending resolution that would avert a government shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with President Donald Trump on the afternoon of Sept. 29 but remained deadlocked as Democrats continued to demand significant additional spending on health care in exchange for their votes.

Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin rides along with immigration enforcement agents as they conduct raids in Chicago on ‘Special Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office conducted an unprecedented large-scale investigation in Minneapolis this month, focused on those who were committing marriage and asylum fraud.

Under a mission known as Operation Twin Shield, officers targeted 1,000 cases, knocking on doors at more than 900 sites to conduct interviews and review immigration criteria. Coordinating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the FBI, they found fraud, non-compliance, or public safety and national security concerns in 275 cases.

It's the first operation after a new rule finalized earlier this month allowed USCIS to expand its law enforcement duties.

In 44 of those cases, the immigrants were referred to ICE or given a notice to appear (NTA) in court. Two were detained on-site. The rest are still being investigated.

In one example, an immigrant engaged in a sham marriage with an elderly U.S. citizen and subjected the citizen to "elder abuse and exploitation," according to USCIS. Another immigrant admitted to fabricating a death certificate from Kenya for $100 to falsely claim the termination of a marriage — the spouse in question was alive, living in Minneapolis and the mother of five of his children.

Other cases included a petitioner who confessed to marriage fraud just hours after swearing under oath that her marriage was legitimate, and another involving an immigrant who had overstayed a visa waiver, was the son of a suspected terrorist, and had previously been denied benefits for fraud.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow described the operation as part of a broader shift in enforcement posture under President Donald Trump. "USCIS is declaring an all-out war on immigration fraud. We will relentlessly pursue everyone involved in undermining the integrity of our immigration system and laws. With help from ICE and the FBI, USCIS' Operation Twin Shield was a tremendous success — hundreds of bad actors will be held accountable," Edlow said.

The operation was conducted between Sept. 19 and 28 across the Minneapolis–St. Paul region. USCIS said it is the first time the agency has committed resources on this scale to a single geographic area and signaled more such crackdowns could follow.

Officials expect the number of NTAs, referrals to ICE and adverse adjudications to increase as investigations continue.

The agency pointed to Executive Order 14161, which directs federal agencies to protect the United States from foreign terrorists and other public safety threats, as the framework guiding the operation. Officials emphasized that unlike during the Biden administration, USCIS officers are now empowered to thoroughly vet applicants and aggressively pursue fraud wherever it is encountered.

The Minneapolis surge marks the first time USCIS has deployed resources at this scale in a single region, and leadership suggested it could become a model for future crackdowns in other parts of the country. With more administrative investigations still underway, the number of arrests and court referrals is expected to rise.

            President Donald Trump made some false claims in a lengthy remarks earlier today to hundreds of generals and admirals who were summoned to a military base in Virginia to listen to addresses by the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Some of Trump's false claims were about the military itself.
    


Here is a fact check of some of the president's remarks, many of which have been debunked before:
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had an impromptu, terse exchange on the Senate floor Tuesday as tensions rise ahead of a possible government shutdown.
    


            After Thune noted Democrats supported stopgap government funding bills during the Biden administration, Schumer argued Republican leaders didn't negotiate with them before voting on the bill.
    


                    “It's not working because the leaders wouldn't discuss it with us, as we discussed with Republicans on every single one of these what should be in the bill,” Schumer said.
                





            Before beginning his remarks, Schumer took the unusual step of bringing to his lectern a poster board Thune had used to show the percentage of Democratic senators who supported the Biden-era CRs, or continuing resolutions.
    


                    Thune shot back: “This is a short-term CR. This is what we do all the time around here as witnessed by the chart that you're just using there, 24 pages long, funds the government until November the 21st at which time you have the same leverage then that you have right now, and we have until the end of the year to fix the ACA credit issue.”
                





            Schumer continued to argue against the House-passed GOP stopgap.
    


                    “The leader says it's a clean bill. It's a partisan bill. Not once were Democrats asked for what input should be in the bill. We were not told about it. We're not asked about it, et cetera. Nor did Speaker Johnson talk to Hakeem Jeffries. You cannot pass legislation in the Senate when it comes to appropriations unless it is bipartisan. So the leader will say it's clean. No, it's not clean because there was no discussion,” Schumer said.
                





            President Donald Trump warned Tuesday that his administration can impose significant cuts on the federal workforce and “irreversible” changes if there is a shutdown, dangling the threat of job loss for government employees and other, permanent impacts that might distress Democrats with just hours before a key funding deadline.
    


            “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Democrats.
    


            The president pointed to Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, who has been the architect of sweeping changes to the federal workforce during Trump's second term, describing the budget chief as “very popular.”
    


            “He's become very popular recently, because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn't do any other way,” Trump said.
    


            In a memo last week, Vought directed federal agencies to prepare plans for mass firings should the government shut down – an effort to ramp up pressure on Democrats but also enact plans he been advocating for for months.
    


            Democrats, Trump said Tuesday, are “taking a risk by having a shutdown. Because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits. We can get large numbers of people – we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse. And, you know, we're cutting that.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday called a government shutdown “probably likely,” casting blame for the looming funding lapse on Democrats who he blamed for refusing to back off their demands.
    


            “Nothing is inevitable, but I would say it's probably likely,” Trump said from the Oval Office, adding “I didn't see them bend even a little bit.”
    


            The pessimistic outlook came after a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders ended at an impasse yesterday over Democrats' demands for health care concessions.
    


            Hours later, Trump shared a racist, AI-generated video on social media mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, further deepening divisions between the two sides with just hours to go until the October 1 deadline.
    


            On Tuesday, Trump took aim at Democrats again, accusing them again without evidence of seeking to “give health care to illegal immigrants.”
    


            The Donald J. Trump Presidential Library will be at Miami Dade College, the president's foundation announced in a press release Tuesday.
    


                    “No monument can fully capture the scale of my father's legacy, but this library will stand as a tribute to the leader who reshaped history and restored America's strength,” Eric Trump, the president's son and head of the library foundation, said in a statement.
                





            “Once completed, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library will be visible for miles into the Atlantic, a bold landmark on Miami's skyline and a lasting tribute to the achievements my father continues to deliver for this nation,” he added.
    


            Per the foundation, the site chosen is 2.63 acres and will be adjacent to the Miami Freedom Tower, which served as a processing center for Cubans fleeing communism in the 1960s.
    


            The land was “deeded to the Foundation by the State of Florida through a Cabinet vote,” the foundation said.
    


            The president chose the location after Eric Trump and his team evaluated multiple sites across the state, the foundation said.
    


            The president, a native New Yorker, legally declared himself a Florida resident in 2019. He changed his permanent residence that year to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, in forms filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
    


            President Donald Trump on Tuesday acknowledged that he floated negotiating a health care deal with Democratic congressional leaders during a meeting at the White House a day earlier over a possible government shutdown.
    


            “We're going to see what happens,” Trump said from the Oval Office. “I asked the Democrat representatives, ‘What do you think about coming up with a better health care?'”
    


            The president connected the potential for a broader health care deal with an initiative he announced Tuesday designed to lower drug prices, contending that it could ultimately have a significant impact on Americans' health costs.
    


            Democrats are pushing for a health care compromise extending certain enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of a deal to avert a government shutdown.
    


            Congressional Republican leaders have so far rejected that demand, insisting that Democrats will take the blame for a shutdown due to begin at midnight. But Trump on Tuesday signaled openness to striking some kind of agreement in the future, criticizing the Affordable Care Act, which is often referred to as Obamacare, as “not good” and speculating that the two sides “might be able to do something” aimed at slashing health care costs.
    


            The mayor of Chicago says ramped-up immigration operations in the city — as well as reported plans to send the National Guard — are frightening people rather than helping them.
    


                    “This is not about safety. This is not about immigration. This is about fomenting chaos and terrorizing the people of Chicago and cities across America,” Mayor Brandon Johnson told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on “The Situation Room.”
                





            During a speech to generals in Quantico, Virginia, earlier in the day, President Donald Trump suggested using some of “these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” which the mayor called “absolutely appalling.”
    


            “These brave women and men who sign up to serve and protect this country, they do not do it with being deployed against American citizens and residents in mind,” Johnson said.
    


            Dozens of Democratic lawmakers just attempted to pressure the House to consider their short-term legislation that would fund the government, as well as address President Donald Trump's rescissions and health care cuts.
    


            House Democrats' top appropriator, Rosa DeLauro, tried to be recognized during the pro forma session and make a motion to have the House pass the Democratic CR, or continuing resolution, by unanimous consent.
    


            But Rep. Morgan Griffith of Virginia, who was presiding over the House, gaveled out as she was trying to do so. Democrats objected with shouts of “Shame on you!”
    


            House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries joined members in the House chamber for the pro forma session.
    


            As Jeffries' members gathered to try to force a vote on their version of a government funding plan, some held signs reading “missing person” with a picture of House Speaker Mike Johnson's face.
    


            While the Democratic side of the House floor was relatively full, the Republican side was nearly empty.
    


            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries slammed the AI-generated video President Donald Trump posted last night mocking him as racist and criticized House Republicans for being away from Washington.
    


                    “Mr. President, the next time you have something to say about me, don't cop out through a racist and fake AI video. When I'm back in the Oval Office, say it to my face. Say it to my face.”
                


                    House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, speaking on Capitol Hill
                


            Trump on Monday shared a video depicting Jeffries wearing a sombrero and a mustache, shortly after he met with the House Democratic leader and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer at the White House to discuss government funding.
    


            Jeffries on Tuesday criticized House Republicans for being out of town hours away from the government funding deadline, telling them: “Do your job.”
    


            “Shame on them for being on vacation all across the country and across the world on the eve of a government shutdown. We're on duty. They're on vacation. They're on vacation because they'd rather shut the government down than protect the health care of the American people. That's unfathomable, that's unacceptable, that's unconscionable, and that's un-American,” Jeffries said, alongside several Democratic members.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN earlier that he hasn't brought his chamber back because “the House has done its work.”
    


            “If Chuck Schumer does his work, everything, the machinery of government can continue. But we did our work, so there's no real reason for anybody to be here this week,” he said, noting the House was scheduled to be out this week for the Jewish holidays.
    


            Republican and Democratic senators are assigning blame to the leaders of each other's party as Congress inches closer to a government shutdown.
    


            Here's what they're saying:
    


Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal said “this kind of shutdown is a self-inflicted, totally unnecessary, avoidable wound that Donald Trump - not necessarily my Republican colleagues - but Donald Trump is bringing on the American people.” He added  that “we can still avoid it - even in these last hours. The path to compromise is there.”
    


Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for tying an extension of expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies to government funding. “You want to have a debate on health care, we can have a debate on health care. You don't hold the government hostage over that. That's exactly what they're doing,” he said.
    


Republican Sen. John Kennedy said anticipates OMB Director Russ Vought will use a government shutdown to advance his goals, saying: “My guess is that, knowing Russ Vought as I do, that he is going to take advantage of this to do a lot of the things that he would like to do otherwise.”
    


            Asked by CNN if Republicans could bear the blame if the Trump administration moves forward with mass federal layoffs, Kennedy said he believes Americans will determine Democrats' demands are unreasonable, but both parties could be blamed in the end.
    


            “One school of thought is that it's all of our fault. I mean, I keep getting emails from, from Thune saying, ‘We got this.' The truth is, none of us have this, and we all need therapy,” he said. “That's the truth. That's what the American people conclude.”
    


            Immigration enforcement operations, including in cities like Chicago — where agents have bolstered their presence — will largely continue in the event of a government shutdown, according to two Homeland Security officials.
    


            Most personnel from US Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, both of which fall under the Department of Homeland Security, are considered exempt from furlough, meaning that their activities continue.
    


            The Trump administration has surged resources to Chicago and is soon expected to move additional resources to Memphis.
    


            CNN previously reported if the government shuts down, it's likely that immigration, border security and defense activities funded through the GOP's tax and spending package, which Trump signed into law in July, would continue.
    


            “Thankfully, H.R. 1 provided ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted,” the Office of Management and Budget wrote in its memo to agencies about preparing mass layoff plans, referring to the president's domestic agenda package.
    


            Voters see plenty of blame to go around in the event of a government shutdown, while views of Donald Trump's presidency remain solidly negative, according to a New York Times/Siena College survey released today.
    


            Asked whom they would blame in the event of a federal shutdown,
    


            That hypothetical question offers a snapshot of where opinions stand right now, but doesn't necessarily predict what they might look like if a shutdown actually takes place, particularly as voters tune in more closely.
    


            Currently, the poll finds Democratic support for a fight narrowly outweighing opposition, with 47% of Democratic registered voters saying that Democrats should shut down the government if their demands aren't met, and 43% that they should not.
    


Trump's overall approval rating stands at 43% among registered voters, little changed since spring, the poll finds. His approval rating is underwater on his handling of immigration, the economy, managing the federal government, trade with other countries and both the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestinian conflicts, while he breaks roughly even for his handling of crime.
    


            And voters are about split on whether they think he has done a good job of keeping his campaign promises, with 47% saying that he has and 49% that he hasn't.
    


            The New York Times/Siena poll surveyed 1,313 registered voters selected from a voter file and reached through phone calls or text messages. Interviews were conducted by live telephone interviewers or online. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of +/-3.2 percentage points.
    


            The FBI and Border Patrol conducted a “targeted immigration enforcement operation” early this morning in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago.
    


            “The FBI, alongside other Department of Justice law enforcement partners, has been supporting these efforts at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to a spokesperson for the FBI field office in Chicago.
    


            Video from the scene showed camouflaged agents — many with weapons drawn — surrounding an apartment building on 75th Street, just across the street from an elementary school and a block from Lake Michigan. Two armored vehicles and rental moving trucks were seen as part of the operation.
    


            The FBI did not provide details on the purpose of the operation or how many people were detained. CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more details.

            Trump said during his speech to admirals and generals on Tuesday that his administration is debating making the military “larger.”
    


            “We're thinking about making it larger because we have so many people, and it's nice to be able to cut people because of merit that aren't really qualified for any reason, a physical reason, a mental reason, you don't have to take them anymore, because you have, you have the pick of the litter, and they all want to be with you,” Trump said. “They all want your job. They want to be with you. They want to work with you. They'll even take your job.”
    


            Trump also said he wasn't satisfied with previous people who held high-ranking positions in the military.
    


            “And, we got many of them out of here too. I'll be honest with you, didn't like doing it, but we got many of you out of here because we weren't satisfied we have we know everything about everybody,” Trump said.
    


            He noted the military had previously struggled with recruiting, but he said that his election made a “difference.”
    


            “I can say that, as opposed to a couple of years ago, when I was talking to rooms where they were desperate to get people and they couldn't get them, what a difference a presidential election can make,” Trump said.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to suggest in his remarks today that the Department of Defense should use “dangerous cities as training grounds” for the military and National Guard.
    


            “I told Pete [Hegseth], we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military, because we're going into Chicago very soon, that's a big city with an incompetent governor,” the president said during his remarks to a gathering of top generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia.
    


            The president then proceeded to tell a story about watching media coverage of troops being spit on, saying in part the new policy should be “they spit, we hit.”
    


                    “People are standing, their mouth is this far away from their mouth, and they're spitting at them and they're screaming at them. And that soldier standing there, he wants to knock the hell out of the person, but he's not allowed to do anything,” Trump said.
                





            “I say they spit, we hit. Is that okay? I think so, they spit it's a new thing. They spit, we hit,” he added.
    


            Relatedly, Trump then told the generals that if military or police vehicles are hit with bricks or other objects, that officers should “do whatever the hell” they want.
    


            “You get out of that car, and you can do whatever the hell you want to do, because those people are, you now can die from that,” he said.
    


            Sen. Gary Peters, one of 10 senators in the Democratic caucus who voted for a stopgap bill to keep government open in March, would not say this morning how he plans to vote this time.
    


            “You'll see what I'll do in a little bit,” he told CNN.
    


            Government funding will lapse at midnight if Republicans don't reach a deal with Democrats to supply the needed votes to pass a stopgap measure.
    


            Sen. Maggie Hassan, who also joined Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in declining to block the GOP-led funding plan in March, wouldn't answer when asked whether she would vote for the House-passed bill later in the day.
    


            So far, Sen. John Fetterman is the only Democrat in the chamber who has publicly said he would vote for the seven-week bill.
    


            At least seven Democratic votes are needed to advance the bill and avert a shutdown. Democratic leaders say they want changes to health care policy before voting for the bill.

            President Donald Trump, more than 40 minutes into his speech to military brass, has meandered through several topics, speaking only sporadically from his prepared remarks. It resembles most other speeches he delivers, even given the unusual setting and audience of the country's top military leaders.
    


            He's touched on his decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — and the ensuing fallout with the Associated Press; his frustrated efforts to end the wars in Gaza and Ukraine; his bid for the Nobel Peace Prize; his love for the word “tariff”; his assessment of former President Joe Biden as the “autopen;” his love of the 1950s television show “Victory at War”; and the aesthetic shortcomings of the Navy's ships.
    


            At one point, he recalled the moment last month when he ordered two nuclear submarines to be strategically positioned near Russia in response to what he said were aggressive remarks by Dmitry Medvedev, the country's former president and current deputy chairman of its Security Council.
    


            “It was really a stupid person … mentioned the word nuclear,” he said, concluding later: “I call it the N-word. There are 2 N-words, and you can't use either of them.”
    


            At another point, Trump declared some warships produced by the military “ugly.”
    


            “I'm a very aesthetic person. I don't like some of the ships you're doing aesthetically,” he pronounced.

            The Department of Housing and Urban Development posted a new message on its website as of this morning, blaming the “Radical Left” ahead of the looming midnight deadline for a government shutdown.
    


            “The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands. The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people,” a pop-up banner reads on the department's website.
    


            A CNN search of other Cabinet-level departments shows that HUD is the only department with this type of message on its website.
    


            When asked for comment, a HUD spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that “The Far Left is barreling our country toward a shut down, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.”
    


            The federal government will shut down at midnight unless Congress reaches a deal on funding. Republicans need at least seven Democrats in the Senate to join them to pass a spending package under the chamber's rules.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told senior military officers to “do the honorable thing and resign” if they did not agree with his views on diversity in the military, the military's past Covid-19 vaccine mandate, or criticisms of transgender individuals.
    


            He tallied off things he said generals and admirals were previously told about those topics, saying, “They followed civilian policies set by foolish and reckless political leaders.”
    


                    “Our job, my job, has been to determine which leaders simply did what they must to answer the prerogatives of civilian leadership, and which leaders are truly invested in the ‘woke' department and therefore incapable of embracing the War Department and executive new lawful orders,” Hegseth said.
                





            “The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies,” he added. “But if the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign.”
    


            Hegseth took the opportunity to criticize retired general officers who have also come under attack by President Donald Trump, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley and former commander of US Central Command Gen. Frank McKenzie.
    


            “The new compass heading is clear: Out with the Chiarellis, the McKenzies, and the Milleys, and in with the Stockdales, the Schwarzkopfs, and the Pattons. More leadership changes will be made, of that I'm certain, not because we want to, but because we must.”
    


            President Donald Trump seemed to preempt what he expected to be a muted audience reaction as he began his remarks to generals and admirals in Quantico,
    


            “I've never walked into a room so silent,” Trump said to laughs.
    


            Military brass, by tradition, put forward a nonpartisan posture. They listened mostly silently earlier to Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth.
    


            Trump suggested he'd been forewarned about a quiet crowd.
    


            “I was told that, ‘Sir, you won't hear a murmur in the room,'” he said. “I said we had to loosen these guys up a little bit.”
    


            He joked that anyone who didn't appreciate his message could leave — and quit.
    


            “If you don't like what I'm saying, you can leave the room. Because there goes your rank, there goes your future,” Trump said to laughs.

President Biden answers a reporter's question about the accuracy of the death toll numbers released by the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza. 

EXCLUSIVE: Unearthed note cards from the Biden era show the administration detailed the names and photos of high-profile Democrats, such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as lesser-known individuals for then-President Joe Biden to ostensibly reference during live events, documents obtained by Fox News Digital show. 

Five different "palm cards," which are hand-sized note cards frequently used by politicians for quick reminders or talking points during public events, especially while on the campaign trail, were uncovered amid an investigation of National Archive documents related to the Biden administration's use of an autopen, and obtained by Fox News Digital.  

Four of the five cards obtained by Fox Digital are stamped with a disclaimer reading, "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN," while a fifth card detailing an ABC News reporter's question to Biden during a press conference did not include that stamp. 

It is unclear if Biden relied on each of the cards during the various public events. Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for any comment and clarification on the use of the cards but did not immediately receive a reply.

Clinton was among a handful of Americans who received a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the U.S., in the waning days of the Biden administration. One of the palm cards obtained by Fox Digital reads "Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients" and was followed by photos and short biographies of the recipients, including a photo of Clinton and a short note detailing she "was the Secretary of State in the Obama-Biden administration."

The note card also included a photo of Hollywood actor Denzel Washington, who also received the prestigious award in January, and a note describing him as an actor, director and producer whom the New York Times called "one of the greatest actors of the 21st century." The note also had photos and short bios for lesser known individuals who received the award, including renowned chef José Andrés and businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein.

Another palm card simply reading, "Judicial Confirmations Milestone Speech," showed a photo of Schumer and a separate photo of Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin accompanied by the roles in the Senate, their party and the states they represent. The card included a stamp reading, "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."

Biden celebrated his administration confirming 235 judicial nominees in January in a speech from the State Dining Room and was joined by Schumer and Durbin during the event. Durbin and Schumer also held other public events celebrating the Biden administration's judicial confirmation strides earlier in Biden's Oval Office tenure. 

WHITE HOUSE INVESTIGATING BIDEN USE OF AUTOPEN IN SPRAWLING PROBE OF ‘INCOMPETENT AND SENILE' FORMER PRESIDENT

Another palm card listed out various family members of Hollywood legend Francis Ford Coppola ahead of the 47th Kennedy Center Honors in December 2024 that honored "The Godfather" director. 

A fourth palm card was timestamped "Saturday, January 18 Greets," and showed a photo and short bio of White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin, as well as another section reading, "Pritzker Family," which displayed a photo of Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, and photos and explainers on Pritzker's wife, son and daughter, Fox News Digital found. A photo of the palm card also read "PRESIDENT HAS SEEN."

It is unclear if Pritzker visited the White House Jan. 18, which fell on a Saturday. 

The fifth card detailed a question from ABC News' reporter Mary Bruce. A handwritten note on the card states "Question #3."

"2024: How do YOU view the path forward? How do YOU think about YOUR place in history?" the card reads. 

"Speaker McCarthy/Debt Limit: Depending on what happens with the House vote on the Speaker's debt limit bill tomorrow, do do YOU anticipate moving forwards?"

BIDEN CAUGHT WITH CRIB NOTES DETAILING REPORTER'S QUESTION PRIOR TO CALLING ON HER DURING PRESS CONFERENCE

A Fox News Digital review found that the ABC News journalist asked Biden about his re-election effort during a joint press conference with the South Korean president April 26, 2023, in the Rose Garden. Bruce was the third reporter to ask Biden a question during the press conference, which fell on the same day House Republicans approved a bill to increase the debt ceiling. 

"My turn to ask a question?  I think the next question is Mary Bruce, ABC," Biden said during the press conference. 

Bruce asked, "You recently launched your reelection campaign. You've said questions about your age are ‘legitimate.' And your response is always, ‘Just watch me.' But the country is watching, and recent polling shows that 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, believe you shouldn't run again. What do you say to them? What do you say to those Americans who are watching and aren't convinced?"

"You've said you can beat Trump again.  Do you think you're the only one?" she added. 

BIDEN SPOTTED HOLDING A NOTE CARD WITH REPORTERS' PHOTOS AND NAMES TO CALL ON AT JOINT PRESSER

Biden's use of palm cards has long been documented, including during the April 2023 press conference with Bruce. Fox News Digital previously reported that Biden flashed a separate card showing the photo, name and name pronunciation of Los Angeles Times journalist Courtney Subramanian, while noting the card was part of "Question #1."

Subramanian asked the first question during the press conference, with Biden calling on "Courtney of the Los Angeles Times."

Biden flashed another palm card showing photos of reporters, accompanied by their outlets and roles, during a joint press conference with the Australian prime minister in October 2023. At his first formal press conference as president in March 2021, Biden was seen handling a card that had statistics and talking points to use.

In another image, Biden was consulting a list of preselected reporters along with their photos, Fox Digital previously reported. 

Politicians long have used palm cards while on the campaign trail. Biden's use of the cards while serving as president added fuel to the fire of concern over his mental acuity, though, including Axios reporting in 2024 that donors were spooked by Biden's reliance on the notes. 

The White House pointed to President Donald Trump's public events where he routinely takes questions from journalists off the cuff when asked about Trump's potential use of palm cards. 

"President Trump gives unfettered access to the media and answers every question imaginable, without pre-screening the press questions or collecting reporters' palm cards ahead of time like his incompetent predecessor," White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital Tuesday when approached for comment. "Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump is actually running our country, and he doesn't ever shy away from taking on the fake news to deliver the truth."

The Biden administration is currently facing scrutiny over the use of an autopen to sign official documents — including for clemency orders, executive orders and other official documents. The use of the autopen follows years of mounting concern that Biden's mental acuity and health were deteriorating, which hit a fever pitch during the 2024 campaign cycle following the president's disastrous debate performance against Trump. 

Biden ultimately dropped out of the presidential race as the concerns mounted. 

Since reclaiming the Oval Office, Trump has balked at his predecessor's use of the autopen, claiming Biden's staff allegedly used the pen to sign off on presidential actions unbeknownst to Biden. Trump ordered an investigation into the use of the autopen under the Biden administration back in June.

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports the latest on the investigation into the suspect Nigel Max Edge. 

One of the three victims killed in Saturday night's mass shooting at a popular North Carolina waterfront restaurant has been identified as Joy Rogers, a newly retired mother of three who had recently moved to Southport after raising her family in California.

Her husband, Lennie Rogers, confirmed to WECT News that Joy was among those killed at the American Fish Company.

"Joy was a devoted wife to her husband and a loving mother of three," her husband, Lennie Rogers, said in a statement to WECT News. "Born and raised in California, she and her family moved to Southport just a year ago to enjoy their retirement. In that short time, she touched countless lives in her community."

"Joy loved Jesus deeply, and because of that, she loved others deeply. She lived up to her name—her spirit radiated joy, light, and kindness everywhere she went. Joy had a special gift for making people feel seen and welcomed. She was truly a vibrant part of the community and her family, and she will be dearly missed."

Her church community is also mourning her loss. Living Word Bible Church in Winnabow, North Carolina released a statement calling Rogers "a beloved part of our church family—bold in her faith, compassionate toward others, and a constant encouragement. We will miss her deeply, yet we take comfort in knowing she is now in the presence of her Lord and Savior."

The church asked the public to keep the Rogers family in their prayers.

Authorities have called the ambush at the popular waterfront restaurant "highly premeditated." Joy was one of the three victims in the waterfront attack on Sunday night.

The shooting happened around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 27, at American Fish Company in Southport, a maritime town in the southeastern part of the state. The popular spot is known locally not only as a waterfront bar and restaurant, but also as a filming location for "Safe Haven," the 2013 romantic thriller based on the Nicholas Sparks novel.

Investigators allege that 40-year-old Nigel Max Edge positioned himself in a white, center-console boat just off the restaurant's deck before opening fire. At the time, live music was playing, and patrons were gathered along the bar's waterfront area.

Authorities said chaos broke out as bullets struck people on the deck as patrons scrambled to safety. Edge, police said, sped away. Edge, an Oak Island resident and military veteran, has not yet entered a plea. He appeared for his first court hearing Monday afternoon, logging in by video at 2 p.m. from the neighboring sheriff's office jail.

A judge denied bond, citing him as both a flight risk and a danger to the community. Edge is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 13 for a probable cause hearing. He requested a public defender.

Prosecutors said in court that Edge used a .300 Blackout Sig Sauer rifle outfitted with a suppressor and scope, and also had a .380 handgun tucked in his waistband when he was arrested. Some of the rifle ammunition was tipped for maximum ballistic impact, authorities noted.

Two deputies responded on a sheriff's department boat after the shooting, later spotting Edge as he walked to retrieve his boat trailer. Deputies moved in and apprehended him as he backed the trailer in to pull his vessel from the water.

Scientists warn that “flying rivers” — invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon — are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance. That's because the trees that are being lost are crucial to essentially passing the moisture westward. A new analysis finds southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable to increasing droughts. The disruption could destabilize forests, farming and hydropower, with ripple effects across South America and beyond. Experts say halting deforestation and restoring forests are key to preserving these vital systems. (Produced by Rosa Ramirez and Steven Grattan)

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible “flying rivers” carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.

New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna — grassland with far fewer trees.

“These are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,” said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation's Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis. 

“If you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.”

Most of the Amazon's rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.




Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the “flying rivers” term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.

That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.

The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes — precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru's Manu National Park.

“Peru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,” Finer said. “But if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.”

Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.

Corine Vriesendorp, director of science at Conservacion Amazonica, based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.

“The last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,” Vriesendorp said. “Ecological calendars that Indigenous communities use — when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce — are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.”

Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up. 

MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong. 

But in the dry season — when forests are already stressed by heat — the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.

“It's during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,” Finer said. 

Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil — a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon — could create an entirely new deforestation front.

For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture. 

“It's not a single, all-at-once collapse,” he said. “Certain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we're already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.”

Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water. 

“The dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,” he said. “If deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there's no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.”

Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.

“To avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires — immediately,” Nobre said. “And we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.”

Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers — safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.

For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, “this can't be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.”

Federal agents target suspected Tren de Aragua gang members in Chicago, Illinois, immigration enforcement operation.

Hundreds of federal agents carried out a "targeted immigration enforcement operation" early Tuesday in Chicago, Illinois, against suspected Tren de Aragua gang members. 

The FBI confirmed the operation to FOX32 Chicago, noting that its agents assisted the U.S. Border Patrol in the city's South Shore neighborhood. The operation — which involved almost 300 agents — targeted six people associated with the Venezuelan gang, according to Fox News senior correspondent Mike Tobin. 

The development comes a day after Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is "seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois." 

The FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the DHS did not immediately respond Tuesday to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

Footage captured overnight showed agents converging on an apartment building in the area. At one point, a helicopter dropped snipers down onto the building's roof.

Two dozen people were taken into custody.

"You hear people screaming, you hear loud bangs and pops," a witness told FOX 32 Chicago. 

No Chicago police officers took part in the operation, the station added.

"Over the weekend, we received numerous confirmed reports of federal agents from ICE and Customs and Border Patrol abusing their power, intimidating innocent civilians and waging war on our people," Pritzker told reporters on Monday. "All of this has been aimed at causing chaos and mayhem in the hopes of creating a pretext to deploy military troops against Chicago and Broadview and other suburbs just as the president is doing right now in Oregon." 

"Moments ago, the Illinois National Guard received word that the Department of Homeland Security has sent a memo to the Department of War seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois, claiming a need for the protection of ICE personnel and facilities," Pritzker added. 

"What I have been warning of is now being realized. One thing is clear — none of what Trump is doing is making Illinois safer," he also said.

ICE launched Operation Midway Blitz earlier this month, describing the operation as one that, "will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets."

            President Donald Trump made numerous false claims in a rambling Tuesday speech to hundreds of generals and admirals who were summoned to a military base in Virginia to listen to addresses by the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Some of Trump's false claims were about the military itself.
    


            Here is a fact check of some of the president's remarks, many of which have been debunked before. This article will be updated with additional items.
    


            Trump noted that he brags that “we have the strongest military anywhere in the world,” then falsely added, “You never heard Biden say that. You never heard him say anything, but you never heard him say – did we ever hear him say, ‘We have the strongest military.' He doesn't say that.” In fact, Biden repeatedly said the US has the world's strongest military.
    


            To cite just one example, Biden said in a 2023 speech about democracy: “Our US military – and this is not hyperbole; I've said it for the last two years – is the strongest military in the history of the world. Not just the strongest in the world – in the history of the world.”
    


            Biden sometimes made the same point using slightly different language. In the last week of his presidency, in January 2025, he told a Defense Department audience, “You are simply the greatest fighting force in the history of the world – in the history of the world. That's a fact. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact.”
    


            Trump falsely claimed that Biden said he thought he could get rid of Space Force, the military branch created during Trump's first term, before backing down.
    


            “When Biden came into office, he wanted to terminate it – he said, ‘And this thing called Space Force, so we can get rid of that.' And he got hammered by the people in this room for even suggesting it,” Trump said. But Biden never said anything like that.
    


            In the first month of Biden's presidency, in 2021, there was a controversy over a snarky response by his White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, to a question about whether Biden had made any decisions about keeping Space Force. But even Psaki did not come close to saying “we can get rid of that,” and she said the next day that Space Force has “the full support of the Biden administration” and “we are not revisiting the decision to establish the Space Force.”
    


            Trump touted the fact that he got members of the NATO military alliance to pledge to spend 5% of their gross domestic product on defense (by 2035), then falsely said, “It used to be 1%, then we got it up to 2(%) in my last term, and they did not like it.” Trump was not responsible for getting NATO to set its previous 2% target; the 2% figure was agreed upon by NATO defense ministers in 2006 and then reaffirmed in NATO documents in 2014, the year before Trump even launched his presidential campaign. (And if Trump meant that he was the one who got the members to meet their commitment, that's not true, either; in 2020, the last year of Trump's first term, only nine members were meeting the 2% target.)
    


            Trump repeated his usual false claim that Biden “gave $350 billion” in aid to Ukraine. That figure isn't close to accurate. A German think tank that has closely tracked wartime aid to Ukraine says the US allocated about $135 billion to Ukraine (and had committed about $5 billion more) through June, at current exchange rates.
    


            The US government inspector general overseeing the federal Ukraine response says the US had disbursed about $94 billion as of the end of June 2025 (and had appropriated about $93 billion more), including money that was spent in the US and in broader Europe rather than Ukraine itself.
    


            Trump repeated his false claim that he has “settled seven” wars. He cited a war between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as one example, saying, “I got that one done,” and mentioned “Kosovo and Serbia” as another.
    


            But those examples actually show that Trump has not settled seven wars.
    


            For one, Trump hasn't ended the conflict involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration and signed by the DRC and Rwanda in June did not involve the rebel coalition, allegedly backed by Rwanda, that has seized territory in the eastern DRC, and CNN reported from the ground last week: “The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump's claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.”
    


            And while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren't in an actual war either during Trump's current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump's administration in 2020, so he couldn't possibly have settled one.
    


            Similarly, another dispute on his list of seven wars he supposedly settled, between Egypt and Ethiopia, was not actually a war, either, during Trump's time in the White House. They have a long-running and unresolved dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but this is not a war.
    


            Trump repeated his frequent false claim that, under Biden, “the Congo” and Venezuela opened their prisons to somehow get prisoners to travel to the US as migrants.
    


            “They opened up prisons in the Congo. They came into our country, totally unmatched, unvetted, unchecked, and from all over,” Trump said, adding moments later, “Venezuela emptied its prison population into our country.” He said a bit later, of unspecified countries, “They would take their worst people, and they're people from prisons, in jail, and they put them in a caravan, and they'd walk up.”
    


            Trump has never provided any proof for these claims, which his own presidential campaign and White House have been unable to corroborate.
    


            Experts on both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the neighboring Republic of Congo told CNN during the Biden administration there is no evidence for Trump's claims that “the Congo” deliberately emptied prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants, and the government of each of these countries told CNN that the claims are baseless. Experts on Venezuela and on international prisons agree.
    


            “We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN last year after Trump made similar claims.
    


            “I do a daily news search to see what's going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in an email to CNN last year.
    


            Trump repeated his false claim that “25 million” migrants entered the country under Biden. The “25 million” figure is fictional; even Trump's previous “21 million” figure was a wild exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country. Even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there's no way the total was even close to what Trump has said.
    


            Trump repeated his usual lie that the 2020 election was “rigged,” claiming that Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine “if the election weren't rigged.” Leaving aside the hypothetical about Russia, Trump lost the 2020 election fair and square to Biden.
    


            Trump repeated his usual phony figure about US drug deaths, saying, “We lost 300,000 people (who) died last year.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported earlier this month that there were 80,856 reported overdose deaths in the US in the 12 months ending December 2024 (and that, since the data is incomplete, the predicted total was 81,711). Experts say that even though drug deaths may be undercounted, there is no reasonable way to get to Trump's “300,000” figure.
    


            Trump, talking about the city of Portland, falsely claimed “your place is burning down” and that “unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II.” We're not sure what “tapes” Trump has seen, but it's simply not true that the city is burning down. While there have been some unruly protests near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in the city this year – and protesters were arrested in June for allegedly starting fires there – the broader city has been functioning as usual, and even the situation around the ICE building is generally calmer than it was in June.
    


            CNN's Andy Rose noted in an article Tuesday that Trump began publicly floating the idea of deploying troops to Portland this year on the same day that Fox News, of which Trump is a frequent viewer, aired a story that mixed recent footage of standoffs at the ICE facility with five-year-old footage of rioting in Portland during a period of national unrest in 2020.
    


            Reviving a false claim he has deployed for years at his campaign rallies, Trump claimed that, right after he criticized CNN during the speech, CNN turned off the camera that had been filming him; Trump said, pointing toward the back of the room, “Oh, their camera just went off.” That didn't happen. A CNN photojournalist who was ​there covering the speech for the media “pool” filmed it without interruption. And CNN itself aired Trump's criticism live and in full; in fact, the network didn't turn away from Trump's live remarks until more than half an hour after the president claimed the camera had been turned off and more than an hour after the speech began. (CNN then moved to analysis of what he had said.)

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest on the possibility of a government shutdown on 'Special Report.'

Nearly two-thirds of American voters say that the Democrats in Congress shouldn't force a federal government shutdown if their demands are not met, according to a new national poll.

But a New York Times/Siena poll also indicates that voters would blame Republicans and President Donald Trump, as well as Democrats, if the government shuts down at midnight Tuesday.

Currently, there's no indication either Trump and the Republican majority in Congress or congressional Democrats are willing to lower the temperature, with both political parties at odds over a temporary short-term spending plan to avoid the shutdown.

Democrats are insisting that any agreement to prevent a government shutdown must extend tax credits for the popular Affordable Care Act (ACA) beyond the end of this year. Those credits, which millions of Americans rely on to reduce the costs of health care plans under the ACA, which was once known as Obamacare, are set to expire unless Congress acts.

But most Republicans oppose the extension of the credits and argue that the Democrats' demands would lead to a huge increase in taxpayer-funded healthcare for migrants who entered the country illegally.

Sixty-five percent of those questioned in the poll said Democrats should not shut down the government even if their demands are not met, with 27% disagreeing.

But many Democrats appear eager for a fight. 

By a 47%-43% margin, Democrats said the party should vote to shut down the government if their demands are not met.

Only 32% of independents and just 5% of Republican respondents said the Democrats should vote to shut down the government.

Meanwhile, the poll also indicates that independent voters are twice as likely to blame Trump and congressional Republicans than Democrats if the government shuts down.

Trump, speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, reiterated his warning that "a lot" of federal workers may be fired if the government shuts down.

And speaking Monday night with Politico, the president once again argued that the Democrats would be blamed for a government shutdown.

"People that are smart see what's happening. The Democrats are deranged," he claimed.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top Democrat in the lower chamber, responding to a fake and derogatory video posted on social media by the president on Monday evening, said in a social media post that "Bigotry will get you nowhere. Cancel the Cuts. Lower the Cost. Save Healthcare. We are NOT backing down."

The New York Times/Siena poll indicates that the president's overall approval ratings remain underwater. 

Trump stands at 43% approval and 54% disapproval in the survey, which was conducted Sept. 22–27.

While Trump's approval rating is well into negative territory among Democrats and independents, he retains the support of roughly 9 out of 10 GOP voters.

The poll was conducted among 1,313 registered voters nationwide.

President Donald Trump informed hundreds of senior military leaders on Tuesday that he told Secretary of War Pete Hegseth that the military should use “dangerous cities” in the United States as “training grounds for our military.”

The president and secretary have deployed National Guard forces to quell civil unrest in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and have approved missions to Portland, Oregon and Memphis, Tennessee, with several other cities discussed as possible options.

Trump addressed the hundreds of senior military leaders who traveled to Quantico, Virginia on Tuesday following an order from the secretary, who addressed the crowd ahead of the president.

“Portland, Oregon, where it looks like a war zone, and I get a call from the liberal governor, ‘Sir please don't come in, we don't need you.' I said, ‘Well, unless they're playing false tapes, this looked like World War II. Your place is burning down. I mean, you must be kidding,'” Trump said.

Referencing the service members who have been deployed on these missions, Trump said he has told Hegseth, “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military because we're going into Chicago very soon, that's a big city.”

The president's deployment of the National Guard troops quickly became a political issue.

He called up 4,000 California National Guard troops in opposition to the city mayor and state governor, who, under normal circumstances, are the heads of the state's national guard. Hegseth also deployed about 700 Marines to the city to augment federal and local officials.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit to stop the mission, but it is still being adjudicated.

Trump faced less resistance federalizing troops to help reign in crime in Washington, D.C., because the president controls the D.C. National Guard, given there is no governor of the district. He has discussed the possibility of deploying troops to other cities as well, including Chicago and New York City.

Last month, Trump signed an executive order that called for the creation of a “quick reaction force” made up of National Guard troops available for “rapid nationwide deployment.”

“That is going to be a big thing for the people in this focus. It's the enemy from within and we have to handle it before it gets out of control,” Trump said, referencing the EO.

“It seems that the [cities] that are run by the radical left Democrats, what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places, and we're going to straighten them out one by one,” the president added. “And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That's a war too. It's a war from within.”

Trump also said that military officers who are spat on while conducting crowd control missions should be allowed to “hit” that person back.

Many of the protests that have spurred the deployment of troops to inner cities have focused on protecting immigrants, both those who have legal status and those who don't, who feel threatened by the administration's emphasis on deporting illegal immigrants.

The audience of senior military leaders were often quiet throughout the president's address largely in line with how they act at presidential addresses, like the State of the Union. The military is expected to remain apolitical.

Trump addressed the more stoic audience as he walked out on stage in Quantico, saying, “I've never walked into a room so silent,” adding that he was told ahead of time that he wouldn't “hear a murmur in the room.”

“If you don't like what I'm saying you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future,” Trump quipped, which elicited laughs from the crowd.

He is set to follow up his address on Tuesday with plans to go to Norfolk on Friday to discuss the country's “great Naval assets,” according to a senior White House official. 

“Some people would say, no, that's old technology,” Trump told senior military leaders about possibly bringing back naval battleships. “I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns. But it's something we're actually considering, the concept of battleship, nice six-inch side solid steel, not aluminum.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson tears into Democrats' shutdown 'demands' on 'Hannity.'

FIRST ON FOX: A union representing roughly 18,000 Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents is putting pressure on Senate Democrats to avert a partial government shutdown before midnight Wednesday.

Congress now has roughly less than 12 hours to keep federal agencies funded or risk potentially furloughing thousands of government workers and temporarily pausing key government services, with the Senate due to vote on a short-term bill extending current funding levels through Nov. 21 sometime late afternoon on Tuesday.

Democrats have so far stood firm in their demands for significant concessions on healthcare to be included in any funding deal, while Republicans continue to pressure left-wing lawmakers to stop the coming shutdown.

"On behalf of the men and women patrolling and securing our borders, we strongly support the bipartisan House-passed Continuing Resolution (CR) and urge the Senate to immediately pass and send it to President Trump for his signature," National Border Patrol Council President Paul Perez told Fox News Digital.

SHUTDOWN EXPLAINED: WHO WORKS, WHO DOESN'T AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS

Perez warned that a lapse in federal funding "threatens our ability to do our jobs and our capacity to maintain the most secure border in our nation's history."

"A government shutdown means we go without mission-critical funding for patrol vehicles, roads, radios, infrastructure and agent pay," Perez said.

"What our agents do every day — ensure the safety of the American people and the sovereignty of our great country — is not a game, it's life and death. We hope our Democrat-elected leaders in Congress will stop playing political games and fund our government."

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., backed up the endorsement, telling Fox News Digital, "There is a sad irony in the fact that Democrats are threatening to hold pay for Border Patrol agents hostage unless we reinstate taxpayer-funded healthcare for people who crossed the border illegally. America's Border Patrol agents are heroes, not political pawns for Democrats' political game."

He was referring to House Democrats' alternate proposal for a short-term funding bill calling for a repeal of the Medicaid cuts passed in the GOP's One Big, Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in July.

The majority of Republican-led provisions in the OBBB that targeted federal healthcare funding going toward illegal immigrants did not make it into the final legislation, however.

Democrats have also been pushing for an extension of Obamacare subsidies that were enhanced during the COVID-19 pandemic but are due to expire at the end of this year.

Republican leaders have signaled openness to having discussions on Obamacare, formally called the Affordable Care Act, but ruled out their inclusion in the seven-week funding bill. They've also called demands to roll back Republicans' Medicaid changes a non-starter.

The bill, called a continuing resolution (CR), would keep current government funding levels roughly flat until Nov. 21 to give Congress more time to strike a deal on fiscal year 2026 spending levels. It would also include about $88 million toward enhanced security for lawmakers, the White House and the judicial branch — which has bipartisan support.

The House passed the CR largely along party lines. But in the Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is needed to overcome a filibuster and consider a bill, at least some Democratic support is needed.

The last time a government shutdown standoff happened was in March, when 10 Senate Democrats broke from their party to help pass the Republicans' CR.

There were no Senate Democrats from states on the U.S.-Mexico border in that number.

Addressing a rare gathering of top military leaders in Virginia, President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to end political correctness and “woke” culture in leadership and proposed using U.S. cities as training grounds for the armed forces.

QUANTICO, Va. (AP) — President Donald Trump revealed that he wants to use American cities as training grounds for the armed forces and joined Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday in declaring an end to “woke” culture before an unusual gathering of hundreds of top U.S. military officials who were abruptly summoned to Virginia from around the world.

Hegseth announced new directives for troops that include “gender-neutral” or “male-level” standards for physical fitness, while Trump bragged about U.S. nuclear capabilities and warned that “America is under invasion from within.”

“After spending trillions of dollars defending the borders of foreign countries, with your help we're defending the borders of our country,” Trump said. 

Hegseth had called military leaders to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, near Washington, without publicly revealing the reason until this morning. His address largely focused on his own long-used talking points that painted a picture of a military that has been hamstrung by “woke” policies, and he said military leaders should “do the honorable thing and resign” if they don't like his new approach.

Meetings between top military brass and civilian leaders are nothing new, but the gathering had fueled intense speculation about the summit's purpose given the haste with which it was called and the mystery surrounding it.

Admirals and generals from conflict zones in the Middle East and elsewhere were summoned for a lecture on race and gender in the military, underscoring the extent to which the country's culture wars have emerged as a front-and-center agenda item for Hegseth's Pentagon, even at a time of broad national security concerns across the globe.

Trump is used to boisterous crowds of supporters who laugh at his jokes and applaud his boasts during his speeches. But he wasn't getting that kind of soundtrack from the generals and admirals in attendance. 

In keeping with the nonpartisan tradition of the armed services, the military leaders sat mostly stone-faced through Trump's politicized remarks, a contrast from when rank-and-file soldiers cheered during Trump's speech at Fort Bragg this summer.

During his nearly hour-long speech, Hegseth said the U.S. military has promoted too many leaders for the wrong reasons based on race, gender quotas and “historic firsts.” 

“The era of politically correct, overly sensitive don't-hurt-anyone's-feelings leadership ends right now at every level,” Hegseth said.

That was echoed by Trump, who said “the purposes of America military is not to protect anyone's feelings. It's to protect our republic.″

″We will not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom,” Trump said. “And we will be a fighting and winning machine.”

Hegseth said he is loosening disciplinary rules and weakening hazing protections, putting a heavy focus on removing many of the guardrails the military had put in place after numerous scandals and investigations

He said he was ordering a review of “the department's definitions of so-called toxic leadership, bullying and hazing to empower leaders to enforce standards without fear of retribution or second guessing.”

The defense secretary called for “changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records that will allow leaders with forgivable, earnest, or minor infractions to not be encumbered by those infractions in perpetuity.”

“People make honest mistakes, and our mistakes should not define an entire career,” Hegseth said. “Otherwise, we only try not to make mistakes.”

Bullying and toxic leadership has been the suspected and confirmed cause behind numerous military suicides over the past several years, including the very dramatic suicide of Brandon Caserta, a young sailor who was bullied into killing himself in 2018.

A Navy investigation found that Caserta's supervisor's “noted belligerence, vulgarity and brash leadership was likely a significant contributing factor in (the sailor)'s decision to end his own life.”

Hegseth used the platform to slam environmental policies and transgender troops while talking up his and Trump's focus on “the warrior ethos” and “peace through strength.”

Hegseth said the department has been told from previous administrations that “our diversity is our strength,” which he called an “insane fallacy.”

“They had to put out dizzying DEI and LGBTQE+ statements. They were told females and males are the same thing, or that males who think they're females is totally normal,” he said, adding the use of electric tanks and the COVID vaccine requirements to the list as mistaken policies.

Hegseth said this is not about preventing women from serving.

“But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,” he said. “If women can make it excellent, if not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.”

Hegseth's speech came as the country faces a potential government shutdown this week and as Hegseth, who has hammered home a focus on lethality, has taken several unusual and unexplained actions, including ordering cuts to the number of general officers and firings of other top military leaders.

Hegseth has championed the military's role in securing the U.S.-Mexico border, deploying to American cities as part of Trump's law enforcement surges, and carrying out strikes on boats in the Caribbean that the administration says targeted drug traffickers.

Trump administration Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy decries the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a North Carolina commuter train and urges stronger leadership on ‘Hannity.'

Authorities have arrested a paroled felon with a violent past in connection with a deadly stabbing on a Caltrain platform, according to police and a local news report.

The San Mateo County Sheriff's Office identified the suspect as Jose Gomez Bustamante, 31, who was booked into the Maguire Correctional Facility on Aug. 28 on suspicion of murder. He was taken into custody around 11:30 a.m. after investigators tracked him overnight.

The victim, a man from San Mateo, was taken to a nearby hospital with critical injuries and later died. 

The victim has been identified by the coroner's office as Joseph Michael Carreiro. Authorities said it was not immediately clear what led up to the stabbing.

The case is being investigated as a homicide, with assistance from the Redwood City Police Department and the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office.

Sheriff's officials are asking for the public's help in gathering evidence, including photos, videos or eyewitness accounts. They emphasized the stabbing appeared to be an isolated incident and that there is no ongoing threat to public safety.

Sheriff Christina Corpus praised the efforts of law enforcement and their swift actions.

"We extend our thoughts and deepest condolences to the loved ones of the deceased," she said in a statement. "I am grateful to all Sheriff's Office personnel who acted swiftly to safely apprehend the suspect to bring him to justice. This is another example of the excellent work of our highly trained personnel and their commitment in keeping our community members safe."

This is not Bustamante's first brush with violence. In 2020, he attempted to stab a taqueria employee in Redwood City in what authorities described as an unprovoked attack. He later pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to six years in prison in June 2023.

However, according to RWC Pulse, Bustamante was released on parole this April, less than two years into his sentence after receiving credits for good behavior and treatment program participation. Records reviewed by the outlet also show a history of parole violations and prior offenses.

            Most people in Portland, Oregon, don't mind if you think they're weird. In fact, it's practically a trademark.
    


            “We do have a lot of weirdos here,” Sarah Siano, who has lived in the city off and on since 2010, says with a smile.
    


            But to hear President Donald Trump tell it, Portland is the latest city taken over by terrorists and in desperate need of federal salvation, making its weirdness something else entirely.
    


            “It's anarchy out there,” Trump said last week in the Oval Office, days before announcing the federalization of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for a period of 60 days.
    


            The president is citing daily protests outside the city's Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility to justify the latest of his troop callups in a major city with a Democratic-led government.
    


            The anarchy described by the president is strongly disputed by locals who say they don't want or need federal help.
    


            “It kind of feels like somebody's trying to rage bait you,” Siano said. “They're just trying to get that negative reaction.”
    


‘It's slippery slope': CNN military analyst reacts to Trump's plan for Portland



            The state and the city government took their concerns a step further Sunday, filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration and calling the president's move “unlawful” and “baseless.”
    


            “There is no insurrection,” Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said Saturday.“There is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city.”
    


            As they await a federal judge's decision on whether to block the Guard deployment – and continue to emphasize their “sanctuary city” status – Portland officials remain at odds with Trump over their view that the city needs no additional federal presence.
    


            “President Trump has directed ‘all necessary Troops' to Portland, Oregon,” Mayor Keith Wilson said Saturday. “The number of necessary troops is zero.”
    


            Getting an exact record of clashes between protesters and law enforcement is difficult because most of the standoff has been between demonstrators and federal agents, with Portland Police declining to get involved unless there is a safety threat to the general public.
    


            Portland Police Bureau logs show more than 100 calls made to the address of the ICE building this year. Listed reasons include “disorder,” “unwanted person”﻿ and shots fired.
    


            The tension reached its peak during one week in June, when a half-dozen protesters were arrested for allegedly starting fires around the building and more were accused of interfering with law enforcement.
    


            On June 14, a protest organized in connection with the national “No Kings” movement turned violent as some demonstrators arrived at the ICE facility. Police declared a riot outside the building – the only time this year – and made three arrests.
    


            Portland Police continued to monitor the area for the following week, resulting in four minor arrests, including one for DUI. Later that month, the building was closed for several days after federal law enforcement forcibly removed protesters who refused to leave federal property.
    


Portland's city leaders and residents are pushing back against ICE. Now Trump is sending in troops



            The area outside the ICE facility has been calmer since the dramatic events of June, but the tan brick and stucco building in an industrial area has more layers of fencing, its lower-level windows have been blocked by plywood and a concrete retaining wall is covered in anti-ICE graffiti.
    


            Still, contrary to the president's depiction of constant violent lawlessness, neighbors say most of the time there is little to see.
    


            “I live within a thousand feet of the ICE facility,” Lashawnda Shavers told CNN affiliate KPTV on Sunday. “There are no fires, there's no lynching, there's no rioting, there's no looting, there's no attacks or assaults.”
    


            Neighbors have repeatedly complained about the tear gas periodically being deployed against protesters. It wafts down the street in such a thick cloud that a nearby charter school was moved a mile away earlier this month to get away from the gas.
    


            And some Portland residents say they're fed up with all of it.
    


            “(Protesters) are making noise constantly, even when nobody from ICE is outside,” David Schmidt told CNN affiliate KATU. “So for hours they would be out here just disrupting the public here that lives here.”
    


            This isn't the first time Trump has sent federal law enforcement to Portland to deal with protesters. More than 700 officers were deployed in 2020 to protect federal facilities in downtown Portland as some protests turned violent following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
    


            Dozens of those officers did not have sufficient training in handling crowd control, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.
    


            Those frequently violent protests in downtown Portland stretched on for more than 100 days and became a top target for conservative leaders who argued Democratic leaders of major cities were being too soft on criminals.
    


            At the time, Trump called the protesters “anarchists and agitators,” and his view of Portland today appears to be strongly influenced by the protests of five years ago.
    


            “The few shops that are open, they just use plywood … They don't put store fronts because they know it's going to be burned down,” Trump said last week, describing a scene that is neither the current state of downtown Portland nor the South Waterfront community where the ICE building sits.
    


            But residents say that depiction of the heart of their city is behind the times.
    


            “For him to start making these comments again when I would say it's like more of a renaissance of downtown, it's just really ironic,” Siano said.
    


            The president's years-old view of the city may be influenced by his own media habits. He first began floating the idea of a Portland deployment weeks ago, on the same day that Fox News – famously Trump's outlet of choice – aired a story about the protests that mixed recent footage of standoffs at the ICE facility with older footage of the downtown rioting.
    


            “I didn't know that was still going on,” Trump mused on September 5.
    


            Local officials believe the deployment is an attempt to provoke demonstrators to violence and before Trump's announcement, they were already urging them to stay peaceful.
    


            “Their goal is to create an engagement – an engagement that will lead to conflict,” said Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in a Friday night news conference. “President Trump has one goal. His goal is to make Portland look like what he's been describing it as. Let's not grant him that wish.”
    


            At least one prominent politician from Oregon is supporting the move.
    


            “I've seen firsthand how lawlessness has transformed Portland from a beautiful place to live to a crime-ridden war zone. Thank you, @POTUS, for taking action to keep our ICE facilities protected and Make America Safe Again!,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer wrote in a post on X.



            Chavez-DeRemer, a Republican, is a former member of Congress who represented a district that includes a very small section of the city of Portland near the ICE building.
    


President Trump plans to send troops to Portland, Chicago and Memphis. Here's what we know



            The idea that federal agents can make a tense situation worse appears to be a concern shared by Portland Police.
    


            Assistant Police Chief Craig Dobson said this summer federal agents “have been, night after night, actually instigating and causing some of the ruckus that's occurring down there,” adding that ICE is “not following best practice,” The Oregonian reported. His testimony was part of a lawsuit filed against the city by a local resident who argued the city has failed to punish demonstrators who violate noise ordinances and disturb the peace of the neighborhood.
    


            Following the announcement of the National Guard deployment, Kotek and Wilson were both part of a march against federal escalation Sunday, KATU reported.
    


            More than 100 people then gathered Sunday outside the ICE building, including counter protesters, which police said led to fights among the crowd. Portland Police made two arrests, their first at the location since mid-summer, according to the city's lawsuit against the federal government.
    


            Rep. Maxine Dexter, a Democrat whose district includes most of Portland and who also participated in the march, said she hopes demonstrators will avoid confrontation at the ICE building.
    


            “Donald Trump is watching video of what's happening down there,” she told KATU Sunday. “I would love it if we keep that as quiet as possible. Leave flowers. Walk by peacefully, but agitation down there is just going to backfire on all of us.”
    


            But with the Trump administration determined to make Portland its next test case on ramping up force, some residents wonder if keeping calm will make a difference.
    


            “I'm pissed that this is about to happen because it's ridiculous,” Shavers said Monday, according to KATU. “If the president actually had been out here and seen what's really going on, maybe he would change his mind.”

Rep. David Schweikert (R-AZ) is running for governor of Arizona, forgoing a chance for reelection in a competitive GOP toss-up seat in 2026.

The congressman, who has represented Arizona's 1st District since 2023 but has been in the House since 2010, will join a gubernatorial primary against fellow Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ). President Donald Trump has endorsed two candidates already in the Republican primary, Biggs and Karrin Taylor Robson, so Schweikert's entrance will be a test of how influential Trump's support can be in a competitive primary.

Whoever wins the GOP race will go on to face Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ), who defeated Republican Kari Lake in the 2022 gubernatorial general election. Arizona became an epicenter for GOP challenges to election results that year, but the courts certified that Lake's claims were unfounded.

Schweikert told Axios that he believes Washington is “unsavable.” 

“I do believe Arizona is savable,” Schweikert said.

The six-term congressman told the outlet that he was skeptical Biggs or Robson could win against Hobbs, noting he has a track record of winning a purple district that can translate to results in a purple state.

Schweikert separately told the Washington Post he thinks Republican voters desire an “actual conservative … someone that's not running on resentment and grievances.”

In 2022, Lake beat out a more centrist candidate in the primary only to lose to the Democratic candidate in the general election. But Trump won Arizona by more than 5 percentage points in 2024, so Hobbs's governor's mansion is viewed as a pick-up opportunity for Republicans in 2026.

MAJOR HOUSE REPUBLICAN PLAYERS HEAD FOR THE EXITS, LEAVING GAPS IN THE LOWER CHAMBER

Schweikert's departure from the House is a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), as congressional Republicans will now need to devote heavy resources to defend a swing seat and hold on to their razor-thin majority in the lower chamber.

So far, the House GOP lawmakers who have already left or plan to retire after this term are leaving behind solid red or likely red seats. Schweikert's is the second toss-up race, listed by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, to become open, giving Democrats a chance to flip the seat without the presence of an incumbent. The first was Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who has expressed similar sentiments that the chaos of the House is factoring into his retirement.

Taylor Swift has been one of the Wives And Girlfriends of professional athletes (WAGs) for a minute, but there are levels in the WAG pyramid, if you will.
    


            The superstar singer has been dating Kansas City Chiefs football player Travis Kelce since 2023, but the pair recently got engaged, which moves her closer to the “wives” portion of that unofficial club.
    


            WAG, a celebratory term for our vernacular purposes, has reached reality show status in popular culture, most recently in “W.A.G.s to Riches” on Netfllix.



            And while most WAGs, like Swift, are seen as supportive of their athlete partners, they are usually less famous.
    


            Kelce rose to prominence when he joined the Chiefs in 2013, but his lady love has been on the music scene since she was 16 years old.
    


            Forbes has designated Swift as the richest living female musician and estimates her worth at $1.6 billion, while Kelce's portfolio is estimated to stand at $70 million.
    


            Game recognizes game, and Kelce has expressed his admiration for the effort and conditioning required for Swift's concert performances.
    


            On his podcast in August, Kelce recalled seeing what he called “the recovery station” for Swift after her Eras Tour concert.
    


            “S**t, I'm telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy,” Kelce said. “I was like, ‘Oh my Gosh. She does more than I do.'”
    


Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged



            When it comes to the intersection of sports, culture and politics, the two have already shown they can successfully navigate their own paths.
    


            The pop star has been more vocal in recent years about her political stances, including endorsing then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the most recent presidential election.
    


            For his part, Kelce has not made direct comments about his political views.
    


            He ran afoul of some anti-vaxers after starring in a 2023 ad done in partnership with Pfizer to publicize flu and Covid vaccine shots.
    


            That same year, he also collaborated with Bud Light, a beer brand which stirred backlash from some conservatives after collaborating with actor and writer Dylan Mulvaney, who is trans.
    


            Outrage aimed at the football player has not been from one side, however.
    


            Some liberals were less than pleased when Kelce was asked about President Donald Trump's planned attendance at Super Bowl LIX, which he and his team were playing in. Trump was making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl game.
    


            “It's a great honor, I think you know, no matter who the president is,” Kelce said at the time. “I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there – it's the best country in the world – and that's pretty cool.”
    


            CNN legal analyst Lisa Bonner said she doesn't see Swift changing her stance or stifling her desire to speak out on issues that matter to her.
    


            “I don't think that she's going to be willing to silence herself. She does not speak out all the time, so when she does speak out, she has something to say,” Bonner said. “She just says it and moves on. I think that's going to be the biggest challenge being able to keep her voice and reconcile that with the NFL.”
    


            That's because the NFL has famously attempted to avoid controversy, like in 2016 when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sparked debate after he began kneeling during the National Anthem at the beginning of his games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the US.
    


            But Swift has a massive audience and her own power, Bonner noted.
    


To the ‘dads, Brads and Chads' who've taken issue with the amount of Taylor Swift shown during NFL games: Too bad



            “She has moved mountains and moved economies in different cities when she was on tour,” the lawyer said. “So I don't think that she's really too worried about it. I think (the NFL is) probably more worried about it than she is.”
    


            Bonner said she also doesn't think Kelce is too concerned, as he is extremely supportive of Swift and pursued her in such a way that gave her fans the love story they have always wanted for her.
    


            “He's no shrinking violet in his own right,” Bonner said of Kelce. “He's arguably, at this juncture, one of the most famous football players that is on the roster these days.”
    


            “He checks all the boxes,” she said, “including the unbothered box.”

Cleveland Browns legend Joe Thomas is giving the "Shedeur Sanders cult" a reality check in his appearance on OutKick's "Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich."

The mother of Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders fired back at criticism he received from former NFL head coach Rex Ryan on Monday.

Ryan had some terse words for Sanders after the rookie said he was capable of playing better than some of the starters in the league. However, Sanders has not moved up from the No. 3 position on the depth chart and has not seen action in any Browns games this season despite Cleveland being 1-3, not even in garbage time.

Pilar Sanders didn't appear to appreciate the remarks from Ryan.

"To young Athletes and Football fans... This is what impotent, cancerous, envious energy looks like," she wrote in a post on her Instagram Stories. "This type of Evile (sic) goes waaay back - you can cut it with a knife - embedded in blood and bones seeping through all of the rotting worm holes it has. 

"What and who does he really represent? Its family and peers should be embarrassed to know and let this on their platforms. There's no room for this type in sports."

The post has since been taken down.

The former New York Jets head coach said on ESPN that he believed there was something "missing" from the Sanders conversation as the panelists debated over what head coach Kevin Stefanski should do at the position.

"This kid talks and he runs his mouth. Like he said, 'I can be a starting quarterback' with his arms crossed like this. Get your a-- in the front row and study and do all that. If I know, the whole league knows," Ryan said.

"Quit being an embarrassment that way. You've got the talent to be the quarterback, you should be. You should be embarrassed that you're not the quarterback now."

Sanders said last week he believed he could perform better than some current starters in the NFL.

"I know if you see the quarterback play in the league right now, I know I'm capable of doing better than that," Sanders told ESPN Cleveland.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — The United States will deport hundreds of Iranians back to Iran in the coming weeks, with the first 120 deportees being prepared for a flight in the next day or two, Iran said Tuesday. 

The deportation of Iranians, not yet publicly acknowledged by the U.S. government, comes as tensions remain high between the two countries following the American bombings of Iranian nuclear sites in June. 

Meanwhile, the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran this past week over its nuclear program, putting new pressure on the Islamic Republic's ailing economy. 

The deportations also represent a collision of a top priority of President Donald Trump — targeting illegal immigration — against a decadeslong practice by the U.S. of welcoming Iranian dissidents, exiles and others since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

As many as 400 Iranians would be returning to Iran as part of the deal with the U.S., Iranian state television said, citing Hossein Noushabadi, director-general for parliamentary affairs at Iran's Foreign Ministry. He said the majority of those people had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico illegally, while some faced other immigration issues.

Noushabadi said the first planeload of Iranians would arrive in a day or two, after stopping over in Qatar on the way. Authorities in Qatar have not confirmed that.

The U.S. State Department referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond. The New York Times first reported the deportations.




In the lead up to and after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, a large number of Iranians fled to the U.S. In the decades since, the U.S. had been sensitive in allowing those fleeing from Iran over religious, sexual or political persecution to seek residency. 

In the 2024 fiscal year, for instance, the U.S. deported only 20 Iranians, according to statistics from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

Iran has criticized Washington for hosting dissidents and others in the past. U.S. federal prosecutors have accused Iran of hiring hitmen to target dissidents as well in America. 

It's unclear exactly what has changed now in American policy. However, since returning to the White House, Trump has cracked down on those living in the U.S. illegally.

Noushabadi said that American authorities unilaterally made the decision without consultations with Iran. 

But The New York Times said Tuesday, citing anonymous Iranian officials, that the deportations were “the culmination of months of discussions between the two countries.”

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, as well as President Masoud Pezeshkian, both attended the U.N. General Assembly in New York last week as a last-ditch effort to stop the reimposed sanctions. However, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei boxed in their efforts by describing diplomacy with the U.S. as a “sheer dead end.”

Speaking to state TV in footage aired Tuesday, Araghchi acknowledged that direct communication from Iran went to the U.S. government during the U.N. visit — something he had been careful not to highlight during five rounds of nuclear negotiations with the Americans earlier this year. 

“With Americans, both directly and indirectly, messages were exchanged, and eventually, we are relieved that we did whatever it was necessary,” Araghchi said. “It was clear and evident to us after the interpretation the Supreme Leader made that negotiations with Americans is an obvious dead-end.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Crowds wore maga flowers and “pavas” — straw hats traditionally worn by jíbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa. 

Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (“little house”), for the pari de marquesina, a house party. 

If all the world's a stage — might as well make it home.

In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish — a landmark moment for Latino culture.

Bad Bunny's “No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí” residency (in English, “I Don't Want to Leave Here”) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history — reggaetón hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.” (“I Should Have Taken More Photos.”)

There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song “Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii,” (“What Happened to Hawaii”), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's “El Apagón” (“The Blackout”), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.




Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream — but it is enough for a taste. 

It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the ‘00s. He's a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further — helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.

Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year. 

In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.

“There was the issue of — like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump's immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.

Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,” he said in a video last year.

For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an “anti-ICE activist” on Instagram.

Ryan Fournier, chair of Students for Trump, said that “whoever picks these people should be fired.”

For others, Bad Bunny's booking is cause for celebration. “Go get em Bad Bunny!” wrote Bruno Mars on X.

Roc Nation founder Jay-Z, who oversees the Super Bowl booking, said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has “done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage.”

At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.

The question is — what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?

In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. “The revolution 'bout to be televised,” he announced early in the performance.

It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,” reminding them to “play the game.” There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick's kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.

That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.

At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities — among them LeBron James, Penélope Cruz and Kylian Mbappé — to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arcángel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted “Preciosa” — a song Anthony had not sung in public in 20 years.

“Preciosa” was written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández Marín in 1937 and is viewed as an unofficial anthem for the island. It references Puerto Rico's hybrid identity — a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures — and threats made to the island in its long colonial history (“No importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,” goes the chorus. “It doesn't matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.”) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.

It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets — and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same — but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight — informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.

Fox News national correspondent Garrett Tenney has the latest on why the FBI is calling the Michigan shooting a targeted attack on 'Special Report.'

GRAND BLANC, Mich. – The father of the man responsible for driving a truck into a Mormon church in Michigan before opening fire on congregants apologized for his son's actions on Monday.

The father, Thomas Sanford, told the Detroit Free Press that the situation is a "nightmare." Neighbors and members of the community in Grand Blanc, Michigan, expressed shock and sorrow in interviews with Fox News Digital. Investigators have not determined a specific motive for the shooter, also named Thomas Sanford, as new details emerge about his romantic life and alleged anti-Mormon prejudice.

"I feel terrible about all the families that have been hurt and they're under the same crap that I'm going under, that my wife and I are going under," the elder Sanford said. "I apologize for that."

Sanford added that his son "loved the United States" and was a "family man."

"The only thing I can say is that it was my son that did it," Sanford said. "As far as why? Irrelevant. It happened. We're dealing with it. It's been a nightmare."

Online images of the shooter's home showed a campaign sign for President Donald Trump on its fence, but the sign was not present when Fox News Digital saw the home on Monday.

Neighbors of Sanford's father said they were aware of the attack but didn't speculate about the man's motive.

"It's just awful," the neighbor said, declining to be named.

Local city council candidate Kris Johns told Fox News that he spoke to Sanford just days before his attack and that the conversation veered toward extreme anti-Mormon rhetoric.

Sanford referred to Mormonism as "the anti-Christ" during their talk, Johns said.

Past acquaintances of Sanford's say he had no such prejudice earlier in his life. Sandra Winter, who says she was Sanford's landlady in Utah for roughly 10 months in 2010, said he dated and nearly married a Mormon woman during his time there.

Winter said she knew Sanford well and that he was considering joining the Mormon church in order to further his relationship with the girlfriend. She added that the woman's family was "pretty gung ho about the idea."

Despite all this, Winter said Sanford one day abruptly left without explanation.

Another Grand Blanc community member told Fox News Digital that he was at the police academy and watched national media descend on Grand Blanc after the attack.

"You see this stuff happening all over and think it can't happen here. And then suddenly it does," he said.

He went on to argue that media coverage of the shooting only adds "fuel to the fire," by giving notoriety to the attacker. As of Tuesday, at least four people are dead, seven are in stable condition in the wake of Sanford's attack.

"It's all about forgiveness," the Grand Blanc resident told Fox. "I'm not a Mormon but I'm a Christian, and I'm mourning right along with them."

Several local Christian churches have offered their support to the Mormon community in the wake of Sunday's attack. Grand Blanc's The River Church held a prayer service Sunday night, while St. Christopher's Episcopal Church offered to share its facilities for worship services.

NEW YORK (AP) — Baseball's economic disparity will be on display in the playoffs, where the Los Angeles Dodgers have committed more than $500 million in salaries and luxury tax this season as they take on a Cincinnati Reds team with a $121 million payroll.

Six of the 12 postseason teams have payrolls of $200 million or more, with the Boston Red Sox about $500,000 short of the mark. The World Series champion Dodgers overtook the New York Mets with in-season moves that boosted their payroll to $341.5 million, according to Major League Baseball's latest tabulation.

Despite deferring over $1 billion in payments for eight players, including Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles is projected to pay nearly $168 million in luxury tax. That shatters the prior mark of $103 million it paid for the 2024 season for a record total spend of $509.5 million.

The second-biggest spender, the Mets, didn't even make the 12-team postseason despite spending $428.8 million — which represents a decrease of about $1.5 million from 2024. The Mets payroll after in-season moves is $339.7 million and they project to pay $89.1 million in tax.

Final payrolls and tax figures won't be calculated until award bonuses are determined following the World Series.




Baseball's collective bargaining agreement expires in December 2026 and some owners are advocating that management push for a salary cap. Baseball players have always resisted a cap, and the sport's 10th work stoppage since 1972 is possible.




The Yankees have the third-highest spend at $363.3 million with $301.5 million in payroll and $61.8 million in tax. Their Wild Card Series opponent is the Red Sox, who committed just under $199.6 million with a $198 million payroll a little over $1.5 million in tax.

Cleveland at $103.9 million has the lowest payroll of the playoff teams. The Guardians play Detroit, which is at $162.6 million.

San Diego ($224.1 million in spending) meets the Chicago Cubs ($211.8 million) in the other NL first-round series. The Padres have a $217.3 million payroll and are projected to pay a $6.9 million tax.

Two teams with first-round byes didn't reach this year's luxury tax threshold, Milwaukee at $124.8 million and Seattle at $167.2 million.

Philadelphia has the fourth-highest spend at $347.7 million with a $291.7 million payroll and $55.9 million in forecast tax.

Toronto is at $266 million with a $252.7 million payroll and $13.4 million in projected tax.

            Hot Stocks 





            Gray's Papaya hot dog restaurant in Manhattan has served up beef franks to the hungry and frugal masses for the past five decades.
    


            But the bustling business off 72nd and Broadway isn't just an iconic New York City bastion for cheap eats — it also moonlights as an unofficial economic indicator.
    


            When hot dog sales there see a dramatic pickup — particularly the two-frank-and-tropical-drink “Recession Special” — it's usually a signal that folks have fallen on harder times, owner Rachael Gray told CNN.
    


            “We noticed a big uptick around 2008-2009, when everything was collapsing (amid the Great Financial Crisis), and we are feeling the same thing right now — to a lesser extent, obviously, but the pattern is the same,” she said.
    


            There are scores of traditional, time-tested gauges of the US economy's health and its trajectory: Federal data on employment, production, spending, income and other critical areas factors heavily into the calculus of the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, when it dates business cycles.
    


            (The NBER's declarations, by the way, don't happen in real time. They often come months, and sometimes not for two years, after a recession has already started.)
    


            Still, as it stands now, while some barometers indicate the US economy is slowing, recent data has shown that it's still growing, consumer spending remains strong and the unemployment rate isn't yet tripping alarm bells.
    


            However, for many Americans, especially middle- and lower-income households, there's a growing disconnect. This sure doesn't feel like a period of economic prosperity, they say.
    


            “When we look at these aggregate numbers, that's representative of some average outcome,” Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, told CNN. “It's not showing us distributional outcome. And so, as inequality increases to some extent, people will disagree with what they see in the averages a little bit more.”
    


            So, beyond the spreads of credit, the curves of yields and the claims for unemployment benefits, there's a motley crew of unorthodox metrics that are gaining popularity at a time when aggregate spending data mostly reflects the actions of the well-heeled few (and when fears are heightened about the integrity of federal data — or whether we'll get any data at all, if the government shuts down).
    


            While seemingly more silly than scientific, here's what a selection of some real-world objects and activities — like hot dogs, movie-going, pawn loans, cardboard boxes, camping and gas station snacks — can tell us about the state of the American consumer and broader economy.
    


            The Gray's Papaya sales pattern appears to convey a straightforward trend: When people are looking to save money, they'll seek out value and turn to cheaper eats.
    


            In recent weeks, sales of the $7.50 Recession Special have been on the rise. However, Gray's noticed that customers are sizing down even further: Even more people have been ordering up the $5 one-dog-and-drink Local Special (which was launched in 2018).
    


            But there's a negative correlation element also at play: declining activity at Rachael Gray's architecture practice.
    


            “My architectural practice has slowed down, and Gray's is picking up in terms of the number of tickets,” she said, adding that dynamic was often noted by her husband and Gray's Papaya founder, Nicholas Gray, who passed away in 2023.
    


            “When Nick was alive, he would always say, ‘If we're going into a recession, you're going to slow down and Gray's will carry us; and then in good times, it's the other way around,'” she added.
    


            In this age of Amazon, packages promptly appear on doorsteps following a mere click of a button or a vocal cue. The discards fill recycling bins to the brim and clutter closets, basements and hallways. 



            Now, the seemingly unfathomable part: Cardboard box shipments are at a decade low, and producers of the ubiquitous products are cutting production and laying off employees.
    


            About 9% of domestic box production capacity is set to shut down, which is the steepest retraction for the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, Virginia Tech economist Jadrian Wooten wrote earlier this month.
    


            “What does this mean for the rest of us? If we're to assume that cardboard boxes are a leading indicator, it could be a bad sign of what's ahead,” Wooten wrote. “If they're cutting back on capacity, it likely comes as a response to fewer orders. That would suggest weaker demand in the broader economy. If shipments keep falling, other indicators like GDP or unemployment may eventually catch up.”
    


            While not all of the slowdown in box production can be attributable to falling demand for goods, the slump is present in other areas of the freight economy, said Adam Josephson, a longtime paper and packaging sell-side analyst who now authors an economics newsletter.
    


            The Cass Freight Index, which measures aggregate deliveries of freight across North America, is at its lowest level since the early stages of the pandemic, he said. Excluding the steep plunge in 2020, the index is at its lowest since 2010.
    


            “That ought to tell you something,” he said. “Whether you look at the trucking market, the box market, they tell you that there is a real problem here with goods demand that only seems to be getting worse.”
    


            Movie theaters have long been considered a countercyclical economic indicator, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, which tracks an array of media platforms, including the silver screen.
    


            “During the Great Depression, people went to the movies in huge numbers, so it does seem that the escapism and the respite from the real world that movie theaters provide has value as much today as it did 50 or even 100 years ago,” he told CNN. “While moviegoers are price-sensitive, going out to the movies is a relatively inexpensive way to be entertained outside of the home.”
    


            Through September 28, box office revenue is up 4.5% from this time last year, Comscore data shows.
    


            However, there are plenty of caveats that come with cinema data, and, oftentimes, it's the content that plays an outsized role in demand swings, Dergarabedian noted.
    


            “People see going to the movies as an affordable escape, but they're not just going to do it for the sake of going out of the house. They'll go if a movie looks compelling or if it has great word of mouth and/or great reviews,” he said.
    


            Another sky-is-blue datapoint: Spending on outdoor activities typically increases during the spring and summer months.
    


            However, since April, spending at campsites has spiked and was up 15% year over year in August, according to Bank of America card data. That's the strongest growth seen at campgrounds since early 2022 (when inflation was escalating).
    


            “Consumers may be trading airfare for fire pits, drawn by affordability and a wellness-focused vibe,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note last week.
    


            Recent months' data and company earnings reports show that Americans are putting an increasing share of their dollars toward essential areas — particularly health care, housing and insurance — as they pull back on other spending, former packaging analyst Josephson said.
    


            “As more of people's wallets go toward mandatory items, the less money they have to spend on discretionary items,” he said in an interview.
    


            People trade down, look for bargains and cut out some expenses.
    


            And when figurative financial belts are tightened, nonessential goods like snacks oftentimes land on the chopping block (which, in turn, could lead to literal belt-tightening).
    


            “We continue to see lower-income, lower/middle-income consumers stretched, strained, really controlling their spending,” Alex Miller, chief executive officer of Alimentation Couche-Tard, which operates convenience stores such as Circle K, said earlier this month during the company's most recent earnings call.
    


            Some of the world's largest makers of salty, savory and sweet treats have flagged weakness in their snack portfolio, Josephson said, adding that many of these companies had dramatically hiked their prices in recent years.
    


            “Coincidentally, their food volumes have been under constant pressure in recent quarters,” he said.
    


            The latest available Federal Reserve data on loan officers' lending practices showed that standards are getting tighter and credit is increasingly harder to obtain for consumers with lower scores.
    


            Those turned away are instead turning up at the local pawn shop.
    


            At EZCorp, which operates hundreds of EZPawn shops across the United States, the pawn loans outstanding and overall revenue hit record highs during the second quarter.
    


            “I think the liquidity tightening for more of the everyday American, they've got rising costs and reduced access to credit,” Timothy Jugmans, chief financial officer of EZCorp, told CNN. “The consumer that we are dealing with is coming up against it, with having to get some extra cash.”
    


            The pawns loans are typically pretty small, in the range of $200, Jugmans said. But that's sometimes enough to fill up the car with gas or pay that unexpected bill.
    


            “This business does well in all cycles,” he said. “In downturns, what we do see is that the loans grow a little bit quicker, but the sales margins do go on the lower end of the range we operate in. And, conversely, when consumers are feeling a bit more stable, the discretionary retail purchases increase, and so we make a little bit more money on the sales and a little bit less on the loans.”
    


            “But we're definitely seeing it on the loan side at the moment,” he said.

He performs under the name “Bad Bunny.” He has sold nearly 10 million records worldwide. He has nearly 50 million followers on Instagram. And he's not only a rapper but also an actor, most recently appearing in Happy Gilmore 2, one of Netflix's highest-grossing films ever. 

And now, Bad Bunny will perform at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara, California, in February. More than 125 million people will tune in to watch live. Even more will see clips of the performance on social media afterward. It is a life-changer for any artist to have that kind of exposure. 

IN FOCUS: WHY SCHUMER HAS TO SHUT IT DOWN

Bad Bunny is also a far-left activist. He announced earlier this year that he would no longer do concerts in the United States because of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which no longer allow for unfettered entry into the country to the tune of millions. He is also vehemently against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agents who are expelling violent criminals from the country.

“Look, those motherf****** [ICE] are in these cars, RAV-4s. They're here in Pontezuela,” Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, raged recently.

Among those arrested by ICE in Puerto Rico is Maykel Negrín Núñez, who had been charged with homicide, violations of gun laws, illegal transportation of firearms, and spousal abuse. 

Bad Bunny apparently takes issue with Núñez being detained. 

He also announced he would no longer perform on the U.S. mainland due to ICE having the audacity to do its job outside his concerts.

“There was the issue of — like, f****** ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about,” he said in an interview earlier this year. 

What changed about Bad Bunny's staunch principle around not performing in America anymore? He has agreed to be the featured act during the Super Bowl in Santa Clara in February. Is he making an exception because he'll be watched by more than 100 million people live?

“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself. It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

It appears money can buy happiness. 

What exactly is the National Football League thinking here? Does Commissioner Roger Goodell even know who Bad Bunny is? Could he identify even one of his songs? 

The answers are likely no and no. But it's not Goodell who makes the decision here, but rapper and businessman Jay-Z, to whom the NFL outsources the halftime show decision-making process. As for Goodell, he likely just rubber stamps the selection. 

“What Benito has done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world's biggest stage,” Jay-Z said in a statement. 

Yes, there's nothing more inspiring than hiring someone who hates federal agents expelling the worst elements of society back to their homelands. Totally. 

As every dishonest broker in the illegal immigration debate does, Bad Bunny purposely conflates illegal immigration with legal immigration. In one music video, he hires a Trump impersonator to apologize to the “immigrants of America.” 

“I made a mistake,” the voice says to a group of Latinos huddled around a radio listening to the faux-Trump. “I want to apologize to the immigrants in America. I mean the United States, I know America is the whole continent. I want to say that this country is nothing without the immigrants. This country is nothing without Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans, Cubans—” it continues before the group shuts off the radio in disbelief before walking away. 

Again, for the billionth time, Trump is not anti-immigrant. He's literally married to one. 

“Legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways,” Trump said in a State of the Union Address, among dozens of other times. “I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”

And that's the trick: They have to come in legally. And if they enter the U.S. illegally and commit crimes, they'll be the first to be deported. Voters overwhelmingly approve of this. Per Pew Research, 97% of Americans support deporting illegal immigrants who have committed violent crimes. In the same poll, just 37% of voters are against deporting all of those here illegally, regardless of their criminal record. 

Mr. Bunny is in that 37% opposition. 

They say that rock ‘n' roll is here to stay. But it is clearly no longer welcome at the Super Bowl. In fact, with the addition of Bad Bunny in 2026, you have to go back 16 years to find the last rock band that performed on America's biggest stage (The Who in 2010). Over the years, the NFL was smart enough to bring in not only rock's biggest performers but also country and pop stars and rappers, including the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, in 1993.

Just days before Election Day 2024, after a comedian almost no one has ever heard of (Tony Hinchiffe) told a joke about Puerto Rico at a Trump rally, Bad Bunny voiced his support for former Vice President Kamala Harris, winning him plaudits from the legacy news media.

“Who won the day? Bad Bunny,” Politico declared on Oct. 29, “Bad Bunny won the day because he elevated the celebrity endorsement in a way that spoke to a specific community at a crucial moment in the race.” 

“It has the potential to help turn this into one of the more important moments in Puerto Rican and mainland politics in decades for the five million U.S. citizens identifying as Puerto Rican who live here — including half a million in battleground Pennsylvania,” it adds. 

My goodness, this is 31 flavors of delusion. When is the legacy media going to get it through their heads that celebrity endorsements don't matter?

Harris paid millions of dollars to the likes of Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Eminem, and Lady Gaga, among many others, to have them perform during her rallies. And all that got her were zero wins in swing states while losing the popular vote. The same goes for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she also went the “people totally vote because a celebrity told them to vote a certain way” route and lost a race many believed she could never lose. 

Bad Bunny — at least for now, unless the NFL comes to their senses — will perform the Super Bowl 60 halftime show. 

The NFL has produced record-breaking ratings and thrilling games to start the season. 

But by doing this, it is begging a large chunk of the country to publicly denounce its product again in the same way it did when it welcomed Black Lives Matter with open arms. 

OPINION: THE HUGE DEAL TRUMP COULD MAKE TO LOWER ENERGY PRICES

Goodell has sacked himself and the league here. 

And for no good reason.

Many used to worry about China's power over the app — but American control is troubling, too.

TikTok is not just the most downloaded app in the world; it's the most powerful information platform on the planet.

The app is also a political flashpoint. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company under the shadow of Beijing. For years, US lawmakers have tried to rein it in, either by banning it outright or forcing a sale to American investors. Now, with Donald Trump back in office, that fight has entered a new phase that could reshape the social media landscape. Last week, Trump signed an executive order approving the creation of a new entity — TikTok US — that would allow the app to remain available in America despite the “ban” that Congress passed in 2024. Trump's allies — Larry Ellison (the CEO of Oracle), Michael Dell (of Dell Technologies), and the Murdochs — will reportedly be involved in running the new company. China still has to approve the deal.

Emily Baker-White is a senior writer at Forbes and the author of Every Screen on the Planet: The War Over TikTok. Her reporting exposed how ByteDance employees accessed American users' data and how TikTok's internal systems gave the company enormous influence over what we see.

I invited Baker-White onto The Gray Area to talk about the latest news in the potential US-China TikTok deal, how Washington and Beijing are playing this game, and why the app has become a cultural superpower. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

TikTok isn't just another social platform. Why is it so addictive?

TikTok's founder, Zhang Yiming, believed information could find people better than people could find information. On older platforms, you followed accounts and searched for things. On TikTok, you open the app and it just goes. It watches how long you linger, how you interact, and the experience is so frictionless that it figures you out while you do nothing.

And it's designed to take away agency — it feeds you what you'll want without you asking.

Exactly. And it's sneaky because we like it. If we didn't, we wouldn't use it. We're giving up agency without noticing, because the product is pleasant.

Is part of the pleasure not having to think?

Decision fatigue is real. You didn't used to have to do anything in the checkout line. You could just stand there and be a person waiting your turn. Now you can't just, you know, raw dog the checkout line. When did that become intolerable? When did we have to be doing something in every tiny pause of daily life?

TikTok's For You feed is a prediction machine based on revealed preferences, not what we say we like. How does that change user psychology? Which content thrives, compared with Facebook/Instagram/X?

TikTok helped lead a broader shift: We now see far less from people we actually know and far more from professional creators. That's true on TikTok and, increasingly, on Instagram and Facebook. It's as much like Netflix as OG Facebook — people don't go there to see friends.

I held out for a long time but finally experimented with TikTok for this interview. It's pure, uncut social media heroin. From the second you log on, you can see it learning your mind, predicting what you want, and feeding you the perfect digital drug designed just for you.

Most people who've tried it agree — and Instagram Reels knows it.

Let's talk moderation. We've discussed the algorithm; what's the human role at TikTok?

Today it's similar to other big UGC [user-generated content] platforms. Algorithms flag likely violations; large teams of human moderators enforce rules and tune those systems. Policies in the US now look broadly like competitors'. Early on, it was different — more “Chinese” policy defaults that were later “Westernized.” One distinctive piece is the internal heating tool.

“Remember, you're making fewer choices about what to see. That means you're ceding more control over your information diet to a faceless machine — and the people who build and govern it.”

The heating button — what is it?

It lets certain staff give a video a fixed number of impressions — 5,000, 50,000, 5 million — overriding the recommender. That initial shove often triggers further organic growth. Early on, many people had access. Humans used it to teach the system what “good” looked like when the algo was still rough. Marketing later used it to woo creators and partners. TikTok eventually restricted access and wrote stricter policies, but misuse did happen — and with a tool like that, some misuse likely persists.

Other platforms boost and demote content too. What makes this different?

Everyone tunes distribution. What stood out here was how explicit, granular, and widely available the “big red button” was — at least historically. (If folks at other platforms have similar tools, my Signal is open.)

How do you see TikTok's cultural and political force compared with Facebook and Twitter?

Facebook and Instagram are more comparable in size, and YouTube is enormous. But TikTok is really, really big — on the order of a 2019 or 2020 Facebook, if not bigger. And remember, you're making fewer choices about what to see. That means you're ceding more control over your information diet to a faceless machine — and the people who build and govern it.

How much control does Beijing have over TikTok? Or is “leverage” the better word?

Leverage. In China, authorities can coerce employees — “do this or else” — including by threatening family. If a China-based ByteDance/TikTok employee can access US data or influence ranking, the state could compel them. That capability is the concern. There's limited public evidence they've exercised it extensively — capability does not equal action — but the leverage is real as long as China-based staff exist with relevant access.

Is there evidence China has used TikTok as an ideological weapon?

In the US, I've seen no public evidence of PRC manipulation of discourse via TikTok. Years ago, TikTok had restrictive policies around China topics; those changed. There's classified material — referenced obliquely in TikTok's court filings — that US officials say involves manipulation abroad, but I haven't seen it.

ByteDance's answer to America's ban on TikTok was Project Texas — walling off US data under Oracle. How did that go?

Conceptually, “driver carries no cash”: [The US] cut China-side access [to Oracle] so coercion can't yield US data. They spent billions trying to bifurcate. But there are hundreds of internal tools and data pipes; closing every last pathway is Sisyphean. They got far, but the “last mile” is hard to guarantee. The US eventually doubted a solution, short of full separation, would be foolproof.

What made that technical challenge so daunting in practice?

If you've ever worked inside a big tech company, you know how many internal tools there are and how much they talk to each other. TikTok is propped up by hundreds of them. The consumer app you see sits on top of 500 internal apps. Cutting off data flows across all of them was a maze-like, Sisyphean task. They closed most pathways, but the last mile was nearly impossible.

Walk me through the policy saga.

Trump first tried to ban [TikTok], then to force a sale; he used the wrong legal mechanism and lost in court. Biden's team negotiated Project Texas for about 2 years, then pivoted to “sell or be banned,” pushing Congress to pass a law. ByteDance challenged; the case went to SCOTUS, which upheld the law. On the eve of [Trump's second] inauguration, TikTok briefly “flickered” off; after taking office, Trump ordered DOJ not to enforce the law. TikTok has lived in that purgatory since.

And TikTok publicly thanked Trump for “saving” it.

Quite a turn from their early “Donald Trump isn't on TikTok — download now” ads.

After all your reporting, how do you feel about TikTok now?

Personally, I hate autoplay video — on any platform. I downloaded TikTok to report on it; cute animals aside, I'm not a natural video consumer. That probably saved me from addiction.

You end the book noting Zhang Yiming is already moving on to AGI (artificial general intelligence). That seems…interesting.

He's a builder. TikTok's hard problems are largely solved; generative AI is the next frontier. The TikTok story isn't about AI, but the core questions — agency, control, who steers your reality — are the same.

When you think about an algorithm, replace the word with a guy named Bob. If Bob shouldn't be fixing prices across industries, an algorithm shouldn't either. If Bob shouldn't have access to everyone's Social Security numbers, neither should an algorithm. Algorithms are made by people, for people's interests — and when we forget that, we give them far too much power.

We don't usually do addendums, but the legal future of TikTok might have changed after we spoke. What do we know now?

More than before, but details are thin. Both the US and Chinese sides say they've made progress. Trump is calling it a deal and extended non-enforcement of the ban law. Reporting suggests he'll sign an order declaring the deal meets last year's statute — he has wide latitude there. The prospective US buyers/overseers include Oracle (already TikTok's cloud/TTP), Andreessen Horowitz, and possibly the Murdochs. Terms — and who gets what power — remain unclear.

Are there contours of the deal we do know?

Both sides say ByteDance keeps ownership of the recommender algorithm; US TikTok would license it. “License” can range from “do whatever you want” to heavily restricted. How open it is will determine real separation. You'll also see the word “lease”; the label matters less than the control terms.

Oracle says it will “retrain the algorithm from the ground up.” What could that mean?

Models are only as good as their training data. TikTok's was built over years on vast, mixed corpora (including scraped public web). Will ByteDance hand over those corpora? Do they still have them? If the new owners can't replicate inputs, users may notice “new TikTok” isn't as good — which is a business risk.

Will Oracle keep American users' data walled off from China?

Likely similar to today's TikTok US Data Security setup: new US user data housed in Oracle-controlled TTP, [trusted technology partner] walled from ByteDance. The draft deal would formalize and continue that.

What do the new US stakeholders get besides a shit ton of money?

Money is plenty. But there's also influence over speech rules: bullying/hate policies, moderation posture, priority signals. Many on the left see this as handing a massive speech platform to Trump allies. Savvy owners won't overtly politicize fast — that's bad business (just look at what happened to Twitter/X). But ownership ultimately steers policy.

Well, it does appear to be Trump handing it over to his powerful political allies. People like Larry Ellison of Oracle, Marc Andreessen, the Murdochs of Fox News — they're all involved in this potential deal and it has a whiff of corruption. Am I missing something here?

I don't think that's wrong. If the Soros group wanted in, or Warren Buffett, I'm not at all sure Trump would be interested in making that happen. You're looking at a president who has involved himself in the private sector, and in private deals, far more than any president in recent history.

He's delivering an organ of speech to his allies — to people he believes will use it in ways he approves of. It's a very weird deal. When I think about the law Congress passed, in a way they were trying to curtail presidential authority, but the way it was written still gave an immense amount of power to the president. And I think a lot of the people who passed it didn't imagine a president so willing to engage in naked self-dealing.

If they had, they might have written it differently. That's just true — I don't think many would have done it this way if they'd foreseen the moment we're in now.

How much better is this arrangement than Beijing controlling TikTok?

The book's “authoritarian shakedown” concern was always the foil to a state that can't do that. We're now watching a US executive attempt to shape distribution and punish critics. We're about to find out which is “better,” but the CCP-like tactics are worrying.

HEGSETH'S BIG DAY: Speculation has run wild over the past week, ever since War Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an unprecedented, mandatory, and in-person meeting of almost all of the U.S. military's “GOFOs” — Pentagon speak for general and flag officers — at the U.S. Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, just south of Washington D.C.

The highly unusual gathering, and the fact that the participants have been kept in the dark about what it's all about, have sparked numerous rumors, from Hegseth announcing a radical restructuring of the combatant commands to fears that senior officers will have to sign a loyalty pledge.

Hegseth has revealed little, but appeared to scoff on social media when former U.S. Army in Europe commander retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges noted on X that in 1935, German generals were summoned to a meeting to pledge loyalty to Adolf Hitler. “Cool story, General,” Hegseth responded.

Hegseth is scheduled to speak at 8:15 a.m., followed by President Donald Trump at 9 a.m. The meeting is not classified. Reporters have been allowed to attend, and the remarks will be streamed live on the Pentagon's website.

Trump has said the gathering is just about “esprit de corps,” a chance to “tell the generals that we love them, they're cherished leaders, to be strong, be tough and be smart and be compassionate.”

“That's all that is, esprit de corps. It's about time somebody did that.” 

“Another possibility is that Hegseth has decided that his schemes for reorganizing the U.S. military just aren't being taken seriously enough,” wrote Tom Nichols in the Atlantic. “Hegseth has been getting resistance to his push to reshape several military commands, so he may be trying to announce new structures as a fait accompli and then order the officers — who would have to draw up the actual plans — to make them happen.”

“Hegseth surely knows that they can still slow-roll his ideas into oblivion, and he may have called this meeting because he somehow thinks he has enough force of personality to stare down some 800 men and women who were officers when he was still in high school,” writes Nichols, a retired professor at the U.S. Naval War College.

THE NEW DEFENSE STRATEGY: While Hegseth has hinted he'll talk about his favorite subject, “warrior ethos” and “lethality of the force,” the meeting comes as there is growing concern among some in the upper ranks about Pentagon's new defense strategy, which shifts the primary U.S. military focus from countering China to protecting the homeland, including missions formerly the purview of law enforcement.

The official National Defense Strategy document is now in draft form and undergoing final edits, according to the Washington Post. The draft has been shared widely with military leaders from the global combatant commands to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“People familiar with the editing process, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive deliberations, described a growing sense of frustration with a plan they consider myopic and potentially irrelevant, given the president's highly personal and sometimes contradictory approach to foreign policy,” the Post reported.

“Secretary Hegseth has tasked the development of a National Defense Strategy that is laser focused on advancing President Trump's commonsense America First, Peace Through Strength agenda,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell told the newspaper in a statement. “This process is still ongoing.”

HAPPENING TODAY: COUNTDOWN TO SHUTDOWN: With neither side giving an inch, the country is on the brink of the first government shutdown in seven years, and Democrats and Republicans are adamant that the other side is to blame. The deadline is midnight tonight, and no one is blinking, yet.

“We have very large differences. Their bill has not one iota of democratic input. That is never how we've done this before. Significant and meaningful differences remain,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after top House and Senate leaders met with President Donald Trump at the White House yesterday afternoon. “It's now in the president's hands,” Schumer said. “He can avoid the shutdown if he gets the Republican leaders to go along with what we want.”

“The problem is that Chuck Schumer and Leader Jeffries refused to acknowledge the simple facts,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) after the meeting. “By way of review, the House is getting back to the way the regular appropriations process is supposed to work, 12 separate appropriations bills passed through the House Appropriations Committee, three off the floor. The Senate is doing their work as well.”

“All this is happening in bipartisan fashion. The problem is we've run out of clock. September 30th is the end of the fiscal year, so we need a little more time. So, what we did in the Republican majority is the right, responsible, simple thing. A clean continuing resolution, a short-term nonpartisan continuing resolution,” Johnson said. “Now, there's a reason that Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have come out here stomping their feet, saying that they can't go along with this. They're trying to bring in extraneous issues. They issued a counterproposal. You should go take a look at what they requested, $1.5 trillion in new spending that is unrelated to the ongoing appropriations process.”

“This is not simply a negotiating tactic. This relates to the well-being and the health of the American people. More than 20 million Americans are on the verge of experiencing increased healthcare costs because of the Republican refusal to address the Affordable Care Act Tax Credits that benefit working-class Americans,” said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) on CNN. “We are ready to find a bipartisan agreement. But that bipartisan agreement needs to address the healthcare crisis.”

“If they want to talk about how to fix American healthcare policy, let's do it. The speaker would love to do it. The Senate majority leader would love to do it. Let's work on it together,” said Vice President JD Vance. “But let's do it in the context of an open government that's providing essential services to the American people. That's all that we're proposing to do.”

Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and would need at least eight Democratic votes to pass the bill with 60 votes, since Republican Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has suggested he will vote against it. The only Democrat to say he'll vote for the short-term funding extension is Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA).

The Pentagon's contingency plan for a shutdown calls for “only the minimum number of civilian employees necessary to carry out excepted activities” to be exempted from being furloughed.

SENATE VOTES AGAINST PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO PREVENT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

PUTIN: ‘WE FIGHT AND PREVAIL': In a video message translated on the Kremlin's official website, Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a defiant tone as he celebrated the illegal annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts he does not fully control.

“I extend my heartfelt congratulations on this holiday, the Day of Reunification of the Donetsk and Lugansk people's republics, and the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions with our large, united country,” Putin said. “We did what had to be done, and we are proud of it.”

“We fight and prevail, safeguarding our vital national interests, our common memory and values, the Russian language, traditions, culture and faith,” Putin said. “We will overcome every trial and emerge even stronger.”

In a Truth Social post last week, President Trump said Russia has been “fighting aimlessly,” making it look like “a paper tiger.” In a meeting with the Turkish president, Trump said, “With all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land. Think of that: They've gained almost no land. And I'm not going to ever call anybody a paper tiger, but Russia's spent millions and millions of dollars in bombs, missiles, ammunition, and lives, their lives, and they've gained virtually no land.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she'd committed fraud. 

The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made “whole-dollar” purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.

The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.

An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued — and won. 

“It is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,” Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.

Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people's food benefits. 

Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had “trafficked,” or sold, their benefits.

Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.




In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.

Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.

Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, “I'm not saying that folks didn't do it, didn't commit the fraud, but I don't think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.”

Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they're asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that's generally a one-year SNAP ban. They're also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.

Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for “trafficking” or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.

The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.

Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants' denial or lack of response — and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.

Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that “we have never” brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.

In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations “and patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.” She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data — which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.

Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data. 

The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become “overly politicized.” The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.

In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky's rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by. 

“The people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,” Dodds said. “It's our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.”

The cabinet denied KPR's request for case notes on individual fraud accusations starting in early 2024 that would include the evidence used in the accusations. But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.

National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn't unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases — not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said. 

He's studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals. 

In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she'd checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times. 

She lost her SNAP benefits for a year. In an appeal, the woman told the state she has two kids and had recently discovered she was pregnant.

“Everyone forgets to get something and has to go back in the store and get it,” she wrote, defending her back-to-back purchases.

She received another hearing, but the outcome didn't change.

Cabinet officials acknowledged in cross examinations during a 2023 case that back-to-back transactions and whole-dollar purchases aren't forbidden under SNAP rules, nor are recipients told that the cabinet considers them suspicious.

But all of these things are used as evidence — sometimes the sole evidence — that a person misused their benefits.

Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they've declined in the last year. 

“There have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,” Goff said. “There are no receipts, there's no video footage to show that someone's doing anything wrong. It's just a number written on a paper.”

While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations. 

In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.

In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business — or person — fraudulently used SNAP benefits.

Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky. 

He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.

“There are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,” Dodds said. “There was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ... But cases with non-transactional data are exceedingly rare.”

Women in Gaza promised food, money or work in exchange for sexual interactions, AP explains

After weeks of scraping by to feed her six children in Gaza, the 38-year-old woman thought she'd found a lifeline.

At a shelter, a friend told her about a man who could help with food, aid, maybe even a job. The woman — separated from her husband, and forced to shutter the business that once kept the family afloat — approached him. 

It was about a month into the war in Gaza, she said, and he promised her work, a six-month contract with an aid agency. On the day she believed she'd sign the paperwork, he drove her not to an office but to an empty apartment. He complimented her, she said, and told her to remove her headscarf.

He told her he loved her and wouldn't force her, she said, but he also wouldn't let her leave. Eventually, they had a sexual encounter, she said. She declined to give details of the nature of their interaction, saying she felt fear and shame. 

“I had to play along because I was scared, I wanted out of this place,” the woman said. 

Before she left, she said, he handed her some money — 100 shekels, about $30. Two weeks later, he gave her a box of medicine and a box of food. But for weeks, the job didn't materialize.




As Gaza's humanitarian crisis grows, women say they have been exploited by local men — some associated with aid groups — promising food, money, water, supplies or work in exchange for sexual interactions. Six women detailed their experiences to The Associated Press, each speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from their families or the men and because sexual harassment and assault are considered taboo topics. Sometimes, they said, the men's solicitation was blatant: “Let me touch you,” one woman recalled being told. Other times, it was culturally coded: “I want to marry you,” or “Let's go together somewhere.”

Aid groups and experts say exploitation often arises during conflicts and other times of desperation, particularly when people are displaced and reliant on assistance. Reports of abuse and exploitation have emerged during emergencies in South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Congo, Chad and Haiti.

“It's a horrible reality that humanitarian crises make people vulnerable in many ways — increased sexual violence is often a consequence,” said Heather Barr, associate director for the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch. “The situation in Gaza today is unspeakable, especially for women and girls.” 

Four psychologists working with women in Gaza described patients' accounts to AP. One said her organization — focused on protecting women and children — treated dozens of cases involving men sexually exploiting vulnerable women, including some in which they became pregnant. The psychologists, all Palestinians working for local organizations in Gaza, spoke on condition of anonymity because of privacy concerns for the women involved and the sensitive nature of the cases, in a conservative culture where sex outside of marriage in any context is seen as a grave offense. They said none of their patients wanted to speak with AP directly.

Five of the women who shared their stories with AP said they did not engage in sexual interaction with the men. The psychologists said some women who came to them agreed to the men's demands, while others refused.

Six human rights and relief organizations — including the local Palestinian group the Women's Affairs Center and the Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse network, which coordinates with various aid groups including United Nations agencies — told AP they were aware of reports of sexual abuse and exploitation linked to receiving aid. 

Aid groups say the context in Gaza — nearly two years of war, the displacement of at least 90% of the population, and turmoil over aid access — has made humanitarian work for vulnerable people particularly challenging. As hunger and desperation grow across the enclave, women in particular say they've been pushed to make impossible decisions. 

The groups blame Israel's offensive and blockade for the humanitarian crisis and say the war has made documenting exploitation cases difficult. More than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The ministry does not say how many of those killed were civilians or combatants, but it says women and children make up around half the fatalities. 

“Israel's siege on the Gaza Strip and the restrictions on humanitarian aid are what's forcing women to resort to this,” said Amal Syam, director of the Women's Affairs Center.

Israel says there are no restrictions on aid and that it has taken steps to expand what comes into Gaza. Israel also accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid — without providing evidence of widespread diversion — and blames U.N. agencies for failing to deliver food it has allowed in. The U.N denies there is widespread aid diversion.

One of the women who spoke to AP described phone calls that began in October, a year into the war. At first, she said, the man's questions were simple. What happened to her husband? How many children did they have? But, the 35-year-old widow said, his tone took a turn. What underwear was she wearing? How did her husband please her?

She said she'd met the man in Muwasi, a strip of land Israel designated a humanitarian zone. She described standing in line to get assistance and giving her phone number to an aid worker — a Palestinian in a uniform labeled UNRWA, or the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. 

Shortly after he took her number, the late-night calls began. He would ask sexual questions, she said, and she'd stay silent. She said that at one point, he asked to come to her, for sex. She refused, and after nearly a dozen calls but no aid, she blocked his number, she added.

The woman said she reported him to UNRWA in Gaza in a verbal complaint. She said she was told she needed a recording of the conversations as proof, but she had an old phone that couldn't record calls.

UNRWA communications director Juliette Touma said via email that the agency has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual exploitation, takes each report seriously, and doesn't require proof. But she wouldn't say whether staff were aware of this particular incident, citing UNRWA's policy against discussing individual cases, and wouldn't comment further on its awareness or work on exploitation cases overall. 

The PSEA network — to which UNRWA belongs — said survivors can report anonymously or without naming the perpetrator and are never required to provide proof. 

Understanding the scale of exploitation is challenging, said Sarah Achiro, a coordinator for the network, which works to prevent, and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian and development settings. Gaza's limited connectivity restricts calls that could report abuse, and constant displacement makes it harder for survivors to seek in-person help and for aid groups to build trust.

Achiro noted that sexual violence is vastly underreported, particularly in humanitarian and conflict settings, where data often shows just “the tip of the iceberg.”

The PSEA network said that last year, it received 18 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation linked to receiving humanitarian aid in Gaza, all involving either aid workers or those associated with it, such as community representatives or private contractors. Allegations against aid workers are investigated by the employer organization. The network wouldn't indicate how many of the cases were being investigated, saying it can't disclose information unless they are formally concluded.

Four of the women who spoke to AP said the men who solicited them identified themselves as aid workers, and, in one case, a community leader promising aid.

Like the widow, several women said it happened while registering or trying to register for aid, with men taking their numbers — frequently a step in the aid process — and later calling. The women said all the men were Palestinian. Several said they weren't able to identify which aid group the men seemed to be associated with. 

The U.N. and aid groups generally work with local communities: paying people as contractors, using volunteers, or having leaders appointed by the community as liaisons.

The mother of six said the man who promised her a job drove a car with U.N. markings. After their interaction, she said, the messages kept coming — late-night sexual calls and requests for photos. She described dodging them with excuses: She was busy, her phone was broken, she couldn't talk.

But about a month after their sexual interaction, she saw the man at an aid site, in December 2023. He then helped her get a six-month position with UNRWA, which she completed, she said.

 She told AP she never reported the man, their encounter or his exploitation attempts. 

“I told myself that no one would believe it,” she said. “Maybe they would say I am only saying this so that they would give me a job.” 

Asked about the woman's story, UNRWA's Touma emphasized the organization's zero-tolerance policy and said it would seek more information on the exploitation incidents and accusations.

Since the interaction and her job, the woman has been displaced, doesn't have work and struggles to feed her family. She said she blocked the man's number but he's tried to contact her as recently as this summer.

Some women say they've been solicited multiple times, by various men throughout the war. 

A 37-year-old mother of four told AP she was approached twice, once by the head of a shelter. She said the man offered food and shelter if they could “go together somewhere,” like the sea. She said she understood he was asking for something sexual. She refused. 

Psychologists and women's groups said cases have increased as the crisis worsened — with more people displaced, reliant on aid, and crammed into camps. One psychologist said some women were kicked out when their husbands learned what happened. 

Before the war, exploitation reports happened once or twice a year, but are up dramatically, said Syam, of the Women's Affairs Center. But she said many organizations won't highlight the numbers or the issue. 

“Most of us prefer to keep the focus on the violence and violations committed by the Israeli occupation,” Syam said. 

Israel says it is fighting to dismantle Hamas and release the hostages taken in the 2023 attack that sparked the war, and that it mitigates civilian harm as much as possible. 

The women who spoke to AP said it's important to try to hold on to their dignity as the war continues. 

For weeks last fall, a 29-year-old mother said she received calls from an aid worker asking her to marry him in exchange for nutritional supplements for her four children. 

She refused and blocked his number, she said, but he called from different phones. He insisted he liked her and made distasteful comments that she called too vulgar to repeat. 

“I felt completely humiliated,” she said. “I had to go and ask for help for my children. If I didn't do it, who would?”

OpenAI is debuting what it bills as its most advanced video generation model yet, alongside a new iOS app designed to bring artificial intelligence-powered video creation to everyday users.

The Sora 2.0 model builds on an earlier version released this year as a research preview. OpenAI said the new release represents a major leap in physical realism, audio-video synchronization, and multi-shot storytelling.

The new app, which is also called Sora, is invite-only to start with and will let users create, remix, and cameo in AI-generated videos using text or images with built-in controls for safety, likeness, and provenance.

The rollout is already raising concerns around intellectual property rules. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that OpenAI is notifying studios and talent agencies that, unless they explicitly opt out, their copyrighted material may be reflected in Sora-generated content.

OpenAI says its approach builds on existing content policies used for its image generation tools. 

The company views this style of engagement, where users remix or reference familiar fictional worlds, as a form of fan expression and creative play. 

Executives said they've seen strong user interest in using AI to interact with stories and characters they love, and they believe Sora introduces new ways for people to engage with those fictional universes.

OpenAI has also drawn a clear line between copyrighted IP and individual likeness. 

While characters or visual styles from popular franchises may appear unless blocked, individuals cannot be generated at all — via prompt or image — unless they've submitted a verified cameo. 

The policy is intended to give people full control over how, when, and whether they appear in any AI-generated content.

The app rolls out Tuesday in the U.S. and Canada with an invite-only system. A Pro version, web access, and developer API are all coming soon.

DETROIT – Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said he expects demand for all-electric vehicles to be slashed in half next month following the end of federal tax incentives on Wednesday.

Farley on Tuesday said he "wouldn't be surprised" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.

"I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tail pipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away," he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. "We're going to find out in a month. I wouldn't be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%."

Farley said the industry learned that "partial electrification," such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being.

Farley said his Model e EV team is analyzing the demand for non-gas-powered vehicles each day. The company currently offers a handful of all-electric vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning pickup, which can top $90,000, and Mustang Mach-E crossover in the U.S.

The federal EV incentives of up to $7,500 are coming to an end as part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV.

"Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They're fast, they're efficient, you don't go to the gas station, but they're expensive," Farley said. 

Once the bill was passed, sales of EVs quickly gained traction, especially as some automakers added even more discounts to move out older models.

Cox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share.

Cox and other industry analysts and executives expect many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset. 

Farley also said the federal changes mean the auto industry, including Ford, will have to adapt, saying the company will have to figure out what to do with its battery plants and EV capacity.

"We'll fill them, but it will be more stress, because we had a four-year predictable policy," Farley said. "Now the policy changed. ... We all have to make adjustments, and it's going to be good for the country, I believe, but it will be one more stress."

Slight tweak: Farley was speaking Tuesday at the automaker's "Ford Pro Accelerate" event, which features executives from many industries as well as public officials discussing the "essential economy" and need for skilled labor and education.

When Starbucks announced on Thursday that it would shutter more than 100 coffeehouse locations across North America, the company didn't publicly specify which stores would close.

So, Business Insider has begun creating a list compiled from accounts from affected in-store staff members, reporter visits, and verification through the Starbucks "store locator" feature. While incomplete, it begins to show which neighborhoods and states are most affected by the closures.

When reached for comment by Business Insider, Starbucks pointed to a message it's sending its customers about the store closures: "We know this isn't just any store to customers. It's their coffeehouse, a place woven into their daily rhythm, where memories were made, and where meaningful connections with our partners grew over the years. We're deeply grateful for the communities that have been built."

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek will step down from his position and move to the role of executive chairman, the company said Tuesday.

Spotify shares dipped 6% following the announcement.

Ek, who co-founded the streaming platform in 2006, will be replaced by current co-presidents and longtime executives Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström as co-CEOs, the company said in a release. The transition will happen Jan. 1, 2026.

"Over the last few years, I've turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav–who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase," Ek said in a release. "This change simply matches titles to how we already operate."

Ek said his new role will focus on steering the company's long-term strategy and providing support to its senior team.

"It's been an honor of a lifetime for me to be able to lead Spotify for close to 20 years," Ek said in an X post.

Ek, who now has a net worth of $9.8 billion according to Forbes, has led the streaming giant to its current market cap of $140 billion. 

Launched in 2008, Spotify now offers over 100 million tracks and boasts 696 million users and 276 million subscribers, up 11% and 12% respectively from a year ago.

The company said in its second-quarter earnings report that it expects to net add 14 million active users and five million net new Premium subscribers for the current quarter, even with the added price hike announced in August.

In September, prices increased to 11.99 euros (US $14.08) from 10.99 euros (US $12.90) for premium subscribers in markets including South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, the company said in a release.

The company reported total revenue of 4.19 billion euros in the second quarter, which was up 10% year over year but missed LSEG estimate of 4.26 billion euros. 

Questions were raised about its advertising business, with revenue down about 1% in the segment from a year ago.

Spotify has also been cracking down on artificial intelligence "slop" under the increasing threat of AI-generated music going viral. 

The streaming juggernaut cut 75 million AI spam tracks in the past 12 months and rolled out updated policies to protect against harmful AI use, the company said in a release last week.

Spotify shares are up 54% year-to-date.

The AI boom is a "bubble" driven by the "momentum" of soaring stocks like Nvidia, fund manager Bill Smead has said.

"Dogs chase cars, and people chase stocks," Smead Capital Management's founder and chief investor told Business Insider in an interview.

Nvidia shares have surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, supercharging the AI chipmaker's market value to an unprecedented $4.4 trillion.

Palantir shares have soared 28-fold over the same period, valuing the maker of AI-powered data-analysis software at around $420 billion.

"We're in the crazy stage," Smead said, giving the example of CoreWeave, which generated $1.2 billion of revenue last quarter but has a $60 billion market value. The AI cloud-computing company reported a $30 billion revenue backlog at the end of June, underpinned by an expanded agreement with key customer OpenAI.

"It is late '99," Smead said, referring to the period just before the dot-com bubble peaked in March 2000.

"This is, from a fundamental standpoint, identical to all the past major manias," Smead said. "We're bumping up against history real hard now."

Smead said the problem isn't whether AI companies realize the technology's potential benefits, but that "whatever success they might have has already been massively overcapitalized."

He said that "when this thing breaks," people will only be willing to buy AI stocks at a fraction of their current price.

Oracle stock jumped 40% in a day earlier this month after it forecast rapid revenue growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which caters to AI companies such as OpenAI.

But if it can rise so much in a day, then it can fall 40% in a day too, Smead said.

"That is going to be spooky," he said, adding that there were declines of that scale after the dot-com bubble burst at the turn of the millennium.

The value investor, who has 40-plus years of experience, said he was worried about the "incredibly unusual," close incestuous relationship between major AI companies. Nvidia recently agreed to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI to help the ChatGPT maker finance its buildout of AI data centers powered by Nvidia chips.

Smead said he's "extremely concerned" that so many people have so much of their savings in the Big Tech stocks, because if they come crashing down, the financial fallout could be enormous.

"I'm watching people build $10, $20 million homes in my neighborhood in Paradise Valley, Arizona," Smead said. "If the market turns sour, and the tech stocks are crushed, that high-end homebuilding will stop."

However, he said investors shouldn't cash out of stocks entirely and wait for a crash as "you can't hold your breath until then."

Smead said his fund has mostly avoided tech stocks in favor of energy, homebuilding, healthcare, retail, and real estate investment trusts or REITs.

"We own a lot of meritorious companies in a lot of out-of-favor sectors," he said.

In this article

In 2023, Jamie Siminoff called up Amazon's former devices boss, Dave Limp, to say he was stepping down from leading the video doorbell company he sold to the e-commerce giant for $839 million in 2018.

Siminoff, who started Ring in 2013, said Limp and Amazon offered him the opportunity to work elsewhere at the company, but he declined.

"I said, 'I think I have to leave,'" Siminoff recalled in an interview on Friday. "I don't think I can be half in. I'm either all in or I'm all out."

He wasn't gone for long.

In April, Siminoff announced his return to Ring, replacing Liz Hamren, a former Microsoft and Discord executive whom Amazon had hired to succeed him. Now that he's back at the helm, Siminoff says he's restoring Ring's original mission, to "make neighborhoods safer."

And now his team has even more artificial intelligence technology at its disposal to supercharge those efforts.

Siminoff took the stage Tuesday at Amazon's annual hardware event in New York to debut new Ring cameras, along with a feature called Search Party that uses AI to identify potential matches in camera footage. It's aimed at "reuniting lost dogs" with their families, but Siminoff said there could be other applications in the future.

During Hamren's two-year tenure, Ring moved to adopt a softer, more whimsical image marked by silly videos of backyard animal encounters and family-friendly hijinks. It also removed a tool widely criticized by civil liberties and privacy advocates that let police request doorbell footage from users in its neighborhood watch app.

Siminoff, 48, said Ring's cameras have many uses, including keeping an eye on pets and loved ones. Siminoff is based in Los Angeles and has two dogs, a Belgian Malinois and a Chihuahua.

"I'm focused on: How can I get the highest density of camera coverage in a neighborhood matched with AI to make neighborhoods safer?" he said. "It's not just hard crime."

Ring is part of Amazon's vast devices and services division, which is overseen by Panos Panay, a former Microsoft hardware leader who joined the company in 2023. Beyond Ring, the unit spans Amazon's Zoox robotaxis, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices and Kuiper, the company's internet satellite service.

Ring's security cameras typically start at $50 and range in price depending on coverage. Users can also pay up to $20 a month for its subscription service that lets them continuously record and access more cloud storage, among other features.

Siminoff said a personal encounter with violence played a part in his return.

Several months earlier, Siminoff said he witnessed a shooting at a laundromat in South Central Los Angeles that left him feeling shaken.

"It was terrible," Siminoff said through tears. "Kids are crying, it's a whole f****** scene."

The incident reaffirmed his belief in Ring's mission and its potential to aid law enforcement officers when they "don't have time to go door to door," he said.

Those relationships with police have been controversial over the years.

Amazon claimed a Los Angeles Police Department pilot program in 2015 found that Ring's doorbells reduced burglaries in neighborhoods "by as much as 55%," according to a 2018 release. But reports from several outlets have disputed whether Ring cameras lead to a decrease in crime.

Privacy advocates have expressed concern that the company's cameras and accompanying Neighbors app have heightened the risk of racial profiling and turned residents into informants, with few guardrails around how law enforcement can use the material.

Siminoff, who said he's "pro public safety" and "backs the blue," said he felt some of the coverage of Ring's video-request feature for police was unfair or inaccurate.

"That's the stuff that irks me," Siminoff said, referring to the claim that Ring gives camera access to police.

"We allow them to request footage from people in a super privacy centric, anonymous way that keeps their privacy. But that's not a good headline," he added.

A few weeks after Siminoff's return, Ring reintroduced its community request tool through a partnership with Axon Enterprise, the maker of Tasers and police body cameras. Police can solicit footage from Ring cameras through Axon's online evidence management system, and users can choose whether or not to share it.

"I don't think we should be working directly with police," Siminoff said. "It's not the business we're in in any way."

Siminoff said Ring, which is profitable, is exploring other potential growth areas, such as security solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses.

Ring isn't currently exploring offering up its tech to a more homegrown customer — its sprawling parent company. At least when it comes to sticking its cameras in Amazon delivery vans or warehouses.

Siminoff has considered it, but "then you realize it's just a distraction," he said. "Amazon's so big you could probably do something for everything."

President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily sell its medications for less, as his administration pushes to link U.S. drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.

Pfizer has agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations, or what Trump calls the most-favored-nation price, according to the president. Pfizer will also guarantee the same "most-favored-nation" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers.

As part of the deal, Pfizer has also agreed to a three-year grace period during which the company's products won't face pharmaceutical-specific tariffs – as long as the drugmaker further invests in U.S. manufacturing. The company plans to invest $70 billion to reshore domestic drug manufacturing and research facilities.

Shares of Pfizer rose more than 4% on Tuesday after the announcement.

"Pfizer has agreed to provide some of the most popular current medications to our consumers at heavily discounted prices anywhere between 50% and even 100%," Trump said, adding that those drugs will be available for direct purchase at a discount online on a website the administration is calling TrumpRx.gov.

Trump said he's working with other drugmakers to secure similar agreements over the next week, adding that Pfizer is the first.

"If we don't make a deal, we're going to tariff them," he said of the other companies' drugs.

The deal comes as Pfizer and 16 other drugmakers face Trump's Monday deadline to take steps to lower drug prices, as outlined in letters from the president. Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the "most favored nation" policy, that aims to tie the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad. 

During the press conference, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the company satisfied all four of the requests Trump outlined in his letter. Among the other steps is pursuing tougher price negotiations abroad and adopting models that sell its medicines directly to consumers or businesses.

"The big winner clearly will be the American patients, there is no doubt," Bourla said. "They are the ones that will see a significant impact on their ability to buy medicines." But he said "American innovation and and the American economy" will also be "winners" with the agreement.

Pfizer said it will offer a large share of its primacy care treatments and certain specialty branded drugs at discounts of 50% on average and up to 85%, according to a release from the company.

In a separate statement Tuesday, Pfizer said more than 100 million patients are impacted by diseases those medicines treat, such as migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, menopause and atopic dermatitis.

The company provided examples of discounted drugs under TrumpRx.gov. Duavee, a treatment for certain menopause symptoms, will be available for as little as $30 on the site, which is an 85% discount to its current price.

Patients will also be able to pay as low as $162 – an 80% reduction to the current price – for prescription ointment Eucrisa, which is used to treat mild-to-moderate eczema. Tovias, a medication for overactive bladder, will also be available on TrumpRx.gov for as little as $42, which is a 85% discount to the current price.

Pfizer said it also plans to offer products such as Abrilada for autoimmune diseases at a 60% discount, Xeljanz for rheumatoid arthritis at a 40% discount and the migraine drug Zazvpret at 50% discount.

Those drugs don't appear to be significant revenue drivers for Pfizer. The company's quarterly and full-year earnings reports only include product-specific revenue for Xeljanz, which generated $349 million in worldwide sales in 2024. Sales of the drug fell 29% operationally from 2023, primarily due to lower demand globally as well as lower net prices in the U.S.

The deal comes as drugmakers brace for Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the country. Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday that the U.S. will impose a 100% tariff on "any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product" entering the country from Oct. 1.

The measure will not apply to companies building drug manufacturing plants in the U.S., Trump said. He added that the exemption covers projects where construction has started, including sites that have broken ground or are under construction.

In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the deal is positive for Pfizer's stock and the broader pharmaceutical sector, as it "adds certainty and shifts POTUS policies potentially away from Pharma tariffs."

"Today's deal seems to set a path for other pharmaceutical players to follow, allowing for headline pricing concessions and a Trump 'win' without more punitive implementation" of the most favored nation policy or tariffs, he added.

Consumer confidence edged lower in September ahead of an expected data blackout caused by the looming federal government shutdown, the Conference Board reported Tuesday.

The board's headline confidence index registered a 94.2 reading, off 3.6 points from the August reading and below the Dow Jones estimate for 96.0. The reading was the lowest since April and comes with nonessential government operations slated to close at midnight.

In addition to the weakness on the main reading, the "present situation" index hit its lowest in a year.

"Consumers' assessment of business conditions was much less positive than in recent months, while their appraisal of current job availability fell for the ninth straight month to reach a new multiyear low," said Stephanie Guichard, the organization's senior economist for global indicators.

Though the labor market has shown considerable weakness this year, employment availability in August was slightly better than the prior month.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in what could be its last data release until the spending impasse on Capitol Hill is resolved, said job openings totaled 7.23 million, up 19,000 from July though down 422,000, or 5.5%, from the same period a year ago.

The bureau's Job Openings and Labor Turnover report, which Federal Reserve officials watch closely to gauge labor market slack, showed a slower pace in both hiring and total separations. Quits fell by 75,000  for a category looked at as a gauge of worker confidence for finding new jobs after leaving their present one.

Labor market stability is an important consideration for the Fed as officials contemplate the next move for interest rates. Markets widely expect the central bank to lower its benchmark borrowing rate by half a percentage point by the end of the year, with cuts at the October and December meetings.

"My baseline outlook doesn't see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks," Boston Fed President Susan Collins said Tuesday. "In particular, I see some increased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and unwelcome increase in the unemployment rate."

Should the spending impasse be resolved by Friday, the BLS is expected to show payroll growth of 51,000 in September, following just 22,000 in August.

The Conference Board's report showed a growing divide in labor market perceptions.

The share of respondents indicating that jobs were "plentiful" slipped to 26.9%, down more than 3 percentage points from August, while the "hard to get" gauge held flat at 19.1%.

Also, the survey showed more pessimism about finances, as views on their current financial situation saw its biggest one-month drop since the question was asked in July 2022.

Your DoorDash deliverer could soon look a little different.

DoorDash on Tuesday announced a robot, known as Dot, that navigates busy streets, parking lots and sidewalks to bring customers their food.

Dot marks DoorDash's first official standalone push into autonomous vehicle technology. The company previously tested drone delivery and partnered with Sam Altman-backed startup Coco Robotics for sidewalk delivery.

"The scale and complexity of the business demands something like autonomy, and there isn't anything out there that fits our use case," DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang told CNBC.

Tang, who leads the DoorDash Labs automation and robotics unit, said Dot is a solution to increasingly complex deliveries, and attempts to open the technology to local merchants. The company said the robot can reach up to 20 miles per hour and carry up to six pizza boxes, or 30 pounds of items. 

Autonomous delivery is an emerging trend. Last week. Uber announced a food delivery partnership with Israeli drone startup Flytrex, and previously delivered food using self-driving Waymo cars.

DoorDash has been testing its robot in Phoenix, with plans to later expand to other metropolitan areas.  Dot is currently open to merchants in the Phoenix area through DoorDash's new autonomous delivery platform that also includes drone delivery where available.

Dot is equipped with eight cameras and three lidar sensors to navigate road scenarios like crowded parking lots, blocked bike lanes and busy streets. It also includes an internal camera to ensure food quality.

DoorDash also announced a smart scale feature that weighs order and detects any potential missing items. The company said its internal data suggests that the test product has slashed missing item complaints by up to 30%.

AI chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public exactly a year ago. The company has yet to take the plunge, but has now bought itself more time to stay private.

Cerebras said Tuesday that it's raised $1.1 billion in new funding at a valuation of $8.1 billion as it tries to take on Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, in the booming market of artificial intelligence chips.

In its IPO prospectus, Cerebras calls itself a designer of chips for training and running AI models, and the company has prioritized operating a cloud-based service that AI models can use to handle incoming queries.

Shortly after Cerebras filed for its initial public offering last September, the company faced public criticism that it was too reliant on a single Middle Eastern customer, G42. Cerebras hit a snag seeking clearance from the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, to give G42 a bigger position.

Despite the lengthy delay, private market investors are bullish enough to about double the company's valuation from $4 billion in 2021. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Feldman said in an interview that Cerebras still intends to go public.

"I don't think this is an indication of a preference for one or the other," he said. "I think we have tremendous opportunities in front of us, and I think it's good practice, when you have enormous opportunities, not to let them fall by the wayside for lack of capital."

Feldman told reporters in May that the startup aspired to go public in 2025.

There are plenty of high-valued AI companies raising large sums of money in the private market.

Databricks, a seller of data analytics software, recently said it was closing a $1 billion funding round with a valuation above $100 billion. OpenAI said last week that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the company as it builds out data centers, and Anthropic announced earlier in September that it raised $13 billion in funding at a $183 billion valuation.

Investors in Cerebras' funding round include 1789 Capital, Alpha Wave, Altimeter Capital, Atreides Management, Benchmark, Fidelity, Tiger Global and Valor Equity Partners.

"It was with investors who everybody would be proud of to have cornerstone your IPO," Feldman said. The new money will allow for an expansion in U.S. manufacturing, he said.

After Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing produces Cerebras' chip wafers, they're packaged in the U.S. As demand increases, Cerebras plans to hire more people to focus on production.

"We increased manufacturing capacity in the last 18 months 8x, and we are going to go another 4x in the next six or eight months," Feldman said.

Feldman declined to talk about recent financials. The company generated about $70 million in revenue in the second quarter of 2024, compared with less than $6 million in the period a year earlier.

This year Cerebras has discussed business that it's picked up from Hugging Face, Meta, Notion and Perplexity.

Shares of CoreWeave popped more than 13% on Tuesday after the company announced it has agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of artificial intelligence cloud infrastructure.

CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz as big tech companies and AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure. Tuesday's announcement comes just days after CoreWeave expanded its agreement with OpenAI by $6.5 billion, bringing the total contract to $22.4 billion.

"The agreement underscores that behind every AI breakthrough are the partnerships that make it possible," a CoreWeave spokesperson said in a statement about the Meta deal on Tuesday.

Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Bloomberg was first to report the deal.

CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a "neocloud," has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners.

Meta has the option to "materially expand its commitment" for additional computing capacity through 2032, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.

The social media company has been pouring tens of billions of dollars into AI in recent months in an effort to build out its AI infrastructure and bring in top talent.

Meta said during its second-quarter earnings call in July that it expects its total expenses for 2025 to fall between $114 billion and $118 billion, and the company expects its AI initiatives will "result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth."

In July, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Meta is on track to bring its first supercluster online next year, and it is building several others. A supercluster is a large, complex computing network that's housed within a data center.

One of those facilities, which Meta has named Hyperion, is expected to be large enough to cover "a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan," Zuckerberg said.

"Meta Superintelligence Labs will have industry-leading levels of compute and by far the greatest compute per researcher," Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.

The U.S. government was on track Tuesday to shut down at midnight as Republicans and Democrats in Congress both refused to budge from their opposing positions on a funding deal that could avoid that outcome.

Lawmakers took to the airwaves to blame each other for the looming shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box," said Democrats "need to come to their senses here, and do the right thing."

Johnson, R-La., said that top Democrats — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York — have "painted themselves into a corner" by making policy demands in exchange for passing a funding bill that would keep the government open for at least seven weeks.

Those demands, Johnson said, are irrelevant to the urgent need to pass that continuing resolution.

Democrats are insisting that any continuing resolution to keep the government funded in the near term include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.

Those credits, which lower the cost of health insurance premiums paid by millions of Americans who buy coverage on ACA exchanges, are due to expire at the end of 2025.

Johnson accused Democrats of trying to protect Schumer's "backside" by pressing that and other demands.

He said Schumer and other Democratic leaders were concerned that Schumer would become vulnerable to challenges to his position and House seat by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a leader of the party's progressive wing, if they did not hold firm against Republican demands for a "clean" continuing resolution without any provisions for health-care protections.

Johnson said a debate about how to reform the ACA — popularly known as Obamacare — could happen later.

And he accused Democrats of wanting to give undocumented immigrants federal health benefits.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., in a separate interview with "Squawk Box," called the question of ACA tax credit extension "a made-up problem by the Democrats," who are trying to satisfy a voter base that is opposed to President Donald Trump.

"This is Donald Trump," Thune said. "Nothing more, nothing less."

Jeffries, in his own interview on "Squawk Box," said of Republicans, "If the government shuts down, it's their decision to do it."

"We are ready and willing and able to find a bipartisan way forward," Jeffries said.

But he said Democrats are unwilling to support a bill that does not include health-care protections.

"We will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people," Jeffries said.

He said that on Wednesday, "notices are going to start going out" to tens of millions of Americans about higher insurance premiums that they will pay if the ACA subsidies are extended.

"We are fighting to deal with the health care of the American people," Jeffries said.

Asked by CNBC's Becky Quick, "Is it true you want to restore American taxpayer benefits to illegal immigrants?" Jeffries replied, "Of course not."

"And thank you for asking that question, because this is also an outright lie," Jeffries said.

"Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals," he said. "That's the law, and there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law."

As college and university leaders returned to campus this fall, there were new signs that a long-building financial crisis may finally be reaching a breaking point.

Closures and mergers are looming "at a pace we haven't seen since the Great Recession," said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education.

The warning lights have been flashing for years. Fewer high school graduates are enrolling in college and the overall population of college-age students is shrinking, a trend experts refer to as the "demographic cliff."

Higher operating costs and limitations on tuition increases have restricted institutions' ability to raise revenue, according to 2024 research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Higher education as a whole is "facing serious financial headwinds," the report said.

And now, international student enrollment is poised to drop off due to the Trump administration's tougher visa rules and anti-immigrant policies, representing billions of dollars in lost tuition and stripping away one of higher ed's most reliable financial lifelines.

Add deep federal funding cuts, and the sector faces what Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, calls "a perfect storm."

Collectively, with fewer students and less money coming in, there are fewer resources for teachers, programs, and most importantly, financial aid. For many schools, there may not even be enough funds to stay open.

Last September, the U.S. hosted more than 1.2 million students from abroad, an all-time high, according to the latest data by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

But in 2025, the number of international students on many U.S. college campuses is suddenly decreasing.

Largely due to the Trump administration's recent changes to the student visa policy — which deactivated and then reactivated the immigration status of thousands of students and put a temporary pause on new visa applicants — there may be as many as 150,000 fewer international students enrolled for the 2025-26 academic year, according to preliminary projections by NAFSA: Association of International Educators.

That represents a 30%-40% drop in new students from abroad and a 15% decline in total international student enrollment, amounting to a loss of nearly $7 billion in economic impact, according to the findings, which are based in part on State Department data. 

"International student enrollments are down massively," said Wolfson.

Chris Glass, a professor and higher education specialist at Boston College, said the NAFSA analysis was in line with his own projection based on applications for F-1 student visas in the spring, which were trending lower even before the pause on new applicants.

However, new government data suggests that the total number of international students may not have declined to the extent NAFSA projected. "We just don't know yet," Glass said.

At Drew University in Madison, N.J., about one-third of new students from abroad either withdrew or deferred this semester due to visa denials or lack of appointments, according to Hilary Link, Drew's president. 

"For a small institution like Drew, we did see an impact," Link said. International students — coming from 58 countries around the world — account for 14% of Drew's total enrollment of roughly 2,200 students, according to the school. 

Although international undergraduate and graduate students in the U.S. make up slightly less than 6% of the total U.S. higher education population, according to the Institute of International Education, they are an important source of revenue for schools. 

U.S. colleges and universities need a contingent of foreign students, who typically pay full tuition, in addition to enhancing the diversity of perspectives in classrooms and on campuses, Mitchell said.

Altogether, international students who studied in the U.S. contributed $46.1 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2024-25 academic year, according to the most recent data by NAFSA, including tuition revenue as well as student spending, which extends well beyond higher education.

Those funds support colleges' ability to provide financial aid, Mitchell said. "Full-paying international students pay scholarships for domestic students — it's a 1-to-1 relationship."

When it comes to which colleges will be hardest hit, "it's a tale of two worlds," said Jamie Beaton, co-founder and CEO of Crimson Education, a college consulting firm. On one hand, "top schools are really bulletproof."

In fact, Harvard University, which has been at the forefront of the escalating battle over international student visas, banked a recent win over the White House, freeing up $2.2 billion in grant funds.

The nation's most elite colleges, including the Ivy League, have large endowments, a diverse student body and an advanced pipeline of applicants that largely shield them from sudden shocks. "They can fill their entire class over and over and over again," Beaton said.

"These upper-tier schools are not without risk, but they have so many hedges against that risk they are more insulated from disruptions," said Boston College's Glass. "They are going to be the most resilient."

Alternatively, "there is a fair percentage of institutions essentially living month to month, or paycheck to paycheck," Glass said. Those less competitive and tuition-driven institutions are "extremely vulnerable," he said. "International students have been integrated into their enrollment strategy and their viability."

Mid-tier schools may also not be in the position to easily recruit other students, he added. "The pipeline is constricted, exposing them to risk."

Some "will feel the immediate pain," he said. Others "are going to bleed money, reallocate funds and see if they can survive."

"It's going to mean a lot of challenges for smaller, less wealthy institutions if the international student population declines and the domestic student population declines," said Drew's Link.

"We all need to work harder and more creatively to think about the value of a degree from a U.S. institution in this moment and how we make higher education more accessible and desirable," Link said.

For decades, research has shown that getting a college degree pays: College graduates earn significantly more than those with just a high school diploma. But in addition to higher earnings and better employment prospects, getting a degree is the ticket to social mobility, allowing graduates from diverse backgrounds to climb the economic ladder — an opportunity that is unmatched elsewhere.

Yet, today's pressures point to an era when fewer Americans go to college at all, and fewer colleges are in business.

"Declining international student enrollment is a piece of the larger puzzle undermining the financial health of higher education," said AAUP's Wolfson. "What we are going to see is programs shut down, campuses shut down, smaller public or private institutions closing or merging and a curtailment of opportunities for our students."

For now, Mitchell said, "colleges and universities are not holding their breath" for a rebound in revenue. "They need to hit the cost side hard."

"We are carefully monitoring all of our expenses, but we also know the next few years are going to be tough," said Laura Trombley, president of Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas. Only about 7% of the school's 1,434 students come from overseas, she said, so the impact has been minimal, so far.

In times of financial stress, the first cuts would be to the facilities budget, Trombley said, followed by under-enrolled academic programs — often in the humanities — and then reducing the number of faculty and staff.

"You have levers to pull, but you don't have that many levers," Trombley said.

Amazon is hosting a launch event on Tuesday where it's expected to unveil significant updates to its devices lineup.

The event is slated to kick off at 10 a.m. ET and will feature announcements from Panos Panay, who oversees Amazon's sprawling devices and services business.

Invites sent to the media and analysts earlier this month showed what appeared to be an Echo smart speaker, Fire TV, Ring doorbell button and a Kindle e-reader, suggesting what could be in store at the event.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a Bloomberg TV interview earlier this year that a "brand new lineup of devices" compatible with Alexa+ would be coming this fall.

Reviews for the company's upgraded assistant, which is powered by generative artificial intelligence, have been mixed.

Ohio resident and IT manager Jeff Finlay, 61, got access to Alexa+ in late June after applying to the beta program in March. Finlay, who has seven Echo devices in his home, said he feels Alexa+ has "worsened some of the functions I was used to using it for."

He said Alexa+'s weather forecasts don't seem to be as informative as previous iterations offered through the original Alexa assistant, called Big Sky.

Wired wrote in July that the new Alexa seems to be a more skilled and natural conversationalist, which "is a relief after years of Alexa's robotic tones." But TechCrunch noted in August that the service was prone to making mistakes and stumbled on some requests, making it seem "very much like a beta product."

Amazon typically hosts an annual devices bonanza each fall, where it unveils a bevy of new hardware and software products.

The company eschewed the tradition in 2024 and instead hosted an event last February where it announced a long-awaited overhaul of its Alexa digital assistant.

Since then, Amazon has slowly rolled out early access to Alexa+. It's not yet available to the general public and users must have newer versions of Amazon's Echo Show, its voice-controlled display with a touch screen.

The company says more than a million users have been granted access to Alexa+.

In a first for Amazon, the company is charging users to access its digital assistant, which it says is more conversational and proactive compared with previous versions. The service costs $19.99 a month, but is free for members of its $139-a-year Prime program.

Alexa has grown to be a sizable business for Amazon, with more than 600 million Alexa devices sold worldwide. That figure includes third-party products, as well as Amazon-branded devices.

Amazon faces growing pressure to update its hardware and software for the generative AI age following the success of rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Meta also has its Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which use its Llama large language model to answer spoken questions from the user.

Amazon's AI device ambitions may not end with Alexa or Echo smart speakers.

The company in July confirmed it's acquiring AI wearables startup Bee, which makes a wristband that can record and transcribe conversations.

Amazon has also introduced generative AI in some of its Ring smart home security products.

Deep within the bowels of JPMorgan Chase's data centers and cloud providers, an artificial intelligence program crucial to the bank's aspirations grows more powerful by the week.

The program, called LLM Suite, is a portal created by the bank to harness large language models from the world's leading AI startups. It currently uses models from OpenAI and Anthropic.

Every eight weeks, LLM Suite is updated as the bank feeds it more from the vast databases and software applications of its major businesses, giving the platform more abilities, Derek Waldron, JPMorgan chief analytics officer, told CNBC in an exclusive interview.

"The broad vision that we're working towards is one where the JPMorgan Chase of the future is going to be a fully AI-connected enterprise," Waldron said.

JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market capitalization, is being "fundamentally rewired" for the coming artificial intelligence era, according to Waldron. The bank, a heavyweight across Main Street and Wall Street finance, wants to provide every employee with AI agents, automate every behind-the-scenes process and have every client experience curated with AI concierges.

If the effort succeeds, the project could have profound implications for the bank's employees, customers and shareholders — even the nature of corporate labor itself.

Waldron, who gave CNBC the first demonstration of its AI platform seen by any outsider, showed the program creating an investment banking deck in about 30 seconds, work that would've previously taken a team of junior bankers hours to complete.

Since the arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, optimism over generative AI has driven markets higher on gains from the tech giants and chipmakers closest to the trade. Underpinning their growth is the expectation that corporate clients deploying AI will either boost worker productivity or lower expenses through layoffs — or both.

But similar to how the internet story played out in the 1990s, near-term expectations for AI may have outstripped reality. Most corporations had no tangible returns yet on their AI projects despite more than $30 billion in collective investments, according to an MIT report from July.

In the case of JPMorgan, even with it $18 billion annual tech budget, it will take years for the company to realize AI's potential by stitching the cognitive power of AI models together with the bank's proprietary data and software programs, said Waldron.

"There is a value gap between what the technology is capable of and the ability to fully capture that within an enterprise," Waldron said.

Companies "do work in thousands of different applications, there's a lot of work to connect those applications into an AI ecosystem and make them consumable," he said.

If JPMorgan can beat other banks to the punch on incorporating AI, it will enjoy a period of higher margins before the rest of the industry catches up. That first-mover advantage will allow it to grow revenues faster by going after a larger slice of the addressable market in global finance — enabling the bank to pitch more middle-market companies in investment banking, for instance.

AI was a major topic at a four-day executive retreat held in July by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, according to a person who attended but declined to be identified speaking about the private event.

Among concerns discussed at the off-site meeting, held at a resort outside Nashville, Tennessee, was how AI-driven changes will be adopted by the bank's 317,000-person workforce and its possible impacts to the apprenticeship model on areas including investment banking.

If JPMorgan succeeds with its AI goals, it will mean that a bank that is already the largest and most profitable in American history is set for new heights. Dimon has led the bank since 2005, guiding it through periods of upheaval to notch record profits in 7 of the last 10 years.

The end state for JPMorgan, as envisioned by Waldron, is a future in which AI is woven into the fabric of the company:

"Every employee will have their own personalized AI assistant; every process is powered by AI agents, and every client experience has an AI concierge," he said.

JPMorgan laid the groundwork for this starting in 2023, when it gave employees access to OpenAI's models through LLM Suite; it was essentially a corporate ChatGPT tool used to draft emails and summarize documents.

About 250,000 JPMorgan employees have access to the platform today, which is the entire workforce except for branch and call center staff, said Waldron. Half of them use it roughly every day, he said.

JPMorgan is now early in the next phase of its AI blueprint: It has begun deploying agentic AI to handle complex multistep tasks for employees, according to an internal road map provided by the bank.

"As those agents become increasingly powerful in terms of their AI capabilities and increasingly connected into JPMorgan," Waldron said, "they can take on more and more responsibilities."

Waldron, a former McKinsey partner with a Ph.D. in computational physics, recently demonstrated LLM Suite's capabilities to CNBC.

He gave the program a prompt: "You are a technology banker at JPMorgan Chase preparing for a meeting with the CEO and CFO of Nvidia. Prepare a five-page presentation that includes the latest news, earnings and a peer comparison."

LLM Suite created a credible-looking PowerPoint deck in about 30 seconds.

"You can imagine in the past how that would have been done; we would've had teams of investment banking analysts working long hours at night to do this," said Waldron.

The bank is also training AI to draft other key investment banking documents including the "inch thick" confidential memos that JPMorgan produces for prospective M&A clients, said the person who attended the July executive meeting.

The prospect of collapsing workloads means that fewer junior bankers may be needed even while AI-enabled teams handle more work and pitch more companies, according to senior Wall Street executives at several firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide their candid thoughts.

But to extract the full value from this new, almost magical technology, it's not just about the tools: Changes to how employees and departments are organized may be needed.

One proposal being discussed at a major investment bank is reducing the ratio of junior bankers to senior managers from the current 6-1 to 4-1. In the new regime, half of those junior bankers would be working from cities with cheaper labor, say Bengaluru, India, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, instead of being clustered in expensive New York.

The AI-powered junior bankers could then work on deals in shifts around the clock, passing the baton from one time zone to the next.

With fewer bankers on the payroll, the cost structure of investment banking would fall, boosting the bottom line, said the executives.

Unlike previous generations of technology, where bespoke automation tools had to be made for every distinct job, LLM Suite can service them all, from traders to wealth managers and risk officers, according to Waldron.

The implications for workers are profound. AI will empower some workers and give them more time, positioning them at the center of a team of AI agents. Others will be displaced by AI that takes over processes which no longer require human intervention.

That shift favors those who work directly with clients — a private banker with a roster of rich investors, traders who cater to hedge fund and pension managers, or investment bankers with relationships with Fortune 500 CEOs, for instance.

Those at risk of having to find new roles include operations and support staff who mainly deal in rote processes like setting up accounts, fraud detection or settling trades.

In May, JPMorgan's consumer banking chief told investors that operations staff would fall by at least 10% in the next five years thanks to artificial intelligence deployment.

"In an AI world, you'll still have people at the top who are managing and have relationships with clients, but many, many of the processes underneath are now being done by AI systems," Waldron said.

But it's still unwritten as to how that future will unfold; will corporations retain workers impacted by AI, retraining them for the new roles it creates? Or will they simply opt to cut their payroll?

"Without a doubt, AI technology will have changes on the construction of the workforce," Waldron said. "That is certain, but I think it's unclear as to exactly what those changes will look like."

More broadly, Waldron said that workers would shift from being creators of reports or software updates, or "makers" in his terminology, to "checkers" or managers of AI agents doing that work.

The bank is closing in on another frontier: It will soon allow generative AI to interact directly with customers, Waldron said. JPMorgan will start with limited cases, like allowing it to extract information for a user, before rolling out more advanced versions, he said.

Despite market concerns that the AI trade is a brewing bubble, corporate clients are actually more worried now that if they don't start adopting it soon, they'll fall behind and lose share, said Avi Gesser, a Debevoise & Plimpton partner who advises corporations on issues around AI.

"People are starting to see what these tools can do," Gesser said. "They're sort of like, 'Wow, if you get the workflow right, implement it properly and have the right guardrails, I could see how that would save you a lot of time and a lot of money and deliver a better product."

Wall Street's M&A rebound got a boost on Monday with the biggest take-private buyout in years, but experts are warning that the hiring landscape isn't showing the same signs of revival.

Video game producer Electronic Arts on Monday said it would be sold for $55 billion in a transaction hammered out by bankers at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. The price tag marks it the biggest take-private deal since the M&A boom in 2007 that preceded the global financial crisis. Though that's welcome news for everyone's league tables, it doesn't stand to do much for their job boards, insiders said.

"Even a deal of that size is not going to move the needle that much" on year-end bonuses and job opportunities at Wall Street banks, said Alan Johnson, a compensation expert and founder of the consultancy Johnson Associates.

Dealmakers kicked off 2025 anticipating a cascade of M&A opportunities, but tariff concerns in the first half of the year temporarily halted growth. Though M&A is ticking up and big deals like the EA transaction certainly help, experts who spoke to Business Insider said the market for jobs has yet to return to the frothy levels reached during the pandemic, when global dealmaking broke new records.

"I would not be effusive that hiring is back. I think firms are still cautious," Johnson said. "It's probably gone from negative to flat," he said of bank hiring levels, adding that AI will shrink analyst and associate classes, leading to fewer open roles over the long term.

So far this year, global dealmaking has produced standout transactions like Google's planned $32 billion acquisition of Wiz and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $13.4 billion purchase of Juniper Networks.

Large blockbuster transactions, however, don't necessarily translate into an M&A market that lifts all boats. Indeed, data from deals tracker LSEG shows that while worldwide deals by volume were up 32% year-to-date as of late September, at $2.95 trillion, the total number of deals was down nearly 9%.

Sophia Samadian, an investment banking recruiter at the firm Selby Jennings, said the focus has been on senior origination hires who can drive dealmaking, versus legions of support staff. "I think you're going to see more origination talent being needed, especially at the director, managing director level," she said.

Hiring has also been largely sector-specific, she said. "While the overall job growth is modest, I think there's definitely sectors that are picking up, she said, adding that healthcare, energy, and ESG finance are "hiring aggressively."

Artificial intelligence is helping boost financial technology dealmaking and hiring, experts said.

Samadian said clients are creating dedicated teams for AI, crypto, and digital infrastructure. "We're seeing just more investment firms in general try to focus and tailor into being crypto-focused or AI-focused or digital infrastructure or data analytics," she said. Some dealmakers, she added, are spinning out of bigger banks, launching their own shops to get in on the action.

KPMG estimated $44.7 billion of fintech investment in the first half of 2025 — which the firm acknowledged was a drop from the prior six-month period — including about $7 billion for AI-focused firms.

The rise of artificial intelligence will also lessen the need for some bankers by automating time-intensive tasks. "You don't need three analysts" on a deal, Johnson said, referring to Wall Street's youngest ranks. "You need one analyst."

Healthcare and biotech deal flow has begun to return, driving hiring needs in the sectors. This month, Lazard hired biopharmaceuticals insider Geoffrey Porges to its healthcare advisory group, a sign that banks are selectively boosting life sciences coverage, for instance. Recruiters also said analysts and associates with deep modeling experience in biotech and healthcare services are still attractive.

Equity capital markets hiring has been slower than M&A, despite the recent surge in high-profile IPOs. Johnson said equity underwriting incentives are flat to down. Samadian said her team has seen only scattered hiring in ECM.

"From the capital markets perspective, right now it's been a slower market for the equity side versus M&A, which is very much ebb and flow," she said.

Johnson expects most bankers will be paid more this year, but increases will be modest. "Most people are going to get paid more this year. I think if you're really good," the year could hold promise, he said. "If you're average, not so much."

According to summer projections from his firm, equity sales and trading bonuses were expected to rise by as much as 30% on the backs of strong volumes, fixed income sales and trading by as much as 20%, and debt underwriting by up to 15%. Advisory and equity underwriting were projected to be flat to down.

One recruiter pointed to optimism coming from the buyside — private equity firms hungry to do a deal — that next year could be more robust: "There's a lot of positive momentum in buyside hiring" going into the fourth quarter, said buyside recruiter Anthony Keizner of Odyssey Search Partners. And that could benefit everyone.

"Alternative investment firms have been buoyed by rate cuts, decent investment returns, and asset inflows," he said, adding that this is translating into robust 2026 hiring plans.

Chinese startup DeepSeek's latest experimental model promises to increase efficiency and improve AI's ability to handle a lot of information at a fraction of the cost, but questions remain over how effective and safe the architecture is.  

DeepSeek sent Silicon Valley into a frenzy when it launched its first model R1 out of nowhere last year, showing that it's possible to train large language models (LLMs) quickly, on less powerful chips, using fewer resources.

The company released DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp on Monday, an experimental version of its current model DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, which builds further on its mission to increase efficiency in AI systems, according to a post on the AI forum Hugging Face.

"DeepSeek V3.2 continues the focus on efficiency, cost reduction, and open-source sharing," Adina Yakefu, Chinese community lead at Hugging Face, told CNBC. "The big improvement is a new feature called DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention), which makes the AI better at handling long documents and conversations. It also cuts the cost of running the AI in half compared to the previous version."

"It's significant because it should make the model faster and more cost-effective to use without a noticeable drop in performance," said Nick Patience, vice president and practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group. "This makes powerful AI more accessible to developers, researchers, and smaller companies, potentially leading to a wave of new and innovative applications."

An AI model makes decisions based on its training data and new information, such as a prompt. Say an airline wants to find the best route from A to B, while there are many options, not all are feasible. By filtering out the less viable routes, you dramatically reduce the amount of time, fuel and, ultimately, money, needed to make the journey. That is exactly sparse attention does, it only factors in data that it thinks is important given the task at hand, as opposed to other models thus far which have crunched all data in the model.

"So basically, you cut out things that you think are not important," said Ekaterina Almasque, the cofounder and managing partner of new venture capital fund BlankPage Capital.

Sparse attention is a boon for efficiency and the ability to scale AI given fewer resources are needed, but one concern is that it could lead to a drop in how reliable models are due to the lack of oversight in how and why it discounts information.

"The reality is, they [sparse attention models] have lost a lot of nuances," said Almasque, who was an early supporter of Dataiku and Darktrace, and an investor in Graphcore. "And then the real question is, did they have the right mechanism to exclude not important data, or is there a mechanism excluding really important data, and then the outcome will be much less relevant?"

This could be particularly problematic for AI safety and inclusivity, the investor noted, adding that it may not be "the optimal one or the safest" AI model to use compared with competitors or traditional architectures. 

DeepSeek, however, says the experimental model works on par with its V3.1-Terminus. Despite speculation of a bubble forming, AI remains at the centre of geopolitical competition with the U.S. and China vying for the winning spot. Yakefu noted that DeepSeek's models work "right out of the box" with Chinese-made AI chips, such as Ascend and Cambricon, meaning they can run locally on domestic hardware without any extra setup.

DeepSeek also shared the actual programming code and tools needed to use the experimental model, she said. "This means other people can learn from it and build their own improvements."

But for Almasque, the very nature of this means the tech may not be defensible. "The approach is not super new," she said, noting the industry has been "talking about sparse models since 2015" and that DeepSeek is not able to patent its technology due to being open source. DeepSeek's competitive edge, therefore, must lie in how it decides what information to include, she added.

The company itself acknowledges V3.2-Exp is an "intermediate step toward our next-generation architecture," per the Hugging Face post.

As Patience pointed out, "this is DeepSeek's value prop all over: efficiency is becoming as important as raw power."

"DeepSeek is playing the long game to keep the community invested in their progress," Yakefu added. "People will always go for what is cheap, reliable, and effective."

Office workers everywhere are awash in "workslop." This is the term researchers are using to call AI-generated content that might look like it completes a task at work: pretty on paper, well-organized and neatly formatted, but lacks substance upon a closer read — and it often becomes a headache for the person receiving the work.

The term was coined in research published this month from the Stanford Social Media Lab and BetterUp, a professional training and coaching company. Surveying 1,150 desk workers in the US, the researchers found that 40% of respondents said they believed they had received this sort of AI-made sloppy work from their colleagues, which can take on many deceiving forms, like visually pleasing slide shows, long reports, or code that doesn't actually translate to a thoughtful product. On average, employees surveyed said they spent nearly two hours sorting through or cleaning up each instance of workslop.

In short: Some meetings might be better off as emails, and some AI-generated emails might be better off left in the drafts.

"We see that people are just sort of proliferating these documents, offloading the work onto another human, and then having this unintended consequence — there's a whole lack of trust as a result," says Kate Niederhoffer, head of research at BetterUp Labs. It's not that AI use at work can't be effective, she says, but "using it without high enough agency" leads to issues. That's a problem not just for the bottom line, but for relationships between employees. If your coworker foists lengthy, useless docs generated by AI onto your desk, it can feel like they're not pulling their weight or not capable of doing the work themselves. "It's the human dynamic that suffers because of our usage of this tool," says Niederhoffer.

The likes of Zoom CEO Eric Yuan, Bill Gates, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have estimated that with advancements in generative AI, white collar workers may soon only clock in three or four days a week. In Gen AI's current state, few of us are working less, and for some, it's creating more work or shifting how they spend their days rather than making them more productive. A recent MIT Media Lab report found that 95% of AI pilot programs have not seen measurable savings or boosts in profit.

Instead of freedom, some desk workers find themselves slogging through with low-quality work; experienced software engineers are now debugging code, graphic designers are making generative-AI images look like something humans actually want to see, and writers are editing the words that large language models spit out for accuracy, and then rewriting it to cover up ChatGPT's telltale signs. When people think they've received messages generated by AI, they don't like them. A 2023 study from Cornell University found that Google-written smart replies could make conversations more efficient and led to more positive language, but those who received the messages held more negative opinions of the senders of algorithmic responses.

No doubt there have always been workers who squeaked by while another clocked late hours and cleaned up messes, but gen AI has streamlined the process of phoning it in.

On Upwork, a job platform for freelancers, graphic design, English, and fact-checking were among the top 10 most in-demand AI skills in August. Demand for freelancers with content writing or language tutoring and interpretation were up 15% and 162% respectively, according to Upwork's Research Institute. These were among skills most at risk of automation thanks to large language models, but the high-demand shows how companies need expert freelancers in this skillsets, and aren't leaning on AI to replace them, according to Upwork's analysis. "Humans must remain in the loop from the start to ensure that AI work products are delivering the levels of quality, accuracy and usability that we expect and need them to," Teng Liu, an economist for Upwork's Research Institute, tells me in a statement. "Otherwise, the need for 'AI clean-up' jobs does frequently occur."

Big Tech companies have turned to generative AI for coding, and job listings for junior software developers have fallen. AI has killed the coding test and given rise to vibe coding. A deeper look shows that AI might not be making developers more efficient yet, and is more often shuffling around how they spend their time, moving the bulk of their focus from writing code to reviewing it. In 2024, Uplevel, a software development company, studied 800 software developers and compared the productivity of those with GitHub's Copilot access to those without. They found that the developers who used Copilot did not become more efficient or less burnt out, but did have bugs in code 41% more frequently than those without access to the tool (GitHub published its own smaller study a month later, showing that developers who used Copilot wrote about 18 lines of code without error, compared to 16 lines for those without). The effects of AI on productivity for engineers has been uneven, says Amy Carrillo Cotten, Uplevel's director of customer transformation. "For a lot of engineers, the only thing that looks different is where they spend their time, not exactly how much time it took."

Still, the ease and availability of AI coding tools have led customers to think engineering and design work should be faster and cheaper, says Minh Phan, founder of Studio Init, a software development company. Phan says there's still complex work to be done by human developers and designers to get to an end product, and he has to convince some customers that AI for coding isn't the lightning bolt they think it is. "What they want is a Mercedes, but the prompt is giving a bicycle," he says.

More people using tools like ChatGPT also means more sloppy content being sent in cold outreach. Caitlin Ner, director of operations at PsyMed Ventures, a VC firm that focuses on mental and brain health startups, says her firm has received more messages from founders and pitches that seem AI-generated; either they're spammy and don't fit in with the firm's niche, or they're so like other pitches that it's hard to decipher how well the founder can communicate if the product stands out. As a small firm, it's a waste of time to read such generic pitches, and a bigger waste of time to start conversations only to find the founder isn't a good fit on a call, Ner tells me. "When you're an early stage investor, you're essentially really taking a bet on the founder," she says. "It's very easy to tell if you're pulling something just templated, versus you have a technology that actually stands out and you're portraying that with your own words."

A marketing worker named Shawna, for example, recently got a slew of drafted emails from a coworker at 4 p.m. meant to be sent out the next day. It's a standard part of the gig, but these emails needed a lot of extra love: They lacked her company's formatting, style, and tone, she tells me. That's because Shawna's colleague didn't actually write the drafts, but prompted a chatbot and then copied and pasted its output without much thought.

"I had to drop everything and scramble at the end of the day to fix this series of emails," says Shawna, who asked I not use her full name because she's not authorized by her company to speak about this. Shawna herself uses ChatGPT to get her work done faster, and has spent time learning the best ways to prompt it, pulling together the best outputs and throwing out the worst. But she says her coworkers don't always put as much editing into the output. While the person who sent the sloppy emails could blissfully check the item off their to-do list, Shawna had to punch up the writing and fact-check. "It made their life easier, then it made my life harder. I had to do the critical thinking on their behalf."

There are already too many notifications, systems, processes, and standing meetings that eat up worker's time. AI "tools are being used because people feel like there's just too much," says Jeff Hancock, director of the Stanford Social Media Lab. Some AI tools have helped people organize and filter their notifications, cutting down on the unnecessary pings they receive each day. But when used without thought, AI can ironically add to the flood of too much information. In all the hype around the AI boom, many are failing to use the tools with the most important question in mind, and that's: "What are people's needs?" Hancock says. "I think that is so often ignored when talking about AI."

There's a lot that all of us have to read each day — texts, emails, Slack messages, recipes, that book that's been sitting on your nightstand neglected. Using AI in responses might seem like a fix to take something off your plate, but an overreliance on it can derail conversation. Writing, coding, or designing is about communicating ideas to others. If that's outsourced to gen AI with little to no human oversight, there may be little value for the human on the other end who has to read it.

After a seemingly unproductive meeting between lawmakers and U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, the chances that the country's government will be shutting down two days later appear to be growing.

If the U.S. government shuts down, it's essentially like a depressed millennial spending a week in bed having an existential crisis. That is to say, vital functions of the country, such as defence and healthcare, are preserved, but non-essential ones will be curtailed.

One of the offices that will pause functioning: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases the jobs and inflation reports, on which the Federal Reserve relies to make rate decisions. Delayed or murky data means a foggier sea for Chair Jerome Powell to navigate.

Still, major U.S. indexes climbed on Monday as artificial intelligence kingpin Nvidia regained some ground lost last week, while shares of Electronic Arts popped on news that the video game company will be taken private.

Meanwhile, investors pushed up shares of Etsy because of its tie-up with OpenAI's new Instant Checkout feature. In other words, the haven for "corporate refugees," who have turned to handmaking crafts, is partnering the artificial intelligence company that seems to be creating corporate refugees.

Cue more millennial existential crises.

U.S. government shutdown looks increasingly likely. Top lawmakers met Trump on Monday, but it appears a compromise couldn't be reached. Users on prediction markets are betting there's a 70% chance there'll be a shutdown on Wednesday.

White House wants Taiwan to shift chip production. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend that half of America's chips should be manufactured domestically — and is pushing Taiwan to help it do so.

China's manufacturing activity picks up in September. The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 49.8. While still indicating a contraction, it's the highest since March and beats expectations.

Major U.S. indexes tick up. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday as AI shares rose. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Tuesday. Zijin Gold shares soared over 60% in its trading debut in Hong Kong.

[PRO] Hedge funds are starting to move like indexes. While hedge funds are typically a form of asset diversification, they are increasingly moving in tandem with the equity market — posing a risk to investors.

France's sovereign wealth chief has a warning for Europe: We're being 'doubly colonized'

The head of France's state investment bank Bpifrance has painted a grim picture of Europe, saying the continent is caught between the world's two largest economies and is unable to fund its own future-critical industries.

"I'm sorry to be radical in my vision, but we are doubly colonized: industrially colonized by the Chinese, digitally colonized by the U.S.," Dufourcq said at IPEM, a private capital conference in Paris, last week. "It's not in the future; the consequences are now."

The Trump administration is pushing Taipei to shift investment and chip production to the U.S. so that half of America's chips are manufactured domestically, in a move that could have implications for Taiwan's national defense. 

Washington has held discussions with Taipei about the "50-50" split in semiconductor production, which would significantly reduce American dependence on Taiwan, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told News Nation in an interview released over the weekend. 

Taiwan is said to produce over 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors, which, according to Lutnick, is cause for concern due to the island nation's distance from the U.S. and proximity to China. 

"My objective, and this administration's objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips," Lutnick said. "The idea that I pitched [Taiwan] was, let's get to 50-50. We're producing half, and you're producing half." 

Lutnick's goal is to reach about 40% domestic semiconductor production by the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's current term, which would take northwards of $500 billion in local investments, he said. 

Taiwan's stronghold on chip production is thanks to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest and most advanced contract chipmaker, which handles production for American tech heavyweights like Nvidia and Apple. 

Taiwan's critical position in global chips production is believed to have assured the island nation's defense against direct military action from China, often referred to as the "Silicon Shield" theory.

However, in his News Nation interview, Lutnick downplayed the "Silicon Shield," and argued that Taiwan would be safer with more balanced chip production between the U.S. and Taiwan.

"My argument to them was, well, if you have 95% [chip production], how am I going to get it to protect you? You're going to put it on a plane? You're going to put it on a boat?" Lutnick said. 

Under the 50-50 plan, the U.S. would still be "fundamentally reliant" on Taiwan, but would have the capacity to "do what we need to do, if we need to do it," he added.

Beijing views the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to reclaim it by force if necessary. Taipei's current ruling party has rejected and pushed back against such claims. 

This year, the Chinese military has held a number of large-scale exercises off the coast of Taiwan as it tests its military capabilities. During one of China's military drills in April, Washington reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Taiwan. 

Lutnick's statements on the News Nation interview aligned with past comments from Trump, suggesting that the U.S. should get more in return for its defense of the island nation against China. 

Last year, then-presidential candidate Trump had said in an interview that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense, and accused the country of "stealing" the United States' chip business. 

The U.S. was once a leader in the global semiconductor market, but has lost market share due to industry shifts and the emergence of Asian juggernauts like TSMC and Samsung. 

However, Washington has been working to reverse that trend across multiple administrations. 

TSMC has been building manufacturing facilities in the U.S. since 2020 and has continued to ramp up its investments in the country. It announced intentions to invest an additional $100 billion in March, bringing its total planned investment to $165 billion. 

The Trump administration recently proposed 100% tariffs on semiconductors, but said that companies investing in the U.S. would be exempt. The U.S. and Taiwan also remain in trade negotiations that are likely to impact tariff rates for Taiwanese businesses.

Ford CEO Jim Farley says there's barely any contest between Chinese and American automakers when it comes to dominating in EVs.

"The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry," Farley told The Verge's "Decoder" podcast in an episode that aired Monday.

"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China," he added.

Representatives for Farley at Ford did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Farley told guest host and journalist Joanna Stern that China's dominance in the industry stemmed from the generous government support its automakers enjoyed.

"China's successful for good reason. It has great innovation at a very low cost," Farley said.

"There's hundreds of companies, and they're all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. It's new brands. It's BYD and Geely, and companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that's a big advantage for them," he added.

Farley has talked about China's lead in the EV race on multiple occasions.

In June, Farley said during a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival that China's EV progress is the "most humbling thing" he has ever seen.

"They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car," Farley said. "You get in, you don't have to pair your phone. Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in the car."

"We are in a global competition with China, and it's not just EVs. And if we lose this, we do not have a future Ford," he added.

Farley praised Chinese tech giant Xiaomi's maiden electric vehicle, the SU7, in an episode of "The Fully Charged Podcast," which aired in October 2024.

"I don't like talking about the competition so much, but I drive the Xiaomi," Farley said.

"We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up," he added.

Farley isn't the only one who sees China's dominance in EVs as a byproduct of the country's lower labor costs and generous subsidies.

The Centre for Strategic & International Studies said in a report published last year that China's government has spent at least $230 billion funding local EV makers between 2009 and 2023.

"There's not something magical when you take it apart that's allowing these really impressive cost structures," RJ Scaringe, the CEO of American EV maker Rivian, told the "Everything Electric" podcast in an episode that aired in September.

"There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But rather it's the compounding benefits of a lower cost of capital," he added.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Eric Fung, 37, the CEO of Colega AI in Tokyo. It's been edited for length and clarity.

I was ready for a fresh start, so last year, I moved to Tokyo.

California wasn't what it used to be: the cost of living was insane, and the Bay Area magic had dimmed. I wanted a reset. I had visited Tokyo as a tourist and loved its safety, cleanliness, and energy.

I also noticed something important. Japan is home to more than 3 million small businesses, including restaurants, bars, cafés, and retailers. Unlike the US, where big chains dominate, Japan still runs on a lot of mom-and-pop shops. That made it the perfect market to test my idea.

In 2024, I came for three months, the maximum my US passport allows. I don't have roots in Japan — I'm not Japanese, I don't speak the language, and my family is originally from Hong Kong. But I figured if I could make something work here, I could make it anywhere.

I was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in a blue-collar household. My dad emigrated from Hong Kong and worked just about every job you can imagine — waiter, limo driver, FedEx worker. My parents even ran a restaurant for a while.

Entrepreneurship has always been in my DNA, though my parents hoped I'd take a more traditional "white-collar" path.

I studied advertising and public relations at Penn State. After graduating in 2010, I joined an advertising firm in New York. Within a year, I knew corporate life wasn't for me. I jumped to a tiny startup, pitching products no one had heard of and leading a team older than me. I learned more in those three years than in classrooms, and it convinced me I wanted to build companies.

New York didn't seem like the right place to start, so at 24, I packed one suitcase and drove to San Francisco.

My first ideas — from a job search site for visa sponsors to a travel camera app — didn't take off, and stints in Big Tech only confirmed how slow and soul-crushing corporate life felt.

The Bay Area was brutally competitive, which I discovered firsthand at a fast-moving database startup. Working there sharpened my edge and taught me how to fight for market share.

In 2019, I co-founded my first company with two former colleagues. We built AI tools for engineers before "AI" was a buzzword. After early success, we exited, in part due to the pandemic. It taught me how unpredictable startup life could be.

After that, I went through my "restaurant phase" — opening a bubble tea shop, a pancake café, and a fusion spot in California. I set each up, ran it, then hired managers to take over. It was exhausting, but it gave me perspective.

Since then, I've sold one off and have managers running the other two. Now, I'm focused on my new startup, Colega AI, which builds AI marketing solutions for small businesses.

Our startup is US-registered, but the team's based in Tokyo. There are seven of us — three in Tokyo, including me, and two of those are Japanese. The rest are spread across Asia since we're remote-first, and no one's in the US right now. 

I moved here permanently in April.

Moving to Tokyo has been both exciting and challenging.

To navigate the cultural and language barriers, I partnered with a local who helps bridge relationships on the ground. Early on, I worried that no one would take me seriously — a foreigner pitching products in a market known for tradition and formality.

The work culture in Tokyo is a world apart from San Francisco. I have Japanese friends who keep pillows under their desks because sleeping at the office isn't unusual. Long hours and seniority hierarchies are baked into the system. As an American founder, I've had to balance respecting that culture with building a more flexible, startup-style environment.

My wife Shana, whom I met in San Francisco in 2018, runs her own jewelry and gemstone business and has adapted well — she loves how safe the city feels. But making close friends takes time, and the language barrier adds hurdles.

We're renting a spacious studio near Shibuya that's almost 50% cheaper than what we had in California. I pay about $1,350 for 500 square feet in a very convenient part of the city. A similar place in San Francisco would easily be $3,000.

While space is still tight by US standards, the trade-off is incredible access: late-night ramen, world-class dining, and trains to anywhere in minutes. Everyday costs are lower too — eating out and groceries are cheaper, though fruit can be shockingly expensive.

I'm not sure how long I'll stay. If my business keeps me in Tokyo for five years, great. If it leads me elsewhere in Asia or back to the US, I'll figure that out when the time comes.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR) has undergone a profound transformation, evolving from a traditional Bitcoin mining and infrastructure provider into a formidable Ethereum (ETH) treasury company. This strategic pivot, largely initiated in mid-2025, has placed BMNR at the epicenter of the cryptocurrency and financial markets. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, and founded in 2019, BMNR is now predominantly a "financial holding company" with an ambitious core strategy: to aggressively accumulate Ethereum and become the world's largest ETH treasury, aiming to acquire 5% of its total circulating supply.

BMNR's emergence as an Ethereum treasury titan mirrors MicroStrategy's successful Bitcoin accumulation playbook, drawing significant attention from investors seeking exposure to the burgeoning digital asset economy. As of September 28, 2025, the company reported substantial crypto and cash holdings of $11.6 billion, including 2,650,900 ETH tokens (valued at approximately $4,141 per ETH), 192 Bitcoin, and $436 million in unencumbered cash. This impressive portfolio solidifies BMNR's position as the largest ETH treasury globally and the second-largest overall crypto treasury.

The company's relevance is further amplified by high-profile investor backing from institutions like ARK's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund (Peter Thiel holds a 9.1% stake), and Bill Miller III. Chairman Tom Lee of Fundstrat is a vocal proponent, advocating for Ethereum as a foundational technology for both Wall Street and artificial intelligence. BMNR's stock boasts high liquidity, frequently ranking among the most traded in the U.S., making it an attractive, regulated vehicle for institutional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum. While Nasdaq classifies BMNR as a large-cap growth stock in Computer Services, its primary driver of value is now its digital asset accumulation.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) has a dynamic history marked by significant strategic evolution. Incorporated in 2019, the company was initially known by several names, including Sandy Springs Holdings Inc. and Renewable Energy Solution Systems, Sandy Springs, RESS Merger, before establishing its identity as a blockchain technology firm.

Its early operations centered on industrial-scale digital asset mining, equipment sales, and hosting services for both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. BMNR strategically located its mining facilities in regions with low energy costs, such as Trinidad and Pecos and Silverton, Texas, employing advanced immersion cooling technology to enhance efficiency and sustainability, aiming for carbon neutrality. An early foray into cryptocurrency treasury management saw the company purchase 100 Bitcoin for its treasury in June 2025, funded through a common stock offering.

The most pivotal transformation occurred in mid-2025 under the chairmanship of Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat. BMNR fundamentally shifted its core corporate strategy from a primary focus on Bitcoin mining to the aggressive accumulation of Ether (ETH). This audacious new objective, termed "the Alchemy of 5%," aims to acquire 5% of the total circulating supply of Ethereum, targeting a long-term valuation exceeding $25 billion. The ETH Treasury strategy officially launched around June 30, 2025, with the first closing on July 8, 2025, following a $250 million private placement. This strategic pivot was met with immediate investor enthusiasm, causing BMNR's stock price to surge over 50% in a single day on July 1, 2025.

Following this monumental shift, BitMine rapidly achieved several key milestones in its ETH accumulation:

These rapid acquisitions, funded through various capital-raising transactions, have attracted significant support from prominent institutional investors, solidifying BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc.'s position as a leading entity in the cryptocurrency landscape.

As of September 30, 2025, BMNR Corp.'s business model has significantly evolved, with a primary strategic focus on its "Ethereum treasury strategy" while maintaining its historical roots in Bitcoin mining. The company aims to become a dominant financial holding company centered on aggressive cryptocurrency accumulation.

Core Business Model:
BMNR's core strategy is to acquire 5% of the total circulating supply of Ethereum, mirroring MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation approach. This is primarily funded through capital raising transactions, such as stock offerings, which are then used to purchase significant amounts of ETH. Alongside this, the company continues to engage in digital asset mining and related services.

BMNR Corp.'s revenue streams are diverse, though heavily influenced by its cryptocurrency holdings:

Although the market for NFTs has cooled off from its heyday several years ago, digital goods are still a hot commodity. This summer, the Ninth Circuit recognized that such goods are more than mere ephemera: they are “goods” under the Lanham Act to which trademark law applies.

The case, Yuga Labs v. Ripps, involved a dispute over the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection. Yuga Labs sued artist Ryder Ripps and his collaborator for creating a nearly identical NFT collection using the same images and branding. The defendants argued that the trademark infringement claims failed because an NFT is not a “good” under the Lanham Act. While the court ultimately reversed summary judgment on trademark infringement due to unresolved questions about consumer confusion, it made a clear and consequential finding: NFTs are trademarkable goods.

The court's reasoning wasn't limited to NFTs as a niche art form. It emphasized that the Lanham Act protects marks used with “any goods or services,” referencing reports from the USPTO on the subject. The court reasoned that although NFTs are intangible, they are bought and sold in curated online marketplaces, functioning as commercial goods. The decision indicates that trademark protection extends to a wide range of digital assets, including virtual fashion and wearables, in-game items and avatars, tokenized memberships and experiences, and digitally branded merchandise.

The court distinguished NFTs from earlier cases involving intangible content embedded in physical goods (like video cassettes or karaoke tracks). The intangible elements of goods like video cassettes represented ideas or creative works that were not protectable by trademark law. Unlike those goods, NFTs are not tied to tangible media: they exist and are traded entirely in digital environments. Thus, the intangible elements of NFTs are not merely expressive, but include the package in which the content is distributed. That difference was key to the court's conclusion.

In short, if consumers perceive a digital asset as a product in commerce, it may qualify for trademark protection.

This decision is a reminder that courts are willing to adapt traditional IP frameworks to emerging technologies. Tellingly, the court quoted a recent Supreme Court case, stating that “we are mindful that when we apply ‘established legal rules to the ‘totally new problems'' of emerging technologies, our task is “not to ‘embarrass the future.'”

For companies operating in the digital space, it's also a reminder to:

Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper thinks that one day retailers will only accept bitcoin as a payment. 

Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, believes that one day retailers will only accept bitcoin as a payment. 

“There will be a moment when all the retailers say ‘I accept bitcoin' and then there will be a moment when retailers will say ‘I only accept bitcoin,” Draper said on Bloomberg Television. 

Tim Draper's support for bitcoin goes far beyond words. In 2014, he made headlines by spending $19 million to purchase 30,000 bitcoins seized from the shutdown of the Silk Road marketplace.

Today, those coins are valued at roughly $3.5 billion. Draper has also backed major crypto firms, like Coinbase and Robinhood Markets, cementing his reputation as one of the sector's most influential investors.

In the interview with Bloomberg, Draper acknowledged that for now, bitcoin is primarily being held, not spent — a trend fueled by its consistent value growth, which makes it a favored store of value and a hedge against inflation.

But Draper sees change on the horizon. He said that eventually, retailers will start accepting bitcoin as a primary payment method. 

Draper is also raising fresh capital for his venture firm, Draper Associates. 

According to a Tuesday SEC filing, the firm has secured $200 million for its eighth fund, with its website hinting at the official launch. Draper Associates, which manages $2 billion in assets, focuses heavily on crypto investments.

This latest fund follows the 2022 raise of nearly $124 million for Fund 7.

The timing coincides with a strong crypto market rally. The total cryptocurrency market recently surpassed $4 trillion for the first time, buoyed by congressional legislation regulating stablecoins and Bitcoin surging past $120,000 in recent months.

Draper, 67, began his venture capital career in 1985 with a $6 million loan and quickly became known for early investments in companies like Skype, Baidu, Tesla, SpaceX, and Robinhood. 

Draper has predicted in the past that bitcoin could hit $250,000 — a forecast that, while not yet realized, is seeming more and more likely as Bitcoin sits above $113,000.

There are strong accumulation signs, but it comes with none of the hype.

Binance's sender-to-receiver ratio just hit its lowest since early 2024, a sign of growing HODLer behavior.

Only 24% of Binance-listed alts are above their 200-day SMA, a pattern linked to accumulation phases.

Bitcoin's [BTC] been holding its ground and getting stronger.

Even with long-term holders (LTHs) cashing in some profits, BTC barely flinched, resting near $110K through September.

But now, Binance's BTC sender-to-receiver ratio just dropped, and only 24% of Binance-listed alts are trading above their 200-day MA.

Most of the market looks like it's in accumulating in preparation for something bigger.

The 1-month MA of Binance's Bitcoin sender-to-receiver ratio just hit its lowest point since early 2024.

This metric tracks how many people are sending BTC versus receiving it; and when receivers start to dominate, it indicates accumulation. In plain terms, fewer people are selling, and more are just sitting tight.

Spikes in this ratio have so far lined up with market tops. So, a sharp decline? That could mean the opposite, that there's room for more.

And here's where it gets even more interesting.

Despite signs of accumulation, September wasn't exactly quiet. Binance data shows that LTHs started to take profits as prices swung from $117K down to $108K.

But rather than triggering a panic, the market barely flinched.

Source: Cryptoquant

Most of the movement came from coins held between 6 months and 5 years, with the 7-10 year category showing only light activity.

The real test was that BTC stayed remarkably stable near $110K even as these older coins hit the market.

That's not what you'd expect during a sell-off. It's more like the market took the hit, and shrugged it off!

While Bitcoin holds strong and LTHs take profits without shaking the floor, the altcoin market's got its own story.

Just 24% of Binance-listed altcoins are trading above their 200-day SMA; a far cry from the kind of levels we see during bull market euphoria.

Source: X

When this number dips close to zero, it's usually been a pretty reliable marker of big accumulation phases.

In other words, the smart money may already be shopping. It's not flashy, and it's definitely not trending… but that might be exactly the point.

A Chinese national has been convicted following an international fraud investigation which resulted in what's believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in the world.

The Metropolitan Police says it recovered 61,000 bitcoin worth more than £5bn ($6.7bn) in current prices.

Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, pleaded guilty on Monday at Southwark Crown Court of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.

A second person appeared in court on Tuesday to admit to their role in the scheme.

Malaysian national Seng Hok Ling, of Matlock, Derbyshire, pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court of entering into a money laundering arrangement on or before 23 April 2024.

According to the charge, he had been dealing in cryptocurrency on Qian's behalf, "knowing or suspecting his actions would facilitate the acquisition or control of criminal property by another".

Between 2014 and 2017 Qian led a large-scale scam in China which involved cheating more than 128,000 victims and storing the stolen funds in bitcoin assets, the Met said in a statement.

It said the 47-year-old's guilty plea followed a seven-year probe into a global money laundering web which began when it got a tipoff about the transfer of criminal assets.

Qian had been "evading justice" for five years up to her arrest, which required a complex investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, said Detective Sergeant Isabella Grotto, who led the Met's investigation.

She fled China using false documents and entered the UK, where she attempted to launder the stolen money by buying property, said the Met.

"By pleading guilty today, Ms Zhang hopes to bring some comfort to investors who have waited since 2017 for compensation, and to reassure them that the significant rise in cryptocurrency values means there are more than sufficient funds available to repay their losses," said Qian's solicitor Roger Sahota, of Berkeley Square Solicitors.

On Tuesday, the Court heard that confiscation proceedings had begun in an effort to retrieve more than £16.2 million from Ling, with the figure to be adjusted to reflect cryptocurrency rates when he is sentenced in November.

Some reports have suggested the UK government will seek to retain the seized funds.

The BBC has approached the Treasury and the Home Office for a response.

Reforms to crime legislation under the previous Conservative government aimed to make it easier for the UK authorities to seize, freeze and recover crypto assets. 

The changes would also allow some victims to apply for the release of their assets  held in accounts.

Qian had help from a Chinese takeaway worker named Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years and eight months last year for her part in the criminal operation.

Wen, 44, laundered the proceeds from the scam and moved from living above a restaurant to a "multi-million pound rented house" in north London, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) earlier this year.

She also bought two properties in Dubai worth more than £500,000, the CPS said.

The Met said it seized more than £300m worth of bitcoin from Wen.

Chinese media outlet Lifeweek reported in 2024 that investors, mostly between 50 and 75 years old, had poured "hundreds of thousands to tens of millions" of yuan into investments promoted by Qian.

Some of the victims - including business people, bank employees and members of the judiciary - were reportedly urged to invest with Qian's scheme by friends and family.

The investors reportedly knew little about Qian, who was described as "the goddess of wealth".

"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used by organised criminals to disguise and transfer assets, so that fraudsters may enjoy the benefits of their criminal conduct," said deputy chief Crown prosecutor, Robin Weyell.

"This case, involving the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the UK, illustrates the scale of criminal proceeds available to those fraudsters."

Monday's conviction marks the "culmination of years of dedicated investigation", which has involved the police and Chinese law enforcement teams, said Will Lyne, the Met's Head of Economic and Cybercrime Command.

Qian is being held in custody ahead of sentencing, which will take place on 10 November - as part of a two-day sentencing hearing at which Seng Hok Ling has also been asked to appear.

UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the conviction sent a "clear signal" that UK wasn't a "safe haven" for criminals.

"Money laundering erodes trust, undermines our economy, and fuels the rise of serious organised crime," he said in a statement.

The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy in the UK for comment.

Two decisions made by the Securities and Exchange Commission in recent days could unleash a wave of new exchange-traded fund launches, led by crypto ETFs.

The SEC recently approved generic listing standards for spot crypto ETFs, which removes the need for lengthy case-by-case approvals. This means faster launches across more cryptocurrencies.

The regulatory door is now open for a wider range of crypto ETFs beyond existing bitcoin and ethereum funds, which have grown quickly. Digital currencies with smaller but loyal followings could soon be better represented and traded by investors though exchange-traded funds.

"Within the next 60 to 90 days, we'll have a dozen or so new crypto-oriented products tracking things like solana or XRP, or the coins that people don't know about that are below bitcoin and ethereum, the ones everybody knows," said ETF expert David Nadig on CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday.

There are already a handful of solana and XRP ETFs, with relatively low asset bases. The Solana ETF, for example, has $230 million in assets, according to ETFAction.com. The Volatility Shares Trust XRP has roughly $200 million in assets.

Crypto-linked investment strategies are also widening in scope beyond straight single-currency spot market trades, such as new bitcoin income ETFs. Crypto "index ETFs" are also launching, among them, Grayscale Investments recently being approved by the SEC to convert a mutual fund to ETF status.

The anticipated ETF boom will extend well beyond crypto. On Monday, the SEC granted what is expected to be the first in a wave of regulatory greenlights to traditional mutual fund companies to offer their portfolios with an ETF share class. Dimensional Fund Advisors became the first asset manager to win this approval.

More than 70 fund providers have applications pending and experts expect the rest to follow quickly now that Dimensional has cleared the way.

Shelly Antoniewicz, lead ETF researcher and chief economist at mutual fund trade group Investment Company Institute, recently told the "ETF Edge" podcast that in addition to the 70 applications already on file with the SEC, "we've been working with hundreds to be prepared for if and when the SEC exemptive relief is allowed."

According to YCharts, there are around 4,100 ETFs, which is more than the amount of individual stocks listed on U.S. markets, but that could increase by as many as 3,000 more ETFs, Nadig told "ETF Edge" back in May when discussing the highly anticipated SEC change.

Taking strategies from mutual fund wrappers and making them available in ETFs offers new trading flexibility, but also risks for investors.

"It means they're going to be a whole lot of new tickers you've got to worry about," Nadig said on ETF Edge on Monday.

He noted some tax advantages from the more flexible ETF structure may exist for existing shareholders, but the bigger story is the product proliferation.

"Two big regulatory changes, both of them opening the floodgates on new products for investors," Nadig said.

 The SEC is exploring a plan to let blockchain-based versions of stocks trade on crypto exchanges, signaling growing support for tokenization. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly developing a plan to allow blockchain-registered versions of stocks to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges — a move that would mark a significant step toward integrating digital asset technology into the traditional financial system.

The proposal, still in early stages, would let investors buy and sell stock tokens — digital representations of shares in publicly traded companies — on approved crypto platforms, The Information reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The initiative reflects growing regulatory openness to tokenization, the process of creating blockchain-based tokens that mirror ownership of traditional assets. 

SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently described tokenization as an “innovation” the agency should seek to advance, not restrict. Regulators “should be focused on how do we advance innovation in the marketplace,” he said, noting that tokenized assets could improve access to financial markets and reduce costs.

Interest in stock tokenization has accelerated in recent months. Platforms such as Robinhood and Kraken have begun offering tokenized stock products. At the same time, Nasdaq has requested SEC approval for a rule change that would allow it to list tokenized securities on its exchange.

Crypto exchange Coinbase is also reportedly seeking SEC approval to offer tokenized equities.

Still, the SEC's apparent willingness to embrace blockchain-based equities has drawn pushback from traditional finance companies. In a July note to the agency's Crypto Task Force, Citadel Securities cautioned regulators to ensure that tokenization delivers genuine market benefits rather than exploiting regulatory gaps.

“Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” Citadel wrote.

Magazine: Can Robinhood or Kraken's tokenized stocks ever be truly decentralized?

Tokenized stocks are emerging as one of the next major growth areas within the broader tokenization market. While early financial tokenization efforts have focused largely on private credit and US Treasury bonds, stocks are beginning to catch up.

According to industry data, more than $31 billion in assets have been tokenized, but tokenized equities currently account for only about 2% of that total. Still, their value has nearly doubled over the past 100 days, signaling accelerating adoption.

A recent Binance Research report compared the rise of tokenized stocks to the early days of the DeFi boom in 2020 and 2021. Researchers suggested that, following recent growth, tokenized equities “may be nearing a major inflection point in the broader transition to hybrid finance.”

Binance Research estimates the market for tokenized stocks could exceed $1.3 trillion if just 1% of global equities move onto the blockchain.

Sharps Technology (STSS) and Crypto.com announced today a partnership to expand the Solana ecosystem via institutional-grade treasury solutions. The collaboration will utilize Crypto.com's infrastructure to manage and deploy more than $400 million worth of Sharps Technology Solana holdings into a digital asset treasury strategy.

STSS has accumulated over 2 million SOL, valued at roughly $418 million based on the current price. The firm is among the largest corporate holders of Solana, with more than 6.8 million SOL in holdings, among giants like Forward Industries. According to STSS, a Solana-focused treasury strategy is both a balance sheet measure and a corporate commitment to incorporating TradFi with blockchain networks.

Crypto.com provides custody infrastructure services and an OTC desk with deep liquidity and discreet execution. STSS has collaborated with the custody infrastructure to manage its assets, benefiting from an institutional-grade custody platform with competitive pricing. The firm hopes the collaboration will generate yield while also contributing to the liquidity and expansion of the broader Solana ecosystem. Crypto.com will also integrate additional Solana projects into its custody framework to increase institutional access to the network.

“STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision. Crypto.com is uniquely built to offer the comprehensive capabilities institutions require to safely and effectively manage digital asset treasuries.”

James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS, confirmed that the company views its treasury strategy as part of its mission to expand an open and efficient financial infrastructure. He highlighted that Crypto.com's platform, hosting over 150 million users, provides them with institutional-grade tools and liquidity to manage their Solana treasury and contribute to the growth of the Solana ecosystem. He acknowledged that collaboration is essential in aligning STSS's long-term corporate strategy with innovation at the forefront of digital finance.   

After the announcement, STSS stock on NASDAQ is up 2.68%, trading at $6.90, with a day range of $6.40 – $7.09. During the pre-markecrypto.com/custodyt session, the stock rallied up only 0.87% but has continued to climb, showing positive investor sentiment towards the firm's strategy. 

Crypto.com, founded in 2016, has built its reputation on regulatory compliance, security, and privacy. Its vision is Cryptocurrency in every wallet. Its institutional offerings include custody, liquidity services, and execution support for large asset managers. The firm has invited clients interested in custody solutions to submit requests via its portal.

STSS core operations lie in the medical and pharmaceutical packaging, while digital asset treasury management adds as a balance sheet strategy. The firm has expanded into the capital markets to accumulate and deploy SOL. According to Coingecko data, the firm is ranked fourth among the corporate institutions holding SOL with 2 million SOL tokens. 

Forward Industries has the highest SOL tokens among corporate treasuries, with 6.82 million SOL, representing approximately 1.25% of the total SOL supply. DeFi Development Corp. and  Upexi follow closely, with approximately 2.1 million SOL and 2.02 million SOL, respectively. Forward Industries, which launched this September as a $1.65 billion Solana-focused asset treasury, has helped Solana increase its gains this year, currently at 32% over the past 12 months: Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital back the fund. Solana's total locked value is currently $11.37 billion on DefiLlama.

TokenWorks' NFT Strategy tokens have officially launched on OpenSea, marking a significant milestone for the NFT and DeFi markets. These tokens, including the original Punk Strategy token (PUNKSTR), are now available for trading. OpenSea announced on September 30, offering a new way for traders to engage with NFTs.

NFT Strategy tokens combine NFT collections with decentralized finance (DeFi) models. These tokens aim to generate yield by managing assets with automated trading strategies. The ‘flywheel' mechanism is central to this strategy, automatically relisting NFTs at 1.2 times their purchase price. As a result, holders can earn passive income through the appreciation of these NFTs.

NFT Strategy tokens have revolutionized how traders view NFTs. These tokens are no longer just collectibles; they now serve as investment instruments. OpenSea's marketplace now hosts multiple NFT Strategy tokens, including PUNKSTR, PUDGYSTR, APESTR, TOADSTR, and BIRBSTR, among others. The newly launched rewards pool adds further value to these tokens, offering 20 ETH for select tokens.

The flywheel effect allows the strategy to function automatically, generating yield for holders without manual intervention. “PunkStrategy started as an art project, and turned into a whole new token meta,” TokenWorks shared. The project aims to provide a permissionless, safe, and efficient way for users to launch their own NFT Strategy tokens. By creating this model, TokenWorks ensures that value is returned to project creators, who have previously been excluded from royalties.

As part of the launch, OpenSea introduced a rewards pool for NFT Strategy tokens. The pool, valued at 20 ETH, is designed to incentivize trading of select tokens. This move is expected to increase liquidity and trading volume for the tokens on the platform.

NFT Strategy tokens allow investors to purchase NFTs in a way that offers potential returns. The automated trading system is designed to buy NFTs when their prices drop to a set floor and relist them at a higher value. When these NFTs are sold, the proceeds are used to purchase and burn the tokens, ensuring a continuous cycle of growth.

The PUNKSTR token has already shown impressive growth. Since its launch, it has reached a market cap of $87.2 million, with a daily trading volume of $1.5 million. Although the price dipped by 1.9% in the past 24 hours, it has surged by 392% since its debut on September 15.

TokenWorks charges a 10% fee on all PUNKSTR swaps on decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap. Of this, 8% is directed to an Ethereum treasury, while 1% supports the collection owners through royalties. The remaining 1% goes to the TokenWorks team.

Visa Inc. announced early Tuesday it will launch a cross-border payments service that will rely on stablecoins to fund transfers. The service, meant ultimately as an improvement on existing transfers that require users to commit capital in advance, will run on the payments company's Visa Direct real-time payments rails. It is expected to transition to “limited availability” by April, Visa says, though timing for the pilot itself was not announced.



The initiative represents the first time Visa has ventured into stablecoins for cross-border transactions, the company says. With the new service, “businesses can now prefund Visa Direct with stablecoins,” Visa says, though recipients can elect to receive funds in their local currency.
The service, Visa says, is expected to improve on existing cross-border technology while taking advantage of the immediacy of blockchain technology, which allows for programmability, or the setting of parameters for who can receive payments and in what amounts. “Cross-border rails were built decades ago and stablecoins can provide the necessary upgrade to make payments faster, cheaper, and programmable,” the network says in a release regarding the development. A spokesperson did not immediately respond to queries from Digital Transactions News.


The market potential could be substantial for the new service. Cross-border payments amounted to $190 trillion in 2023, the most recent year for which figures are available, with business-to-business flows accounting for the bulk of the volume. That potential has begun to attract payments players. MoneyGram International Inc. this month unveiled a mobile app featuring a U.S. dollar-backed stored-value account that will work with stablecoins as well as fiat currencies for cross-border transactions.



The target market for the new Visa service embraces banks, remitters, and businesses, according to Visa. These parties are seeking the “faster, more efficient liquidity management” offered by stablecoins, along with instant-transfer capability, Visa says. Stablecoins are blockchain-generated digital tokens whose value corresponds to the value of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar. In this way, stablecoins avoid the significant swings in value seen with other digital currencies.



Stablecoins gained a much higher profile among U.S. payments companies and banks this summer with the passage by Congress of the GENIUS Act, legislation whose rules and clarifications are expected to remove doubt or uncertainty among players looking to exploit stablecoins for various business purposes.

ByAJ Dhaliwal,

Contributor.

The New York Department of Financial Services issued guidance last Wednesday requiring banks engaged in cryptocurrency activities to use blockchain analytics tools, extending expectations first set for crypto firms three years ago to mainstream financial institutions.

The directive applies to all state-regulated banking organizations, including foreign bank branches, marking a watershed moment in how regulators approach digital asset oversight. What began as specialized compliance for virtual currency startups is now baseline supervision for any bank touching crypto markets.

Blockchain analytics refers to software that monitors, traces and assesses activity on public blockchains. The tools screen customer wallets, verify fund sources, detect illicit flows like money laundering or sanctions evasion, and compare customer behavior against risk profiles.

NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne Harris made the regulatory logic clear: “As traditional banking institutions expand into virtual currency activities, their compliance functions must adapt, onboarding new tools and technologies to mitigate new and different risks.”

The September guidance identified concrete use cases where banks should deploy blockchain analytics:

The list is not exhaustive. NYDFS emphasized that banks must tailor controls to their business models and risk appetites, and reassess frameworks regularly as markets evolve.

The regulatory arc moved quickly. In February 2018, NYDFS warned licensed virtual currency companies about fraud and market manipulation, requiring incident detection and 48-hour reporting. By May 2019, FinCEN issued an advisory highlighting how convertible virtual currencies enabled ransomware, money laundering and sanctions evasion.

The inflection came in April 2022, when Harris issued guidance requiring New York-licensed virtual currency businesses to adopt blockchain analytics as best practice for customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and sanctions screening. For crypto firms in New York, on-chain monitoring became a supervisory expectation.

Last week's guidance completes the circle. Any New York bank engaged in crypto-related activities must now integrate blockchain analytics into core risk management, not as experimental technology, but as fundamental infrastructure.

The shift matters beyond state lines. New York has long been the country's most influential financial regulator. Its BitLicense regime, established in 2015, set the first comprehensive rules for digital asset companies. Its enforcement actions shaped compliance norms nationwide, including a $48.5 million penalty against Paxos for AML deficiencies and a $40 million settlement with Block over bitcoin transaction monitoring failures.

By extending blockchain analytics requirements to mainstream banks, NYDFS is signaling the direction of national and likely global regulation. FinCEN already views virtual assets as vectors for ransomware and sanctions evasion. For banks with New York operations, state rules often become de facto national standards.

The ripple effect extends internationally. Regulators in Europe and Asia watch how New York sets expectations. Blockchain analytics could quickly evolve from state requirement to global compliance baseline.

Banks face significant operational challenges. Blockchain analytics cannot remain siloed. It must integrate with existing KYC, AML and suspicious activity reporting infrastructure. Institutions will need to license intelligence platforms, update written policies, train compliance officers and demonstrate deployment to regulators.

The transition raises practical questions. Banks must determine which vendors to use, how to staff blockchain monitoring teams, and how to document their risk assessments for examiners. Compliance officers accustomed to traditional transaction monitoring will need training on wallet analysis, mixers, privacy coins and other blockchain-specific risks.

Fintechs and compliance vendors stand to benefit. Demand for wallet-screening, sanctions checks and real-time monitoring tools will surge as banks close compliance gaps. Vendors offering seamless integration with legacy systems are well-positioned. The market for blockchain intelligence platforms, dominated by firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic and TRM Labs, could expand substantially.

Yet the shift also raises questions about privacy, proportionality and competitive intelligence. Continuous blockchain surveillance means banks can track customer transactions across multiple platforms and geographies. Regulators demand transparency, but banks must balance surveillance with customer trust and data protection obligations.

Banks should begin with a gap assessment. Compliance teams need to inventory existing crypto exposures, whether through direct offerings, customer activity or third-party relationships, and map those risks against current monitoring capabilities. That inventory determines vendor requirements and implementation timelines.

Policy updates come next. Written AML programs must explicitly address blockchain analytics deployment, including which tools will be used, how alerts will be escalated, and how findings integrate with suspicious activity reporting. NYDFS expects documented procedures, not ad hoc responses.

Training is critical. Compliance staff must understand blockchain-specific typologies: mixers and tumblers that obscure transaction trails, high-risk jurisdictions flagged through IP addresses, wallet addresses linked to sanctioned entities or darknet markets. Many banks will need external expertise to build this capability.

Finally, banks should establish regular review cycles. NYDFS noted that risk frameworks must adapt to “changing business models, new customer types, and new market entrants.” Blockchain analytics programs require ongoing calibration as crypto markets evolve and new threats emerge.

For institutions that move decisively, blockchain analytics offers more than regulatory compliance. It provides competitive intelligence on emerging risks and customer behaviors that traditional monitoring misses. For those that delay, the consequences are clear: enforcement actions, reputational damage and loss of regulatory trust in a market where bank supervisors now expect on-chain visibility as standard practice.

On 25 September 2025, it was announced that 9 european banks, including UniCredit, ING and CaixaBank, have launched a consortium to issue a euro stablecoin – a cryptocurrency with a value pegged to the euro.

While stablecoins are less volatile than regular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, they are not, despite their name, inherently stable. Allowing banks to create their own could further destabilise the eurozone's already turbulent economy, and will amplify the impacts of any future market crash.

Cryptocurrency, and stablecoins in particular, can be understood as digital casino tokens. Imagine you go to Casino A. At the entrance, they give you a token (with the label of the casino) in exchange for a euro. You spend a few hours in the casino, get lucky, and end the night with a Casino A token in your pocket.

The following night you go to Casino B. At the entrance, you realise that you don't have any cash, only the Casino A token. The cashier in Casino B asks his boss whether he can accept tokens from Casino A. The boss says, “of course, I know Casino A, it's a healthy business”. They then swap your Casino A token for a Casino B token. The Casino B boss accepts Casino A's token for one reason alone: trust.

There are two takeaways from this story. First, being able to use the token from Casino A in Casino B is a good thing. Otherwise, you would have needed to go to Casino A, convert the token into a euro, go back to Casino B, and exchange it for a Casino B token. Directly exchanging the tokens reduces transaction costs.

Second, tokens are substitutes for cash. If our hypothetical casinos trust one another, it doesn't matter who issues the token – a token from either casino is always worth one euro.

Problems arise when casinos start distrusting each other. In our example, the boss in Casino B could have said “you can accept it but at a discount, give him only half a Casino B-token.” They might even say “Casino A? No way, their tokens are worthless!”

Now, imagine that these tokens are digital instead of physical, and can be sent instantaneously, much like an email. This is a stablecoin.

As stated above, 9 eurozone banks are planning to issue a euro stablecoin. We can think of these banks as Casino A in our example. You will be able to go to one of these banks and purchase “their stablecoin” in exchange for one euro – most likely more than one euro (banks will want to earn a fee from it).

If everyone trusts these banks, one of “their coins” and one euro will have the same value. The main advantage of “their coin” is that you will be able to make transfers instantaneously. Today, a bank transfer, even within a country, may take up to three days.

A euro stablecoin might seem great, but there is one major condition to maintaining its value: everyone has to trust these particular banks. We know that this isn't always the case – people can quickly lose faith in banks, and banks often don't even trust each other. In a financial crisis, trust can vanish overnight.

We don't need to look far into the past for evidence of this. In 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, interbank lending (banks lending each other money) froze. Banks were not sure about the quality of other banks' assets, so they were afraid to lend them money. If they were afraid of lending a bank money, they certainly wouldn't be happy to accept “their coin” without a hefty discount.

Champions of stablecoins will undoubtedly argue that we don't need to worry because there will be regulations making sure that the banks have enough assets to back this token. The banks would be required to have liquid assets that match the value of the tokens they issue.

However, history has shown us that the price of assets can unexpectedly decline during a financial crisis. Before 2007, investors thought that subprime mortgage backed securities (MBS) were as safe as US government bonds. Similarly, Spanish government bonds were thought to be as safe as German bonds until August 2007.

This loss of trust led to the market crash of 2008, but it would have been far worse with stablecoins in the picture. If there had been stablecoins in 2008, holders of Spanish government debt (or subprime MBS) would not only have seen the value of their own assets collapse, but also those of all the people who had decided to place their savings in stablecoins. It would have multiplied the crash's already devastating impact – a “Great Great” Recession.

There are potential benefits to having digital currency. Imagine you have a deposit in the European Central Bank (ECB), and you can use its token to make instantaneous transactions (from buying coffee to transferring it to your daughter studying abroad). No one would worry that the ECB could the run out of euros, because they're the ones who print them!

A digital euro could also be adopted by other countries, which would make the euro a real contender against the US dollar as a reserve currency. The US has already precluded itself from making such a move – the Genius Act, which regulates stablecoins within the US, prohibits the Federal Reserve from creating digital dollars.

Under these circumstances, the choice seems obvious. An official, ECB-backed digital euro is a much better proposition than a consortium of private banks competing to promote their own, inherently unstable, digital coin.

Tether (CRYPTO: USDT)-backed stablecoin blockchain Plasma (CRYPTO: XPL) has retraced by over 33%, following its 100% price increase after the token launch on Sept. 25.

What Happened: Economist Alex Kruger explained that a ~40% drop over two days was driven by profit-taking from recently unlocked non-U.S. initial coin offering participants, with abnormally high funding pointing to continued spot selling. 

Once this eases, a strong upward move is expected.

Trader Altcoin Sherpa noted relentless selling with little rebound, taking a loss on perpetuals but holding spot XPL and targeting $1 as a buy zone.

 They cautioned that "catching falling knives" is risky, as momentum and supply control often outweigh fundamentals.

Trader Lord Durden highlighted that calling a "generational bottom" too early can be misleading. 

Key bullish triggers include support reclaims, retests, and a 4-hour downtrend breakout. 

Daily support at $1.11 is crucial, with further levels noted if price falls.

Why It Matters: Aave's deposits on the Plasma chain exceeded $6.5 billion since mainnet launch, making it the second-largest Aave deployment within a week.

On Sept. 25, Plasma launched its XPL token, introducing a digital bank, Plasma One, and distributing 25 million tokens to pre-depositors, regardless of their investment size. 

The distribution strategy assures broad and aligned ownership.

Despite the short-term drop, traders see Plasma as one of the few ways to gain direct stablecoin exposure in 2025, suggesting the project could be well-positioned for the coming year.

Key Takeaways

For over 50 years, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, has been the backbone of global finance. Its messaging rails connect over 11,000 institutions in more than 200 countries, enabling trillions of dollars to move across borders daily.

Yet, despite its global reach, the SWIFT system has long faced criticism for being slow, expensive, and limited to the operating hours of participating banks.

That status quo is starting to change. In contrast to speculation that SWIFT might adopt the XRP Ledger or Hedera Hashgraph for its blockchain transition, the organization has refuted that narrative by selecting Linea, an Ethereum layer-2, for its first major pilot.

In September 2025, SWIFT confirmed it is progressing with blockchain integration , testing shared ledger technology to enable real-time, 24/7 cross-border settlement. This development has the potential to reshape international payments by addressing long-standing inefficiencies and positioning SWIFT as a bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain-powered future.

This article explores SWIFT's embrace of blockchain, how a shared ledger model would work, the implications for banks and corporations, and what it could mean for the crypto and digital asset ecosystems.

Understanding what SWIFT actually does is essential to appreciating the significance of this pivot. Contrary to popular belief, SWIFT does not move money itself. Instead, it provides the secure messaging infrastructure that banks use to send instructions to one another.

For example, if a business in Germany wants to pay a supplier in Brazil, its bank will use SWIFT to send payment instructions to the supplier's bank. Funds move through corresponding accounts, often via intermediary banks, before landing in the final destination.

This reliance on messaging rather than direct settlement has historically made SWIFT reliable but slow:

What has kept SWIFT indispensable is its role as a neutral, global infrastructure. Unlike proprietary payment networks, SWIFT doesn't privilege one currency, bank, or jurisdiction over another. It operates as common rails that all institutions can trust, precisely because it is not owned by any single central bank or private entity.

However, the above inefficiencies contrast with the rise of blockchain-based payment systems (via stablecoins, for example), where transfers can settle in minutes, or even seconds, and operate 24/7.

The global payments landscape has changed dramatically in the past decade. Several forces have pushed SWIFT toward modernization :

At the core of SWIFT's blockchain initiative is the shared ledger. Instead of merely sending payment instructions, SWIFT would maintain or interoperate with a distributed ledger that records the actual transactions in near real time.

Over 30 global financial institutions (see image below) are collaborating with SWIFT to design a shared digital ledger, with the first use case targeting real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments.

Here's how it could work in practice:

This would transform SWIFT from a messaging-only system into a real-time settlement platform.

While many in the crypto community speculated that SWIFT's blockchain rails might run directly on XRP or other payment-native tokens, the organization's first major pilot is instead being conducted on Linea, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by ConsenSys.

The Linea pilot doesn't eliminate the possibility of XRP or HBAR playing roles in future settlement layers, but it does shift the competitive narrative. Rather than adopting a payments-specific token outright, SWIFT appears to be building a flexible, modular ledger capable of interfacing with multiple assets.

SWIFT's choice signals a pragmatic strategy: start with a programmable, privacy-preserving Ethereum L2, then extend interoperability outward. This path allows SWIFT to:

In short, SWIFT's move to Linea highlights its intent to remain the neutral backbone of global payments, integrating blockchain while maintaining optionality on which tokens ultimately power liquidity.

The implications of round-the-clock, blockchain-enabled payments are profound.

In short, a shared ledger brings global payments into the internet era: instant, programmable, and always available.

SWIFT's move reflects growing pressure from central banks, fintechs, and corporate clients to deliver faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments.

By leveraging distributed ledger technology (DLT), SWIFT aims to address many of the long-standing pain points in traditional correspondent banking.

Below are some of the potential benefits such a shift could bring:

Blockchain adoption is not without hurdles. SWIFT will need to navigate several risks:

SWIFT's blockchain adoption is not happening in isolation. It intersects with broader trends in digital finance:

BlackRock's BUIDL fund, a tokenized U.S. Treasury money market fund, has quickly grown into the largest on-chain RWA, surpassing $2.3 billion in assets. It demonstrates institutional appetite for tokenized products.

If SWIFT's blockchain rails support such tokenized funds, investors could move capital between banks, funds, and DeFi platforms instantly, with compliance built in.

This would blur the line between traditional settlement and on-chain liquidity management.

Regulation will determine the pace of adoption.

For SWIFT, alignment with these frameworks is essential. Without compliance, major banks will hesitate to onboard.

By 2030, if SWIFT's blockchain adoption succeeds, you could see:

SWIFT's embrace of blockchain marks a turning point in global finance. By moving beyond messaging to shared ledgers, SWIFT acknowledges that the old model of delayed, costly cross-border payments no longer fits the digital age.

This shift promises banks and institutions faster settlement, lower costs, and compatibility with tokenized assets and CBDCs. For the broader crypto ecosystem, it validates the power of blockchain for payments while introducing new competition from a legacy giant.

The road ahead is not without risks, from regulatory hurdles to adoption friction, but the momentum is undeniable.

As SWIFT modernizes its infrastructure, it has the potential to transform itself from a behind-the-scenes messaging utility into the backbone of 24/7 global payments in the blockchain era.

What is SWIFT, and why is it important?


SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the global messaging system banks use to send payment instructions to each other. It connects over 11,000 institutions in over 200 countries and facilitates trillions of dollars in transactions daily. While SWIFT doesn't move money, it's the critical “plumbing” for global payments.




What does it mean for SWIFT to use blockchain?


Instead of just sending payment messages, SWIFT plans to use a shared ledger where transactions themselves are recorded and settled in near real time. This would transform SWIFT into a true settlement network, not just a messaging one.




How would a shared ledger model work in practice?


Banks could tokenize balances and settle transfers instantly on-chain. Smart contracts would automate compliance checks, and the ledger could interoperate with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Every transaction would be securely time-stamped and auditable.




How does this impact the crypto and digital asset ecosystem?


SWIFT's blockchain rails could support regulated stablecoins, tokenized deposits, and real-world assets. This validates the blockchain approach while introducing competition for crypto-native payment networks like RippleNet or Stellar.

The US SEC just tore down one of crypto's longest-standing hurdles. By scrapping the need for 19b-4 filings, the agency has opened the door to a flood of exchange-traded funds that could now be approved ‘absurdly fast.'

Analysts say approvals could arrive in days instead of months… A timeline that has already lit up the altcoin market. With Chairman Paul Atkins declaring crypto a top priority, and speculation swirling around $XRP ETFs, sentiment has turned sharply bullish.

Investors are now asking the obvious: if Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are just the beginning, which altcoins stand to gain next? The altcoin market tends to react strongly to fresh liquidity and institutional flows, and projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Snorter Token ($SNORT), and Aster ($ASTER) are poised to ride that momentum.

Crypto ETFs represent far more than a convenient way to buy coins. They're a stamp of legitimacy from Wall Street, opening the gates for pension funds, registered investment advisors, and institutional allocators to funnel billions into digital assets.

Historically, ETF issuers needed both a 19b-4 and an S-1: a two-step process that often dragged on for months. Now, thanks to new generic listing standards, only an S-1 is required.

Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas notes how odds are really 100% now, and the SEC could move any day if it wants to accelerate approvals.

Combined with the SEC's clear signal that crypto is a ‘priority,' this shift puts altcoins squarely in focus.

Which projects actually stand out? The next wave of capital won't just chase established names. It's also likely to flow toward new ecosystems and utility-driven tokens, like $HYPER, $SNORT, and $ASTER.

If ETFs accelerate Bitcoin adoption by drawing in institutional capital, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will amplify what you can actually do with that liquidity.

By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine, Hyper plans to transform Bitcoin with a high-speed Layer-2, opening the door for instant payments, DeFi applications, and meme coin experimentation – areas the base chain has never been able to support efficiently.



The process will be straightforward: you bridge $BTC in, it's minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2, and transactions settle back to Bitcoin Layer-1 via zero-knowledge proofs. That means you keep Bitcoin's security while gaining sub-second speed and near-zero fees. In practice, Bitcoin Hyper will make $BTC usable the way $ETH is for smart contracts.

For early buyers, that's a chance to earn yield while positioning for what some call Bitcoin's ‘Ethereum 2017 moment,' a shift from static store of value into a dynamic execution layer.

If ETFs draw institutions into Bitcoin, Hyper is where retail traders, builders, and meme coin culture will follow.

Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper presale before the next price increase.

ETF approvals may bring big institutions into Bitcoin and Ethereum, but many retail traders are building their own playground elsewhere – inside Telegram.

That's where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in. It will power a full-stack trading bot that lives directly in a Telegram chat, giving you the ability to swap, snipe new launches, set stop-losses, copy trades, and check your portfolio without ever leaving the app.



The edge here is speed and cost. Holding $SNORT will cut trading fees down to 0.85%, lower than major competitors at 1.5%.

Its beta tests have also flagged 85% of rugpulls and honeypots, while its instant-sniping tool will let you buy meme tokens the moment a pool goes live. For anyone who's ever been front-run by a bot or whale, that's a serious edge.

A heads up, though – time is of the essence, as there are just 19 days left before the presale ends.

The trading bot market itself is booming, forecast to reach $200B+ by 2035, and bots like Bonk Bot have already proven the appetite on Solana. Snorter blends that same speed with meme coin branding, but beneath the humor is a real piece of trading infrastructure.

Join the official Snorter Token presale before it's too late.

If ETFs are greasing the rails for institutional inflows, decentralized infrastructure is the next frontier for that liquidity.

Aster ($ASTER) has quickly emerged as one of the biggest names in perpetuals trading, topping DeFiLlama's charts with $25M in fees and over $42B in daily volume earlier this week. Fresh data shows Aster handling $66.4B in 24h perps volume, with 30-day totals north of $356B. That's a staggering figure for a DEX barely out of the gate.

Source: DefiLlama

Token-wise, $ASTER is currently trading around $1.78 with a $2.96B market cap and $1.09B in daily volume. Its fully diluted valuation stands at $14.31B, a massive leap from just $560M at launch.

Backing from YZi Labs (ex-Binance Labs) and an open endorsement from former Binance CEO CZ himself – who said Aster competes with Binance, but helps $BNB – only adds weight. For traders priced out of CEXs, $ASTER could become the DEX that absorbs ETF-fueled flows once they filter into DeFi.

Buy $ASTER today through MEXC and other leading platforms.

 The collaboration targets Circle's euro-pegged EURC and USDC stablecoins, with an initial focus on trading on Deutsche Börse's 3DX. 

German securities marketplace Deutsche Börse has partnered with USDC stablecoin issuer Circle to collaborate on stablecoin adoption in Europe.

Deutsche Börse Group and Circle Internet Group have signed a memorandum of understanding to integrate Circle's stablecoins within Deutsche Börse's financial market infrastructure, according to a joint announcement on Tuesday.

The collaboration targets Circle's euro-pegged EURC (EURC) stablecoin, as well as its dollar-pegged USDC (USDC), with an initial focus on listing and trading on 360T's digital exchange 3DX and via Crypto Finance, both part of Deutsche Börse.

The announcement comes amid reports that European authorities are considering a ban on multi-issuer stablecoins, raising questions about the potential impact on companies like Circle and Paxos.

According to the announcement, Circle and Deutsche Börse's collaboration is enabled by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, which entered into full force in late 2024.

Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to comply with MiCA rules, its co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire announced in July 2024.

“We're planning to advance the use of regulated stablecoins across Europe's market infrastructure — reducing settlement risk, lowering costs, and improving efficiency for banks, asset managers and the wider market,” Allaire said in the announcement, adding:

In addition to trading on Deutsche Börse's 3DX, the partnership aims to enable custody through Deutsche Börse's post-trade business Clearstream, leveraging the German entity Crypto Finance as sub-custodian.

Circle's partnership with Deutsche Börse came amid Bloomberg reporting on European authorities considering a ban on multi-issuance stablecoins, or tokens issued in Europe and overseas under a single brand.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report suggested that the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), a European Central Bank (ECB)-linked body for macroprudential oversight, passed a recommendation to ban multi-issued stablecoins last week.

“The ESRB guidance, which was approved by a high-powered board of central bank governors and EU officials, is not legally binding,” the report said, adding that it would still add pressure to authorities to implement restrictions.

Although European authorities have not issued any formal statements about a multi-issuance ban, a senior Bank of Italy official argued last week that stablecoin multi-issuance poses multiple risks to the EU, including legal, operational, liquidity issues and more.

While Circle managed to comply with MiCA, Tether — the issuer of USDt (USDT), the world's largest stablecoin by market cap — explicitly refused to comply with the framework, citing local reserve requirements.

Local companies have been rushing to adopt stablecoins, as some officials admitted that MiCA had a limited impact on the adoption of compliant stablecoins in Europe as of May 2025.

On Tuesday, Société Générale-Forge, the crypto arm of French Société Générale, announced the deployment of its USD CoinVertible (USDCV) and EUR CoinVertible (EURCV) stablecoins on the decentralized finance protocols, Morpho and Uniswap.

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is set to become a cornerstone of Japan's emerging blockchain ecosystem, following a new strategic partnership announced September 30, 2025, between SBI Ripple Asia and Tobu Top Tours, a major Japanese travel agency.

The partnership aims to build a payment platform that not only uses digital tokens but also connects them with NFTs, opening doors for creative new use cases

XRPL Partnership to Launch in 2026

SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between Ripple and SBI Holdings, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Tobu Top Tours. Their shared goal is to launch a new platform by the first half of 2026. 

Each partner company will be able to issue its own unique tokens, which can then be linked with NFTs carrying added functions. XRPL will power a new payment platform that links unique tokens with NFTs.

NFTs as Digital Souvenirs and Vouchers

One of the most exciting ideas being explored is NFTs that double as “digital souvenirs” or discount vouchers for future travel bookings. This new platform leverages XRPL's speed, low fees, and eco-friendly design, proven earlier this year when SBI minted over 900 Expo 2025 NFTs. 

Now with 28.2 million visitors expected at events like the Osaka World Expo, this system shows real potential for large-scale use.

For Tobu Top Tours, it's a new way to engage travelers, while also supporting Japan's fan economy and local communities.

Beyond Travel: Wider Use Cases

The platform won't be limited to tourism. Customers could eventually use it for dining, shopping, and regional services, making payments more seamless while also unlocking new possibilities for businesses and local communities. 

By tying tokens and NFTs together, the project is aiming to deliver more than just faster transactions, it's about creating real-world utility.

XRP Ledger's Growing Capabilities

The initiative represents a departure from traditional NFTs as pure digital art collectibles. Since the introduction of NFT support in 2022 through XLS-20, developers have been able to build features like royalties and anti-spam protection. 

More recently, DynamicNFTs (XLS-46) have enabled NFTs that can change over time, opening new opportunities in gaming, ticketing, and identity solutions.

FAQs

The partnership will launch a blockchain payment platform on XRPL, using tokens and NFTs to enhance travel experiences and community engagement.

SBI Ripple Asia and Tobu Top Tours plan to launch the platform in the first half of 2026, aiming to integrate tokens, NFTs, and seamless digital payments.

NFTs will work as digital souvenirs or discount vouchers, giving travelers unique perks and interactive ways to engage with destinations and local services.

XRPL offers fast, low-cost, eco-friendly transactions, making it ideal for issuing tokens and NFTs that provide real-world travel and lifestyle benefits.

NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025

Rebranding highlights the company's independent growth and expanded focus on driving TradFi's transition to DeFi

NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Provenance Blockchain Labs (ProvLabs) today announces its rebranding to NU Blockchain Technologies (NU). The rebrand reflects the company's independent growth and expanded focus on multi-chain asset distribution opportunities while aggressively supporting the industry-defining financial rails on Provenance Blockchain, the leading blockchain for Real World Assets (RWAs), with over $16B in TVL. 



 



NU will continue to enhance its core API and managed SaaS services, including ProvConnect and BlockVault. These tools make it easy for Web 2.0 asset issuers to access the growing ecosystem on Provenance Blockchain and adopt blockchain technology at scale. More than a dozen issuers are currently building with NU's assistance, including infineo, a life insurance firm with more than $625M in on-chain policies. 

NU's expanded focus is driven by NUVA (NUVA.finance), a vault marketplace that powers blockchain native institutional-quality financial products that are liquid, composable, transparent, and accessible. Launching Q4, 2025, NUVA users can select from a curated group of high-quality yielding assets while NUVA issuers get access to new distribution channels across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana and Base. NUVA is supported by NU Digital, a subsidiary of NU and a joint venture with Animoca Brands, the leading Hong Kong based Web3 builder and investor.

"During NU's first year of operation, we successfully built world-class digital infrastructure necessary to bring institutional quality assets on-chain," said Anthony Moro, CEO of NU. "Now, with NUVA, we are every asset issuer's one stop, full lifecycle, blockchain solution. The rebranding to NU does a better job of recognizing our more expansive role, and better aligns our family of brands"

"I'm excited by the continued developments at NU," said Mike Cagney, Executive Chairman of Figure Technologies and member of NU's Board of Directors. "The company is innovating in ways that are accretive to Provenance Blockchain, and we at Figure look forward to seeing YLDS and Democratized Prime assets distributed through NUVA, using NU's vault infrastructure."

We're pleased with NU's continued progress following their strategic spin out late last year," said June Ou, Executive Director of Provenance Blockchain Foundation. "We look forward to having them as part of the Provenance Blockchain ecosystem to help establish Provenance as the leading platform for financial services."

From structuring advice and mission-critical APIs and SaaS services, to broad, multi-chain Web3 distribution through the NUVA marketplace, NU is perfectly positioned to help bring trillions of dollars of assets on-chain.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund has overtaken Deribit as the largest venue for BTC$113,273.25 options in an indication of how accreditation and institutional capital is reshaping crypto derivatives trading.

Open interest in IBIT contracts hit nearly $38 billion after Friday's expiry, versus $32 billion on Deribit, which had dominated the market since 2016. The flip comes less than a year after IBIT options went live in November.

IBIT, already the world's largest spot bitcoin ETF, with $84 billion in assets, has quickly become a magnet for institutional flows. Its growth cycle is reinforcing liquidity and legitimacy, pulling activity into regulated markets that once sat firmly offshore.

Deribit — bought by Coinbase for $2.9 billion in August — remains favored by crypto-native traders. But IBIT's surge signals a structural power shift as options once driven by high-leverage offshore venues are increasingly anchored in the U.S.

Meanwhile, Checkonchain data shows IBIT ETF's leverage ratio has reached 45%, near all-time highs.

The ETF holds 770,000 BTC, while options open interest stands at 340,000 BTC, meaning nearly half of IBIT's underlying exposure is mirrored in derivatives. This highlights the scale of speculative positioning tied to the ETF, though it is debatable whether this fully reflects market leverage.

IBIT now accounts for 45% of global BTC options open interest dominance, overtaking Deribit at 41.9%, with CME at just 6% and other exchanges making up the rest.

This concentration indicates that IBIT and Deribit together command almost 90% of the BTC options market.

The data suggests two takeaways: IBIT's growing role in derivatives trading is reshaping the market, and institutional platforms like CME remain small when compared with ETF-driven and retail-dominated venues.

Chainlink said it developed a technical process allowing banks to interact with tokenized investment funds through Swift, the interbank messaging system that underpins much of traditional finance.

In a pilot with UBS, Chainlink's Runtime Environment (CRE) processed subscriptions and redemptions for a tokenized fund using ISO 20022 messages, the international standard for financial messaging used by Swift.

The blockchain workflows were triggered directly from UBS's existing systems after CRE received the Swift messages. It then triggered the subscriptions or redemptions in the Chainlink Digital Transfer Agent, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

The setup lets banks access blockchain infrastructure using tools they already use, like Swift, while Chainlink's infrastructure handles the rest.

The pilot builds on previous work from Project Guardian, a tokenization initiative led by Singapore's central bank. The latest development adds in interoperability that enables institutions to use Swift to trigger on-chain events.

The launch comes after Chainlink announced a separate pilot with 24 global banks and financial infrastructure providers like DTCC and Euroclear. That project used Chainlink's tools and AI to extract and standardize data from corporate action announcements, a process that currently costs the industry an estimated $58 billion annually.

A broad V-shaped day: Fidelity funds dominated while Ark, Grayscale and Bitwise added; flows bolster risk appetite after weeks of outflows.

US-listed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew more than $1 billion in net inflows on Sept. 29, signaling renewed investor confidence after weeks of heavy outflows.

The sharp turnaround also came as the broader crypto market sentiment improved and prices staged a notable rebound.

Data from SoSoValue shows that Bitcoin ETFs captured $521.95 million in inflows, with Fidelity's FBTC accounting for the bulk of activity. The fund pulled in $298.70 million, which is more than half of the day's net total.

Other major contributors included Ark 21Shares' ARKB, which saw $62.18 million in inflows, Grayscale's BTC and Bitwise's BITB, which contributed approximately $47 million each, and Invesco's BTCO attracted $35.34 million in fresh capital.

Meanwhile, VanEck's HODL added $30.66 million, while Grayscale's GBTC brought in $26.91 million. Smaller but notable gains came from Franklin Templeton's EZBC at $16.51 million and Valkyrie's BRRR at $4.03 million.

Notably, BlackRock's IBIT, the dominant Bitcoin ETF, was the only product to register losses, with $46.64 million in outflows. This marked the fund's third day of withdrawals in September.

On the other hand, Ethereum ETFs saw even stronger inflows on the day, totaling $546.96 million. Fidelity's FETH led the charge with $202.18 million, followed by BlackRock's ETHA at $154.20 million.

Grayscale's ETH and ETHE added $99.84 million and $22.77 million, respectively, while Bitwise's ETHW saw $36.52 million in inflows.

The inflows coincided with a sharp recovery in asset prices, reinforcing the view that institutional demand remains highly sensitive to market signals.

Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, pointed out that Bitcoin climbed back to $114,000, erasing much of the prior week's losses and forming a sharp V-shaped recovery.

According to him, BTC investors consistently defended the $110,000 to $111,000 range, creating a sequence of higher lows that strengthened bullish conviction.

Misir continued that the resistance lies between $115,000 and $116,300. He noted that consolidation in that zone is likely before any push higher, but stressed that as long as Bitcoin trades above $109,000, momentum remains constructive.

The European Central Bank (ECB) envisions using DLT in the future for a wholesale CBDC and many of today's core central bank functions, such as collateral management and monetary policy. That's provided tokenization takes off, according to Holger Neuhaus who leads the ECB's Project Appia. Although he's pretty optimistic given the strong participation in ECB DLT settlement trials. He was talking on a panel at Swift's Sibos event yesterday. 

Appia is the longer term track of two DLT central bank money payment iterations, with Project Pontes (bridge) as the interim solution that is expected to launch pilots in Q3 of 2026. Pontes builds on the 2024 ECB wholesale DLT settlement trials that involved 61 private institutions. It uses elements of the three trial solutions from the central banks of France, Germany and Italy. Germany's Trigger solution and France's wholesale CBDC both link to the TARGET2 payment system and are the two Pontes central bank money options. Italy is providing the Hashlink interoperability solution that will be used by the German and French offerings to link to other DLT networks.

Neuhaus described Pontes as a bring-your-own-market-DLT approach, highlighting the potential for fragmentation. “Are we actually inducing the risk that there's more fragmentation. Yes, clearly so,” said Neuhaus. “There could be a risk of a proliferation of different market DLTs that don't talk to each other (and) are not interoperable. What would it mean for market liquidity?”

Sharps Technology has partnered with Crypto.com to manage a $400 million Solana-based digital asset treasury, marking a major move toward institutional adoption in the Solana ecosystem.

Sharps Technology has announced a strategic partnership with Crypto.com to manage its $400 million Solana treasury. This collaboration combines STSS's long-term digital asset vision with Crypto.com's robust custody infrastructure and deep liquidity tools. Together, they aim to enhance institutional access to Solana while generating returns through ecosystem investments.

https://t.co/vCNztATkNg and @stsssol partner to strengthen Solana ecosystem growth through institutional treasury solutions. Read more 👉 https://t.co/mJBs0jra9U pic.twitter.com/HOOS08TdsR

Sharps Technology, a publicly traded company, has amassed over 2 million SOL tokens as part of its treasury diversification strategy. Instead of simply holding these assets, STSS is now implementing a dynamic approach using Crypto.com's institutional infrastructure. The platform will provide secure custody, discreet OTC execution, and access to Solana-native investments.

The move signals a shift toward active, yield-generating treasury strategies in the crypto space, particularly in blockchain ecosystems with strong growth like Solana.

The partnership is not just about asset management. STSS intends to actively engage with the Solana DeFi ecosystem through staking, liquidity provision, and validator support. These actions are designed to reinforce the network's infrastructure while allowing STSS to extract value from its holdings.

According to James Zhang, Strategic Advisor to STSS:

Partnering with Crypto.com provides us with institutional-grade tools and liquidity access to responsibly manage one of the largest Solana treasuries, while also contributing to the growth of the Solana ecosystem.

Crypto.com also plans to integrate several Solana projects into its platform. With over 150 million users, this integration could substantially improve access for institutional capital, easing previous barriers caused by the lack of qualified custodians.

This partnership could serve as a model for how traditional finance entities approach digital asset management. By aligning capital deployment with infrastructure support, STSS is making its treasury an active component of blockchain growth.

Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, highlighted the significance of the collaboration: “STSS has an ambitious vision for its digital asset treasury strategy, and we are excited to partner with them to help realize that vision.” He noted that Crypto.com's platform is “uniquely built” to offer the comprehensive tools institutions need for safe, effective digital asset strategies.

In my experience, we've seen plenty of companies dive into crypto with hype and little structure. What stands out here is how intentional and sophisticated STSS is with their approach. They're not just buying tokens. They're actively building a strategy that contributes to the health of the Solana ecosystem while extracting value. This feels like the kind of institutional involvement crypto has needed for years. If more firms take this route, we might finally see meaningful bridges form between traditional finance and blockchain innovation.

Ethereum price prediction is gaining traction this week after the SWIFT network announced a partnership with Consensys, a blockchain software company that builds infrastructure on Ethereum. 

The partnership will expand to 30 major financial institutions, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, to create a new way for real-time cross-border payments.

Experts believe that if the prototype processes even a small share of Swift's on-chain volume, it could provide a major boost.

Meanwhile, the ETH price has regained the $4,000 psychological mark, continuing the rebound started on Friday. Over the past four sessions, the price has surged by over 10%, renewing momentum. 

As the market rebounds after a correction, another asset is quietly gaining traction in the meme sector: Maxi Doge. This meme coin is challenging established players with momentum, community strength, and massive rewards, and has already raised $2.62 million, demonstrating strong investor confidence. 

The SWIFT network, a company that connects more than 11,500 financial institutions globally, is collaborating with the second-largest blockchain software giant, Consensys, and other major firms to develop a prototype for real-time, 24/7 cross-border payments.

SWIFT's existing infrastructure currently processes roughly 53 million financial messages, and the partnership aims to enhance the infrastructure by integrating blockchain for cheaper, faster, and more efficient cross-border transactions.

In the press release, the company said, “It is envisaged that the ledger—a secure, real-time log of transactions between financial institutions—will record, sequence and validate transactions and enforce rules through smart contracts.”

In a blog post, Consensys said, “Swift's plans to extend its network with blockchain infrastructure is a defining moment for both traditional and decentralized finance. It reflects a convergence, not a clash.”

After reaching a new monthly low of $3,828, the Ethereum price has witnessed a sharp surge to $4,245. The altcoin's price mirrors the broader market rebound and ecosystem developments.

Data from CoinMarketCap shows ETH has surged 1.85% in the last 24 hours, and the weekly chart has turned green after a few weeks of decline. The 24-hour trading volume has also surged by 48% to $38.53 billion, showing increased activity by traders. 

Crypto analyst Ted Pillow noted the price surge was a result of short positions getting closed. He believes that for ETH to maintain its upward momentum, it must sustain a price above the $4,250 mark. On a bearish note, the analyst expects the price to fall to $3,600-$3,800 levels if it fails to reclaim the upper levels. 

$ETH had a pump today, but mostly due to short positions getting closed.

For more upside, Ethereum needs to reclaim the $4,250 level.

While the altcoin has increased on a weekly level, the monthly chart is still trading in the red. Investors should watch for a significant increase in trading volume as a potential sign of a rebound. The Relative Strength Index and Fear and Greed Index have surged, showing control and support for the uptrend. 

While the Ethereum price rebounds after correction, Maxi Doge is among the new coins that have sustained momentum even in a high-volatility environment. Its ongoing presale has been a huge success with more than $2.62 million raised in record time. 



MAXI is not an ordinary meme coin; it blends gym-bro bravado with high-stakes 1,000x leverage trading. The presentation is a bulked-up Shiba Inu with red eyes, hustling to dethrone Dogecoin as the best meme coin. 

After years in DOGE's shadow, Maxi Doge is stepping out with a mission to climb higher with every pump.

Here's why many are calling Maxi Doge the best crypto to buy now:

While established tokens face market volatility, Maxi Doge stands out with strong fundamentals and a clear mission for the meme sector. Its blend of degen trading mentality and massive hype among Gen-Z traders makes it a standout contender in the market.

Singapore and the United Arab Emirates have climbed to the top of recent crypto adoption lists, with different reports placing the city-state and the Gulf federation among the most digital currency-friendly places on earth.

According to Henley & Partners and surveys compiled by industry trackers, Singapore holds the number one spot in some indexes, while the UAE posts some of the highest ownership rates recorded.

Based on reports, about 24.4% of Singapore's population is estimated to own crypto, and the UAE shows about 25.3% ownership — figures that are far above the global average.

Singapore's lead is tied to its mix of clear rules and strong finance infrastructure. Regulatory sandboxes, licensing for exchanges, and a banking system that works with digital currency firms are often cited as factors.

Meanwhile, the ApeX Protocol study shows that nearly a quarter of Singaporeans—24.4%—own digital assets, a figure that has more than doubled from 11% the year before.

This surge is also mirrored online, with the country generating about 2,000 crypto searches per 100,000 people, the highest level seen anywhere in the world.



The UAE is pushing hard to attract users and companies. Based on reports, the country scored a perfect 10/10 on tax-friendliness in one index, and its zero-tax stance on trading, staking, mining, or selling bitcoin across many emirates is a major draw.

Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and other local initiatives have created licensing paths and special zones for digital asset firms.



Henley & Partners lists the UAE among the top jurisdictions for crypto wealth, often placing it in the top five for investor-friendly climates. Those policies appear to help explain why roughly a quarter of people in the UAE are reported to hold crypto assets.

Reports place the global number of crypto users in the hundreds of millions — around 562 million by some counts — but that figure hides big differences. Some countries show high ownership because many people treat crypto as an investment.

In others, crypto is used more for payments or savings. Methodologies differ: some studies count any wallet with activity, others rely on surveys asking people if they own crypto.

For investors, late 2025 presents an environment characterized by shifts in interest rates, regulatory harmonization, ETF approvals, and the introduction of new stablecoin and custody frameworks.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The Federal Reserve, US market regulators, and global financial institutions are simultaneously recalibrating their policies, creating a convergence that is reshaping the landscape for both traditional and crypto markets.

For investors, the final quarter of 2025 presents an environment characterized by shifts in interest rates, regulatory harmonization, ETF approvals, and the introduction of new stablecoin and custody frameworks.

The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points on Sept. 17, moving the target range to 4.00% to 4.25%.

According to the Fed's September Summary of Economic Projections, policymakers expect the federal funds rate to fall further to around 3.50%–3.75% by December.

That path implies two additional 25 basis-point reductions before year-end. Fidelity interpreted the dots similarly, noting that most participants see three total cuts in 2025.

For investors, this signals a shift from restrictive to neutral policy, which in turn shapes expectations for credit spreads, equity valuations, and crypto liquidity. Parallel to monetary easing, US regulators are advancing a synchronized framework for digital assets.

September brought a joint statement by the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), clarifying that registered exchanges may list spot crypto commodities.

This was followed by a CFTC announcement on Sept. 23 about a new program enabling tokenized collateral in derivatives markets, while the SEC Chair Paul Atkins pledged an “innovation exemption” for digital assets by year-end.

On Sept. 29, the regulators organized a roundtable to advance harmonized frameworks for perpetual contracts, prediction markets, and margining.

The public crypto strategy of the President Donald Trump administration reinforced this regulatory realignment.

Regulatory coordination coincides with an acceleration in crypto ETF approvals.

The SEC recently adopted generic listing standards, removing the requirement for individual 19b-4 filings for token-specific ETFs.

On Sept. 29, journalist Eleanor Terrett reported that the SEC had asked issuers to withdraw their earlier filings for Solana, XRP, Litecoin, Cardano, and Dogecoin ETFs, as the new rules now automatically cover these assets.

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart had previously highlighted on Sept. 26 that issuers updated their Solana ETF prospectuses.

Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on Sept. 29 that the odds of approval for altcoin ETFs are “really 100% now,” adding that new altcoin ETFs could come any day.

The regulatory backdrop extends beyond ETFs. In the US, the GENIUS Act now provides a federal framework for payment stablecoins, and the Treasury has opened a formal comment period.

Market participants, including Circle and Coinbase, have welcomed the rules as a way to integrate stablecoins into payments and derivatives markets.

Abroad, the Bank of England and the country's largest lenders are advancing a pilot to tokenize customer deposits, prioritizing this approach over bank-issued stablecoins.

HSBC, NatWest, and Lloyds are experimenting with tokenized deposits for payments and settlements, while European lenders are preparing a euro-denominated stablecoin.

The convergence of monetary easing, coordinated US regulation, ETF market access, and new stablecoin frameworks creates a rare alignment of macro and micro forces.

For investors, opportunities include repositioning portfolios toward risk assets that benefit from rate cuts, accessing a wider range of crypto ETFs without the complexity of offshore vehicles, and leveraging tokenized collateral for improved capital efficiency in derivatives.

At the same time, risks persist. The Fed's cuts remain conditional on labor market stability, while SEC and CFTC rules are still in draft phases.

Investors should prepare accordingly for the fourth quarter, positioning themselves for continued Fed easing, monitoring ETF product rollouts as access points for both institutional and retail flows, and assessing regulatory clarity as a key determinant of custody, margining, and collateral strategies.

The integration of crypto and traditional finance is no longer theoretical. It is occurring through deliberate policy, new products, and institutional adoption, creating a market structure where opportunity and risk are inseparable.

Hyperliquid's native token HYPE is approaching the $50 mark after a 24-hour 7.7% increase to approximately $47, driven by the launch of 4,600 Hypurr NFTs on the HyperEVM. The collection launched strongly with a floor near $68,700 and about $45 million in first-day volume.

One rare piece, Hypurr #21, sold for 9,999 HYPE ($467,000), stressing strong demand among NFT traders and Hyperliquid's early community. Most NFTs were allocated to participants from the November 2024 Genesis Event, with some allocations also made to the Hyper Foundation and core contributors.

Hyperliquid's network excitement coincides with increased derivatives activity: daily spot trading rose, futures volume increased approximately 13.9% to $1.8 billion, and open interest grew to $2.28 billion, indicating active short-term trading interest even if longer-term confidence remains cautious.

Technically, $50 is the immediate resistance to surpass; $44 serves as a strong support level. With RSI near 46, MACD negative, and Bollinger Bands tightening, traders are watching for volatility to expand, which could shape the next move.

Institutional chatter fuels optimism: ARK Invest's Cathie Wood recently compared Hyperliquid's growth to that of early Solana, placing the DEX firmly on the radar of big money. Behind the scenes, the team continues to broaden its defenses.

Hyperliquid launched permissionless spot quote assets on mainnet, with USDH (backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries) serving as the first quote. This move enables community-driven listings through Dutch auctions and introduces HYPE/USDH pairs, expanding liquidity while lowering barriers.



Launched in February 2025, the HyperEVM programmability layer connects smart contracts with the chain's HyperBFT consensus and HyperCore liquidity, allowing developers to create lending markets, vault tokenization, and liquid staking.

Tailwinds aside, investors face genuine risks. A rival perpetuals platform, Aster, briefly surpassed Hyperliquid's weekly volume after the token launch, highlighting intense competition in the DEX space.

Security concerns arose when researcher ZachXBT reported the theft of eight Hypurr NFTs worth $400K shortly after launch, another reminder to improve wallet security. Most importantly, a pending $12B HYPE unlock threatens price discovery; additional supply might pressure prices if not absorbed by demand.

To sum this up, if HYPE exceeds $50 on high volume, bulls could target a retest of the $59 all-time high from Sept. 18 and might move into the $55–$65 range next. Falling below $44 could cause a drop into the high-$30s.

Dated archaeological sites are absent in northern Arabia between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and 10,000 years ago (ka), signifying potential population abandonment prior to the onset of the Holocene humid period. Here we present evidence that playas became established in the Nefud desert of northern Arabia between ~16 and ~13 ka, the earliest reported presence of surface water following the hyper-aridity of the LGM. These fresh water sources facilitated human expansions into arid landscapes as shown by new excavations of stratified archaeological sites dating to between 12.8 and 11.4 ka. During the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, human populations exploited a network of seasonal water bodies - marking locations and access routes with monumental rock engravings of camels, ibex, wild equids, gazelles, and aurochs. These communities made distinctive stone tool types showing ongoing connections to the late Epipalaeolithic and Pre-Pottery Neolithic populations of the Levant.

At the end of the last Ice Age, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~25–20 ka) ushered in harsher, cooler climatic conditions that resulted in extreme aridity across the Middle East, causing widespread dune mobilisation and de-population on the Arabian peninsula1,2,3,4. In the “Fertile Crescent”, the Pleistocene-Holocene transition brought a return to more favourable climatic conditions. The Natufian (~14.6 − 11.5 ka) is associated with intensive plant exploitation, and the widespread adoption of sedentism and food storage1,2,5. The domestication of plants and animals commenced in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (PPN) A and B, respectively (~11.7–10.5 ka and 10.5–8.25 ka)1,6,7,8. These pronounced socio-economic shifts went hand in hand with the emergence of a rich symbology expressed in carvings, figurines, and architecture1,9. Notably, distinct geographic differences formed across the late Epipalaeolithic and the emerging Neolithic. In the Mediterranean woodland zones of the Levant, populations were mostly sedentary, while in the more arid regions of the Negev, Sinai, and eastern Jordan, populations were more mobile and reliant on hunting5,6. How climate and population dynamics during this crucial period in human history unfolded further south, on the Arabian Peninsula, is poorly understood.

The presence of human populations in northern Arabia has been primarily linked with episodic humid phases10,11. Evidence from palaeolake deposits and associated pollen and molluscs indicate increased rainfall and vegetation during the Holocene humid period, ~10–6 ka11,12,13,14,15,16. Several sites document human occupation of the region between 10 and 8 ka, such as in the Umm Jirsan lava tube in the Harrat Khaybar17, and the sites of Al Rabyah12, Jebel Qattar18, and Jebel Oraf19, all located in the Jubbah oasis. Radiocarbon ages from Neolithic sites across north-western Arabia suggest a peak in human activity between 7.6 and 6.8 ka, which corresponds with the end of the Holocene humid period19,20,21,22,23. Neolithic communities built large stone structures, including large hunting traps known as desert kites, and large rectangular ritual structures called mustatils, which stretch up to 620 m in length21,23,24. Pastoral communities also created a rich record of rock art, with thousands of depictions of wild animals such as ibex and livestock such as cattle. These are typically stylised, with human figures being elongated with extremely thin arms, and animal depictions with exaggerated horns25,26.

Prior to the onset of the Holocene humid period, little is known about the relatively arid period spanning the end of the Pleistocene and the earliest Holocene in Arabia. An absence of dated archaeological sites has led to a presumed absence of human occupation of the Arabian interior. However, superimpositions in the rock art record appear to show earlier phases of human activity, prior to the arrival of domesticated livestock25.

In 2022, a rock art site was discovered at Sahout (SAU), an area south of the Nefud desert. Here, sandstone outcrops form low-lying mountain ranges that are separated by scattered sand dunes and rocky pavements (Fig. 1). Survey documented 18 life-sized engravings of camels, ibex, and equids, with stratigraphic analysis suggesting that multiple large camel engravings may predate Neolithic engravings and the Holocene humid period. However, test excavations did not permit a correlation between dated deposits and rock art27. Three further panels with large camels were recently documented by members of the public in localities ca. 25 km further south (Fig. 1). Their coordinates were compiled by the Saudi Heritage Commission and shared with our team. This information provided an opportunity to document additional panels belonging to this possible early Holocene rock art tradition, and to survey and excavate any associated archaeological deposits.

Here we report the results of archaeological surveys and excavations at rock art sites with life-sized camel engravings south of the Nefud desert, as well as analyses of spatially associated playa deposits. Three archaeologically unexplored areas were visited during our fieldwork in 2023: Jebel Arnaan (ARN), Jebel Mleiha (MLH), and Jebel Misma (JMI). The three areas span ~30 km along the southern edge of the Nefud desert (Fig. 1). To acquire paleoenvironmental context for the region, playa sediments were excavated and dated at ARN and JMI (Fig. 1). The primary aim of this research was to test if the rock art panels and archaeological deposits represent earlier occupations during the Holocene humid period, resulting in a condensed chronology of rock art production, or if they belong to earlier periods and represent a longer period of human presence in northern Arabia.

To evaluate the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene environments of the region, trenches were excavated at four playas in the vicinity of the archaeological sites, two of which contained sufficient sediment for palaeoenvironmental analysis and luminescence dating: ARN (Site 1) and JMI (Site 4), (Fig. 1; Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig. 42). As local centres of deposition, and areas where water accumulated in the past, these playas provide archives of hydroclimate. Gravels found at the base of both 2 m deep trenches were poorly sorted, containing pebbles of up to 5 cm, and were interpreted as alluvial fan deposits. A luminescence age of 68.8 ± 5.0 ka (MIS-B-1) from JMI indicates that these sediments were deposited at the Marine Isotope Stage 5a to 4 transition (Table 1). Palaeohydrological activation at this time is consistent with both broader regional records28 and a surface find of a Middle Palaeolithic Levallois core from JMI (Supplementary Fig. 32).

At both excavated paleoenvironmental sites, the overlying sediments consist of a thin interval of alternating much finer-grained and well-sorted aeolian sands and playa deposits. These are followed by a prolonged sequence of playa deposits consisting of quartz sand, clays (illite and kaolinite), and calcite, indicating more humid conditions with increased water accumulation in these local depressions. We interpret the onset of playa sediment accretion as representing the change in the balance between aeolian erosion and fluvial sedimentation. During the LGM, the hyper-arid environment meant that any fine-grained sediments deposited in ephemeral floods were subsequently eroded by the wind. As the climate became less arid, fluvial sedimentation increased, becoming greater than the aeolian erosion rate and sediments started to accumulate. However, the subordinate carbonate concentration and the absence of root traces and organic-rich layers suggest that conditions remained too dry for the establishment of more permanent water bodies, indicating that a dryland environment persisted around these ephemeral, and probably seasonal, lakes. Luminescence ages constrain the onset of surface water to between 17.1 ± 1.7 ka (MIS-B-3) and 15.5 ± 1.5 ka (MIS-B-2) at JMI (Site 4) and to 12.7 ± 2.1 ka (SAH-L3-1) at ARN (Site 1) (Table 1). The onset of sedimentation after a long hiatus, coupled with an increase in calcite noted in both sedimentary records, indicates that local conditions gradually became more humid after ~16 ka at JMI to ~13 ka at ARN, with these site-specific differences in timing likely due to differences in catchment hydrology (Table 1). These sites thus represent the earliest evidence from northern Arabia of increased humidity following the hyper-arid LGM. However, the lakes were ephemeral, indicating an arid or semi-arid climate prevailed in the region.

Surveys at ARN and JMI identified previously unknown rock art landscapes with life-sized depictions of wild mammals and human figures, and an individual panel at MLH. Across the three areas 62 rock art panels were recorded, containing 176 engravings. Of these, 130 were life-sized and naturalistic engravings depicting camels (90), ibex (17), equids (15), gazelles (7), and aurochs (1), with individual representations frequently measuring up to 2.5–3.0 m in length and 1.8–2.2 m in height. In addition, we identified 2 camel footprints, 15 smaller scale naturalistic depictions of camels, 19 human figures, 4 human faces or masks, and 6 unidentified, partial engravings (Supplementary Data 1). Most of the recorded engravings show camels in a detailed and naturalistic style that echoes the reliefs of the Camel Site to the north of the Nefud desert. This includes the frequent depiction of a bulging neckline, indicating they represent male camels in rut29,30 (Fig. 2A, B).

Tracings highlight the layering of engravings, showing phase 1 in green, phase 2 in yellow, phase 3 in white and phase 4 in shades of blue. Rock art scale is 10 cm wide. A Panel ARN21A: Several small, stylised depictions of women (phase 1, traced in green), superimposed with a large human figure (phase 2, traced in yellow). Large, kneeling camel engraved over the top (phase 3, traced in white). B Panel ARN22A : naturalistic camel (phase 3, traced in white), superimposed by a camel with stylised, rounded eye and standardised outline (phase 4, traced in blue); original and unfinished camel head (traced in dark blue); three gazelle engravings were added during a later part of phase 4 (traced in light blue). Additional examples are provided in Supplementary Fig. 4. C Panel ARN3B : ibex with cartoon-like eye and horn (phase 4, traced in blue), superimposed with life-sized aurochs (phase 4, traced in lighter blue). D Panel ARN 39 : equid with cartoon-like eye, and with a young (phase 4, traced in blue). Untraced photos are provided in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.

The depictions span multiple engraving phases, with images often overlapping on rock surfaces. Sometimes this was done to update an existing representation (Fig. 2B) or to depict a different animal species (Fig. 2C). We distinguish four phases here. Two early rock art phases: small, stylised depictions of women (phase 1, traced in green), followed by large human figures in frontal view (phase 2, traced in yellow). These human figures were always noted to be older than, i.e. underneath, the recorded life-sized animal representations (Fig. 2A), and they make up a much smaller proportion of motifs. The third phase shows detailed, extremely naturalistic representations of animals, where each depiction has individual characteristics (traced in white) (Fig. 2A, B). A later, fourth phase (traced in blue) shows more stylised depictions of animals with cartoonish features, including rounded eyes and horn ridges, and more standardised, near-identical depictions of animals (Figs. 2C, D and 3C).

A Location of the panels at 34 m and 39 m height, and trenches JMI7 and JMI8 (project vehicle for scale). An OSL date of 12.0 ± 1.8 was obtained from JMI8 (Table 1: JMI8-T1-4). Excavated playa deposits are located directly behind this spur (see also Figs. 1 and 8). B narrow, downward sloping ledges in front of the panel viewed from above. C orthophoto generated via a high-resolution 3D model of the panel, with tracings showing 19 life-sized camels and 3 equids (one further camel was documented on a collapsed fragment left of the image). Naturalistic animals belonging to phase 3 traced in white. More stylised and standardised depictions of phase 4 traced in blue, including two engravings of equids traced in dark blue, and superimposed stylised camels traced in light blue. Unidentified lines traced in black. White traced camels: 1.7–1.9 m length, blue camels: 2.15–2.6 m length. A human figure was added on the far left for scale (1.7 m).

Unlike the SAU site, where many of the engravings were found inside narrow gaps between boulders27, engravings at ARN and JMI were found on prominent locations on boulders or cliff surfaces, facing into the landscape (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 7). Some of these panels were etched onto cliff surfaces in inaccessible but highly visible locations (Fig. 3). The difficulty in getting to and engraving these rock surfaces, and their enhanced visibility by height were clearly attractive for the engravers. The precarious nature of the engraving process is particularly evident in the largest recorded panel. On the ground, panel JMI18 is today only visible in optimal light conditions for about 1.5 h in the morning, due to its elevated location and the varnish build-up on the engravings. This panel would have been accessed by climbing up a cliff and then engraved while standing on a downward sloping ledge, only ~30–50 cm in width (Fig. 3B). Today the sandstone is too degraded to reach the ledge safely, and the panel was documented using a drone. The friable nature of the substrate and the slope of the narrow ledges suggest the engravers likely risked their lives to create this art. Engraving at close range would have required them to use direct percussion, while also preventing them from being able to see the complete image. Twenty-three life-sized camels and equids, each with an individual length of ~1.7–2.6 m were engraved on this surface (Fig. 3C), with the engravings stretching ~23 m across two cliff surfaces at a height of 34 m and 39 m (Fig. 3A), giving this rock art a monumental scale.

All recorded rock art panels show a thick coating of dark rock varnish on the natural sandstone surface and inside the engraved lines (Fig. 2), although on some panels this varnish has partially eroded and is now only visible in areas that are less exposed (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. 3C, D). The re-formation of rock varnish following the exposure of the fresh sandstone during the engraving process has been shown to take over 8 ka31,32, and provides a first indication of the antiquity of these images.

The appearance of multiple life-sized animal engravings is impressive today. Freshly engraved against the varnish, the images would have had considerable visual impact. The durability of the images may have facilitated the remembrance of meaning and symbolism across generations of people using these sites. The large naturalistic engravings, therefore, align with the definition of monumentality, which references great size and effort, but also longevity and remembrance within a community33,34.

Four trenches revealed stratified archaeological deposits. Two were excavated at ARN (ARN3, T1 and T2), and two at JMI (JMI7 and JMI8, Fig. 1), yielding artefacts including over 1200 lithics (Supplementary Note 2), and 16 bone fragments (Supplementary Note 4). Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating (Supplementary Note 6) samples from the archaeological deposits attest to human occupation during the terminal Pleistocene and earliest Holocene.

In front of panel ARN3, a 2 × 1 m trench (T1) was excavated directly below two life-sized engravings of camels, one superimposed on the other (Fig. 4). Below recently disturbed sediments, the excavation revealed intact archaeological deposits with layer 5 in particular containing dozens of flaked stone artefacts. This layer was sealed by several large sandstone fragments in layer 4 (Fig. 4), likely the result of a colluvial event. In ARN3 T1, the legs of the engraved camels were buried at a depth indicating that they were engraved no later than when layer 4 was deposited (Fig. 4). Layer 5 included a stone tool that may have been used for engraving the rock art (discussed below) (Fig. 4, orange). Two luminescence samples obtained from layer 5, dating to 12.2 ± 1.4 ka, and 12.8 ± 1.1 ka (Table 1), directly date the burial of the artefacts and pecking tool, and provide an indirect date for the engraving above. Analysis of the engraved lines shows that all images were made using a pecking stone. In some engravings, pecked lines were smoothed in a second step (Fig. 4 inset).

South-western and north-western sections, highlighting the extent of the disturbance: original height of deposit (pink dotted line), and extent of disturbed sand (pink line). Colour grading of layers reflects artefact density. Location of OSL samples shown in black, location of engraving tool projected onto section from a plotted position 72 cm south-east. Earlier camel engraving (phase 3) traced in grey, later camel engraving (phase 4) traced in blue, dashed lines indicated parts of the engraving that were covered with sediment. Note that the legs of the earlier (grey) camel have partially eroded and are no longer visible. Inset shows a closeup of the engraved lines, the crudely pecked line of the earlier (grey) camel on the upper right, and the pecked and smoothed lines of the nose of the later (blue) camel on the lower left. Remains of dark rock varnish29,31,47 can be seen in several patches on both lines.

A second trench (T2) was excavated at ARN3 1.2 m to the east, beneath two more camel engravings at the other end of the same boulder surface (Supplementary Fig. 11). T2 also revealed layers containing hundreds of lithics (layers 6–8; Supplementary Fig. 13) with three small hearths in layer 7, one of which was radiocarbon dated to 11.44 ± 0.18 ka (cal. BPUGAMS65278, Table 2). Refits from layers 8 and 9 in T2 testify to the high integrity of the archaeological contexts (Supplementary Note 3).

At JMI, two trenches were excavated beneath boulders featuring rock art panels. At JMI7 a 2 × 1 m trench was excavated beneath life-sized engravings of two camels and an equid, which revealed a single layer with high artefact concentrations (layer 4; Supplementary Fig. 16). At JMI8 a 2 × 1 m trench was excavated below a life-sized engraved camel. Here moderate artefact concentrations were interspersed throughout the stratigraphic sequence, with the highest artefact concentration in layer 2, near the surface (Supplementary Fig. 19). A luminescence sample was obtained from layer 6, which provided an age of 12.0 ± 1.8 ka (JMI8-T1-4, Table 1), consistent with the luminescence and 14C ages at ARN.

The ARN3 excavations revealed a rich assemblage of occupation debris. In T1, 101 lithics were recovered, with over half in layer 5 (Fig. 4), while in T2, 532 lithics were recovered, with over 95% from layers 5–9 (Supplementary Fig. 13). Chert was the main material used, constituting 36% of the pieces, with obsidian and crystal quartz making up another 23% and 15% respectively (Supplementary Data 2). Lithics showed a diversity of reduction strategies, including small bipolar cores occurring alongside chert bladelets/blades with lamellar scar patterns and often ground platforms (Supplementary Note 3.1).

A total of 30 retouched pieces were recovered. Among these, notches were common with eight notched pieces and two opposed notch blades (Supplementary Table 1). Two chert drills were recovered in T2, as well as a single endscraper from the disturbed upper part of T1. The largest retouched artefacts were two tongue-shaped scrapers from T2 layer 8 (Supplementary Fig. 28). T2 produced seven marginally retouched convergent points made on chert bladelets, while the tanged butt of a point on an obsidian blade was recovered from T1 (Supplementary Figs. 25 and 26). The most distinctive artefacts were a single crystal quartz Helwan bladelet from T1 layer 4 (Fig. 5B), and three chert El Khiam points, a broken butt from T1 layer 5, and both a broken butt and a complete El Khiam point from T2 layer 5 (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. 26). The luminescence age of 12.2 ± 1.4 ka (ARN-T1-2, Table 1) in T1 and the radiocarbon date of 11.44 ± 0.18 ka (UGAMS65278, Table 2) from T2 correspond with the age of El Khiam points from the Levant and therefore indicate that the main occupation was contemporary with the PPNA.

Excavations at JMI7 produced 100 lithics while JMI8 produced 519 (Supplementary Figs. 16 and 19). Quartz was the most commonly used material comprising 65% of pieces, with an additional 20% made from silcrete (Supplementary Data 3). The single core was a silcrete naviform piece from layer 4 in JMI7 (Supplementary Fig. 29). The JMI7 and JMI8 excavations produced nine retouched artefacts (Supplementary Table 2). An opposed-notch chert blade was recovered in layer 5 (Supplementary Fig. 31), with two other chert notched blades recovered from JMI8 layer 4, but these did not have the distinctive opposing notches. This same layer also produced a chert drill with a distal break. A broken Helwan point was found on the surface between JMI7 and JMI8 (Supplementary Fig. 30).

Several of the recovered artefacts have associations with the PPN and even the Natufian in the Levant. Helwan bladelets (Fig. 5B) and opposed notch blades are known from Natufian sites; El Khiam points (Fig. 5A) are an artefact type characteristic of the PPNA, whereas Helwan points and naviform cores are typical for the PPNB (Supplementary Note 3). These artefact types accord with the chronometric dating at ARN and JMI (Tables 1 and 2).

Four grinding stones were recovered from the ARN3 excavations and six from the JMI excavations, along with a facetted stone ball (Supplementary Fig. 34) and two stone platters in JMI7 layer 4 (Supplementary Fig. 35). Two mortars were documented on an exposed rock surface between JMI7 and JMI8 (Supplementary Fig. 33). Mortars are typical of the PPNA35 and have not previously been documented among grindstone assemblages of Neolithic northern Arabia36.

A total of five ground stone beads were recovered, four green pieces from ARN T2 layers 7 and 9, and one from JMI8 layer 2. The recovery of two broken beads and one unfinished bead, together with drills at both sites, suggests on-site manufacture. Two marine dentalium (tooth-shell) beads were recovered from ARN3 T2, layers 7 and 8 (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. 41). Among mostly red pigment, noteworthy was a crayon of green copper ore pigment from ARN3 T2 layer 7. Green pigment and ground stone beads are characteristic of the earlier PPN37,38. Dentalium shells are known from the PPNA39 and had to be collected from the Mediterranean Sea or the Red Sea, making the latter the closest potential source at over 320 km away.

Three tools with clear battering marks were recovered from directly below engraved panels. One is from a stratified and dated archaeological context underneath a life-sized camel engraving at ARN3 T1 (Figs. 4 and 6), immediately below OSL sample ARN-T1-2, dated to 12.2 ± 1.4 ka, and above sample ARN-T1-3 dated 12.8 ± 1.1 ka (Table 1). Two additional tools were recovered on the surface beneath panels ARN30 and JMI8 (Supplementary Fig. 37). The ARN tools are made on clasts of ferruginous sandstone, a tough material not immediately available at the rock art localities, while the JMI8 tool is made of silcrete, a material available at SAU. The tools are all wedge shaped, and the two made on ferruginous sandstone were flaked to sharpen the pecking edge. The tools comfortably fit into a medium-sized adult hand, with the battered edges protruding (Fig. 6B, C). Battering is evident on multiple edges of all three tools, indicating they were used extensively. Due to their angular form, these tools are not viable as lithic hammerstones in the arced free-hand percussion motion; however, the tapered ends would make good surfaces for the direct end-on percussion required to peck petroglyphs (Supplementary Note 3.3). The tool recovered from ARN3 T1 was used to peck and could thus have been involved in the production of either of the two camel engravings above (Fig. 4). In Arabia, this type of tool was first noted at the Camel Site, where traceological analysis on silcrete pieces showed damage consistent with sandstone engraving40. Comparable tools and patterns of wear have also been observed at petroglyph sites in Europe41 and South America42,43.

Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research provides new insights into the human occupation history of northern Arabia (Fig. 7). An absence of sites dating between the LGM and ~12 ka has been observed across the Arabian Peninsula and was likely exacerbated by rising sea levels, which would have submerged any sites associated with coastal refugia44,45. Our evidence for the onset of playa sedimentation indicates that as the hyper-arid climate of the LGM gave way to gradually increasing humidity, ephemeral water bodies were established after ~16 ka at JMI and from ~13 ka at ARN. Human groups in northern Arabia began to exploit these newly forming seasonal water bodies in dryland ecosystems during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

2σ 14 C age ranges are presented in calibrated years BP, while luminescence age ranges are shown at 1σ in ka prior to the measurement datum of 2023. Evidence for human activity and environments listed in grey refer to published research11,19,22,57, evidence listed in black is presented in this paper. Artefacts listed under human activity were recovered during excavations at ARN and JMI and are dated based on OSL and 14 C ages recovered at ARN and JMI, as well as typological comparisons with the Levant. The timing of rock art phases reflect the interpretation of our evidence presented in the text: Rock Art phases 3 and 4 are based on OSL dates from a layer containing a pecking tool at ARN T1, a radiocarbon age from ARN3 T2, an OSL date from JMI8 T1, and the overall characteristics of artefact assemblages at ARN and JMI. The timing of Rock Art phases 1 and 2 is estimated based on superimpositions. The environmental phases are based on a change in the balance between aeolian erosion and fluvial sedimentation that is visible in the sedimentary record, with increasing fluvial sedimentation indicating a reduction in aridity.

Sediment analyses indicate seasonal waterbodies in a landscape that was likely slightly wetter than it is today but too arid to allow the establishment of more permanent lakes (Supplementary Note 5). The fauna represented in the rock art supports this evidence with the identifiable engravings dominated by arid-adapted species, i.e., camels (72%), ibex (12%), gazelles (5%), and wild equids (10%) (Supplementary Data 1). In this context a single depiction of an aurochs at ARN3B (Fig. 2C) stands out and suggests that either these obligate drinkers were able to penetrate the Arabian interior during exceptionally wet seasons or that aurochs were seen elsewhere, perhaps when human populations retreated to wetter areas during the dry season. Currently, the rainfall in the region falls predominantly in the winter months. Observations of modern feral camels indicate their mating season correlates with the wet season46. The depiction of male camels in rut29,30 and with visible winter fur in these engravings27 thus indicates rainfall may have also coincided with the winter months around 12 ka.

Two independent lines of evidence provide a chronology for the rock art at Jebel Arnaan. Firstly, life-sized engravings of animals are the principal rock art tradition at the ARN localities, with no later or superimposed images present until the introduction of firearms (Supplementary Fig. 5). This indicates that the engravings must have been produced at the time of the archaeological occupation, with the main phase in both ARN3 trenches overlapping in age. Secondly, the lower parts of the engraving behind ARN3 T1 are covered by layer 3, indicating that the images must have been completed by the time the deposition of layer 4 ended. The ferruginous pecking stone in layer 5 would be effective in engraving sandstone. In the absence of other rock art within 200 m of the site, our parsimonious assumption is that the pecking stone was used to produce one of the engraved figures at ARN3, and that corresponding chronometric dates can thus be used to date the rock art. Nevertheless, the possibility that the engraving tool was transported from a different panel at Jebel Arnaan cannot be excluded entirely. Luminescence and radiocarbon ages obtained at ARN3 indicate that the pecking stone was deposited at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, and the main phase of occupation is contemporary with the PPNA. Our resulting correlation is that at least one of these large animal engravings was produced during the PPNA. This is supported by analyses of rock varnish which have shown that complete re-varnishing of engraved lines (Figs. 2 and 4 inset; Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3) requires ca 8 ka31,32,47, and match previous observations at SAU and at the Camel Site that this type of engraving does not include any depictions of livestock and thus likely pre-dates the emergence of pastoralism in northern Arabia27,29,48.

Two earlier rock art phases were recorded with repeated superimposition by life-sized camels, but these do not have direct associations with archaeological deposits. Small, stylised depictions of women with accentuated curves (rock art phase 1), and subsequent depictions of large, stylised human figures (rock art phase 2, Fig. 2D). These human figures consequently pre-date engravings such as those at ARN3, and are thus likely older than 12 ka (Fig. 7). Similarly, an Epipalaeolithic date had previously been tentatively suggested for stylistically similar figures in the Jubbah oasis based on a relative chronology of rock art superimpositions25.

Re-engraving events such as the one documented at JMI18 (Fig. 3C) indicate that the tradition of large, naturalistic engravings was long-lived. For new lines to be visible, previous representations must have been sufficiently faded through varnish accumulation, weathering or erosion. This pattern was also observed in the rock art of SAU27 and appears to be typical for this monumental rock art tradition. Engravings of phase 4, which are often found superimposed over earlier naturalistic depictions of phase 3 (Fig. 2B and 3C), are more cartoonish and follow a more standardised ideal of beauty, reflecting a stylistic evolution over time (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4).

During the terminal Pleistocene and earliest Holocene, human populations appear to have moved along established routes determined by a network of water sources, which were marked with monumental rock art. Such ‘freshwater corridors' also connected the Nefud and Levant during the much wetter Pleistocene humid events when large permanent lakes formed in the region10. At JMI all panels flank the edge of a playa (Fig. 8C and Supplementary Fig. 6). At ARN, all life-sized rock art panels follow a gulley up the slope in which water pools even today after infrequent rains (Fig. 8B). This route provided convenient access to ephemeral water pools and it would also have acted as a shortcut across the mountain to reach two playas on the western side (one of which is Site 1, ARN), where water would likely have been available for longer periods after infrequent flood events (Fig. 8A). All panels with life-sized animals overlook this route and would have been highly visible when freshly engraved (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The engravings express a symbolism that relates to desert animals and to seasonality, namely the depiction of male camels in rut, which may have referenced the mating season of these animals after the winter rains46, and potentially also their extraordinary resilience in these arid landscapes. In the drylands of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, hunter-gatherer groups were likely highly mobile. Depictions of wild animals and the marking of natural landscapes may have been a mechanism to mark routes and perhaps also served as territorial markers documenting access rights via impressive images that would have “guarded” locations in a group's absence. The engravings, which may have been created over a time span of millennia, would have reminded people of ancient symbolisms and beliefs of their group, which likely structured their highly seasonal lives and thus enhanced their ability to thrive in these marginal landscapes.

Mounting archaeological evidence suggests repeated contact between human populations in northern Arabia and the Levant, throughout the terminal Pleistocene and the Holocene. Arrowheads associated with the Late Neolithic in the Levant, such as Ha-Parsa, Nizzanim, and Herzliya types, as well as decorative artefacts such as shell beads and stone bracelets, have been identified at Jebel Oraf19 and at multiple sites in the AlUla region49. PPNB technologies such as naviform cores are well documented from the Jawf region north of the Nefud desert50, with the discovery of Helwan points at Jebel Oraf51 extending these links into the southern Nefud desert, where PPNA technology in the form of El Khiam points is also known from Jebel Qattar18 in the Jubbah oasis. The recent discovery of a Helwan bladelet at SAU, alongside a radiocarbon age of 13.4 ka indicates that these connections may reach back to the terminal Pleistocene27.

The artefact assemblages presented here include Levantine stone tool types and decorative forms of material culture (green ground stone disc and dentalium beads), suggesting regular and repeated cultural contact across long distances. These contacts are evident in the initial occupation of the region at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, and continued into the early Holocene, with PPNA and PPNB cultural entities represented in the material culture. Luminescence and radiocarbon ages obtained from stratigraphic contexts indicate that the use of these artefacts was contemporaneous with the Levant (Fig. 7). To our knowledge, this is the first time PPN artefacts have been found in a stratified and dated context in Arabia, and the first time they have been associated with this style of monumental naturalistic art.

The distribution of the monumental rock art along routes connecting seasonal water bodies suggests high mobility, and regular movements across considerable distances may have been a key adaptation to the cyclical availability of water. In one case this may even have been captured in three rock art panels north and south of the Nefud desert, which appear to have been re-worked multiple times by the same succession of artists48. Connectivity is also a key feature of Epipalaeolithic occupations in the Levant and Jordan52, with such connectivity increasing in scale in the PPN53,54. Population movements in both northern Arabia and regions further north may therefore have facilitated the transfer of knowledge while also accommodating distinct cultural expressions.

The interdisciplinary geoarchaeological fieldwork at Sahout indicates that the populations who engraved the monumental rock art panels of Jebel Arnaan and Jebel Misma were the first occupants in the interior of northern Arabia since the LGM (Fig. 7). These pioneers were able to thrive in the arid conditions of the terminal Pleistocene and earliest Holocene due to seasonal water bodies. The presence of key lithic artefacts such as El Khiam and Helwan points, as well as decorative artefacts such as green pigment and dentalium beads, suggests these human groups maintained contact with their Levantine neighbours during the PPN, travelling across vast distances. However, the engravers of Jebel Arnaan and Jebel Misma had their own, distinct cultural and symbolic identity. Their adaptation to an environment where water was only available temporarily, involved complex mobility along routes connecting different water sources. Unlike their Levantine neighbours, they produced monumental rock art that centres around a desert animal symbolism: the camel. These monumental images were used to mark water sources and the routes between them, perhaps providing impressive visual reminders of access rights, while also commemorating these extraordinary desert-adapted groups over millennia.

Permission for excavations in Saudi Arabia, sampling, export of samples and artefacts to the United Kingdom, and analysis was granted by the Heritage Commission, Ministry of Culture, Saudi Arabia.

Rock art panels were recorded using pro-forma record sheets, with content, size and GPS location noted, and documented using high-resolution digital photographs as raw files and JPGs. To enhance faded details on the rock art, some photos were enhanced using Adobe Lightroom. Key panels were photographed systematically to allow generation of high-resolution 3D models and orthophotos using Metashape photogrammetry software. One exceptionally large panel was located on a cliff 34–39 m above the ground (Fig. 3C) and had to be documented using a DJI Mavic Mini 2 UAV due to its height and inaccessibility, with the resulting photographs combined into an orthophoto to facilitate analysis.

Rock art surveys were carried out systematically, with survey teams following the base of jebels and exploring all boulders and rock surfaces along the base and within heights that could safely be reached. At Jebel Arnaan, rock art survey followed a gully that leads up the mountain slope and connects to a wadi above (Fig. 8B).

A total of 106 rock art panels were documented across all three regions (Jebel Arnaan, Jebel Mleiha and Jebel Misma). Distinct surfaces of boulders were defined as separate panels, with multiple surfaces on the same boulder labelled with the same number, distinguished by a letter suffix (e.g. ARN3_A, ARN3_B).

All trenches were hand-dug by trowel using the single context method55. Thicker deposits were sometimes divided into multiple contexts for extra stratigraphic control. Contexts were recorded using project-specific pro forma record sheets. Depths were recorded with a line level, with five points taken for each context. Excavated sediment was sieved through a 3 mm mesh with all artefacts and faunal remains retained. The position of key finds was manually measured using a plumb bob from an origin in one corner of each trench.

All lithics were classified by material, counted, and weighed. Any retouched pieces and cores were assigned to types. Key types were photographed and measured. Grinding stones were assigned to types, their ground surface form characterised, and any complete dimensions measured. Pigment was weighed and pieces with striations visible at low magnifications designated as crayons. Bead diameter, aperture width, and thickness were measured.

Luminescence dates presented in this study were determined using optically stimulated luminescence techniques applied to quartz. These measure the time elapsed since sediments were last exposed to sunlight. Opaque metal tubes were hammered into cleaned sections, transported to the UK and analysed as described in Supplementary Note 6.1. Environmental dose rates were calculated using location and overburden density (cosmic rays), field gamma spectrometry (gamma), and thick-source beta counting (beta). Luminescence analyses were carried out by Simon Armitage at the School of Life Sciences and the Environment, Royal Holloway University of London, United Kingdom.

Samples suitable for radiocarbon dating were collected from stratified archaeological deposits during excavation and included charcoal-rich sediment samples from hearth deposits, ostrich egg shell, micro charcoal, and one piece of shell. The latter was identified as a pearl oyster (Supplementary Note 4). Samples for radiocarbon dating were sent to the Centre for Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS) at the University of Georgia and analysed as described in Supplementary Note 6.2.

Trenches were dug in the middle of the playa settings, up to 2 m deep. The sections were described sedimentologically and sampled for geochemical lab analysis and luminescence dating. The XRD semiquantitative analysis of the major mineral components was carried out using a D8 Bruker machine, at the laboratory in KAUST, with a chosen angle (2θ) between the incoming and outcoming X-ray beam between 5 and 80°. The mineral phase interpretation was done using DIFFRAC.EVA software and the results are presented as a proportional percentage of the mineral phase present in the analysed samples (Supplementary Note 5). The samples were powdered using a handheld mortar.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

All data used in this study are available in the Supplementary Information files. All data used to support our results were generated in our research. Sediment samples from playa deposits are stored at King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Physical Science and Engineering Division. Artefacts recovered during excavations will be returned to and stored by the Heritage Commission, Ministry of Culture, Saudi Arabia, in 2025. Access can be negotiated with the Heritage Commission (faljibrin@moc.gov.sa).

Income inequality, a structural property of societies characterized by the unequal distribution of resources, is associated with adverse mental health outcomes during adolescence, which is a sensitive period of neurodevelopment. While previous research has explored the impact of individual-level socioeconomic factors on brain structure and function, the neurobiological mechanisms linking structural inequality to mental health disparities remain poorly understood. Here, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we investigated the associations between state-level income inequality, indexed by the Gini coefficient, and brain structure and functional connectivity in over 8,000 children aged 9–10 years (from 17 states in the USA). We analyzed whole-brain cortical thickness and surface area, and volume and region-specific measures of thickness and surface area, as well as functional connectivity within and between 12 brain networks, controlling for several individual-level and state-level confounders (for example, income, educational attainment, state-level incarceration rate and Medicaid expansion status). Mediation analyses were conducted to test whether brain metrics linked income inequality to mental health outcomes at 6-month and 18-month follow-ups. Higher income inequality was associated with reduced cortical thickness and surface area across widespread brain regions, as well as altered functional connectivity between multiple brain networks. Lower cortical volume and surface area, as well as connectivity between the default mode and dorsal attention networks, mediated the association between higher structural income inequality and greater mental health problems. Our findings reveal income inequality as a unique societal-level determinant of neurodevelopment and mental health, independent of individual socioeconomic status. Policies aimed at reducing inequality and strengthening social cohesion to mitigate its neurobiological and mental health impacts are needed.

Economic inequality, characterized by the unequal distribution of income and wealth in a society, is associated with mental health and wellbeing outcomes beyond the influence of household income1,2,3. This may be particularly relevant during adolescence—a dynamic period of neurodevelopment when the brain undergoes rapid maturation and many mental health disorders begin to emerge4,5. Research increasingly underscores the link between higher income inequality and a range of adverse mental health outcomes in young people, including elevated rates of depression, anxiety and behavioral disorders6,7,8,9. Inequality-related stressors may contribute to heightened mental health vulnerabilities by shaping neurodevelopmental pathways, particularly those involved in emotion regulation and social cognition. Although numerous studies have examined how individual-level income is associated with brain development10,11, few have considered the broader role of structural income inequality in brain development and mental health. Income inequality has risen worldwide in recent decades12. Investigating whether and how inequality becomes neurobiologically embedded and heightens the risk of psychopathology during adolescence could provide valuable insights. Absolute poverty—typically defined as the inability to meet basic needs and operationalized based on thresholds set by the government and/or economists—has known effects on neurobiology10. If structural inequality has similar measurable associations, addressing it may gain broader acceptance across political ideologies.

Income inequality, which refers to the disproportionate concentration of income within a small fraction of the population, can fundamentally alter the social environment and is a distinct construct from poverty. While income inequality can exacerbate poverty by concentrating resources among a small proportion of the population, it is a structural characteristic of a society that can influence mental health through unique pathways—such as increased social comparison, which is a fundamental process through which individuals evaluate themselves by comparing their attributes, abilities and achievements to those of others13, and reduced social cohesion—not captured by individual income or poverty alone1,3. Inequality fosters relative deprivation, social comparison and perceptions of limited social mobility1,3. This creates conditions that induce chronic stress, a well-established risk factor for psychopathology14. Although evidence from adolescent samples is limited, biological evidence is aligned with the idea that inequality contributes to increased stress. A study of over 19,000 individuals across four European countries found that C-reactive protein levels, a marker of inflammation, were lowest in more equal societies (for example, Switzerland) and highest in more unequal ones (for example, Portugal)15. Experimental findings are also consistent with this: Shapiro et al.16 showed that short-term exposure to inequality triggers physiological stress responses. Increased stress levels could explain the well-established links between inequality and mental health1,3,17.

Stress neurobiology research shows that chronic stress exposure is associated with neural pathways involved in emotion regulation and cognitive control18, which are relevant for mental health. Extensive research has linked low individual income to altered brain structure and function, such as reduced cortical thickness and surface area and changes in functional connectivity19,20, factors closely associated with mental health21. Importantly, the association of individual socioeconomic status (SES) with brain volume has been shown to vary across European countries, with associations being stronger in some countries than others22—potentially reflecting broader structural factors such as inequality—a hypothesis that remains untested. Apart from a study examining electrophysiological brain dynamics in adults23 and a few studies examining links of local income disparity with gray matter24,25, the role of structural income inequality in shaping brain structure and function and, crucially, behavior outcomes in youth, remains unexplored. This gap underscores the critical need to explore how income inequality may influence neurobiology and mental health, independent of individual income.

In this study, we leverage population-based data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to assess associations between state-level income inequality, indexed by the Gini coefficient, and brain structure and functional connectivity in children aged 9–10 years. Specifically, we examine the associations of inequality with cortical thickness and surface area, analyzing both whole-brain and region-specific measures, as well as functional connectivity within and between 12 brain networks. Finally, we evaluated whether any implicated brain structure or connectivity metrics mediated the relationship between state-level inequality and mental health 6 and 18 months later, aiming to elucidate the pathways through which structural inequality contributes to mental health disparities. Overall, the present study aims to examine the neural mechanisms through which income inequality is associated with adolescent mental health. By examining neurobiological pathways, we aim to better understand how inequality contributes to mental health disparities and inform potential interventions.

The sample consisted of 10,071 children (4,871 female; 56% non-Hispanic white; Table 1) from across 17 states in the USA (N = 8,412 for functional connectivity after excluding unusable scans). We used linear mixed-effects models to examine associations of income inequality (operationalized as the Gini coefficient) with average cortical thickness, total cortical volume, total surface area, regional cortical thickness (n = 34 variables) and surface area (n = 34 variables), and within- and between-network connectivity (n = 78 variables). Our analyses control for multiple key covariates, including participant age and sex assigned at birth, scanner model, in-scanner motion (for connectivity variables), household income-to-needs ratio, parental educational attainment, parent mental health and state-level variables including incarceration rate, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Medicaid expansion status. We also accounted for the nested family structure. These covariates were included to isolate the unique contribution of structural inequality to brain and mental health outcomes. False discovery rate (FDR) corrections (PFDR < 0.05) were applied within cortical thickness, surface area and functional connectivity analyses.

Higher income inequality was significantly associated with lower overall cortical volume (β = −2.93, s.e.m 0.49, t = −6.04, P < 0.001), average cortical thickness (β = −1.33, s.e.m. 0.55, t = −2.41, P = 0.016) and total surface area (β = −2.99, s.e.m. 0.49, t = −6.06, P < 0.001; Fig. 1a–c). Further, higher income inequality was associated with widespread patterns of lower cortical thickness (Fig. 1d and Table 2) and surface area (Fig. 1e and Table 2) across frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital regions (n = 48 variables). For a few regions, inequality was associated with higher thickness and surface area, including for the bank of superior temporal sulcus (STS) and supramarginal thickness, and parahippocampal area. The complete model output for all associations is available in Supplementary Table 2.

Only areas with significant associations are depicted in the figure.

In sensitivity analyses, we adjusted for the average cortical thickness for thickness models and the total surface area in surface area models (Supplementary Table 4). Briefly, thickness results remained largely unchanged (22 out of 24 variables were still significant), whereas some surface area results were no longer significant (12 out of 22 variables remained significant). This suggests that inequality is associated with regional structure, over and above global effects.

Similarly, we found a significant relationship between inequality and several (n = 46) connections between and within functional networks. Higher inequality was associated with alterations in connectivity within and between networks involved in higher-order cognition and attention, such as the cingulo-opercular network (CON), dorsal attention network (DAN), default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network (FPN) and ventral attention network (VAN). Inequality was also linked to connectivity in networks related to sensory and motor functions, including the auditory network (AN), sensorimotor network (SMN) and visual network (VN) (Fig. 2 and Table 3). The complete model output for all associations is available in Supplementary Table 3.

Only the bottom half of the matrix has been displayed for ease of readability. b, A chord diagram for significant connections. Red and blue chords represent positive and negative associations, respectively.

Additionally, to directly assess whether income inequality explained additional variance beyond individual-level SES, we compared models with and without the Gini coefficient for a few representative models (global brain measures and the first two significant connectivity variables). We found that including income inequality significantly improved the model fit for all brain outcomes tested and resulted in small but consistent increases in marginal R2 when the Gini coefficient was added to the models (Supplementary Table 5). This suggests that the Gini coefficient explains unique variance above individual-level SES and other covariates in the model. The main effects of parent income to needs and educational attainment are presented in Supplementary Tables 11 and 12.

We then leveraged structural equation modeling, including the same covariates as the linear mixed-effects models, to test the role of the implicated brain variables as mediators of the association of inequality with total mental health problems at 6 months and 18 months later. The FDR was used to adjust for multiple comparisons within each set of analyses. Fit indices indicated acceptable to excellent fit for the structure models (root mean square error of approximation: mean 0.013, s.d. 0.004; comparative fit index: mean 0.997, s.d. 0.002; Tucker–Lewis index: mean 0.97, s.d. 0.023) and connectivity models (root mean square error of approximation: mean 0.016, s.d. 0.003; comparative fit index: mean 0.993, s.d. 0.004; Tucker–Lewis index: mean 0.93, s.d. 0.038). There was a significant total effect of inequality on mental health at the 18-month follow-up but not the 6-month follow-up (Supplementary Tables 6–10). We found a significant indirect effect for total surface area and cortical volume, and connectivity between the DAN and DMN for the association between inequality and total mental health problems at both 6 months and 18 months later. Specifically, higher inequality was associated with lower surface area and volume and higher (that is, less negative) DMN–DAN connectivity, which were in turn associated with higher mental health problems (Fig. 3 and results for 6 months provided in the Supplementary Information). These results were significant even when total mental health problems at baseline were accounted for in sensitivity analyses (see Supplementary Information for the model output).

a–c, The neural mediators between income inequality and total mental health problems for total surface area (a), total cortical volume (b) and DMN to DAN connectivity (c).

The present study provides new evidence on the neural mechanisms through which structural income inequality contributes to psychopathology. Our findings show that structural inequality is associated with measurable differences in brain structure and functional connectivity, which have implications for subsequent mental health outcomes during early adolescence. Higher income inequality was associated with reduced cortical thickness and surface area across widespread brain regions spanning all four lobes of the brain, which is in line with our whole-brain findings. The present study also revealed that structural income inequality was associated with alterations in functional connectivity within and between multiple cortical brain networks, including both higher-order cognitive and sensorimotor systems. These findings of widespread associations between inequality and brain structure and connectivity extend prior research on the impact of individual socioeconomic factors10,11,19,20,26,27,28,29,30,31,32 on brain development by highlighting the role of structural income inequality as a unique societal-level determinant that operates independently of individual-level SES. Importantly, total brain volume and surface area, as well as connectivity between the DMN and DAN, mediated links between inequality and mental health 6 months and 18 months later.

Given the evidence showing that inequality fundamentally alters the social environment—resulting in lower levels of social cohesion, trust and social capital, as well as higher levels of social comparison13—and the crucial role that social relationships play in our health and wellbeing33, it is unsurprising that inequality is associated with higher stress levels34. While not directly measured in our study, we speculate that these social changes and increased stress levels probably contribute to the profound impacts on the brain outcomes in children observed in our study. We discuss these ideas further below.

A key finding of this study is that youth living in states with higher income inequality have, on average, lower surface area and thickness across widespread regions in the brain, spanning the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes. The implicated regions support a range of functions including executive function, emotion regulation, reward processing, attention and sensory integration, socioemotional processing and visual processing35,36,37,38,39,40. Inequality was also associated with differences in functional connectivity within and between numerous functional systems involved in both sensorimotor and higher-order cognitive functions. Together, these findings indicate that income inequality may shape brain development in a diffuse and pervasive manner, potentially influencing a wide range of cognitive, emotional and behavioral outcomes in children and adolescents. Importantly, our findings are consistent with and extend prior work on individual SES showing similarly widespread associations of SES with brain structure and connectivity19,20,29 and associations between SES and a range of outcomes in children41,42,43,44. We speculate that such widespread patterns may be a consequence of inequality-related chronic stress. While both household income and inequality generate chronic stress, with potential biological consequences, they may do so via different psychosocial pathways. For instance, absolute poverty may trigger stress via material deprivation and income insecurity, while inequality may amplify status anxiety and social comparison as inequality heightens the salience of socioeconomic hierarchies, leading to increased upward social comparisons and feelings of inadequacy3,45,46. Social comparison—a psychological process through which individuals evaluate themselves relative to others13—is heightened in unequal societies where status hierarchies are more salient. This fosters upward comparison and contributes to status anxiety, a persistent worry about one's social standing47. According to the status anxiety hypothesis, individuals in more unequal societies may experience greater stress about their social rank—even if they are not economically deprived. Supporting this, relative income (for example, income rank) is often a stronger predictor of psychological distress and life satisfaction than absolute income, particularly in high-inequality areas48,49,50,51. Experimental and observational studies have also linked higher inequality to increased materialism, status seeking and conspicuous consumption52. For children and adolescents, who are particularly sensitive to social comparison53, this may translate into a heightened preoccupation with peer status, social rejection and negative self-evaluation54, all of which lead to higher stress levels55. Growing up in the context of higher income inequality is also associated with greater victimization in adolescence56.

Further, inequality may also contribute to higher levels of adolescent stress indirectly. For example, ample evidence shows that inequality degrades mental health in adults1,3,17, and poor parent mental health is associated with greater family conflict and reduced parental support57, both of which may contribute to adolescent stress. Biological and experimental evidence is in line with the idea that inequality contributes to stress15,16. Experiencing chronic stress may disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and elevate cortisol levels, norepinephrine and adrenaline58. While short-term stress responses may be protective, chronic stress places strain on the brain and other organ systems58. In the brain, chronic stress may disrupt synaptic homeostasis by impairing the balance between synapse formation and pruning, driven in part by prolonged glucocorticoid exposure59. This can lead to widespread synaptic loss and reduced synaptic density59, which may contribute to the widespread connectivity alterations in large-scale functional networks observed in the present study. Additionally, chronic stress can reduce dendritic arborization complexity, potentially driving reductions in cortical volume and thickness60,61. Further research is needed to test these pathways directly.

Income inequality not only exacerbates chronic stress but may also deprive adolescents of the protective effects of strong social ties, such as emotional support and shared resources, which may buffer these associations. For example, income inequality erodes social capital—defined as trust, networks and norms of reciprocity within communities—which is critical for fostering social cohesion and mental wellbeing62. Communities with high levels of inequality tend to experience greater segregation, reduced civic participation and weaker social networks, all of which can amplify feelings of isolation and mistrust63, contributing to the maintenance or exacerbation of chronic stress. This chronic stress may ultimately influence brain structure and function as described earlier.

Another central finding of our study is that whole-brain cortical surface area and cortical volume, and connectivity between the DMN and DAN, mediated the association between income inequality and mental health problems. These results are consistent with prior work showing that the DMN and DAN are involved in emotion regulation, and disruptions in their connectivity have been associated with various mental health disorders64,65,66. Furthermore, our findings build on prior research showing associations between reduced cortical volume and surface area and various forms of psychopathology (for example, depression, anxiety and externalizing disorders)67,68,69,70,71. Our results suggest that income inequality may contribute to these associations by shaping neurodevelopment, although further research is needed to disentangle the mechanisms underlying these links. Notably, only a small subset of brain variables associated with income inequality mediated these links, leaving the exact contribution of these neural alterations to behavioral outcomes uncertain. We speculate that it is possible such effects would be evident in outcomes not examined in the present study—such as emotion regulation and cognitive function—or over a longer developmental timespan, such as late adolescence or young adulthood.

Our findings suggest that structural income inequality is associated with neurobiological differences, even after accounting for absolute income and poverty. These brain differences, in turn, help explain links to adverse mental health outcomes. As such, structural inequality should be considered a harmful social determinant with clear biological sequalae, meriting attention in efforts to improve population mental health, regardless of political ideology. In other words, addressing absolute poverty alone is likely to be inadequate and policies aimed at reducing inequality, improving social capital and cohesion, and mitigating the effects of social comparison are needed. We have discussed possible interventions in depth in a recent paper (see ref. 3 for a review). Briefly, economic reform including progressive taxation, increased social safety nets and universal healthcare are needed to alleviate the stressors that disproportionately affect children in more unequal societies3. Further, efforts to promote social capital, such as community-building initiatives and investments in public infrastructure, could mitigate the detrimental effects of inequality on mental health by fostering trust and social cohesion1,2,3. Interventions targeting status anxiety, such as programs promoting emotion regulation, social connectedness and feelings of self-worth, may help reduce the salience of social comparison among adolescents. In particular, schools could play a critical role by creating inclusive environments that minimize socioeconomic disparities and emphasize belonging and connectedness to promote mental health in young people72. Given our findings of links between structural inequality and brain structure and function, and evidence suggesting that inequality is associated with worse outcomes for everyone, even those not struggling financially2,17, such measures are urgently needed.

Despite its strengths, this study has several limitations: (1) while the Gini coefficient we used provides a robust measure of income inequality, it did not capture other inequities, such as wealth disparities or access to healthy nutrition, that may also influence brain development. Although we relied on the Gini coefficient, other indices, such as the proportion of total income earned, Atkinson index, income ratios or the Robin Hood index may offer complementary insights73. For instance, the Theil index allows for the decomposition of inequality into between-group and within-group components74,75 (for example, between race versus within race), offering a more granular understanding of how different dimensions of inequality may relate to brain development. Future work could benefit from incorporating multiple measures of inequality to provide a more nuanced understanding of how different aspects of income distribution may differentially relate to brain outcomes. (2) Our findings are correlational. Experimental studies (for example, from behavioral economics) and longitudinal neuroimaging research, ideally grounded in causal inference frameworks, are needed to establish causal pathways. (3) While we speculate that the brain differences observed in our study may be due to the chronic stress associated with inequality, we did not measure perceived stress or biological markers of stress (for example, cortisol levels) directly. As such, any interpretations should be made with caution. Future work should test whether both self-reported and physiological indicators of stress mediate links between inequality and brain structure and function. Relatedly, stress and its neurodevelopmental consequences caused by structural factors such as inequality, and individual-level factors including poverty are not easily dissociable. (4) We chose to focus on state-level income inequality, which captures broader macrosocial factors and has been underexplored in developmental cognitive neuroscience. Future work should test the unique, distinct and joint effects of local inequality versus state inequality to better understand how different social contexts contribute to developmental outcomes76. (5) In our dataset, 21 sites span only 17 states, with 15 out of 17 states represented by a single site. This precluded us from including site as a random effect without compromising our ability to estimate state-level associations. While we controlled for scanner manufacturer and model, future research with broader geographic sampling and multiple sites per state could better disentangle site-specific variability from state-level predictors of brain structure and function. (6) The ABCD study does not include data from states with the highest poverty rates in the USA (for example, Mississippi, Louisiana and New Mexico). These findings therefore may not be generalizable to structurally disadvantaged states. However, our findings of inequality being associated with brain structure and function even in states with comparatively lower levels of poverty highlights the relevance of state-level contextual factors beyond absolute deprivation. (7) Averaging left and right hemisphere values may have masked potential hemispheric differences. This could be explored in future work with specific hypotheses. (8) This study examined whole-brain patterns and overall psychopathology and cannot comment on associations relevant for specific mental health domains. Future work should investigate more specific pathways to delineate risk and resilience mechanisms for distinct mental health domains. (9) We did not examine the role of residential segregation and homogeneity, which may influence children's development through shared pathways with inequality such as low social capital, fragmentation, exclusion and lack of belonging76,77,78. Future work that examines the extent to which these exposures share common versus distinct pathways is needed. Further, it would also be valuable to examine whether racial homogeneity within a state or region influences the strength of the association between inequality and children's outcomes in future work. Future research should examine the environmental and biological mechanisms linking inequality to brain structure and connectivity, such as neighborhood cohesion, prosocial behavior, parental stress, family conflict and stress pathways. Finally, while effect sizes are small, small effects can accumulate and have meaningful effects at the population level79.

This study advances our understanding of how income inequality shapes child brain structure and function and mental health. Our findings highlight how structural inequality becomes biologically embedded to influence mental health. Addressing inequality at the societal level is essential to fostering environments that support healthy neurodevelopment and mental wellbeing for all children.

This study utilized data from the ABCD study (release 5.1), an ongoing large-scale, multisite, longitudinal research study from the USA. Baseline data were collected from September 2017 to August 2018. The present study used neuroimaging data from the baseline time point and self-reported mental health from 6-month (when self-reported mental health was first assessed80) and 18-month (the last time point before the COVID-19 pandemic) follow-ups. The ABCD study aims to comprehensively track psychological and neurobiological development from late childhood to late adolescence. The study is conducted across 21 research sites (from 17 states). The participating sites cover about 20% of the 9–10-year-old population in the USA. Schools within a 50-mile radius of each site—across public, charter and private institutions—were selected using probability sampling within the 21 defined catchment areas (see ref. 81 for more information). Participants took part in clinical interviews, neuroimaging sessions, neurocognitive testing and completed various surveys. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or caregivers, and children provided assent. All participant rights were safeguarded by local institutional review boards. After excluding participants based on imaging quality and missing data on covariates, 10,071 children remained in the final analysis sample for brain structure and 8,412 for functional connectivity. Detailed demographic information for the sample has been provided below.

We focused on structural inequality at the state level, which is intended to capture broader, system-level socioeconomic stratification—the policies, norms and institutional frameworks that shape income distribution at a population level. Inequality at the state level was assessed using the Gini coefficient, one of the most widely used measures of income inequality2,34,73, making it comparable with previous research. The Gini coefficient quantifies the extent to which income distribution among individuals or households within a population deviates from perfect equality. Values range from 0 (complete equality, where everyone has the same income) to 1 (complete inequality, where one person has all the income and everyone else has none). It is typically calculated from the Lorenz curve, which plots the cumulative proportion of income earned against the cumulative proportion of the population, ranked from poorest to richest. The coefficient represents the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality, divided by the total area under the line of perfect equality. State-level Gini coefficient values were acquired for the year 2017 from the US Census Bureau. Importantly, larger geographic units, such as states or nations, offer more consistent and robust findings on the relationship between inequality and various outcomes than inequality at a smaller geographical scale such as the neighborhood34,82. For example, Wilkinson and Pickett82 found that the proportion of analyses reporting a supportive association between income inequality and health outcomes was 83% among international studies, 73% in studies using large subnational units (for example, states) and only 45% in studies using small areas such as neighborhoods. Similarly, Hsieh and Pugh83 concluded that consistent associations between income inequality and violent crime were found in studies using national or state-level data, but not in studies using smaller geographic units34. This pattern has been echoed in later multilevel meta-analyses34,84, supporting the idea that state-level measures more reliably capture meaningful variation in inequality. Further, inequality is a relatively stable construct and can be assumed to precede neurobiological changes temporally. More importantly, brain structure and function cannot influence state-level income inequality, making reverse causality a non-issue in this context. We report associations between the state-level Gini coefficient and state-level median income and racial homogeneity (percentage white) and income-to-needs ratio (averaged for individuals in the state) in Supplementary Table 1.

We utilized youth-reported symptoms of psychopathology on the Brief Problem Monitor, which assesses symptoms over the past week using 19 items drawn from the Child Behavior Checklist, Teacher's Report Form and Youth Self-Report85,86. Items are rated as 0 (‘not true'), 1 (‘somewhat true') or 2 (‘very true') and are categorized into three domains (attention, internalizing and externalizing). We utilized the total problems raw score, which included scores on internalizing, externalizing and attention symptoms. Internal consistency in our sample was high (Cronbach's α = 0.85), indicating good reliability. The present study used data from two time points: the 6-month (the time point at which self-reported mental health was first assessed) and 18-month follow-up (which was the last timepoint of complete data before the pandemic). This was done to examine whether brain structure and connectivity mediated associations between inequality and mental health both in the short term and over a longer period, thereby testing the robustness and persistence of any observed effects.

Race and ethnicity data were collected through two questions: (1) “What race do you consider the child to be?” (Asian, Black or African American, white) and (2) “Is the child of Hispanic/Latino/Latina descent?” (yes or no). Responses were categorized into five groups: Asian, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic white and multiracial/multiethnic, and this classification is used in the study's data releases. This variable was binarized into non-Hispanic white and non-white.

Models were adjusted for a range of theoretically motivated covariates87. The mean educational attainment of parents/caregivers (in years) was calculated by averaging the education levels of both parents/caregivers. In cases where data for both were unavailable, the information for the available parent or caregiver was used. The income-to-needs ratio was determined by dividing the median value of the household's income band (as defined by the ABCD study) by the federal poverty line for the respective household size. Parental mental health was the (responding) parent's total raw score on the self-reported Adult Self Report instrument of broad psychopathology. Additionally, we accounted for the average TANF benefit at the state level88,89 as low assistance for needy families can exacerbate inequality as well as increase individual-level stress, which in turn can influence neurodevelopment. Further, we covaried for incarceration rate90 (that is, the number of individuals incarcerated in the state out of every 100,000 in population), as more unequal states may have higher levels of crime, which can influence brain development and mental health, as well as Medicaid expansion (binary variable) as an indicator of whether the state had expanded Medicaid eligibility91. In sensitivity analyses for our mediation models, we accounted for parent-reported youth mental health problems (total problems subscale) based on the Child Behavior Checklist92.

The imaging procedures used here have been comprehensively outlined by Casey et al.93. Neuroimaging was performed following standardized protocols across multiple sites using 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanners from Siemens, Phillips or General Electric, equipped with 32-channel head coils. A high-resolution 3D T1-weighted image with 1 mm voxel size was obtained for all participants. Further, four or five 5 min resting-state scans (eyes open) were performed to ensure a minimum of 8 min of relatively low-motion data. For further details, refer to Hagler et al.94. The preprocessing was carried out by the ABCD data analysis and informatics core, utilizing a uniform pipeline (for detailed procedures and quality control, refer to Hagler et al.94). Motion correction was implemented in real-time at the Siemens and GE sites using dedicated software tools. Both automated and manual methods were employed to assess data quality, and all images were reviewed by trained professionals to detect artifacts or abnormalities. Artifact severity in the cortical reconstructions of the postprocessed images was rated on a scale from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating the highest level of artifact. Based on these ratings, technicians recommended the inclusion of only those images rated 0 for further analysis. Signal-to-noise ratios and head motion were assessed using automated tools.

FreeSurfer version 7.1.1 was used for cortical surface reconstruction and parcellation (Desikan–Killiany atlas). In this study, we focused on cortical thickness and surface area (34 variables each). Since no lateralized effects were hypothesized and prior work on individual-level environmental factors and brain structure has not yielded consistent results for lateralized effects10, values for the left and right hemispheres were averaged for the analysis. This is consistent with ours and others' prior work on this sample19,95, and a study by Taylor et al.96 showed that SES is largely consistently associated with volume in the left and right hemisphere in the ABCD sample. Scans were excluded if they did not meet the quality control inclusion criteria outlined by the data analysis, informatics and resource center of ABCD (see release notes for details).

Functional magnetic resonance imaging time courses were projected onto FreeSurfer's cortical surface. Using these time courses, within- and between-network connectivity (Pearson correlation) was calculated based on the Gordon parcellation scheme (36) for 12 predefined resting-state networks: AN, CON, cinguloparietal network, DAN, DMN, FPN, retrosplenial temporal network (RTN), SMN (hand (H)), SMN (mouth (M)), salience network (SN), VAN and VN. These connectivity measures were then Fisher z-transformed, resulting in 78 dependent variables, 66 between-network connectivity variables and 12 within-network connectivity variables (with within-network connectivity representing the average correlation across all pairs of regions within each network). Scans were excluded if they did not meet the quality control inclusion criteria outlined by the ABCD data analysis, informatics and resource center (see release notes for details).

To examine the effects of state-level income inequality on brain structure and functional connectivity, we conducted linear mixed-effects models (using the lme4 package in R). State-level income inequality, indexed by the Gini coefficient, was included as the main predictor, with brain structure (cortical thickness and surface area, 34 variables each) and functional connectivity (across 12 brain networks, 78 variables in total) as the dependent variables (with separate models for each outcome). We corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR within each set of analyses for thickness, area and connectivity (PFDR < 0.05). P values were obtained using the lmerTest package. We ran three additional models for total cortical volume, total surface area and average cortical thickness. We included participant age at baseline, sex, scanner type and average framewise displacement (for connectivity measures), income-to-needs ratio at baseline, parent educational attainment at baseline and parent mental health problems at baseline as covariates to control for potential confounding factors. We additionally adjusted for TANF, incarceration rate and Medicaid expansion status (from 2016–2017) at the state level and included a random effect for family ID. All numerical variables were standardized for analyses. Semi-partial R2 values were obtained using the partR2 package in R. Given the small number of states (n = 17) and adjustments for key individual-level covariates (for example, age, sex, income-to-needs ratio, parent educational attainment and parent mental health) and site and state-level variables (for example, scanner manufacturer and model, state-level policies and cash assistance, and incarceration rates), clustering or random effects at the state or site level were deemed redundant as the included covariates adequately account for potential confounding and site-related variability. Since some covariates might arguably lie on the causal pathway from inequality to youth mental health (for example, parent mental health issues), the estimates obtained from our model are conservative. However, including this covariate adjusts for other environmental factors that may be associated with parent mental health issues—such as neglect, inconsistent caregiving and substance abuse—as well as genetic propensity to mental health problems. This approach allowed us to isolate effects associated with inequality to a greater extent. Further, to tease apart regional effects from global effects, we adjusted for average thickness (for regional thickness models) and total surface area (for regional surface area models). Model output for this additional analysis has been provided in Supplementary Table 4. Additionally, sensitivity analyses adjusting for racial homogeneity at the state-level (that is, percentage white) have been provided in Supplementary Tables 18–21.

On secondary analyses, race/ethnicity was modeled as a moderator of the association between inequality and brain structure and connectivity to account for intersectional influences. As above, we corrected for multiple comparisons using the FDR within each set of analyses for thickness, area and connectivity (PFDR < 0.05). These results have been reported and are discussed in the Supplementary Information.

For the significant variables identified in the linear mixed-effects models, we performed mediation analysis using structural equation modeling in the lavaan package in R. The analysis aimed to investigate whether brain structure or functional connectivity metrics mediated the relationship between state-level income inequality and total mental health symptoms assessed both 6 months and 18 months later. Scanner manufacturer/model, family ID (to account for family structure) and mean framewise displacement (for functional connectivity variables) were regressed out of the brain measures (that is, the mediator). All covariates (for example, sex, baseline income-to-needs ratio, baseline parental education and baseline parent psychopathology, 2016–2017 Medicaid, TANF and incarceration rate) were included as predictors in both the brain and outcome equations of the mediation models to ensure effects of interest were adjusted for these variables. Additionally, interview age at baseline was modeled in the ‘a' path and interview age at the respective mental health assessment (either the 6-month or 18-month follow-up) was modeled as a covariate in the ‘b' path. The structural models were not saturated and included only theoretically driven paths. To assess the significance of indirect effects, we employed a bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples to obtain bias-corrected confidence intervals (CIs) and P values for the indirect pathways. As before, we corrected for multiple comparisons within each set of analyses (that is, thickness, surface area and connectivity; PFDR < 0.05). A moderated mediation model was conducted for variables where race/ethnicity moderates the association between inequality and brain variables (results reported in the Supplementary Information). In a sensitivity analysis, we tested whether results were robust to the inclusion of total mental health problems at baseline as a covariate.

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) enables the direct reprogramming of somatic cells into functional oocytes, albeit with a diploid genome. To address ploidy reduction, we investigated an experimental reductive cell division process, termed mitomeiosis, wherein non-replicated (2n2c) somatic genomes are prematurely forced to divide following transplantation into the metaphase cytoplasm of enucleated human oocytes. However, despite fertilization with sperm, SCNT oocytes remained arrested at the metaphase stage, indicating activation failure. Artificial activation using a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor successfully bypassed this arrest, inducing the segregation of somatic chromosomes into a zygotic pronucleus and a polar body. Comprehensive chromosome tracing via sequencing revealed that homologous chromosome segregation occurred randomly and without crossover recombination. Nonetheless, an average of 23 somatic chromosomes were retained within the zygote, demonstrating the feasibility of experimentally halving the diploid chromosome set. Fertilized human SCNT oocytes progressed through normal embryonic cell divisions, ultimately developing into embryos with integrated somatic and sperm-derived chromosomes. While our study demonstrates the potential of mitomeiosis for in vitro gametogenesis, at this stage it remains just a proof of concept and further research is required to ensure efficacy and safety before future clinical applications.

Infertility affects millions of individuals worldwide and is often caused by the absence of functional gametes. In women, age-related decline in oocyte quality and quantity has been recognized as a primary contributing factor to infertility, particularly after their mid-thirties1. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is ineffective for patients lacking functional gametes, leaving them with no option to have genetically related children except through the use of donor gametes.

Reprogramming a patient's somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), followed by differentiation into functional sperm or oocytes—a concept known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG)—holds immense therapeutic potential, especially for patients without viable gametes. Proof-of-concept for female IVG has been established in mouse models2; however, due to significant differences in germ cell development between mice and humans, the translation of IVG to human oocytes remains elusive. Unlike the differentiation of iPSCs into adult somatic cells, IVG-derived oocytes must acquire maternal cytoplasmic factors essential for inducing totipotency after fertilization. They must also undergo proper meiotic recombination, chromosome ploidy reduction, and imprint reprogramming to meet the requirements for future clinical applications. Notably, the natural development of human oocytes from pluripotent progenitors within an embryo is a lengthy process, taking more than a decade to reach functional maturity. For clinical applications, IVG must substantially shorten this timeline to a few weeks.

Functional oocytes can also be generated through direct reprogramming of somatic cells via donor oocyte cytoplasm following somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT)3,4. SCNT-based IVG could offer several advantages, including reprogramming of transplanted somatic cell genomes directly to the oocyte-like epigenome by natural oocyte cytoplasmic factors5,6. Furthermore, the cytoplasm of in vivo matured donor oocytes provides essential maternal factors and germline mitochondria critical for subsequent induction of totipotency and full-term development of SCNT embryos.

Since the cytoplasm of enucleated metaphase II (MII)-arrested oocytes retains metaphase activity, implanted somatic chromatin rapidly condenses to form a metaphase-like spindle, resulting in the establishment of an MII-arrested SCNT oocyte7,8. Given that SCNT oocytes are diploid, fertilization with sperm has not been considered due to the risk of triploidy. Conventional SCNT applications instead utilize artificial activation to induce exit from metaphase arrest while preventing cytokinesis and chromosome loss9,10. Simultaneously, artificial activation triggers the release of maternal cytoplasmic factors responsible for inducing totipotency and initiating embryonic mitotic cycles. The developmental potential of SCNT oocytes has been well demonstrated by the successful production of live cloned mammals and the generation of functional human blastocysts and embryonic stem cells (SCNT-ESCs)8.

With the ultimate goal of developing infertility treatments for individuals without functional oocytes, we recently demonstrated that ploidy reduction can be experimentally achieved in mouse SCNT oocytes following fertilization with sperm11. Our findings indicated that premature metaphase spindles, comprising single-chromatid chromosomes formed after transplanting non-replicated, G0/G1-arrested somatic cell nuclei into enucleated MII oocytes, are capable of discarding one set of parental homologs into a pseudo polar body (PB) upon fertilization12. SCNT zygotes consisting of haploid somatic and sperm pronuclei can develop into diploid embryos and produce live mouse offspring11,12.

In this study, we adapted mitomeiosis for human SCNT oocytes and investigated whether metaphase spindles are functional and capable of discarding somatic chromosomes into the PB upon fertilization or artificial activation. We conducted precise chromosome sequencing to trace homologous chromosome segregation and examine ploidy reduction mechanisms. Lastly, we evaluated the integration of somatic and sperm chromosomes in preimplantation embryos derived from fertilized human SCNT oocytes.

Typical mitotic and meiotic cell divisions are preceded by a single round of DNA replication during the S-phase of the cell cycle resulting in duplication of chromosomes to two sister chromatids (2n4c; Fig. 1a, b). In the mitotic metaphase, sister chromatids from each chromosome are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle and segregated upon cytokinesis into two genetically identical daughter cells with a diploid number of chromosomes (2n2c). In contrast, during the female meiotic metaphase I, homologous chromosomes are paired with each other within a spindle and separated upon reductional division to haploid daughter cells, i.e. an oocyte and a polar body 1 (PB1), each containing one copy of each homolog (1n2c). Since chromosomes still contain two sister chromatids, the second meiotic division bypasses the S-phase and directly enters metaphase II (MII) and remains arrested at MII until fertilization with sperm. Upon fertilization, an MII oocyte exits from metaphase arrest and similar to mitosis, segregates sister chromatids to the female pronucleus (PN) and the PB2 (1n1c; Fig. 1a).

A schematic cell cycle and chromosome segregation mechanisms to daughter cells during canonical mitosis, meiosis I and meiosis II vs. mitomeiosis, an experimental reductive cell division induced in non-duplicated (2n2c) somatic cell genomes. Created in BioRender. Marti, N. (2025). a Chromosome dynamics and segregation during two consecutive meiotic cell divisions. Left panel shows the reductive meiosis I, where the duplicated homologous chromosomes consisting of sister chromatids pair, synapse and crossover followed by their segregation to the MII oocyte and its PB1. Right panel depicts the second meiotic division, where, similar to mitosis, sister chromatids segregate to the zygote and its PB2. b Left panel presents the canonical mitotic cell cycle, where following chromosome duplication, sister chromatids of each chromosome are segregated into two daughter cells maintaining the diploid chromosome content during cell divisions. Right panel demonstrates reductive mitomeiosis, where the nucleus at the G0/G1 stage is transferred into the cytoplasm of enucleated MII oocyte, thus bypassing the S-phase and prematurely entering the metaphase. The residual metaphase activity of enucleated MII-arrested oocyte forces premature condensation of non-duplicated chromosomes and formation of bipolar mitomeiosis spindle. Depending on chromosome positioning and attachment to the spindle, subsequent segregation of chromosomes to the zygote and the PB can result in either randomly reduced ploidy or haploidy in daughter cells.

We recently modified the conventional mouse SCNT and induced an experimental reductive cell division by mitomeiosis (Fig. 1b)11,12. Progression through various cell cycle stages is strictly regulated by DNA integrity checkpoint regulatory mechanisms including S/G2 and G2/M checkpoints. These checkpoints play a crucial role in ensuring that the metaphase does not commence if DNA replication is incomplete13,14. In meiosis, the cell cycle checkpoint blocks progression from metaphase to anaphase if positions of chromosomes and formation of a proper bipolar spindle are compromised15. Therefore, we initially investigated if nonduplicated G0/G1 (2n2c) genomes of human fibroblasts can prematurely enter the metaphase upon nuclear transfer into enucleated, MII-arrested cytoplasm of human oocytes. In vivo matured oocytes were collected following routine clinical ovarian stimulation and retrieval from young, healthy egg donor volunteers after obtaining informed consent8.

Spindle-chromosomal complexes from 270 mature, MII-arrested oocytes containing the PB1 were removed shortly after retrieval and cytoplasts were fused with G0/G1-arrested fibroblasts following our previously developed methods8. Premature onset of metaphase was monitored by observation of de novo spindle formation in SCNT oocytes using noninvasive imaging under polarized microscope equipped with the Oosight system8. Visible spindles, similar to those seen in control intact MII oocytes, became first detectable in SCNT oocytes 1 h after fusion, but the majority of spindles (77.5% ± 4.8) appeared after 2 h (Fig. 2a). Spindle images were captured, and their size and morphology analyzed by Oosight Meta software. SCNT spindles were elongated in shape and measurements of length and width were similar to spindles in intact MII oocytes (Fig. 2b, c).

Selected SCNT oocytes were fixed at several critical time points and immunolabeled to visualize spindle microtubules (α-tubulin), chromosome centromeres (kinetochore), and stained with DAPI (for DNA). These oocytes were then imaged under fluorescence microscopy to monitor spindle formation dynamics. Somatic cell nuclei in the interphase stage persisted in SCNT oocytes for up to 30 min post-fusion (Fig. 2d). By 1 h, SCNT oocyte nuclei underwent nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), premature chromatin condensation (PCC), and initiated microtubule formation (Fig. 2d). Bipolar SCNT spindles, with chromosome centromeres positioned at the equatorial region similar to control MII oocytes, were observed 2 h post-fusion (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Movie 1, 2). However, abnormal spindle morphology was also noted in majority of SCNT oocytes including small, round, or multipolar configurations (Fig. 2e).

These findings provide important insights into spindle formation dynamics during mitomeiosis in human oocytes and support our conclusion that, following fusion with enucleated MII oocyte cytoplasm, somatic 2n2c chromatin directly enters metaphase, bypassing the natural S-phase.

Next, we asked if human SCNT oocytes can exit from the MII-arrest and segregate non-duplicated chromosomes consisting of single chromatids to daughter cells. Naturally, mature MII oocytes remain arrested at the metaphase until fertilization with sperm which triggers exit from metaphase and sister chromatid segregation into the PB2 and the female PN, a signaling mechanism commonly referred to as oocyte activation. Intact control MII (n = 30) and SCNT oocytes (n = 41) with visible spindles were fertilized with sperm donated by a healthy research donor using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In the control group, 82.9% ± 9.5 fertilized oocytes extruded the PB2 and 79.8% ± 9.2 formed two PNs (female and male) visible after 6 h post fertilization (Fig. 2f). In contrast, only 23.4% ± 8.7 of sperm injected SCNT oocytes extruded the PB and 17.4% ± 9.3 formed PNs but PN formation was delayed up to 12 h post ICSI. While all control zygotes cleaved and 59% ± 16.1 reached blastocysts, only 25% of SCNT zygotes cultured cleaved but arrested at the 2-cell stage (Fig. 2f). It is important to note that the 25% activation rate refers specifically to PB extrusion, representing completion of the second division in mitomeiosis, rather than failure of subsequent mitotic cleavage.

These results indicate that a nonduplicated (2n2c) genome can enter prematurely into metaphase when nuclei of G0/G1 somatic cells are directly transplanted into enucleated MII-arrested oocyte cytoplasm. However, natural, sperm-induced activation is insufficient to release SCNT oocytes from the MII arrest. As the percentage of abnormal spindles did not directly correlate with the 77% that failed polar body extrusion upon sperm fertilization, it may be reasonable to suggest that additional factors beyond spindle morphology contribute to activation failure.

While the exact mechanisms responsible for failed fertilization of SCNT oocytes remain unclear, we reasoned that the persistent metaphase arrest could be due to failed activation. MII arrest is maintained by high activity of Maturation Promoting Factor (MPF) consisting of cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (Cdk1) and cyclin B (Fig. 3a)16,17. Sperm entry during fertilization triggers Ca2+ oscillations leading to degradation of cyclin B and subsequently inactivation of Cdk1 and exit from the MII arrest18. Alternatively, exit from the MII arrest can be induced experimentally, following so called artificial oocyte activation approaches10. Artificial activation is a critical step for conventional SCNT allowing exit from the MII arrest in SCNT oocytes without fertilization with sperm and thus avoiding possible triploidy. In addition to exit from the MII arrest, conventional activation procedures also block cytokinesis in SCNT oocytes preventing chromosome segregation into PBs10. We previously established sequential artificial activation stimuli critical for human SCNT oocytes to exit from the MII arrest and develop to blastocysts and SCNT-ESCs8. However, implementation of 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP), a broad protein phosphorylation inhibitor for conventional SCNT activation also prevents cytokinesis and PB extrusion10.

In contrast, activated and sperm fertilized SCNT zygotes contain two pronuclei originating from somatic and sperm genomes. Results observed in 7 independent experiments. d Activation and embryo development in control and SCNT oocytes after fertilization supplemented with electroporation+roscovitine activation.

Left: a zygote with 2PNs and a PB. Middle: a 2-cell embryo. Right: a blastocyst. Scale bar 100 μm. Note: All SCNT zygotes that developed to blastocysts had successfully extruded polar bodies, indicating completion of mitomeiosis.

Therefore, we tested an alternative activation for the ability to induce exit from the metaphase arrest without interfering with cytokinesis and PB extrusion. We initially mimicked calcium elevations by electroporation of MII and SCNT oocytes in Ca2+-containing D-sorbitol buffer8 and monitored release from the MII arrest. Electroporation alone induced robust cytokinesis and PB2 extrusion in the control MII oocyte group, but pronuclear formation was significantly delayed (10–12 h) compared to that seen in sperm fertilized zygotes (6 h). Moreover, all zygotes failed to cleave and remained arrested at the 1-cell stage (Fig. 3b). Upon electroporation, only 16.7% ± 10.5 of SCNT oocytes extruded the PB and 13.3% ± 9.7 formed one PN also visible late, 10–12 h after electroporation. Similar to controls, all SCNT zygotes failed to cleave (Fig. 3b).

Generally, calcium elevations alone are not sufficient to induce release from the MII arrest and initiate embryonic mitotic cycles10. Additional stimuli are required to inactivate MPF in human or monkey MII oocytes. Therefore, we treated control intact MII (n = 15) and SCNT (n = 74) oocytes with electroporation followed by 4-h incubation with roscovitine, a selective cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, in order to downregulate MPF activity while also allowing cytokinesis and PB extrusion (Fig. 3a)10,19. In the control MII group, 83.3% ± 10.5 oocytes extruded the PB2 and formed a single PN, 6–7 h after electroporation (Fig. 3b). In SCNT group treated with this sequential activation, 68.6% ± 7 of oocytes extruded the PB and 57.7% ± 6.2 formed a single PN, visible within 6–7 h after electroporation (Fig. 3b, c; Supplementary Movie 3). Imaging of immunolabelled SCNT oocytes 1 h after activation demonstrated an anaphase-like microtubule arrangement with somatic chromosomes situated at both poles of the spindle (Fig. 2d).

The majority of zygotes in both control and SCNT groups cleaved (91.7% ± 4.6 and 93.8% ± 6.3, respectively) and while 45.8% ± 16.2 of control (parthenogenetic) embryos reached the blastocyst stage, SCNT embryos arrested at the 4-10-cell stage.

To determine if this artificial activation can rescue SCNT oocytes from the MII arrest upon fertilization with sperm. Control MII (n = 30) and SCNT (n = 82) oocytes were fertilized with sperm by ICSI and then SCNT oocytes activated with electroporation+roscovitine. The majority of control and SCNT oocytes extruded polar bodies (82.9% ± 9.5 and 77.9% ± 4.9, respectively) and formed two pronuclei (79.8% ± 9.2 and 76% ± 5.5, respectively) after 6–7 h post fertilization (Fig. 3d, e). All control and most SCNT zygotes with 2 PNs cleaved (100% and 83.3% ± 16.7, respectively), while 59% ± 16.1 of control embryos reached the blastocyst stage, only 8.8% ± 5.2 fertilized SCNT embryos developed to blastocysts (Fig. 3d, e).

Our results showed that supplemental activation with electroporation and roscovitine can rescue the fertilization by sperm and release SCNT oocytes from the MII arrest. Moreover, this artificial activation does not affect normal fertilization nor development of control, intact MII oocytes suggesting its potential applications for assisted activation for IVF cases with fertilization failures. In summary, a diploid but non-replicated somatic genome (2n2c) can be forced to enter prematurely into a metaphase of mitomeiosis by SCNT. Moreover, upon assisted activation, SCNT oocytes consisting of 2n2c somatic chromosomes can bypass spindle checkpoint arrest and resume embryonic cell divisions.

Next, we asked how 2n2c somatic chromosomes in human SCNT oocytes are segregated to daughter cells (i.e. PN and PB) upon exit from metaphase of mitomeiosis. To identify all human chromosomes and distinguish somatic parental homologs from each other and from sperm (total of 69 chromosomes), we developed a custom, whole chromosome tracing approach using an amplicon sequencing assay (Ampliseq). A family consisting of parents from diverse ethnic backgrounds and their daughter were recruited to participate in this research, as was an unrelated research sperm donor who also provided blood DNA and skin biopsies for this study. Initially, WGS was performed on genomic DNA from all four study subjects and screened for presence of unique SNVs discriminating maternal and paternal somatic chromosomes from sperm homologs. WGS data were then analyzed to identify informative triallelic loci on all autosomal and X chromosomes that would allow distinction between maternal and paternal chromosomes in SCNT oocytes generated from daughter's skin fibroblasts from sperm homologs in fertilized SCNT embryos. We selected a total of 630 highly confident loci covering 584 triallelic and 47 biallelic genomic variants in autosomal and X chromosomes and used this database to build the targeted AmpliSeq sequencing platform. We then validated the AmpliSeq on DNA samples from the study subjects confirming consistent capture between 92 and 95% of targeted genomic loci (min. 580, max. 598 of 630) necessary for determining homologous chromosome origin in SCNT oocytes and embryos (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b).

We then used daughter's skin fibroblasts arrested at the G0/G1 of the cell cycle for transfer into enucleated MII oocyte cytoplasm. Human SCNT oocytes containing visible spindles were either activated with electroporation+roscovitine or fertilized with sperm and then activated with electroporation+roscovitine and PBs and PNs or individual blastomeres of cleaving embryos were collected from each of 113 SCNT embryos. Only SCNT embryos that successfully extruded polar bodies were selected for AmpliSeq analysis. The DNA samples were processed by WGA, sequenced by AmpliSeq and the chromosomal content of 90 embryos was suitable for analysis while the remaining samples were lost during collection or sequencing. Paired analysis of both PN or blastomeres  and PB revealed that in 41 (45.6%) SCNT zygotes segregation of somatic chromosomes did not occur (Fig. 4a, Supplementary data 1,2,3,4). In the majority of non-segregated embryos (n = 39), all 46 somatic chromosomes were retained within the PN, whereas in 2 zygotes, all chromosomes were extruded into the PB. Among the remaining 49 SCNT embryos, segregation patterns of 46 chromosomes to the daughter cells ranged from 3:43 to 23:23 (Fig. 4b, Supplementary data 1,2,3,4). We removed 8 SCNT embryos with partial segregation patterns (10 or fewer chromosomes) from the subsequent analyses to avoid artificial biases during computation of segregation patterns (Fig. 4b). Of the remaining 41 embryos, 22 provided paired, readable somatic chromosome sequences for both PN and PB compartments, while in the remaining samples clear sequencing reads were available only for PN or PB. The mean somatic chromosome count in PNs (N = 38) was 22.8 ± 1 while in PBs (N = 25) the mean count was 23.3 ± 1.3 (Fig. 4c, Supplementary data 1,2,3,4). These results suggest that partition of somatic chromosomes, consisting of single chromatids after activation of human SCNT oocytes is more or less equal. While similar to meiosis, mitomeiosis achieves numerical chromosome reduction, the random segregation pattern and absence of recombination represent fundamental differences from conventional meiotic mechanisms.

Horizontal lines represent the mean; (p = 0.76, Wilcoxon rank sum test). g No linear relationship was found between chromosome length and homolog segregation frequency; R2 = 0.02. h Random distribution of maternal and paternal homologs to PNs and PBs for all chromosomes except the chromosome 8 that showed preferential segregation of maternal homologs to PNs and paternal homologs to PBs. *Indicates significant (p < 0.05) differences between groups. Chi-square test was used for comparison. i Number of segregated homologs analyzed for each chromosome pair for detecting crossover recombinations. Note: only SCNT zygotes that extrude polar bodies were included for analyses. Note: analysis focuses on somatic-origin chromosomes only; sperm chromosomes in fertilized samples are present but excluded from this segregation analysis to enable aggregation between fertilized and non-fertilized SCNT oocytes.

Next, we examined the segregation pattern of each 23 pairs of maternal and paternal somatic homologous chromosomes during mitomeiosis in SCNT zygotes. The mean number of properly segregated somatic homologs in PNs was 10.9 ± 2.5 and 11.1 ± 2.4 in PBs, ranging in individual SCNT zygotes from a minimum of 6 to a maximum of 16 (Fig. 4d, e, f). To evaluate the homolog segregation mechanism, we compared the distribution seen in human SCNT zygotes to a Monte Carlo simulation test calculated for random segregation of 23 pairs. The mean number of segregated homologs expected by random distribution in this simulation was 11/11.5, ranging from a minimum of 6/7 to a maximum of 16 homologous chromosomes segregated properly (Fig. 4e, f). This simulated segregation was statistically similar to that seen in SCNT zygotes, suggesting that in contrast to canonical meiosis, segregation of parental somatic homologs during mitomeiosis is random. We also analyzed segregation dynamics of individual chromosomes based on their relative length but did not observe any correlation with homolog segregation frequency (Fig. 4g). We also analyzed if chromosome morphology (metacentric vs. acrocentric) influenced segregation patterns, as recent studies have suggested differential behavior of acrocentric chromosomes in the meiotic context. However, we observed no significant correlation between chromosome morphology and segregation frequency during mitomeiosis. We next analyzed distribution of paternal vs. maternal homologs to PNs and PBs and concluded random distribution of all pairs except for chromosome 8 that showed preferential segregation of maternal homologs to PNs and paternal homologs to PBs (Fig. 4h). The bias observed for this particular chromosome segregation rates is unexpected considering that chromosome 8 is relatively moderate in size and aneuploidy rate in human IVF embryos is relatively low compared to some other chromosomes. The underlying mechanism behind this intriguing exception to the otherwise random segregation pattern for other chromosomes remains unclear and warrants further investigations.

We then analyzed all segregated somatic homologous chromosomes containing AmpliSeq reads for the entire length of chromosome for crossover recombinations. The AmpliSeq profiles of all segregated chromosomes in SCNT zygotes were identical to the original fibroblasts used for SCNT, indicating absence of recombination after mitomeiosis (Fig. 4i).

We next asked if SCNT zygotes produced by artificial activation can resume subsequent mitotic cell divisions and replicate somatic chromosomes. DNA isolated from individual blastomeres of nine (2–10 cell stage) cleaving SCNT embryos and DNA from pooled cells of two embryos (6–8 cell stage), were processed for sequencing. These early stage embryos were chosen to ensure accurate representation of the initial chromosome segregation patterns before additional chromosomal abnormalities potentially arising after embryonic genome activation. Single-cell chromosome analysis indicated that all 9 embryos were uniform with every sister blastomere carrying the same number and origin of somatic chromosomes (Supplementary data 3, 5). Three embryos carried the full diploid set of 46 somatic chromosomes indicating that segregation of chromosomes to the PB did not occur in these embryos (Supplementary data 3,5). The remaining 6 embryos carried a reduced number of chromosomes ranging from N = 14 to N = 23, consisting of mixture of various maternal, paternal or both parental chromosomes while some chromosome pairs were absent altogether (Fig. 5a; Supplementary data 3,5). The total number of chromosomes in two SCNT embryos from pooled cells was also reduced (N = 34 and N = 41; Supplementary data 3). These results suggest that SCNT zygotes can resume embryonic mitotic cell divisions and replicate and distribute reduced number of somatic chromosomes.

a Uniform 4-cell stage SCNT embryo #89 produced by artificial activation alone. AmpliSeq detected presence of 23 somatic chromosomes in every blastomere with random homolog segregation. b Uniform 3-cell stage SCNT embryo #10 produced by fertilization with sperm assisted with activation. Sequencing data show presence of all 23 sperm chromosomes and 25 somatic chromosomes in each blastomere. c Mosaic SCNT embryos #6 and #9 produced by fertilization with sperm assisted with activation. Individual sister blastomeres carried various number of sperm and somatic chromosomes.

Lastly, we analyzed SCNT embryos fertilized with sperm for integration of somatic and sperm chromosomes. Analysis of pooled cell DNA from three SCNT blastocysts detected the presence of a total N = 49, N = 28, and N = 27 chromosomes in each embryo, respectively (Supplementary data 4 and 6). All 23 sperm homologs were present in the blastocysts, while the number and origin of somatic chromosomes varied. To determine mosaicism within sister blastomeres, we analyzed additional nine SCNT embryos at the 2–6-cell stage by single-cell sequencing of individual blastomeres.

Analysis revealed that three of these embryos were uniform while remaining six were mosaic. In uniform embryos, chromosome number and composition were similar among all sister blastomeres and consisted of both sperm and somatic chromosomes (Supplementary data 4 and 7). All 23 sperm homologs were present in all blastomeres of these embryos, while number and origin of somatic chromosomes varied. As expected, some somatic chromosomes were of paternal or maternal origin while for other chromosomes both homologs were present or absent (Fig. 5b, Supplementary data 4, 7). Mosaic embryos consisted of blastomeres carrying either sperm or somatic chromosomes only or mixture of somatic and sperm chromosomes (Fig. 5c, Supplementary data 4 and 8). All 23 sperm chromosomes were present in most mosaic embryos except one embryo where not all sperm chromosomes were detected. As expected, somatic cell chromosome numbers and origin varied between mosaic embryos and between sister blastomeres ranging from N = 46 (diploid) to N = 6 and consisting of mixture of maternal, paternal and both somatic homologs.

To assess genomic stability following mitomeiosis, we performed detailed chromosome analyses of polar bodies and embryos derived from fertilized or activated SCNT oocytes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary data 3–8). Our results indicate that mitotic cycles after mitomeiosis proceed normally, with both somatic and sperm chromosomes replicating faithfully despite initial aneuploidy. In uniform embryos, chromosome numbers and composition were consistent among all sister blastomeres, suggesting stable maintenance of the initial chromosomal content throughout early embryonic divisions.

Overall, our results suggest that somatic and sperm chromosomes can integrate into a joint genome in some SCNT embryos, while in others the two genomes segregated to different sister blastomeres and formed a mosaic embryo. Despite contribution of all 23 sperm homologs, random segregation and allocation of somatic homologs to the PN of SCNT zygotes resulted in aneuploid SCNT embryos.

The diploid genome of mammalian cells is organized as a set of chromosome pairs consisting of nearly identical parental chromosomes initially formed during fertilization of haploid oocyte with haploid sperm20. Reverse diploidy reduction to haploidy occurs naturally only in gamete precursors following the reductive meiosis I division. In prophase of female meiosis I, duplicated chromosomes, each consisting of two sister chromatids, undergo extraordinary rearrangements by sensing, recognizing and pairing with their homologs followed by crossover recombination21. These homolog alignment and crossover events collaborate with sister chromatid cohesion to create temporary physical links, called chiasmata, that connect homologs and allow them to orient and subsequently segregate one parental homolog into the MII oocyte and another into the PB1, thereby achieving haploidy. The reductional meiosis I is followed by an equational meiotic II division where, similar to mitosis, sister chromatids are segregated to opposite spindle poles eliminating one set into the PB2. Human oocyte haploidization is also an extremely long process initiating meiosis I in the first trimester of fetal development and completing the meiosis II roughly 12 or more years later, after the fertilization. Prophase I is considered the longest stage compared to other meiotic stages22. Mirroring these mechanistically complex and lifelong meiotic processes of natural oogenesis for human IVG remains challenging.

We have successfully utilized the residual metaphase activity and meiotic machinery in the cytoplasm of enucleated human MII oocytes to implant donor MII spindles23 (known as spindle transfer) or PB1 genomes24 (PB1 transfer) to induce de novo spindle formation. Moreover, such reconstructed human MII oocytes (1n2c) can readily be fertilized with sperm followed by exit from the MII arrest, segregation of sister chromatids and formation of normal diploid zygotes containing 1n1c sperm and 1n1c oocyte chromosomes23,24,25,26. Applications of the spindle transfer, generally known as cytoplasmic/mitochondrial replacement therapy or MRT, has been already tested in clinical IVF for treatment of female infertility and resulted in birth of healthy children27.

Here, we explored the metaphase machinery of enucleated MII oocytes to induce reductive cell division and chromosome count reduction in the transplanted somatic genome. As indicated above, transition through different phases of the cell cycle is closely coordinated with DNA replication, chromosome duplication and distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. This coordination is controlled by a system of cell cycle checkpoints including in G2 that prevents entry into the M-phase if DNA replication is incomplete and chromosomes are not duplicated28. Direct transfer of somatic cell nuclei arrested at the G0/G1 phase into the MII-arrested oocyte cytoplasm bypasses this checkpoint and induces formation of MII-like bipolar spindles in SCNT oocytes. However, human SCNT oocytes did not respond to the conventional activation stimulus induced by fertilization with sperm, failing to form zygotes. While the precise nature of this persistent metaphase arrest requires further investigation, we investigated artificial activation as supplement for fertilization with sperm.

We previously showed that fertilization of mouse SCNT oocytes provides sufficient activation signaling for release from the metaphase arrest and formation of SCNT zygotes. This suggests that interspecies differences in SCNT spindles exist between mouse and human oocytes. Therefore, we investigated supplemental activation stimuli to bypass the MII arrest in human SCNT oocytes. We demonstrate that activation by electroporation followed by incubation with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine alone or in combination with sperm fertilization is required to circumvent the MII arrest and induce reductive cell division in human SCNT oocytes.

Approximately half the chromosomes from the 2n2c diploid set in human SCNT oocytes were retained within the zygote while the other half was discarded to the PB. While the average number of chromosomes after the reductive division was comparable to the haploid set, comprehensive parental chromosome sequencing indicated that the distribution of somatic homologs to the SCNT zygotes and PBs was random. Based on our recent mouse study, the sequence differences between homologs from the divergent mouse strains correlated with random segregation while proper segregation of homologs was only observed in mouse SCNT oocytes generated from inbred somatic cells12.

Fertilized human SCNT embryos were diploid (one somatic and one sperm chromosome) for approximately half the homologs while other chromosome pairs were either triploid (two somatic and one sperm) or monosomic (sperm only). Another principal difference of mitomeiosis from the meiosis I is the lack of crossover recombinations between homologs, a source of genetic diversity in gametes.

Consequently, substantial further experimental modifications of the mitomeiosis will be required to achieve reductive cell division outcomes similar to the meiosis I. As mentioned above, crossover recombination and haploidization are preceded by homologous chromosomes pairing and alignment during the meiotic prophase I21. However, mechanisms controlling this critical and fundamental stage of meiosis are poorly understood29. It is believed that in most species including mammals, mechanisms responsible for crossover recombination also promote homolog pairing by delivering the machinery required for reading and detecting DNA sequence homology29,30. Meiotic recombination, in turn, is dependent on programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced across all chromosomes at multiple loci and catalyzed by the Spo11 protein31. The location and number of DSBs are determined by the DNA-binding specificity of the PRDM9 methyltransferase and the ATM kinase32,33. Meiotic DSBs recruit high-fidelity DNA repair machinery by homologous recombination including the ubiquitously expressed RAD51 DNA recombinase and the meiosis-specific DMC1 DNA recombinase which search for a homologous repair template34. The subsequent repair of DSBs results in either crossover or no non-crossover (gene conversion) recombination between homologous chromosomes30. It is likely that many of these critical components of meiosis I are absent in the MII oocyte cytoplasm thus precluding somatic homolog pairing and accurate segregation in human SCNT oocytes. Additionally, the structural complexity hypothesis suggests that the condensed, differentiated state of somatic chromatin may prevent homolog recognition mechanisms that operate during natural meiosis. As somatic genome carries complex epigenetic modifications and higher-order chromatin organization, this could impede the molecular machinery required for homolog pairing and synapsis. Moreover, meiosis naturally operates with duplicated homologs each consisting of two sister chromatids, while SCNT spindles consist of non-duplicated chromosomes. Translation of the SCNT technology for IVG applications will require addressing these and other important characteristics of gamete biology and development of novel methods for segregating somatic cell chromosomes.

Despite incomplete haploidy, somatic chromosomes retained within human SCNT zygotes enter the S-phase, duplicate and resume typical embryonic mitotic cycles. Remarkably, a semi-haploid somatic chromosome set is accurately replicated and segregated to daughter blastomeres in SCNT embryos evading further cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms. Moreover, the somatic genome can functionally integrate with sperm chromosomes after fertilization of human SCNT oocytes and form uniform embryos consisting of somatic and sperm chromosomes.

An important limitation of our current study is the inability to distinguish between developmental arrest caused by chromosomal abnormalities versus incomplete epigenetic reprogramming of somatic chromosomes. Given that all analyzed embryos exhibited chromosomal imbalances, separating aneuploidy effects from reprogramming defects remains challenging. The modest 8.8% blastocyst development rate likely reflects contribution from both factors. Success of SCNT relies on the erasure of somatic epigenetic programs and establishment of totipotency in SCNT embryos, thus extensive future investigations are required to elucidate potential reprogramming errors before considerations of clinical applications.

The OHSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviewed, approved and provided regular oversight of this research study. In addition, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) was formed that provided bi-annually review of all gamete and tissue donations, use of samples, and any adverse events in study participants. During this study, 270 mature MII oocytes were utilized to generate 155 research embryos for developmental analysis and genetic characterization. No embryos were cultured beyond day 6 post-fertilization (blastocyst stage), which represents the standard timepoint for clinical embryo transfer and preimplantation genetic testing.

The study followed the guidelines regulating the use of human gametes, embryos and embryonic stem cells for research in state of Oregon set by the Oregon Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (OSCRO) in 2008. These guidelines also regulate procurement, fertilization and genetic manipulation of human gametes, embryos and embryonic stem cells for research. The OHSU Innovative Research Advisory Panel (IRAP) and the Scientific Review Committee (SRC) reviewed and evaluated the scientific merit and ethical justification of the proposed study and recommended allowing the research with continued oversight and dialog. Members of the committees were kept confidential from the research team. The OHSU IRB supervised all committee meetings and provided documentation and formal recommendations.

Study subjects were provided a protocol specific consent form which included a lay language summary of the research design, approved by the OHSU IRB, prior to obtaining informed consent. The study volunteers were informed of risks associated with participation in this study, including both medical and loss of confidentiality risks. Study subjects were also provided the option to consent to be notified of any clinically relevant findings related to their genetic information, as well as whether they would allow genetic material from their donation to be shared with outside researchers.

Healthy oocyte donors (age 21–35 years), a sperm donor and skin and blood donors were recruited locally using print flyers and online advertising. In accordance with Oregon regulations and ethical guidelines, research oocyte donors received compensation ranging from $7000 to $8000 per donation cycle, reflecting the time, effort, and potential discomfort involved in the donation process. This compensation range reflects changes over the 3–4 year study period and is consistent with amounts offered for egg donations in fertility treatments in Portland, Oregon. The study protocol, including the compensation framework, was reviewed and approved by the OHSU Institutional Review Board to ensure ethical compliance and research participant protection.

Ovarian stimulation protocols and procedures were as described previously25. Ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrievals were managed by OHSU fertility physicians and recovered gametes were transferred to the research laboratory. All study-related procedures were conducted at the OHSU Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were treated with hyaluronidase to disaggregate and remove cumulus cells. Mature metaphase II (MII) oocytes were placed in Global Medium (Life Global) supplemented with 10% serum substitute supplement (Global 10% medium) at 37 °C in 6% CO2 and covered with tissue culture oil (Sage IVF, Cooper Surgical).

Skin biopsy and blood draws were performed at OHSU fertility clinic by the study physicians. Skin punches of 1–3 mm were placed into sterile saline solution and processed to establish primary culture of fibroblasts as described earlier35. Fibroblasts were synchronized at the G0/G1 of the cell cycle by culturing to the full confluency and incubating in culture medium containing 0.5% FBS for 2–4 days before SCNT.

Oocyte enucleations and fusion with fibroblasts were performed as described previously8. Briefly, mature MII oocytes were place into a 30μl manipulation droplet of HTF w/HEPES (Life Global) supplemented with 10% serum substitute supplement (HTF w/HEPES 10%), containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 1.25 mM caffeine in a glass-bottom dish. Droplet was covered with tissue culture oil (Sage IVF, Cooper Surgical) and oocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before spindle removals. Dish was mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a stage warmer (Tokai Hit), Narishige micromanipulators, Oosight spindle imaging system and a laser objective (HamiltonThorne). An oocyte was held by a holding pipette and positioned so that the spindle was situated close to the 3 o'clock position. The zona pellucida next to the spindle was drilled with laser pulses, and an enucleation pipette was inserted through the opening. A spindle with small amount of cytoplasm surrounded by a membrane was aspirated into the pipette and discarded. A disaggregated fibroblast was aspirated into a micropipette, briefly exposed to the HVJ-E fusion extract and then placed into the perivitelline space of the cytoplast ensuring close contact with the oocyte membrane. Fused SCNT oocytes were incubated for two hours to allow spindle formation.

SCNT and MII oocytes were placed into a micromanipulation dish containing 30 µL droplet of HTF w/HEPES 10% covered with tissue culture oil and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a stage warmer and Narishige micromanipulators. Fertilization was performed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using frozen and thawed sperm as described previously26.

SCNT and MII oocytes were initially subjected to Ca2+ treatment by electroporation (Electro Square Porator T-820, BTX) in 0.25 M D-sorbitol buffer containing 0.1 mM calcium acetate, 0.5 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM HEPES, and 1 mg/ml fatty-acid-free BSA as described before8. Briefly, SCNT oocytes are place between the electrodes of the BTX apparatus in D-Sorbitol buffer and subjected to two pulses (HV 3.0 kV, Pulse length 50 and 0.13 charging voltage). After electroporation, oocytes were incubated in Global 10% medium containing 50 μM roscovitine (Sigma) at 37 °C in 6% CO2 for 4 hr. Activated SCNT oocytes were rinsed with HTF w/HEPES 10% and cultured in Global medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 12 mM b-mercaptoethanol (BME), and 10 nM Trichostatin A (TSA, Sigma) at 37 °C in 6% CO2, 5% O2, and 89% N2 for 15 h in an embryoscope time-lapse incubator (Vitrolife). Time-lapse video monitoring was used to determine timing of polar body extrusions and pronuclear formations and zygotes were rinsed and cultured in Global medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 12 mM BME at 37 °C in 6% CO2, 5% O2, and 89% N2.

Zona pellucidae of SCNT and control MII oocytes was removed using a laser and oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing in a blocking solution (0.3% BSA in PBS) three times for 15 min each. Fixed oocytes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature and rinsed in blocking solution for 20 min at room temperature to reduce non-specific binding during subsequent antibody staining. Oocytes were incubated with antibodies for centromeres (human anti-centromere and anti-kinetochore, 1:30, Antibodies incorporated, cat#15-234) and microtubules (α-tubulin rabbit mAb AlexaFluor 488, 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, cat#5063) washed in blocking solution and then placed on glass slides into a micro drop of mounting medium containing DAPI. A coverslip was carefully placed on top of the drop and images were analyzed with super-resolution epifluorescent microscope Olympus IX83 with inbuilt cellSens Dimension software. Pictures acquired with Olympus cellSens Dimension software were used to produce the rotating 3D videos using ImageJ Fiji software.

Three to four hours before filming, culture dishes were prepared with pre-equilibrated medium at 37 °C in 6% CO2, 5% O2, and 89% N2 to ensure optimal medium conditions and pH. Embryos were placed individually into each well, and dishes were loaded into the EmbryoScope time-lapse incubator (Vitrolife, Sweden). The time of oocyte activation or fertilization was the start point. Embryo development was continuously monitored using integrated EmbryoViewer software v.5.4. The system captures high-resolution images of each embryo every 15-min intervals in various focal planes, allowing non-invasive, non-disturbed observation throughout the preimplantation period.

Zona pellucidae from zygotes and cleaved embryos were removed by brief exposure to acidic Tyrode solution (NaCl 8 mg/ml, KCl 0.2 mg/ml, CaCl2.2H2O 2.4 mg/ml, MgCl2.6 H2O 0.1 mg/ml, glucose 1 mg/ml, PVP 0.04 mg/ml). Zona-free zygotes and embryos were briefly treated with trypsin (0.15% in PBS containing EDTA but Ca+2 and Mg+2 free) to loosen blastomeres and PBs. Zygotes were placed in a droplet of HTF w/HEPES 10% containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B and 10 μg/ml nocodazole. Pronuclei and PBs from SCNT and control zygotes were microsurgically isolated using micromanipulators. Cleaved embryos were manually disaggregated into single blastomeres with a small-bore pipette. Individual blastomeres and isolated PNs and PBs were transferred into 0.2-ml PCR tubes containing 4 μl PBS and placed into −80 °C freezer until further use. Whole-genome amplification was performed employing multiple displacement amplification using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's manual.

Whole genome sequencing and AmpliSeq design were conducted to identify genomic loci capable of distinguishing between paternal and maternal homologous chromosomes of fibroblasts as nuclear donors for SCNT and from the sperm chromosomes. DNA extracted from nuclear donor fibroblasts and blood samples from both proband's parents and the sperm donor, was normalized to 500 ng in 25 μl of resuspension buffer RSB. Library preparation was carried out using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Paired-end sequencing was performed at 2 × 150 bp with an average autosome coverage depth of 27X using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.

Preprocessing of the raw sequencing reads was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK). This involved several steps: generating unaligned BAM files using FastqToSam (Picard tools v2.26.9), marking adapters with MarkIlluminaAdapters, converting unaligned BAM to fastq using SamToFastq, mapping to the GRCh38 genome assembly with BWA-MEM (v0.7.17), and merging BAM and unaligned BAM with MergeBamAlignment. The aligned reads were then coordinate-sorted using SortSamSpark (GATK v4.2.6.1), and duplicate reads were marked with MarkDuplicatesSpark (GATK v4.2.6.1). Joint variant calling was performed using FreeBayes (v1.3.5) with local left-alignment of indels, followed by normalization with bcftools (v1.14). Additional filters (QUAL  >  1 & QUAL/AO  >  10 & SAF  >  0 & SAR  >  0 & RPR  >  1 & RPL  >  1) were applied to remove low-confidence calls. The resulting variant sets were used for downstream analysis and identification of unique triallelic loci in R (v4.0.3).

The genomic positions of these loci were used to design a custom targeted sequencing (AmpliSeq) panel. This panel targeted 651 genomic regions across all chromosomes. Among these, 583 targeted genomic regions contained either single nucleotide variants differentiating maternal, paternal, and sperm chromosomes, or a defined set of adjacent biallelic variants that, when phased, determined the haplotype of maternal, paternal, or sperm origin. Due to the low number of informative triallelic haplotypes, chromosomes 19, 21, and 22 were supplemented with 47 biallelic variants differentiating maternal and paternal homologs only. The average amplicon length was 260 bp, and the total length of all targeted regions was approximately 39 Kb.

To analyze the chromosome content of collected PNs, PBs and blastomeres, whole genome amplified DNA concentrations were normalized to 10 ng/μl, and 50 ng input was utilized for library preparation with the AmpliSeq panel and the AmpliSeq Library PLUS kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer's protocols. Paired-end sequencing was conducted on either the Illumina MiSeq platform as 2 × 200 bp or on the Nextseq1000 as 2  × 150 bp to achieve a median coverage depth of 95X.

Preprocessing steps were applied to the raw sequencing reads using GATK to generate BAM files suitable for further analysis. These steps included generating unaligned BAM files via FastqToSam (Picard tools v2.26.9), marking adapters using MarkIlluminaAdapters, converting unaligned BAM to fastq via SamToFastq, mapping to the GRCh38 genome assembly with BWA-MEM (v0.7.17), and merging BAM and unaligned BAM with MergeBamAlignment. Duplicate reads were retained. Genomic variants were called using FreeBayes (v1.3.5), followed by normalization with bcftools (v1.14). The resulting variant calling data were then employed for downstream analysis of chromosome segregation in R (v4.3.0). Genomic loci with variant coverage depth of less than 22× were considered not amplified and were therefore excluded from the inference of chromosome origin.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Chi-square test was used for the comparison between maternal and paternal segregation. Monte Carlo Simulation was use for random segregation. Unpaired t test was used for comparison of mean length and width of the novo spindles, PB2 extrusion, PN formation, cleavage and blastocyst development, which were presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was set at P < 0.05.

All data supporting the findings of this study are included in this published article and its supplementary information files. All data used to generate summary graphs and figures are provided in Supplementary data. Due to OHSU IRB retsrictions and Oregon laws as well as terms of the consents signed by research participants, we are unable to publicly upload and share whole-genome and amplicon sequencing data outside of the OHSU network as these data sets may be used to reveal the genetic identity of the study participants. Nevertheless, we are willing to share this information on a case-by-case basis, onsite at OHSU if approval is granted by OHSU Research Integrity and the IRB (Kara Drolet, Associate VP, ORIO irb@ohsu.edu). Additionally, the approved requestor will be directed to an OHSU compliance officer to initiate a Non-Disclosure Agreement. These measures are intended to ensure the confidentiality of our research participants while also striving for research transparency and reproducibility. Upon successful approvals the requestor will be escorted by a team member at all times and granted access to an OHSU computer in a shared office where they can access and review the data sets. All requests should be initiated with OHSU Research Integrity and will move through their process, which may take upwards of 3–6 months to gain full access to all genome sequencing data that was generated in this work but not shared publicly.

Ever felt the world slow down around you? That's not your imagination.

Time isn't nearly as immutable as it first seems. Ask any astrophysicist, and they'll likely regale you with mind-bending descriptions of gravity's effect on space-time (i.e. the more massive the object, the slower time appears to travel around it). Some cosmologists even wonder if entire pockets of the universe—whether filled with galaxies or endless nothing—experience time at different rates. 

However, the perception of the speed at which time passes can also vary within our minds. And it's this mental realm that Steve Taylor—a psychologist at Leeds Beckett University—is exploring in a new paper and a new book called Time Expansion Experiences. 

Taylor's interest in these altered temporal moments—which he calls “time expansion experiences,” or TEEs—began when he and his wife were involved in a car crash back in 2014. “Everything went into slow motion,” Taylor describes in a post on the Leeds Beckett University website. “I looked behind, and the other cars seemed to be moving incredibly slowly, almost as if they were frozen. I felt as though I had a lot of time to observe the whole scene and to try to regain control of the car. I was surprised by how much detail I could perceive.”

Thankfully, the duo emerged from the car crash unscathed (the car, not so much). In the following decade, Taylor began investigating how and why these moments of ultra-slowness manifest, and his research has led him to some pretty interesting conclusions. 

In 2020, Taylor analyzed 96 instances as TEEs and found that roughly half of them occurred during accidents, while others took place during sporting events, while in meditation, or during psychedelic experiences. The results were published in the journal The Journal of Humanistic Psychology. 



In an article for the website The Conversation, Taylor explained how some of the leading theories behind these time altering states don't quite grasp the entire breadth of the experiences. One theory believes these moments are the result of the release noradrenaline—essentially the body's fight or flight mechanism—but this doesn't explain the mental time dilation of people during moments of intense meditation or concentration. It's possible that this perception is an evolutionary hack for surviving intense situations, but that still doesn't explain how they occur outside of life-or-death events. 

“[Another] theory is that TEEs aren't real experiences, but illusions of recollection. In emergency situations, so this theory goes, our awareness becomes acute, so that we take in more perceptions than normal,” Taylor wrote. “These perceptions become encoded in our memories, so that when we recall the emergency situation, the extra memories create the impression that time passed slowly.”

However, Taylor's findings from people who've experienced TEEs indicate that they were able to process thoughts and information much faster than what would be possible under normal circumstances. Instead, Taylor advocates for an idea that these events shift the human mind into an altered state of consciousness. In these moments, we step outside our normal consciousness into what Taylor calls a different “time-world.”

“The sudden shock of an accident may disrupt our normal psychological processes, causing an abrupt shift in consciousness. In sport, intense altered states occur due to what I call ‘super-absorption,'” Taylor wrote. 

While the flow of time remains a delicate dance between gravity and space-time, research shows that time can also very much be a state of mind.

Brain activity controls adaptive behavior but also drives unintentional incidental movements. Such movements could potentially be used to read out internal cognitive variables that are also neurally computed. Establishing this would require ruling out that incidental movements reflect cognition merely because they are coupled with task-related responses through the biomechanics of the body. Here we addressed this issue in a foraging task for mice, where multiple decision variables are simultaneously encoded even if, at any given time, only one of them is used. We found that characteristic features of the face simultaneously encode not only the currently used decision variables but also independent and unexpressed ones, and we show that these features partially originate from neural activity in the secondary motor cortex. Our results suggest that facial movements reflect ongoing computations above and beyond those related to task demands and demonstrate the ability of noninvasive monitoring to expose otherwise latent cognitive states.

The behavioral and electrophysiological data used in this study are available on Figshare at https://figshare.com/s/924af1de619f4597f37a (ref. 44). Raw videos and electrophysiological data are too large to be shared on a public repository and are therefore available from the authors upon request.

All analyses were performed using custom code written in MATLAB that is available upon request. The code used to process the videos is publicly available at https://github.com/MouseLand/facemap. The code used for the central GLM analyses is publicly available at https://hastie.su.domains/glmnet_matlab/. The code developed for the LM-HMM can be accessed at https://github.com/mazzulab/ssm/blob/master/notebooks/2c%20Input-driven%20linear%20model%20(LM-HMM).ipynb.

a, Decision variables (for example, consecutive failures) evolve after each lick outcome. Therefore, to predict these variables from movement PCs, we aligned the PCs to lick events using a 200 ms window. b, Decoding accuracy of various decision variables from movement PCs was estimated using a 200 ms sliding window (75% overlap) at different time lags relative to the lick event (example session shown). c, Peak decoding accuracy (grey dots) for each decision variable occurred between 100 ms and 350 ms after the lick. Error bars represent the median and m.a.d. across sessions (N = 10 sessions, 8 sessions from distinct animals, two from the same animal). d, This schematic describes the method used to partial out the linear relationship between latent variables. This approach allowed us to decompose DV1 (for example, consecutive failures) into the sum of two time series: one proportional to DV0 (for example, action outcomes) and another orthogonal (uncorrelated) to DV0, which we denote as unique DV1 (for example, unique consecutive failures). The unique consecutive failures residual (pink) is orthogonal to the action outcomes (black). Subsequently, the same procedure generated the unique negative value residual, orthogonal to both action outcomes and unique consecutive failures. The three resulting orthogonal time series (action outcomes, unique consecutive failures, and unique negative value) were then fit using movement PCs.

a, Changes in lick rate across 4 example bouts. b, Correlation (Pearson's coefficient) between lick rate and the two decision variables (median across 10 sessions with 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers represent minimum and maximum values). A small negative correlation exists between lick rate and the decision variables, suggesting that mice tend to lick slightly faster during reward consumption and slow down towards the end of a lick bout. c, Decoding accuracy (cross-validated R²) for action outcome, unique aspects of the two decision variables, and arbitrary signals in each region of interest (median across 10 sessions with 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers represent minimum and maximum values). The movement PCs are used as predictors in multivariate regression models to predict the action outcome and the decision variables with lick rate variance removed (partialed out). The variance in action outcome, consecutive failures and negative value that is not explained by lick rate remains highly decodable. This suggests that the relationship between facial expressions and latent variables is not solely explained by licking behavior. d, Decoding of bout number from facial movement PCs in an example session. The actual bout number is shown as a thick light orange line, and the decoded projection is shown as a thin dark orange line. e, Decoding accuracy (cross-validated R²) across all sessions (N = 10, orange dots). Boxplots show the median (center line), 25th and 75th percentiles (box edges), and minimum and maximum values (whiskers).

a, Mice (N = 5 for a total of 20 behavioral sessions) were presented with single tones (150 ms) of varying frequencies (low: 9.9, 12, and 13 kHz; high: 15, 16.3, and 20 kHz) and, after a delay period (500 ms after stimulus offset), reported their perceived frequency (high or low) by licking one of two water spouts (left or right) to receive a water reward if the response was correct. Simultaneously videos were recorded at 60 fps. b, Task schematics and time intervals analyzed. Video analysis focused on three periods, color-coded in the schematic: “pre-stimulus” (before tone onset; 1 s), “pre-response” (including stimulus presentation and part of the delay period; 500 ms), and “response” (around the time of the lick response; 200 ms). c, Representative frame from the co-registered video (generated by combining the 20 sessions), along with the first four eigenfaces. Error bars represent the median and m.a.d. across mice (N = 5). d, Average motion energy across task periods. Motion energy (relative to the video average) is shown for each analysis period. Low motion is observed during the pre-stimulus period (top), increasing during stimulus presentation (middle), and peaking during the response (bottom), reflecting movement associated with licking. e, Decoding accuracy of task variables from facial movement PCs. Decoding accuracy from facial movement PCs for previous trial outcome (rewarded/unrewarded) and trial number. Each dot represents the average decoding accuracy across sessions for a single mouse; error bars indicate the median and m.a.d. across mice. The task variables, especially the slow latent variable ‘Trial number', can be decoded with relatively high accuracy from facial movement PCs. f, Weighted masks (that is, facial representation of the decoded task variables in panel e) for the three different time intervals. The expression of the task variables on the face is highly consistent across the different time intervals, suggesting that this representation is independent of the animal's overall movement.

a, Eight facial landmarks (red) were manually identified on average frames from each video. An affine transformation determined by using these landmarks and MATLAB's fitgeotrans function, co-registered frames from each video to a reference frame (orange, bottom). This transformation facilitated comparisons and averaging of weighted masks (Fig. 2), video concatenation (Fig. 3), and definition of an average facial silhouette (Fig. 2). b, Improvement in pairwise 2D cross-correlation between average video frames before and after co-registration (N = 10 videos; error bars represent the median and m.a.d. across mice). c, Example traces of the first five principal components (PCs) derived from motion energy analysis of three co-registered videos. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was applied to the merged video data. d, t-SNE visualization of the first 100 PCs of the merged video.

Colors represent the normalized 2D cross-correlation at zero lag between the mean weighted masks of two mice (for each mouse the mean weighted mask was the average across sessions, N = 8 mice, 6 ± 2.7 sessions per mouse). d, Mean weighted mask similarity for each mouse and decision variable. Each gray dot represents the average pairwise correlation of the mean weighted mask of a mouse for a given decision variable with the mean weighted masks of all the other mice for the same decision variable. Each gray diamond represents the average pairwise correlation of the mean weighted mask of a mouse for a given decision variable with the mean weighted masks of the same mouse for all the other decision variables. Color errorbars represent median and m.a.d across mice (N = 10, 8 sessions from distinct animals, two from the same animal). e, Distribution of average pairwise 2D correlations at zero lag for electrophysiology (data in Figs. 2–4) and downsampled optogenetics (data in Fig. 5) datasets. Pairwise correlations of facial expression of decision variables were calculated for all sessions in the electrophysiology dataset (black dots; median and median absolute deviation (m.a.d.) indicated). For comparison, 10 sessions were randomly sampled from the optogenetics dataset multiple times, and average correlations were calculated for each sample (gray dots). The sampling procedure was repeated twenty times, each represented as a row of gray dots. Note that correlations are overall smaller than the ones estimated using averages across sessions (rather than single ones) as in (d). f, Within- and across-mice correlation of decision variable facial expression. Each point represents the average correlation of a single behavioral session with all other sessions, either from the same mouse (within) or different mice (across). Errorbars represent mean and s.d. across sessions per mouse (N = 8 mice, 6 ± 3 sessions per mouse).

a, We recorded with Neuropixels probes in multiple regions of the frontal cortex. Schematic target location of the neuropixels probe insertion. Vertical insertions were performed within a 1 mm diameter craniotomy centered around +2.5 mm anterior and +1.5 mm lateral from Bregma. b, An example of histology with the electrode track. We painted the probe with a red, fluorescent dye to recover the probe's location post-hoc. c, To decode the instantaneous value of multiple decision variables (pink & blue traces, right), we used regression models taking as predictors the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in each brain region (black traces, left, example activity from M2). The model predictions (the weighted sums of neural activity, black trace right) overlap with the decision variables. d, Neural vs. facial movement PC decoding latencies for different decision variables (N = 10 sessions). Each session contributes three points (gray, pink, blue), one per decision variable. Points above the identity line indicate later facial movement representation relative to neural representation. Black cross: median ± m.a.d. across all points. e, Predicting facial movements from neural activity in M2, OFC, and OC. GLMs were trained to predict facial movement PCs using a 50 ms non-overlapping sliding window of lagged neural activity from M2, OFC, and OC. Facial movement PCs were derived from concatenated videos to enable cross-session comparisons. f, Relationship between decoding accuracy and the time of peak decoding accuracy for facial movements. Peak times (median of cross-validated R² across sessions, N = 10) are shown for the 25 PCs of facial movement with the largest variance, as a function of decoding accuracy from neurons in M2, OFC, and OC. Each dot represents one facial movement PC. Negative values, particularly in M2 (M2 = −0.05 ± 0.06, p = 0.002; OFC = −0.05 ± 0.10, p = 0.194; OC = 0.05 ± 0.09, p = 0.0194; median ± m.a.d, N = 10 sessions, Wilcoxon signed rank test, Holm-Bonferroni corrected), indicate that neural activity preceding the facial movement is most predictive.

a, Laser-induced changes in facial movement patterns. 2D masks show the difference in average facial motion (calculated from movement PCs) between laser ON and OFF conditions, across mice and at different lick numbers (decision time points). b, Variability of laser-induced facial motion changes. The variance of the difference in motion energy between laser ON and OFF conditions (normalized by the variance in laser OFF) is shown as a function of lick number for inactivated (green, N = 5 mice) and control (black, N = 3 mice) groups. Thick lines represent group means. c, Decoding accuracy after removing the effect of lick rate (top & middle): Comparison of laser ON vs. laser OFF conditions. Dots below the unity line indicate that representations of decision variables derived from facial movement PCs were decoded less accurately during laser ON than laser OFF. Difference in decoding accuracy (bottom): Laser ON minus laser OFF (mean across sessions for each mouse in the inactivated and control groups). Individual mice are indicated by color. d, Same as in (c) but for decoding latency. Dots above the unity line indicate that representations of decision variables derived from facial movement PCs were decoded later during laser ON than laser OFF. Partial silencing of M2 reduced the accuracy and increased the latency with which facial movement PCs predicted decision variables, even after controlling for lick rate. This suggests that the latent variable represented in facial movements is not simply a consequence of the relationship between M2 activity and lick rate.

A detailed example of the dynamic relationship between facial movements and an evolving decision variable (that is, consecutive failures). It simultaneously displays raw video of a representative mouse (top left), calculated facial motion energy (top middle), and example weighted eigenfaces by their related movement PCs changing frame-by-frame (top right). Focusing on two example behavioral bouts, the video synchronizes these facial dynamics with the complete sequence of action outcomes (rewards/failures; green and black dots, respectively), the actual evolving decision variable (pink trace), and its prediction derived from facial movement PCs (gray trace). This video offers a visual illustration of the temporal relation between these elements.

Comparison of video processing stages for three example mice. Top row: raw videos display variations in the original field of view. Middle row: corresponding facial ROIs considered for analysis, aligned to a standard orientation. Bottom row: videos after co-registration. Note that co-registration primarily rescales facial dimensions to correct for differing initial viewing angles (for example, Mouse 1).

Understanding disease progression is of high biological and clinical interest. Unlike disease susceptibility, whose genetic basis has been abundantly studied, less is known about the genetics of disease progression and its overlap with disease susceptibility. Considering nine common diseases (ncases ranging from 11,980 to 124,682) across seven biobanks, we systematically compared genetic architectures of susceptibility and progression, defined as disease-specific mortality. We identified only one locus substantially associated with disease-specific mortality and showed that, at a similar sample size, more genome-wide significant loci can be identified in a genome-wide association study of disease susceptibility. Variants substantially affecting disease susceptibility were weakly or not associated with disease-specific mortality. Moreover, susceptibility polygenic scores (PGSs) were weak predictors of disease-specific mortality, while a PGS for general lifespan was substantially associated with disease-specific mortality for seven of nine diseases. We explored alternative definitions of disease progression and found that genetic signals for macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes overlap with similar phenotypes in the general population; however, these effects are attenuated. Overall, our findings indicate limited similarity in genetic effects between disease susceptibility and disease-specific mortality, suggesting that larger sample sizes, different measures of progression, or the integration of related phenotypes from the general population is needed to identify the genetic underpinnings of disease progression.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful in uncovering the genetic basis of human diseases by using a relatively straightforward study design that compares individuals with the disease to controls1,2,3. This approach is well-suited to identify loci associated with disease susceptibility, but it remains unclear whether these results can also inform on the biology of disease progression. Studying the genetic basis of disease progression is relevant for at least two reasons. First, biological insights from the study of disease progression can be more relevant for drug target discovery since many medicines are developed to cure a disease rather than prevent its occurrence. Second, most individuals approach the healthcare system once they develop a disease or its symptoms, and predicting disease progression is, in most diseases, an important clinical challenge.

In the past years, several GWASs of disease progression have been performed (see Supplementary Table 1 for a detailed review), but the number of progression-specific loci discovered has been limited.

In cancer, GWASs have primarily focused on disease survival and have generally been unsuccessful in identifying genome-wide significant signals. For example, a GWAS of breast cancer survival in over 96,000 patients did not identify any robust association4 and failed to replicate two loci found in the previous largest GWAS of breast cancer survival5. Among neurological conditions, GWASs have focused on disease survival as well as cognitive or motor decline. In one of the largest studies, researchers identified three new loci associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease6. A recent study on multiple sclerosis progression identified a locus indicating involvement of the central nervous system in disease outcome, as opposed to the enrichment of immunological-related signals observed for disease susceptibility7. However, it is worth noting that older studies of multiple sclerosis outcomes have failed to replicate in larger ones8,9. In cardiovascular diseases, studies have focused on disease recurrence, and initial results from the Genetics of Subsequent Coronary Heart Disease (GENIUS-CHD) consortium showed the strongest GWAS signal for coronary artery disease was not associated with subsequent events10. In Crohn's disease, a study identified four loci associated with disease progression, indicating a distinct genetic contribution to disease susceptibility11.

Apart from single-variant-level effects, some studies examined the aggregate effect of many genetic variants. Most of them suggested that polygenic scores (PGSs) for disease susceptibility do not transfer well to disease progression11,12,13, although they might outperform other disease-specific biomarkers in the case of cardiovascular diseases14.

Some authors have highlighted the challenges in interpreting results from genetic studies of disease progression due to the bias induced when individuals are selected based on their disease status. If common causes of susceptibility and progression are not accounted for, association results can be unreliable due to what is called an index event bias15, and several approaches to detect and correct for index event bias have been proposed16,17.

Large-scale biobanks linked with longitudinal electronic health records have accelerated research into the genetic basis of disease progression and provide sufficient sample size to answer the following two key questions: (1) do genetic predictors that influence disease susceptibility have a similar impact on disease progression? (2) Can we use PGSs for disease susceptibility to predict disease progression? In this study, we aim to provide empirical answers to these two questions by focusing on a specific but commonly used definition of disease progression: disease-specific mortality (Fig. 1). Through an international collaboration across multiple large-scale biobanks, we systematically compared genetic architecture of disease susceptibility and mortality for nine common diseases, focusing on both single variant and aggregated polygenic effects.

Using data from seven biobanks, we investigated the genetic similarity between disease susceptibility and disease progression, defined as disease-specific mortality. We selected nine diseases and ran GWASs of disease-specific mortality among disease individuals. We then compared the genetic architecture of disease susceptibility and mortality, focusing on both single variant and aggregated polygenic effects. We further explored the impact of alternative progression definitions and the theoretical impact of index event bias on the results.

We considered nine common diseases that substantially increase mortality risk in the general population and have a large public-health impact (Table 1). We confirmed disease association with mortality using nation-wide Finnish data and observed a hazard ratio (HR) for 20-year mortality ranging from 1.31 for type 2 diabetes to 3.61 for chronic kidney disease in females18 (Supplementary Table 2). We identified diseased individuals based on consistent disease definitions captured via electronic health records or registry data across eight longitudinal studies—FinnGen19, UK Biobank20, Estonian Biobank21, Generation Scotland22, Genomics England23, Genes & Health24, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute25 and BioMe. The number of individuals included ranged from 124,682 individuals with type 2 diabetes to 11,980 individuals with Alzheimer's disease (Table 1). All individuals with a disease were followed up for at least three months. We defined disease-specific mortality based on death certificates in which the disease of interest was listed as the primary or secondary cause of death. One participating biobank did not have information on causes of death, and we used overall death instead (Supplementary Table 2). We observed the highest cause-specific mortality rate for Alzheimer's disease (40%) in FinnGen and the lowest for type 2 diabetes (3%) in the Estonian Biobank.

For each disease, we carried out a GWAS of disease-specific mortality among disease individuals using Cox proportional hazard model as implemented in GATE26 or SPACox27 (Supplementary Figs. 1–9). On top of all common GWAS covariates, all analyses were also adjusted for age at disease diagnosis for the following two reasons: (1) age is a strong predictor of mortality; (2) age of onset has a nontrivial genetic contribution partially overlapping with disease susceptibility28, and we are instead interested in genetic effects on disease-specific mortality.

Of all nine diseases studied, we identified only one locus associated with disease-specific mortality at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8). The locus (rs7360523) on chromosome 20, close to SULF2, was associated with disease-specific mortality among patients with heart failure.

We asked whether well-established signals for disease susceptibility were associated with disease-specific mortality (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). For each disease, we compared the effect sizes from the largest published GWAS with the results from our GWAS of disease-specific mortality. In total, 804 lead variants were reported from all susceptibility GWASs. None of them were substantially associated with disease-specific mortality after multiple testing correction (P < 0.05/804 = 6.22 × 10−5), while 392 showed the same effect direction, which is no more than expected by chance (probability of observing same direction of effect direction = 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45–0.52); binomial test against 0.5, P = 0.5028).

Variants were selected either because of genome-wide significance for susceptibility in the largest disease-specific GWAS or because of genome-wide significance for disease-specific mortality in the current study, indicated by color of the dot (red, significant in susceptibility GWAS; blue, significant in mortality GWAS). Data are presented as 95% CI for GWAS effect sizes (β ± 1.96 s.e. from corresponding GWAS). See also Supplementary Table 3 for quantitative results and sources of susceptibility GWAS summary statistics. Only one locus for heart failure mortality was genome-wide significant across nine mortality GWASs.

The only disease-specific mortality locus identified for heart failure also did not show comparable effect on heart failure susceptibility (P = 0.87 in susceptibility GWAS with opposite direction of effect). The low number of genome-wide signals for disease-specific mortality was consistent with the lower estimated heritability compared to the GWAS of disease susceptibility (Supplementary Table 2).

To assess whether the overall lack of substantial genetic signals for disease-specific mortality was simply due to smaller sample sizes compared to the GWASs of disease susceptibility, we performed a down-sampling experiment in FinnGen and UK Biobank by imposing the same effective sample size for both analyses. To further make the two analyses comparable, the GWASs of disease susceptibility were conducted using survival analysis with age as time scale and disease diagnosis as outcome. The GWASs of disease susceptibility returned 33 genome-wide significant loci across five of the nine tested diseases, while the GWASs of disease-specific mortality returned no genome-wide significant results (Table 2).

We investigated the joint effects of genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility in predicting disease-specific mortality. For each disease, we constructed a PGS using results from the largest GWAS of disease susceptibility. All the PGSs were strongly associated with disease susceptibility. The HRs for 1 s.d. in the PGS ranged from 1.17 (1.15–1.18) for stroke to 1.90 (1.88–1.93) for prostate cancer (dashed line in Fig. 3). On the contrary, the same PGSs were weakly or not associated with disease-specific mortality (orange dots in Fig. 3). For example, although strongly associated with disease susceptibility, a PGS for breast cancer showed no association with breast cancer mortality (HR = 0.98 (0.93–1.02)). The most substantial association was observed between the heart failure PGS and heart failure mortality (HR = 1.09 (1.07–1.12)), while the PGSs for chronic kidney disease and prostate cancer trend towards having a protective effect on mortality (HR = 0.96 (0.91–1.02) and HR = 0.96 (0.93–1.00), respectively).

Disease susceptibility PGSs were derived from published large-scale GWAS for each disease. PGS associations with both disease susceptibility and disease-specific mortality were examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. The sample size reported on the y axis refers to the disease-specific mortality analyses, and the sample size for association with disease susceptibility can be found in Supplementary Table 4. Horizontal solid lines represent 95% CI for PGS association with disease-specific mortality HR (exp(β ± 1.96 s.e.)). The vertical dashed lines in black and gray represent association with disease susceptibility HR and 95% CI, respectively, (exp(β ± 1.96 s.e.)).

To assess the robustness of these results, we conducted a range of sensitivity analyses. First, we assessed whether using a less specific definition of disease progression, namely all-cause mortality, would impact the observed results. We observed significantly larger correlation coefficients of susceptibility PGSs on disease-specific mortality than on all-cause mortality in five of nine diseases (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 7). Second, we only considered individuals who developed the disease after study enrollment (Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 8) as a way to account for survival bias, which might explain some of the negative associations between PGSs and cause-specific mortality. Nonetheless, results were consistent (correlation coefficient r between effect sizes β in the main analysis and sensitivity analysis = 0.96), and we continued to observe a negative association between a PGS for prostate cancer and prostate cancer mortality. Third, we considered different maximum follow-up lengths (2, 5 and 10 years) because we reasoned that deaths occurring shortly after disease diagnosis were more likely to be caused by the disease. However, results were overall comparable across follow-up lengths (correlation coefficient r between effect sizes in main analysis and sensitivity analysis = 0.67, 0.78 and 0.92 for 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 8), and contrary to our expectation, some diseases (for example, heart failure) showed a stronger association between the susceptibility PGS and disease-specific mortality when considering longer rather than shorter follow-up lengths (effect size—β = −7.99 × 10−4, 0.03 and 0.05 for 2, 5 and 10 years, respectively). Fourth, we evaluated whether adjusting the analyses for age at diagnosis could mask an age-specific effect of PGS on cause-specific mortality, for example, because such effect was only observed among young or old patients. We observed the largest change in z score for PGS effect on disease-specific mortality between lower and upper 50% quantile diagnosed age groups only for Alzheimer's disease (Δz = 3.51; Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 9). That is, the association between Alzheimer's disease PGS and mortality was substantial only among younger but not older patients. Finally, we tested the effect of using only unrelated individuals in FinnGen and found the result to be robust (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 7). We also carried out the same analyses using non-European individuals from Genes & Health. However, due to limited power, no conclusion could be drawn (Supplementary Fig. 15). Forest plots of effects from each participating European biobank are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14.

Having established that susceptibility PGSs are weakly associated with disease-specific mortality, we reasoned that other PGSs that are better proxies of disease-specific mortality could show stronger associations. First, we considered PGSs constructed directly from our GWASs of disease-specific mortality. For diseases where power allowed, we derived PGSs using weights from the meta-analyzed GWAS results from all biobanks except for FinnGen and tested the association between PGS and disease-specific mortality within FinnGen. Surprisingly, of all four diseases, only colorectal has its PGS nominally associated with disease-specific mortality, with a rather marginal effect (β = 0.0523, P = 3.58 × 10−2; Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Table 10).

Second, we considered a PGS for general longevity derived from the largest lifespan GWAS29 under the assumption that it might capture some of the genetic effects related to disease survival. The longevity PGS was substantially associated with disease-specific mortality for seven of nine diseases (P < 0.005, accounting for the number of diseases tested), and for seven diseases, it shows larger HR than a PGS for susceptibility (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5), including the three diseases where we observed protective effects of susceptibility PGSs.

Disease susceptibility PGSs were derived from published large-scale GWAS for each disease. Longevity PGS was derived from ref. 29. Horizontal solid lines represent 95% CI for PGS association with disease-specific mortality HR (exp(β ± 1.96 s.e.)). For quantitative results, see Supplementary Table 5.

We also tested another composite mortality PGS developed from the genetics of multiple risk factors30 in FinnGen. The composite mortality PGS was substantially associated with disease-specific mortality for four of nine diseases, and outperformed longevity PGS in predicting type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease mortality (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Table 12).

Disease-specific mortality is widely accessible across biobanks but can be an inaccurate proxy of progression for some diseases. For type 2 diabetes, macrovascular complications (defined as coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) and microvascular complications (defined as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) are more clinically relevant measures of disease progression that are captured in electronic health records. We ran time-to-event progression GWAS among type 2 diabetes patients for both macro (ncases = 17,332 of 85,188 eligible type 2 diabetes patients) and microvascular (ncases = 5,798 of 103,185 eligible type 2 diabetes patients) complications in FinnGen and UK Biobank, and meta-analyzed the results. We identified one genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 9 for macrovascular complications, but none for microvascular complications (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 18). The locus was not associated with type 2 diabetes susceptibility (P = 0.2898 from UK Biobank and FinnGen meta-analysis), but it was associated with type 2 diabetes mortality (P = 5.6 × 10−4), highlighting how disease-specific mortality can capture, albeit imprecisely, disease progression. We wondered whether this genetic signal was shared with cardiovascular conditions in individuals without type 2 diabetes and performed a GWAS for age of onset for coronary artery disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease in the UK Biobank and FinnGen. For this experiment, we performed random down-sampling to match the available sample sizes for the progression GWAS. We observed a strong overlap in the signals from the GWAS of diabetic macrovascular complications and the GWAS of cardiovascular conditions in individuals without type 2 diabetes (Fig. 5). In other words, the locus detected for type 2 diabetes macrovascular complications was also detected by a GWAS of similar phenotypes in individuals without type 2 diabetes. However, the effect was overall reduced among individuals with type 2 diabetes (leading SNP—β = 0.09, P = 3.62 × 10−16 versus β = 0.11, P = 1.36 × 10−23).

The top Manhattan plot displays the results of a GWAS carried out in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The bottom Manhattan plots display the results of GWAS carried out in individuals without type 2 diabetes, where proxy phenotypes for cardiovascular conditions were used instead. Two GWASs were matched to the same number of cases and controls to ensure similar power (ncases = 17,332 of 85,188 eligible type 2 diabetes patients/type 2 diabetes-free individuals).

As we have previously shown that a longevity PGS created in the general population was predictive of disease-specific mortality, we wondered whether a similar observation would hold for these refined definitions of type 2 diabetes progression. To test this, we considered PGSs for coronary artery disease31 and stroke32 as predictors of type 2 diabetes macrovascular complication, and PGSs for age-related macular degeneration33 and chronic kidney disease34 as predictors of type 2 diabetes macrovascular complication.

A PGS for coronary artery disease was a stronger predictor of macrovascular complications among type 2 diabetes patients than the PGS of type 2 diabetes susceptibility (HR = 1.19 (1.17–1.21) versus HR = 1.04 (1.03–1.06)). For microvascular complications, we did observe a nominally significant association for the PGS of age-related macular degeneration (HR = 1.03 (1.01–1.06)), but not chronic kidney disease (HR = 1.00 (0.98–1.03); Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 6).

Noticing an attenuation of variant effects in progression GWASs with the same sample sizes, we suspected that index event bias could have a role. Therefore, we carried out simulation under a simple liability threshold model and explored the impact of index event bias by introducing a shared nongenetic risk factor accounting for various proportions of the liability in disease susceptibility and progression. We compared the simulated effect of causal genetic variants on progression with the observed effect from the progression GWASs and found larger differences when the shared nongenetic component accounted for higher liability variance, indicating higher impact of index event bias (Supplementary Fig. 20). A correction approach similar to slope-hunter16 reduced the bias, improving the concordance with the true simulated effects. However, in the scenario of a low progression heritability, which is consistent with our empirical findings for disease mortality, index event bias correction showed limited impact as we observed no genetic variants substantially associated with disease progression before or after bias correction (Supplementary Table 11).

In this study, we systematically explored the overlap of genetic effects on disease susceptibility and a common measure of disease progression, disease-specific mortality, for nine common diseases. By conducting the largest within-patient GWAS of disease-specific mortality to date, we found that (1) lead variants affecting disease susceptibility do not have comparable effect sizes on disease mortality; rather, they show little effect and no significant association with disease-specific mortality in GWAS; (2) at a similar sample size, GWASs of disease-specific mortality identified fewer genome-wide significant loci than GWASs of disease susceptibility, suggesting that GWASs of disease progression might require larger sample size or more refined phenotypes than GWAS of disease susceptibility; (3) disease susceptibility PGSs do not transfer well on disease-specific mortality, suggesting that current PGSs are more suitable for identify individuals at high risk of developing a disease rather than those more likely to suffer from the worst consequences and (4) if available, traits measured in a general population, but related to disease progression, can inform the genetic underpinning of disease progression, and PGSs derived from these related traits can predict progression better than PGSs for disease susceptibility.

The limited overlap between genetic effects on disease susceptibility and disease progression may have several explanations.

First, genetic influences on disease progression might be too small to detect. External environmental effects such as treatment choice, treatment response, quality and access to care might have a disproportionate impact on disease progression as compared to disease susceptibility, thus limiting the genetic influence. Heterogeneity in patients and their treatments has a substantial role in disease progression, and we are currently unable to account for all this heterogeneity. Using data from clinical trials rather than observational studies and including finer measurements, such as disease-relevant biomarkers, could obviate these shortcomings. We also noticed that adjusting for age at disease diagnosis reduces the overlap between susceptibility and progression because variants that increase disease susceptibility are often associated with earlier disease diagnosis28. Previous studies have demonstrated impact of adjusting for age in disease progression analyses35 and suggested that association between PGSs and measurement of disease progression may be mediated by age.

Second, our definition of disease progression may be a poor proxy for the biological mechanisms that impact disease progression. Our approach aims to compare progression across multiple diseases, but this comes at the expense of a tailored definition of progression for each disease. Nonetheless, disease-specific mortality has been widely used as a measure of progression6,36,37,38. Association between composite genetic score of various risk factors, including several diseases considered in our study, and all-cause mortality has also been reported30. We tested this score in FinnGen and observed better prediction performance for some diseases of interest. In practice, biobank-based studies of disease progression often require simplification of definitions to maximize sample size, and disease-specific mortality information is typically available across biobanks. However, a definition that maximizes data availability might not be one that best reflects the genetic etiology of a specific disease.

Third, as a common concern for all studies on disease progression, we examined the impact of index event bias resulting from conditioning on individuals with the disease. While this is not the main focus of this study, we found that index event bias alone does not fully explain the lack of concordance between genetic effects on susceptibility and progression observed in our study. Our empirical observations, in comparison to various simulations, indicate a relatively low heritability for disease progression, as defined by disease-specific mortality. Furthermore, heterogeneous phenotypes, such as mortality, although disease-specific, can be highly polygenic. In this case, even a perfect correction for index event bias will only be able to recover effect sizes that are not likely to be detected from a progression GWAS. The fact that only one genome-wide significant locus was detected from our progression GWASs, indicating low signal-to-noise ratio in the progression GWASs, might be a bigger concern than index event bias. Furthermore, most methods to correct for index event bias rely on fitting the relationships between variant effects on susceptibility and progression. In our case, this relationship is close to zero; thus, the correction will be small and insignificant.

Lastly, even with all three aspects taken into account, there is still the possibility that we do not observe comparable genetic effects on disease susceptibility and progression simply because their underlying biological mechanisms are truly distinct.

Given the aforementioned challenges in conducting GWAS of disease progression, one practical alternative would be to study genetic signals for disease progression in a general population and subsequently adapt them for within-patient prognostic prediction. For example, PGSs for autoimmune conditions derived from the general population are correlated with immune-related adverse events among cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors39,40,41,42, and a PGS for ulcerative colitis was associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor-mediated colitis42. In our analysis, a longevity PGS derived from a GWAS of lifespan was substantially associated with survival for seven of nine diseases, suggesting that survival may be more affected by general factors related to mortality than by disease-specific factors. Similarly, the substantial findings for macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes were recapitulated in the general population when looking at similar phenotypes, even among individuals without type 2 diabetes. In fact, the signal was stronger among individuals without type 2 diabetes, possibly reflecting index event bias. Notably, PGSs for cardiovascular conditions in the general population were better predictors of type 2 diabetes macrovascular complications than a PGS for type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Methods for cross-trait PGS43 might be leveraged to obtain progression PGS based on existing GWAS results in the general population. This relationship, however, is not always obvious. For diabetic microvascular complications, it is not as straightforward to find any population equivalent measurement, although it was interesting to observe a nominally substantial but weak effect of a PGS for age-related macular degeneration. On the other hand, this could indicate that such a progression definition is more unique to the diseased cohort and has the potential to yield truly progression-specific genetic signals, if sufficient power is available.

This study has multiple limitations. First, while we explored the similarity in genetic effects between disease susceptibility and disease-specific mortality, we cannot decisively conclude that the biological underpinnings of susceptibility and progression are distinct. For example, a phenotype that serves as poor proxy for disease progression will result in attenuated effect sizes, despite genetic variants being causally associated with both susceptibility and progression. Nonetheless, the poor replication rate and opposite direction of effect observed for susceptibility signals on disease-specific mortality are consistent with a scenario where at least some variants have no shared effect on both susceptibility and progression. Second, our findings do not necessarily extend outside the diseases explored in this study, and further work is needed to confirm the observed trends across more disease categories. Third, whether death certificates accurately capture primary or contributing causes of death depends on the biobank and healthcare system. We tried to address these concerns by restricting the follow-up duration in sensitivity analyses, reasoning that deaths occurring shortly after disease diagnosis were more likely to be caused by the disease.

In conclusion, our current results suggest that there is a limited overlap in genetic effects on disease susceptibility and progression, as defined by patients' mortality. Further refinement in inclusion criteria among the patient population and in the definitions of disease progression can be considered in future studies to robustly identify the genetic underpinnings of disease progression.

We selected nine common complex diseases spanning various disease categories for the analyses. The diseases are selected to meet following criteria: (1) have high epidemiological HR on mortality, so that mortality can be viewed as a reasonable prognosis; (2) constitute high global disease burden in terms of disability adjusted life years44; (3) be relatively common ( > 1% prevalence) in population and have reasonable patient bodies in all biobanks and (4) be heritable and have large-scale GWAS available to construct PGSs. All disease endpoints were defined as a composition of ICD-10 codes curated by the clinical expert groups from FinnGen, Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland and Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare19. The same disease definitions, in terms of ICD-10 codes, were adopted by all participating biobanks to the maximum possible extent. See Supplementary Table 2 for a list of diseases and relevant descriptive statistics.

For all selected diseases, we defined mortality as our outcome. Precisely, we were interested in both all-cause mortalities, namely simple death status of the patient regardless of relevance to the disease, and disease-specific mortalities, meaning the death caused directly or indirectly by disease of interest specifically. Disease progression was evaluated as patients' survival from each type of mortality after being diagnosed with the disease. For all mortality GWASs, we consider only disease-specific mortality whenever possible for each participating biobank, whereas for the PGS analysis, both all-cause and disease-specific mortalities were evaluated. Similar to the disease endpoints, cause of death linked to each disease was also curated by clinical expert groups and defined in terms of ICD-10 codes45. The same definitions were systematically applied to all biobanks to the possible extent. See Supplementary Table 2 for definitions of cause-specific mortality for each disease of interest and available sample sizes from each biobank.

To achieve variant-level effect comparison, a within-patient mortality GWAS was carried out for each selected disease using GATE26 for all biobanks, except Generation Scotland, which used SPACox27 as an alternative. The event of interest in this GWAS was patients' survival after disease diagnosis. For each disease of interest, GWAS was carried out separately within each ancestry group for biobanks that have a cause-specific mortality event count of 50 at minimum after quality control. Eligible individuals were restricted to patients having a follow-up time after diagnosis of three months (0.25 years) at minimum. We used the model below to examine SNP association with patients' survival:

surv(duration of follow-up after diagnosis | disease-specific mortality) ~ SNP + patient's age of diagnosis + patient's birth year + sex + PCs + study-specific covariates,

where study-specific covariates included other available nonheritable biobank-specific covariates, such as genotyping chip or batch.

For analyses in the UK Biobank, to minimize potential impact of survivor bias, only patients with disease diagnosed after enrollment were considered.

After conducting mortality GWAS for selected diseases within each contributing biobank, we then filtered the resulting summary statistics by imputation INFO scores and minor allele counts. We retained only variants with an imputation INFO score >0.7 and at least 20 minor allele counts for each summary statistic. For GWAS summary statistics with a different human genome build, we used the UCSC LiftOver tool46 to convert their genome coordinates into the hg38 assembly. Subsequently, for each disease, we meta-analyzed GWAS results from each biobank using fixed-effect meta-analysis implemented in METAL47, with which we also scanned for heterogeneity in effect sizes across different biobanks using Cochran's Q test. We applied an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis scheme whenever possible. However, since SPACox does not have effect size or s.e. output, in Generation Scotland, we estimated direction of effect under a logistic regression model using PLINK48 and subsequently proceeded with a sample-size weighted meta-analysis using the Z-scores. This was done for four of the nine diseases for which Generation Scotland was one of the data sources: atrial fibrillation, breast cancer, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes.

We compared our mortality GWAS results for each disease of interest with large-scale published GWAS on diagnosis of the same disease. For disease diagnosis GWAS, we extracted SNP effects of reported genome-wide significant leading SNPs at independently associated loci from each study. For chronic kidney disease, a large GWAS on estimated glomerular filtration rate was considered34. Specifically, we examined the effect sizes of independent lead SNPs on the binary diagnosis of chronic kidney disease reported in the study, ensuring a more comparable scale of measurement. For our meta-analyzed mortality GWAS, we identify independent genome-wide loci using summary statistics based on conditional analysis implemented in GCTA-COJO. We merged 5,000 Finnish genomes, which is one of the largest GWAS cohorts in this study, with EUR from Human Genome Diversity Project as linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference for this step. To carry out the effect size comparison for all diseases, we reran the meta-analysis of mortality GWAS, excluding results from Generation Scotland due to the use of an incomparable GWAS approach for the cohort.

We compared genetic architectures between disease diagnosis and mortality in terms of SNP heritability estimated from the meta-analyzed mortality GWAS summary statistics using LD score regression49. For eligible traits, that is, traits with nonzero estimated SNP heritability, we further analyzed genetic correlation across disease diagnosis, mortality, and general longevity GWAS using the same tool.

To ensure heritability comparison between disease susceptibility and progression endpoints not being subject to power issues resulting from difference in sample sizes and GWAS models, for each disease of interest, we also ran time-to-event GWAS to find SNP association with age of diagnosis using a randomly down-sampled cohort which had comparable number of total individuals and event counts as what was available for the within-patient mortality GWAS. The down-sampled GWAS was carried out under the model below:

surv(follow-up from birth until diagnosis | disease diagnosis) ~ SNP + patient's birth year + sex + PCs + study-specific covariates.

This analysis was also carried out using GATE26 but in FinnGen and UK Biobank only, which are two of the largest participating biobanks in this study (see Supplementary Table 2 for sample sizes).

For each selected disease, we derived variant weights for PGSs from GWAS summary statistics listed in Supplementary Table 2 using MegaPRS50. Heritability contributed by each variant was estimated under the BLD-LDAK model as recommended. For weight estimation, we used the ‘mega' option, which allows the software to determine the most appropriate model based on the data. Since we studied mortality, apart from the nine selected diseases, we also computed PGS weights for general longevity using the largest GWAS on lifespan29. Due to the heterogeneous and polygenic nature of lifespan, we used the LDAK-Thin model for SNP-level heritability estimation for this trait instead. Unlike the BLD-LDAK model used in variant weighting for other diseases, LDAK-Thin model does not take functional annotations into account but estimates SNP heritability only as function of SNP allele frequencies and local linkage structures. Variant weights were derived for 1,330,820 common SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.1) lying in the intersection of HapMap3 (ref. 51) and 1000 Genomes52 that are available for each GWAS summary statistic.

Once the SNP weights were derived, individual-level PGSs for each disease and general longevity were subsequently computed as a weighted sum of effect allele counts using PLINK48. Scores were standardized to have 0 mean and 1 as variance within each ancestry group.

For the composite mortality PGS, we used sex-stratified SNP weights developed by ref. 30. Scores for males and females were computed separately and subsequently combined during the association step to obtain a population effect estimate.

As a baseline, we first examined whether the disease PGSs were associated with their diagnoses. For each selected disease, the association was first tested using a general linear model on case–control status as below:

logit(Pr(Individual is diagnosed)) ~ disease PGS + birth year + sex + PC1-10.

To achieve a fairer comparison with the other experiments, we also evaluated such relationship using a survival model on the age of diagnosis as below:

surv(follow-up from birth until diagnosis | disease diagnosis) ~ disease PGS + birth year + sex + PC1-10.

The two analyses above were conducted using all eligible individuals from the biobanks. Then, for each selected disease, we extracted only the patient group for further analysis. To reduce noise in measurements, we limited these within-patient analyses to individuals having a follow-up time of at least three months (0.25 years) after the diagnosis. We tested the association of disease PGSs with our defined prognosis, namely patient survival, using the model below:

surv(duration of follow-up after diagnosis | mortality) ~ disease PGS + birth year + sex + PC1-10 + age of diagnosis,

as well as the association of general longevity PGS with patient survival as below:

surv(duration of follow-up after diagnosis | mortality) ~ general longevity PGS + birth year + sex + PC1-10 + age of diagnosis.

For both associations, we examined both all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality within the patient group. All analyses were corrected for sex, except in analyses for breast cancer and prostate cancer, where only female/male individuals were used.

These analyses were carried out independently for each ancestry group within each participating biobank. We only included biobanks where the count of events of interest in the analyzed ancestry group was 50 or more. We subsequently meta-analyzed effect sizes for the same ancestry group across biobanks using the inverse-variance weighted approach.

For diseases with sufficient power, we derived mortality PGS weights using meta-analyzed mortality GWAS results of European populations from all available biobanks, except for FinnGen or Generation Scotland. Apart from FinnGen, which was used as a test cohort, we also left out results from Generation Scotland for this analysis because their summary statistics did not have effect size or s.e. and therefore cannot be used for inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, which returns necessary statistics for weight derivation. After deriving PGS weights using MegaPRS50, we subsequently computed individual-level disease-mortality PGS for patients of each corresponding disease within FinnGen cohort. The weights and scores are computed in the same manner as mentioned in the ‘Computation of individual-level PGS'. We evaluated the effects of these scores on predicting patients' disease mortality in FinnGen using the model below:

surv(duration of follow-up after diagnosis | mortality) ~ disease-mortality PGS + birth year + sex + PC1-10 + age of diagnosis

We ran a series of sensitivity analyses in eligible biobanks to ensure our observations on the PGSs association were robust, under considerations listed below. Similarly, analyses were conducted for each eligible ancestry within each biobank and then meta-analyzed.

First, to demonstrate the impact of relevance between disease progression and susceptibility as shown in our theories, we examined the association between susceptibility PGS and all-cause mortality and compared the results with disease-specific mortality in FinnGen (see Supplementary Fig. 10 for these results). We then considered other factors that may bias the results.

Depending on each biobank's recruitment scheme, some patients were diagnosed before the start of their follow-up, which may lead to biased results due to the survivor effect. Therefore, we also ran these analyses for each disease using only samples from individuals enrolled before their first onset of the disease of interest (see Supplementary Fig. 11a for these results).

In this study, we aimed to define disease progression as accurately as possible by focusing our analysis on disease-caused mortality. However, some national death registries may not precisely capture the immediate cause of death, and some mortalities, while documented with the disease as one of the causes, may not be truly relevant to the diagnosed disease. To address this concern, we ran the same analysis using only patients with a restricted maximum follow-up length, since death taking place reasonably soon after being diagnosed might have more to do with the diagnosis, compared to death taking place decades after. Under this consideration, we varied the maximum duration of follow-up after diagnosis by 2, 5 or 10 years. The minimum is still 0.25 years for this analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 11b and Supplementary Table 8 for these results; see also Supplementary Table 2 for sample size breakdown by duration of follow-up in each biobank). To facilitate comparability between results, we reported the regression coefficients for PGS effect sizes on nine diseases for each sensitivity analysis and the main results.

As shown above, we included the age of diagnosis as one of the covariates in all within-patient main analysis models to specifically investigate PGSs' unique genetic effect on disease progression by correcting for the diagnosis. As part of our sensitivity analysis, we also examined the role of these diagnosed ages in more detail. We repeated all the within-patient analyses for each disease by stratifying patients into early onset and late onset groups using 50% age of diagnosis quantile as a cutoff and compared the PGS effects across the two groups (see Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 9 for these results).

We included all eligible individuals of each biobank in our main analysis, and one may argue that this could impact our effect size estimates. Therefore, we ran the same analysis in FinnGen with up to second-degree relatives removed (see Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 7 for these results).

Since only patients were considered for most of our analyses, although some of the biobanks (for example, UK Biobank and BioMe) were known to be rather diverse, we ended up with enough power for the main results only for the European super-population. Nevertheless, comparison of results with other less powered but available populations can be found in Supplementary Fig. 15 for reference.

Forest plot for effects from each biobank is presented in Supplementary Fig. 14.

For type 2 diabetes, we explored the genetics of two additional widely considered progressions—macrovascular and microvascular complications. For macrovascular complications, we only consider patients who did not have any coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral arterial disease incidents before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Among those, we define the ones having at least one of the aforementioned diagnoses after type 2 diabetes as cases for macrovascular complications. Event time is defined as the duration from a patient's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes to the earliest diagnosis of a macrovascular complication. Similarly, for microvascular complications, we consider onset of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy after the patients' diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. For both definitions of progression, our analysis only included individuals with >0.25 year of follow-up, meaning the patients' death/onset of progression/biobank censoring take place >0.25 year after their diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

For macrovascular complications, for which we identified genome-wide significant signals among diabetic patients, we further carried out a down-sampled time-to-event GWAS on population-comparable phenotypes, matching the case–control count in the progression GWAS. For this down-sampled GWAS, we considered onset of coronary artery disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease in nondiabetic population.

Shortly before his death in August 2025, A. James Hudspeth and his team in the Laboratory of Sensory Neuroscience at The Rockefeller University achieved a groundbreaking technological advancement: the ability to keep a tiny sliver of the cochlea alive and functional outside of the body for the first time. Their new device allowed them to capture the live biomechanics of the cochlea's remarkable auditory powers, including exceptional sensitivity, sharp frequency tuning, and the ability to encode a broad range of sound intensities.

"We can now observe the first steps of the hearing process in a controlled way that was previously impossible," says co-first author Francesco Gianoli, a postdoctoral fellow in the Hudspeth lab.

Described in two recent papers (in PNAS and Hearing Research, respectively), the innovation is a product of Hudspeth's five decades of work illuminating the molecular and neural mechanisms of hearing -- insights that have illuminated new paths to preventing or reversing hearing loss.

With this advance, the researchers have also provided direct evidence of a unifying biophysical principle that governs hearing across the animal kingdom, a subject Hudspeth investigated for more than a quarter-century.

"This study is a masterpiece," says biophysicist Marcelo Magnasco, head of the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience at Rockefeller, who collaborated with Hudspeth on some of his seminal findings. "In the field of biophysics, it's one of the most impressive experiments of the last five years."

The mechanics of hearing

Though the cochlea is a marvel of evolutionary engineering, some of its fundamental mechanisms have long remained hidden. The organ's fragility and inaccessibility -- embedded as it is in the densest bone in the body -- have made it difficult to study in action.

These challenges have long frustrated hearing researchers, because most hearing loss results from damage to sensory receptors called hair cells that line the cochlea. The organ has some 16,000 of these hair cells, so-called because each one is topped by a few hundred fine "feelers," or stereocilia, that early microscopists likened to hair. Each bundle is a tuned machine that amplifies and converts sound vibrations into electrical responses that the brain can then interpret.

It's well documented that in insects and non-vertebrate animals -- such as the bullfrogs studied in Hudspeth's lab -- a biophysical phenomenon known as a Hopf bifurcation is key to the hearing process. The Hopf bifurcation describes a kind of mechanical instability, a tipping point between complete stillness and oscillations. At this knife-edge, even the faintest sound tips the system into movement, allowing it to amplify weak signals far beyond what would otherwise register.

In the case of bullfrog cochlea, the instability is in the bundles of the sensory hair cells, which are always primed to detect incoming sound waves. When those waves hit, the hair cells move, amplifying the sound in what's called the active process.

In collaboration with Magnasco, Hudspeth documented the existence of the Hopf bifurcation in the bullfrog cochlea in 1998. Whether it exists in the mammalian cochlea has been a subject of debate in the field ever since.

To answer that question, Hudspeth's team decided they needed to observe the active process in a mammalian cochlea in real time and at a greater level of detail than ever before.

A sliver of a spiral

To do so, the researchers turned to the cochlea of gerbils, whose hearing falls in a similar range as humans. They excised slivers no larger than .5 mm from the sensory organ, in the region of the cochlea that picks up the middle range of frequencies. They timed their excision to a developmental moment in which the gerbil's hearing is mature but the cochlea hasn't fully fused to the highly dense temporal bone.

They placed a sliver of tissue within a chamber designed to reproduce the living environment of the sensory tissue, including continuously bathing it in nutrient-rich liquids called endolymph and perilymph and maintaining its native temperature and voltage. Key to the development of this custom device were Brian Fabella, a research specialist in the Hudspeth lab, and instrumentation engineer Nicholas Belenko, from Rockefeller's Gruss Lipper Precision Instrumentation Technologies Resource Center.

They then began to play sounds via a tiny speaker and observed the response.

Discovering a biophysical principle

Among the processes they witnessed were how the opening and closing of ion channels in the hair bundles add energy to the sound-driven vibrations, amplifying them, and how outer hair cells elongate and contract in response to voltage changes through a process called electromotility.

"We could see in fine detail what every piece of the tissue is doing at the subcellular level," Gianoli says.

"This experiment required an extraordinarily high level of precision and delicacy," notes Magnasco. "There's both mechanical fragility and electrochemical vulnerability at stake."

Importantly, they observed that key to the active process was indeed a Hopf bifurcation -- the tipping point that turned mechanical instability into sound amplification. "This shows that the mechanics of hearing in mammals is remarkably similar to what has been seen across the biosphere," says co-first author Rodrigo Alonso, a research associate in the lab.

A device that could lead to future treatments

The scientists anticipate that experimentation using the ex vivo cochlea will improve their understanding of hearing and hopefully point to better therapies.

"For example, we will now be able to pharmacologically perturb the system in a very targeted way that has never been possible before, such as by focusing on specific cells or cell interactions," says Alonso.

There's a great need in the field for new potential therapies. "So far, no drug has been approved to restore hearing in sensorineural loss, and one reason for that is that we still have an incomplete mechanistic understanding of the active process of hearing," Gianoli says. "But now we have a tool that we can use to understand how the system works, and how and when it breaks -- and hopefully think of ways to intervene before it's too late."

Hudspeth found the results deeply gratifying, Magnasco adds. "Jim had been working on this for more than 20 years, and it's a crowning achievement for a remarkable career."

NASA's First-Ever Alien-Hunting Space Telescope Could Enlighten Our New Dark Age

The Habitable Worlds Observatory is poised to tell us whether Earth-like planets are common—if it can get off the ground

By Nadia Drake & Lee Billings 

An animated rendering of several engineering architecture concepts for NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory, a next-generation flagship-class space telescope designed to find and study Earth-like planets around nearby sunlike stars.

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center/Conceptual Image Labs

It's a sweltering Tuesday in Washington, D.C., the kind of day that stretches the definition of Earth as a “habitable” planet. But on an eighth-floor terrace near the U.S. Capitol building, dozens of people are outside anyway, talking and watching as passersby dart between pools of shade on the sticky streets below. Besides the heat, the onlookers are sweating something else, too—an audacious project to learn, at last, whether we have any neighbors living on Earth-like planets in our neck of the Milky Way.

Back inside, a boisterous reception is underway. Hundreds of scientists and engineers, NASA leaders, lobbyists, congressional staffers and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona are also discussing the search for ET.

Surveilling alien worlds for signs of life is a lot more than a twinkle in this community's eye. It's the reason why everyone is here for a four-day science conference in late July, at the height of D.C.'s arguably habitable oppressive summer heat. They are prepping for NASA's next flagship space telescope, a multibillion-dollar machine that could launch as early as the mid-late 2030s and reveal whether Earths are as universal as sand on a beach or if our watery world is instead a lonely island in a quiet sea. Called the Habitable Worlds Observatory, the telescope's core mission is to search for signs of alien biospheres on Earth-size planets orbiting sunlike stars—worlds, at least in theory, that could be twins of our own.

This search demands something conceptually simple but breathtakingly difficult: we need to actually see those faraway planets. To do that, the telescope must separate each world's almost impossibly faint gleam from the overpowering glare of its star.

“HabWorlds is not out to answer your typical science question,” said astrophysicist Chris Stark of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), using what's become the preferred nickname for the mission, during a presentation the day before. “It is arguably attempting to answer the single most profound unanswered question in the history of science and in the history of humankind.”

As Stark spoke, “Are we alone?”—in huge letters—loomed over the audience from one of his slides, almost daring anyone to deny the question's importance. Absent any answer, it's entirely reasonable to think that our planet is, and that we are, either as common as dirt or astronomically implausible enough to represent life's sole spark throughout the entire observable universe.

The truth may well lie between those immense extremes, and HabWorlds' planned search for life in multiple star systems could be our best way to find out—if the observatory ever gets off the ground. As hard as the problem of finding ET may be, overcoming the many terrestrial obstacles on HabWorlds' path to the launchpad may yet prove harder. Some of those obstacles are technical, such as choosing the right targets to investigate and developing innovative but affordable instruments to get the job done.

Others are more grossly mundane and political. During the meeting and in the weeks afterward, power brokers in the White House and Congress were hashing out budget plans that could devastate federally funded U.S. science. For NASA, those plans would lower the curtain on dozens of its iconic space missions and make it very difficult (if not impossible) to launch new ones. But space science is just one small stitch in the fabric of life for most Americans, and its potential ruin pales against this country's rising tide of socioeconomic disruption, civil unrest and political violence. So for HabWorlds, another, more pressing question looms: Can a nation so busy ripping itself apart come together to achieve any big, bold aspiration—especially one as lofty as solving life's cosmic mystery?

To the conference-goers, this moment was all the more reason to spend a few enlightened, unflinching days immersed in the challenges and opportunities of their chosen task. “We needed to be reminded that we have the power to create a world we want to see,” said Janice Lee, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and one of the meeting organizers, to Scientific American afterward.

In the late 1990s, Shawn Domagal-Goldman was home in Chicago, on break from college. Normally, city lights—and stray moonlight—made it difficult to see the twinkling tapestry overhead. This night was different because a total lunar eclipse brought deeper darkness to the sky. With the moon in Earth's shadow, Domagal-Goldman and his younger brother found themselves on their front lawn, gazing up at the stars.

“Do you think there's anyone out there?” his brother asked. “I remember freezing for a solid couple of minutes,” Domagal-Goldman recalls. “And I was like, ‘I don't know, man. That's a really tough question, but it seems like one worth thinking about.'”

Fast-forward more than a quarter-century, and Domagal-Goldman is now an astrobiologist in charge of NASA's entire astrophysics division, still transfixed by the abiding mystery of our apparent solitude. It's his job to manage and oversee NASA's astrophysics fleet, including such flagship missions as the venerable (and beloved) Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Each of these projects has a special place in his heart, but the Habitable Worlds Observatory gets him particularly excited.

“I cannot hide my passion for this mission,” he admits. “In any field, there aren't many opportunities where you get to be a part of something that can literally change the world—and that's not hyperbole. For many people who work on this, including myself, we view this as an Apollo-like moment. I think about those pictures of Earth from the moon and what it meant to see ourselves that way, and I think this is a similar chance to change our view.”

NASA's existing great observatories—like Hubble, JWST and their siblings—have helped us to read our cosmic origin story, revealing how the big bang's blaze of energy infused the newborn universe with the physics needed to forge atoms, stars, galaxies, planets and eventually life. The Habitable Worlds Observatory could tell us how often that story unfolds beyond Earth.

“My expectation is that there is life out there, and the question is: How frequent is it? It could be very rare. It could be very common,” says Evgenya Shkolnik of Arizona State University, an astrophysicist and co-chair of HabWorlds' Community Science and Instrument Team. “I have no idea. But one thing in astronomy we've never done is discover just one of something.”

In its search for extraterrestrial life, HabWorlds will target exo-Earths—rocky worlds in temperate orbits around sunlike stars—within about 100 light-years of the solar system. One of the mission's primary tasks will be to find a few dozen of those worlds that are ripe for in-depth study. But sunlike stars can be 10 billion times brighter than any orbiting exo-Earth would be. To find those dusky worlds, the telescope will employ a starlight-blocking instrument called a coronagraph; once the star is masked, the light from an orbiting Earth-size planet can be seen.

The observatory will then study the composition of the planet's atmosphere in infrared and ultraviolet light. As the telescope dissects those almost inscrutably faint planetary gleams, it will look for the spectral signatures of molecules that, here on Earth, are intimately associated with life. Short of receiving an interstellar radio transmission, finding wriggling Martian microbes or Europan cephalopods or watching a starship touch down next to the U.S. Capitol, a HabWorlds detection of gases such as oxygen, ozone and methane in the skies of a warm, wet, rocky planet would be the best evidence for alien life we could get.

Biology's atmospheric fingerprints are of course still somewhat of an open question on alien worlds, but the data harvested by HabWorlds should at least give scientists something to debate. “We know what we're looking for with respect to the signatures of life that we can already identify on a living planet, such as our own,” Shkolnik says.

But that's not all HabWorlds will be doing. As it sniffs for whiffs of alien biospheres, the observatory will also perform transformative studies of the distant universe and of objects in our own solar system. Its uniquely powerful optics will help astronomers learn more about dark matter and dark energy, the evolution of galaxies, the lives and deaths of stars, our sun's rich retinue of planets and moons, and even potentially Earth-threatening comets and asteroids. Such capabilities are crucial for getting broader buy-in from the entire astronomical community, not all of whom see a search for aliens as their guiding star. (Technically, much of that buy-in already occurred years ago, when a once-every-10-year Decadal Survey of the U.S. space science community anointed HabWorlds as the nation's highest new priority in astrophysics.)

“This is the strongest science case of any flagship I've ever been a part of, whether I've helped build it, fix it or review it,” says Lee Feinberg, HabWorlds' principal architect and an engineer at GSFC. “That gets me really excited.”

In March 1930, almost immediately after the stock market crash that rang in the Great Depression, crews began building a hulking skyscraper on Manhattan, N.Y.'s Fifth Avenue. Each week, those workers added more than four floors to the rising structure of glass, concrete and steel until it soared to be superlative: this was the world's tallest building, the first to top 100 stories.

On May 1, 1931, U.S. president Herbert Hoover turned on the skyscraper's lights.

A mere 21 months had elapsed since architects drew up the first plans for what's now known as the Empire State Building—an art deco edifice that dramatically changed New York City's skyline and, in many ways, Americans' conceptions about what we as a nation could achieve.

For Feinberg, a veteran of multiple flagship space telescopes, that story is less of a parable and more of a blueprint. It demonstrates, he says, that with careful planning and concerted action, we can achieve great things in almost no time at all—great things such as building the first space telescope to find alien biospheres.

“If we could match their level of planning and thought, I think this could be done a lot faster and for a lot less money. But we also need to solve hard technical problems,” Feinberg says. “That's what we're trying to do with HabWorlds—maybe not in a year, although that would be amazing.”

Impatience is not the main reason to move quickly; the best reason to go fast is that speed can save money. (Delays during the development of JWST cost NASA more than $1 million a day.)

“It's all about doing it less expensively, and the way you do that is to do it fast,” Feinberg says.

One of the secrets to speed, Feinberg and his colleagues argue, can be found in the Hubble Space Telescope. Launched in 1990, Hubble was designed to be serviceable, with instruments that could be swapped out and tinkered with by human hands. Between 1993 and 2009, astronauts visited Hubble five times to repair, upgrade or replace components, each time greatly improving the telescope and extending its life. Had Hubble's planners instead waited for technology to catch up with all their aspirations, the observatory might never have launched in the first place.

“When we sent up Hubble, it was not a great observatory. It was an okay observatory,” says John Grunsfeld, a veteran astronaut, former NASA science chief and self-proclaimed Hubble hugger, who flew on three of those servicing missions. Grunsfeld is now working to ensure that the observatory can also be serviced—albeit robotically because the telescope will operate from the same location as JWST, a blissfully dark deep-space spot 1.5 million kilometers away called the Earth-sun Lagrange Point 2, or L2.

“As much as I love human spaceflight, Earth-sun L2 is not a fun place to go. Orbiting the earth is amazing. Going to Mars would be amazing. Going to the moon would be cool. Going to L2 is like two months of travel to spend a few days at a telescope and two months back in a really hazardous place,” Grunsfeld says. “I think we can build a telescope that will be so easy to service it'll be trivial for a robot to open a door, pull an instrument out, put a new instrument in and close the door. We just have to design it that way.”

The possibility of robotic servicing could significantly boost the science and accelerate the development and launch of NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory, mission planners say.

Making HabWorlds robotically serviceable means the telescope can launch even if all the instruments aren't ready. As it stands, some of the concepts Feinberg and his colleagues are considering even include an empty instrument bay for future filling-in. And the instruments that launch with HabWorlds don't need to be the fanciest, most sophisticated things we can build; they only need to be good enough until we replace them with more capable, next-generation hardware. In many ways, making the observatory serviceable could pay for itself. But if the telescope's instruments can change, this makes what must stay fixed—namely, the size of HabWorlds' mirror, or aperture—all the more important.

“Let's focus on aperture, and if we have to compromise on the instruments in the first round, that might be the smart way to go,” says Matt Mountain, an astronomer who has helped to plan multiple large telescopes and is the current president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy.

Beyond the possibility of answering existential questions about extraterrestrial life, all the scientific excitement really boils down to one big thing: HabWorlds is likely to boast the largest, most stable starlight-gathering mirror ever sent into space. But size doesn't always play nicely with other considerations, including cost.

More aperture equates to more light, more resolution, more planets and more science. A bigger mirror can also mean fewer tough engineering challenges down the road. “There's an obvious trade that exists between how many technologies you want to advance [to support high-contrast coronagraphy] and how large your aperture is,” Stark said in his June presentation. With a larger mirror, “you only have to advance a few of the difficult ones.”

And in theory, it's easy to make a mirror very big. You can break it into segments, as engineers do with ground-based telescopes, which then can dynamically adjust to function like a single, solid reflective surface. That's what Feinberg and his colleagues did with JWST, and they're eyeing a similar design for HabWorlds. But with space telescopes, the crucial question is: Just how big of a mirror can we reasonably launch?

“We are ultimately limited by our launch vehicles,” says Breann Sitarski, an optical engineer at GSFC and deputy principal architect of HabWorlds. Right now that means teams are looking at rockets with payload fairings between seven and nine meters wide—SpaceX's Starship, Blue Origin's New Glenn and NASA's Space Launch System.

Given those constraints, one option is to design a segmented mirror to fit as-is within the fairings; another is to make a mirror that, like JWST's, folds up for launch and then unfurls in space. Teams are now studying two designs for HabWorlds. One includes a mirror that would be at least 6.5 meters in diameter, and the other uses a foldable mirror that would be at least eight meters across.

“You don't want too many potential points of failure, but we do have heritage from JWST on folding mirrors, so that's one of the reasons we're looking at it,” Sitarski says. “The launch vehicle size is one thing, but it's also the complexity of the deployment.”

Additionally, for HabWorlds to image exo-Earths, the telescope must be ultrastable. Regardless of the mirror's size, to sweep away unwanted starlight, each of its segments must stay precisely aligned to within picometers of one another—that is, within about one trillionth of a meter. This level of precision is the equivalent of measuring the distance between the Earth and moon to within the length of a grain of rice. Adding to the difficulty, each second the system will be making minuscule adjustments to all the associated parts to maintain clear, crisp imaging. As far-fetched as this requirement may seem, the members of the HabWorlds team are confident that they'll meet it. “We're on the verge of being there,” Sitarski says.

Ultimately, size is not something that scientists are keen to compromise on. Many are pushing for the larger option of an eight-meter-class mirror. Such a big, starlight-catching beast would make it easier to characterize the atmospheres of Earth-size worlds and, in particular, to search for telltale molecules in the near-infrared. In some ways, a larger mirror means the difference between finding potential biosignatures and simply finding life—having more light and more resolution makes ruling out potential “false positives” much easier. And we are learning that studying Earth-size worlds is hard to do with anything smaller. Even the mighty JWST is having trouble meeting that challenge as it scrutinizes rocky planets orbiting smaller, dimmer red dwarf stars. Compared with Earth-sun analogues, such systems are easier to observe—but also so utterly alien that they're very difficult to interpret and understand.

“Nothing would be more depressing than only finding one Earth-like planet where you're not 100 percent sure whether it has life and you don't have the sensitivity to do any more,” Mountain says.

Avoiding that frustrating result is one argument for building a bigger mirror. “The other big argument for aperture is: What if you find nothing? What does it tell you about the abundance of life?” Feinberg says. “If you don't have a big enough aperture, you don't have the confidence to say much statistically about how rare life is—whereas if you have a bigger telescope, and you survey enough stars and Earth-like planets yet don't find life, you can statistically say that life is pretty darn rare.”

Bigger mirrors are more expensive, however, and in NASA's politically charged project planning, even marginal budgetary fluctuations can mean the difference between enduring support and abrupt cancellation. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's former chief of science, was an early supporter of HWO and initiated its first technical study weeks after the release of JWST's first images. He urges teams to be pragmatic, to defend against the allure of bigger-is-better—a mistake, he says, that almost killed JWST. “Do a mission you can be proud of, but don't prematurely fall in love with the wrong one,” he says. “I'd rather have a HabWorlds that looks at 15 exoplanets than one that looks at zero because I couldn't afford it.”

There's more behind such caution than just the lessons of JWST. NASA has pursued a HabWorlds-style mission before—a 2000s-era effort called the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) that was ultimately abandoned after astronomers, policymakers and agency officials failed to win broader support from the astrophysics community and couldn't entirely agree on a preferred design, let alone a realistic price tag. Although now just a historical footnote, to those who remember, TPF remains a cautionary tale, a warning of how a project's internecine fighting can cause the entire effort to falter and fail.

The challenges for HabWorlds, at least right now, seem to be more political and less technological.

No shortage of dire portents exist to make the sunny optimism of this summer's conference seem like little more than futile coping. The fate of federally funded U.S. science has yet to be decided, but if the Trump administration gets its way, the national research enterprise will be transformed into a flimsy husk of its former self, scarcely capable of supporting HabWorlds and other visionary projects. No science agency, not even NASA, will be spared; research at universities will sputter and decline; scientists and students will look for opportunities abroad. Macroeconomic effects from other policy decisions—such as runaway deficit spending and the White House's tariff-fueled trade wars—could further accelerate and amplify the downward spiral.

“I'm not worried about the science [of HabWorlds]; I'm not worried about the experiments we design,” Shkolnik says. “I'm worried about losing people. If we lose the people with expertise and experience, then we will just be relearning the same lessons. We'll figure out how to do it, but it won't be the fastest, most efficient way—and it won't be the cheapest.”

Congress, which carries the constitutionally granted power of the purse, has signaled its intent to avoid this bleak future—to fight, in fact, for the putatively pro-science goals the president himself occasionally proclaims and celebrates in executive actions, public speeches and social media posts. The ruinous treatment of federal science, many researchers and policymakers say, arises not from Trump but from one of his most disruptively ideological appointees: Russell Vought, the ultraconservative bureaucrat in charge of the White House's Office of Management and Budget (OMB). In their proposed science appropriations bills, both congressional chambers largely rejected Vought's machinations, although the OMB is pursuing ways to evade congressional oversight and set U.S. science on a collision course with mediocrity.

In truth, just as the scientific process can't prove a negative statement, it's hard to argue that a world without HabWorlds would be materially worse off. The same could have been said in the 1930s of suggestions to construct the Empire State Building or in the 1960s of proposals to send U.S. astronauts to the moon.

But history tells us, time and time again, how even seemingly small acts can have outsize effects that profoundly shape reality and our place within it. If nothing else, the Apollo lunar missions gave Americans a reason to look up again in unison, as enormous sociopolitical unrest wracked the U.S. The Empire State Building's spire became a towering beacon of progress on New York City's skyline, even as almost unbearable economic hardships unfolded at its base. Such grand projects expand the horizons of our hopes and dreams.

Maybe in the fullness of time, HabWorlds and its quest for exo-Earths will be the same—bright points of light shining against a very dark background, illuminating and forever changing our sense of where—and what—we really are.

“I think it's that kind of enthusiasm which allows us to carry these projects through all of the ups and downs that we're going to face between now and actually getting this launched,” Mountain says, “because it's going to be a journey.”

Although rapamycin eventually became a billion-dollar drug, many of the people instrumental to its discovery—most importantly, the people of Rapa Nui—have been largely forgotten in both a monetary and historical sense.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The island of Rapa Nui—also known as Easter Island—is one of the most “middle of nowhere” places on the planet Earth. It lies 1,200 miles east of Pitcairn Island and 2,200 miles west of Chile (nearly the width of the contiguous U.S.), which officially administers the island. Because of this isolated nature, the history of the island is famously mysterious, and is openly debated to this day. The most well-known symbols of the island are the moai—monolithic carvings of human figures, some of which stand an impressive 33 feet high. 

However, Rapa Nui is also home to another famous export, this one medical in nature—an immunosuppressant drug called (fittingly) rapamycin. Originally derived from a molecule isolated from a soil sample on the island back in the 1960s, rapamycin inhibits a protein known as target of rapamycin kinase, or TOR. 

“This protein acts as a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism,” Ted Powers, a biologist from UC Davis, wrote in an article for The Conversation. “Together with other partner proteins, TOR controls how cells respond to nutrients, stress and environmental signals, thereby influencing major processes such as protein synthesis and immune function.”

This makes rapamycin a critical tool for combatting organ transplant rejection and increasing the usefulness of medical interventions like stents. Powers also mentions that this molecule has now found its way into treatment for certain cancers, and could prove useful in areas like diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and aging as well. Despite its origin being baked into its name, few know exactly how this isolated island in the Pacific provided the world with such a powerful, billion-dollar drug. But in Powers' new Conversation piece, he attempts to bring to light the indigenous origins of rapamycin and its controversial past. 

“As a scientist who built my career around the effects of rapamycin on cells, I felt compelled to understand and share the human story underlying its origin,” Powers wrote.

Who officially earns recognition for scientific discoveries is a complex subject, and sometimes those who are the most deserving can be unfortunately forgotten (or even purposefully neglected). Sadly, rapamycin's origins come from an unfortunate example of scientific colonialism. 

When Medical Expedition to Easter Island (METEI), led by a Canadian research team, arrived on the shores of Easter Island in December 1964 with an honorable goal—to understand what could happen to the island's health with the arrival of its first international airport. During this expedition, scientists retrieved 200 soil samples, one of which contained the Streptomyces bacterium that produces rapamycin. But though it was well-intentioned, the original study (according to Powers) contained many instances of inherent bias. One of the most notable was the perception that the island was relatively untouched by outside influence, despite strong historical evidence that shows the island had regular contact with the outside world as far back as the 1700s. 

Eventually, the microbiologist isolated rapamycin from the soil sample, and it made its way to market in the 1900s as the immunosuppressant Rapamune. Despite the name's homage to the drug's origins, the island of Rapa Nui (as well as the initial expedition that retrieved the sample) received no recognition, monetary or otherwise. 

“This raises questions about Indigenous rights and biopiracy, which is the commercialization of Indigenous knowledge,” Powers wrote in The Conversation. “The discovery of rapamycin on Rapa Nui set the foundation for all subsequent research and commercialization around the molecule, and this only happened because the people were the subjects of study.”

The world is starting to wake up to this form of intellectual property theft. In June of 2024, members of the World Intellectual Property Organisation agreed to a treaty that would protect “traditional knowledge” from being patented by for-profit companies. With many areas of the natural world still unexplored, it's only a matter of time before the Earth offers humanity another life-changing remedy. Hopefully when that happens, all of the rightful participants in its discovery will be fairly recognized and compensated.

Episodic memories are initially encoded in the hippocampus and subsequently undergo systems consolidation into the neocortex. The nature of memories stored in the hippocampus and neocortex differs, with the cortex encoding memories in more generalized forms. Although several brain regions encode social information, the specific cortical regions and circuits involved in the consolidation of social memories and the nature of the information encoded in the cortex remain unclear. Using in vivo Ca2+ imaging and optogenetic manipulations, we found that infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens shell (IL→NAcSh) store consolidated social memories in male mice. Inactivating IL→NAcSh neurons that responded to a familiar conspecific impaired the recognition of other familiar mice including littermates, demonstrating that these neuronal activities support social familiarity. Furthermore, inactivating hippocampal ventral CA1 neurons projecting to the IL region disrupted the consolidation of memory for newly familiarized mice while sparing the recognition of littermates. These findings demonstrate the critical role of hippocampal-cortical interactions in the consolidation of social memory.

Episodic memory is initially encoded and stored in the hippocampus and then consolidated into the cortex through intricate hippocampal-cortical interactions1,2. Prevalent models on the organization of memory, such as the complementary learning systems theory, propose that the interaction between the hippocampus and cortex during an “offline period” is crucial for memory storage, especially for recognition memory3. In addition, some memory models have proposed that different brain regions encode distinct aspects of memory4,5. For example, the cortex stores memory in more generalized or abstract forms compared to the hippocampus6.

Social memory, which refers to the ability to recognize and remember conspecifics, consists of the detection of familiarity and the recollection of social episodes7,8. The hippocampal dorsal CA2 (dCA2) region is a hub for social memory in rodents, with recent studies showing that the tuned geometries of dCA2 representations can support both familiarity and recollection8,9,10,11. The lateral entorhinal cortex sends projections conveying social information to the dCA2, which then sends projections to the ventral CA1 (vCA1)11,12. vCA1 projections to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) are critical for social memory13,14. While vCA1 projections to the mPFC have been implicated in social memory15,16, the precise role hippocampal-cortical interactions play in social memory consolidation remains largely unknown. It is also unclear whether the mPFC stores social memory in generalized forms.

Neural representations of social information have been reported in PFC neurons, encoding relevant social vs. nonsocial information, including information on sex or hierarchy17,18,19,20. Accordingly, social representations in the PFC are impaired in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder20,21,22. Several studies found that learning promoted task-relevant tuning and alterations in the dimensionality of neural representations in the PFC23,24,25. Still, our understanding of social representations in the PFC remains limited. Previously, we reported a subpopulation of mPFC infralimbic (IL) neurons projecting to the NAcSh that was activated by familiar mice. We found chemogenetic suppression of the activity of these neurons impaired social recognition, suggesting that these IL→NAcSh neurons are critical for processing social memory26. The stage of memory processing that requires these neurons remains unclear, as does the nature of the social information they encode.

In this study, we aimed to test our hypothesis that IL→NAcSh neurons store consolidated social memories in a generalized form via hippocampal-cortical interactions. To investigate this, we focused on the role of the vCA1-IL-NAcSh circuit in social memory consolidation in male mice using a combination of in vivo Ca2+ imaging, viral tracing and tagging, as well as both optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations.

Previously, we showed that IL→NAcSh neurons play a critical role in social recognition26,27. The specific temporal window during which IL→NAcSh neurons are engaged, however, remains unclear. We used a social familiarization/recognition task to investigate social recognition memory in male mice (Fig. 1a). During social familiarization, we exposed each subject mouse to a novel conspecific mouse (FN) until it eventually became a familiar mouse (F). We then inactivated IL→NAcSh neurons in different phases of the social familiarization/recognition task via optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation (Fig. 1b). To inactivate IL→NAcSh neurons during either the familiarization (encoding) or recognition (retrieval) phase, we expressed halorhodopsin (NpHR) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the IL and used optic fibers to bilaterally target the NAcSh (Fig. 1c). To demonstrate the functional inhibition of IL→NAcSh neurons via optogenetics, we expressed ChR2 with either YFP or NpHR in IL→NAcSh neurons and recorded optogenetically-induced excitatory postsynaptic currents (opto-EPSCs) in the NAcSh. We found that NpHR activation reduced opto-EPSCs in NAcSh neurons in ex vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings, confirming the optogenetic inhibition functionally affected target region neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Optogenetic inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons during social familiarization on day 1 affected neither social familiarization nor recognition in NpHR or YFP-expressing mice (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). On day 2, both groups showed significantly longer interaction times with novel conspecifics (N) than with either familiar conspecifics (F) or littermates (L). Chemogenetic inactivation of these neurons during the offline phase after social familiarization did not affect social preference for novel conspecifics during the social recognition session on day 2 (Fig. 1e, f, and Supplementary Fig. 2b). We also confirmed that CNO treatment reduced neuronal excitability in hM4Di-expressing IL→NAcSh neurons (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f). When we inactivated these neurons during the social recognition session on day 2, however, although the YFP-expressing mice showed normal preference for the novel conspecific, the NpHR-expressing mice exhibited impaired social recognition (Fig. 1g). The same mice showed normal social recognition in the absence of optogenetic manipulation (Supplementary Fig. 2c). These results indicate that IL→NAcSh neuronal activity is required for the retrieval of social memory. In addition, we found optogenetic manipulation had no effect on locomotive activity or real-time place preference (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Of note, we found most IL→NAcSh neurons in layer 5 of the IL cortex, but we also found a minor population in layers 2/3 (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Our virus injection strategy primarily labeled IL→NAcSh neurons, with minor labeling of other prefrontal subregions projecting to the NAc due to virus diffusion (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3d–f).

Next, we investigated which aspects of social information are encoded by the IL→NAcSh neurons. Since the inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons impaired social recognition, we wanted to examine whether these neurons encode the identity or social familiarity of social targets. To investigate social representations in IL→NAcSh neurons, we monitored Ca2+ activity in this prefrontal subpopulation using an open-source one-photon miniaturized endoscopic microscope during the social familiarization/recognition task (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In Ai148 mice expressing a Cre recombinase-dependent genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP6f), we monitored calcium activity in IL→NAcSh neurons through a gradient-index (GRIN) lens attached to a right-angled optical prism implanted lateral to the prefrontal cortex, primarily targeting the infralimbic cortex (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4b). After obtaining fluorescence signals (ΔF/F), we processed them and analyzed neuronal activity dynamics (Fig. 2b). During social familiarization, the subject mice showed a significantly reduced duration for each consecutive interaction with a novel conspecific (FN) (Fig. 2c). During the recognition session on day 2, the subject mice showed significantly longer interactions with a novel conspecific (N) compared to familiar conspecifics (F) or littermates (L) (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4c). This suggests that the miniscope imaging did not affect performance in the social familiarization/recognition task. We imaged Ca2+ signals longitudinally during the task, achieving successful registration of over 80% of the GCaMP6f-expressing neurons across days (Supplementary Fig. 4d–f). Average Ca2+ transient frequency during the habituation sessions remained comparable with that during the social familiarization and recognition sessions (Supplementary Fig. 4g).

We used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to define a population of social interaction-responsive cells among the IL→NAcSh neurons and classified them as ‘social cells' (see the Methods section for details)17. We could classify 47.2% of all recorded cells (558 out of 1181) as social cells in at least one of the interaction sessions during the two days of the social familiarization/recognition task, with the number of social cells remaining comparable between sessions (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, when we analyzed the interaction-dependent Ca2+ transient area-under-the-curve (AUC) of familiar conspecific-social cells, we found a significant increase during the social recognition session and no change during the familiarization session (Fig. 2e, f). Repeated interactions with a conspecific within the familiarization session did not increase either the number of social cells nor the overlap between them (Fig. 2d, i). These data, along with our optogenetic inhibition results during the social memory encoding and retrieval phases, suggest a delayed emergence of neural representations in the IL for familiar mice 1 day after repeated social interactions.

Additionally, we found that the social cells responding to littermates and familiar conspecifics showed a significantly larger interaction-dependent Ca2+ transient AUC compared to the social cells responding to novel conspecifics, which is consistent with our previous finding that IL→NAcSh neurons show increased responses to familiar mice than novel mice (Fig. 2g, h)26. Thus, we next asked whether familiar mice and littermates activate the same or overlapping subpopulations of IL→NAcSh neurons during social recognition. We found that social cells responding to known conspecifics (F and L) showed a significantly larger overlap (F∩L) than other comparison groups, despite each group containing a similar number of social cells between sessions (Fig. 2d, i). These results led us to hypothesize that the activity of IL→NAcSh neurons encodes social familiarity, enabling them to more effectively distinguish between a novel mouse and a familiar mouse than between a familiar mouse and a littermate. To test this, we examined whether the population activity of IL→NAcSh neurons could decode the identity of social targets at different levels of familiarity. We trained a 3-dimensional linear support vector machine (LSVM) decoding algorithm with two single variables after linear dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2j). We found IL→NAcSh neuronal representations accurately discriminated between mice regardless of their familiarity levels, but the LSVM decoding performance for distinguishing two known social targets (F and L) was significantly lower than for other comparison groups (Fig. 2k). In conjunction with our ROC-based identification of social interaction-dependent cell populations and their properties, these results imply that IL→NAcSh neurons encode social memory of known social targets following social familiarization and subsequent memory consolidation.

Recent studies have shown that neural ensembles in the PFC and hippocampus can simultaneously represent variables in an abstract format while still preserving their ability to decode other variables, including social familiarity and identity8,24. One recent study showed that CA2 activity encodes both social identity and familiarity by analyzing neural activity pattern arrangements, also known as neural representational geometries, in neural activity space8. Given the preferential activities of IL→NAcSh neurons towards known social targets and the decent decoding performance for distinguishing between two known social targets, we asked whether IL→NAcSh neurons can simultaneously represent both social familiarity and identity of familiar conspecifics. We monitored Ca2+ activity in IL→NAcSh neurons while subject mice were consecutively exposed to either two littermates or two novel mice, with the positions of the same target mice reversed between exposures (Fig. 3a, c). During the consecutive littermate recognition task, the subject mice interacted twice with each of two littermates, exhibiting a slight reduction in the interaction time for the second interaction with each littermate (Fig. 3a, b). We observed a similar proportion of social cells in each session (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Interestingly, we observed similar overlap for social cells responding to the same littermates in different sessions and for social cells responding to different littermates, suggesting that IL→NAcSh neurons are not consistently activated by a specific littermate (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Nevertheless, the LSVM classifier gave high decoding accuracy whether trained with social (identity) or spatial (position) information (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). The LSVM classifier also showed high identity decoding performance whether trained with overlapping or non-overlapping social cells responding to two littermates (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g).

During the consecutive novel mouse interaction task, the subject mice alternately interacted twice with two novel mice (Fig. 3c). Interaction times with the novel mice were significantly higher than those with littermates during the first encounter but then decreased in the subsequent interactions to levels comparable to those with littermates (Fig. 3b, d). The number of social cells for novel conspecifics remained similar across sessions (Supplementary Fig. 5h). The degree of overlap between social cells responding to different novel mice and those responding to the same novel mouse was comparable (Supplementary Fig. 5i). Consistent with our social familiarization/recognition task results, we found that the Ca2+ responses of social cells responding to novel mice were substantially smaller than those of social cells responding to littermates (Supplementary Fig. 5j). Despite the overall lower Ca2+ activity of IL→NAcSh social cells responding to novel mice, both the social identity and position of the novel mice could be successfully decoded from the IL→NAcSh population activity (Supplementary Fig. 5k–m). In addition, the LSVM classifier showed high identity decoding performance when trained with overlapping social cells responding to different novel mice (Supplementary Fig. 5n, o).

After finding that we could decode social and non-social (i.e., spatial) features of social targets from the activity of the IL→NAcSh neurons via a linear classifier, we next explored whether social identity could be represented independently of position in the geometry supporting generalization. To answer this question, we used a modified linear SVM classifier called cross-condition generalization performance (CCGP) to train and determine a conceptual hyperplane that could separate an effectively generalized population of vectors illustrating different neural representations and use it for making predictions8,24. We measured identity CCGP by training the linear classifier to decode the identity of two littermates on the left side (L1left and L2left) and then tested it on data from littermates on the right side (L1right and L2right). This analysis was repeated with the training and testing datasets reversed, and the results were averaged (Fig. 3e). We also measured position CCGP in the similar manner. We found the identity CCGP showed much higher performance than the one trained on spatial information, suggesting that IL→NAcSh neural activity supports a generalized decoding of identity, but not the position of littermates (Fig. 3f, i and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b, and e). Interestingly, data from interactions with novel mice gave a CCGP performance that was as low as chance for both identity and position (Fig. 3g–i and Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). Despite high LSVM decoding performance, low CCGP decoding performance remains possible depending on the geometrical positioning of the clusters from novel mouse representations.

Next, we directly investigated the effect of familiarity of social targets on IL→NAcSh neuronal representations by comparing the population patterns from two behavioral paradigms, the littermate recognition task and the novel mouse interaction task. We registered cells from each behavioral paradigm (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d), trained the CCGP classifier using data from interactions with littermate 1 and novel mouse 1 on the left side (L1left and N1left), and then tested it with data from littermate 2 and novel mouse 2 on the right side (L2right and N2right). We did the same with the reversed positional configuration and averaged the results to account for any side-specific bias (Fig. 3j and Supplementary Movie 1). Considering the different social identities and positions of the target mice, the CCGP classifier specifically allowed us to determine any impact of familiarity beyond identity. We found that IL→NAcSh neural activity showed significant decoding performance depending on the familiarity of social targets with different identities but not depending on social target spatial location (Fig. 3j–l, and Supplementary Fig. 6f–h). These data suggest IL→NAcSh neural activity represents both a generalized social identity of littermates and a representation of familiarity. Of note, the LSVM decoder failed to distinguish the calcium activity patterns from the habituation sessions of the littermate recognition and novel mouse interaction tasks, which were performed over several days (Supplementary Fig. 7e–g). This indicates that decoding performance did not depend on the time difference between the two tasks. Decoding performance remained stable across multiple analytical conditions, including when dimensionality reduction or feature selection was omitted (Supplementary Fig. 8). Since our decoding analyses included the entire recorded neuronal population, including both overlapping and non-overlapping social cells, decoding performance could be influenced by both neuronal populations. To assess the specific contribution of each population, we attempted to decode the identity of social targets using either overlapping or non-overlapping social cells using CCGP decoder (Supplementary Fig. 9). When only overlapping cells from different littermates were used, decoding performance was at chance level (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b) Interestingly, non-overlapping social cells from different littermates were able to identify littermate identity with CCGP decoding (Supplementary Fig. 9c). In contrast, for novel social targets, decoding performance using either overlapping or non-overlapping social cells was close to chance (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e).

We next asked whether selective inhibition of IL→NAcSh social cells activated by a familiar conspecific is sufficient to disrupt the neuronal representation of a single known social target and whether it extends to disrupting the recognition of other conspecifics. To investigate this question, we used a genetic technique known as targeted recombination in active population (TRAP)28. First, we injected wild-type mice with the fosCreERT2 virus into their IL cortex and with a retrograde Cre-dependent virus expressing hM4Di-mCherry (hereafter hM4Di) or mCherry into their NAcSh (Fig. 4a). This labeled (TRAPed) IL→NAcSh neurons activated by a familiar conspecific, such that their activities could subsequently be manipulated during the social recognition session (Fig. 4b). Subject mice were exposed to a novel conspecific for familiarization on day 1 and then re-exposed to the familiarized mouse for TRAP tagging on day 2 (Fig. 4c). One week later (day 9), when the TRAPed neurons expressed either hM4Di or mCherry, the subject mice were tested in the social familiarization/recognition task. In this task, the subject mice were familiarized with a novel mouse different from the one they interacted with on days 1 and 2 (Fig. 4c, d). Both hM4Di and mCherry-expressing groups showed similarly reduced interaction times during familiarization with a novel conspecific on day 9 regardless of CNO injection (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 10a, d). Injection of CNO prior to the social recognition session on day 10, however, inactivated the TRAPed IL→NAcSh neurons and induced a significant reduction in social recognition compared to controls. These controls included mCherry-expressing mice with or without CNO injection and hM4Di-expressing mice without CNO injection (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, e, and f). Importantly, interaction times in CNO-injected hM4Di-expressing mice increased, not only with a familiarized mouse, but also with a littermate (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 10f). The inactivation of TRAPed IL→NAcSh neurons did not affect basal locomotor activity or total interaction times (Supplementary Fig. 10g, h). These data show that inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons responding to a single familiar conspecific was sufficient to impair social recognition of other known social targets, demonstrating that IL→NAcSh neuronal activity supports social familiarity. In addition, we TRAPed IL→NAcSh neurons activated during interactions with a novel conspecific (Supplementary Fig. 11a–c). The inactivation of these novel mouse-dependent IL→NAcSh neurons did not impair social recognition, demonstrating the specificity of our other TRAP experiments (Supplementary Fig. 11d–g).

To further investigate whether the TRAPed IL→NAcSh neuronal population represents social familiarity, we asked whether these neurons are reactivated during interactions with another familiar conspecific. After allowing the TRAPed mice to interact with either a novel conspecific or a littermate, we analyzed cFos expression (day 15-16, Fig. 4c, e). The TRAPed mice showed a strong preference toward novel conspecifics over littermates (Fig. 4f). We found that TRAPed mice showed a significantly higher percentage of TRAPed mCherry+ neurons co-labeled with cFos after interacting with a littermate than with a novel mouse or without any social interaction (Fig. 4g, h). The numbers of TRAP-labeled neurons (mCherry+) were comparable among groups (Fig. 4i). The increased overlap between TRAPed neurons and littermate interaction-induced cFos+ staining we observed was consistent with the high overlap of social cells that responded to known social targets in the Ca2+ imaging experiments (Fig. 2i). These results illustrate that IL→NAcSh neurons encode social memory with a certain level of overlap, which might support social familiarity.

Given that the hippocampus plays crucial roles in multiple phases of social memory, including memory acquisition, and given that hippocampal-cortical interactions are critical for episodic memory, we hypothesized that the IL might interact with the hippocampus to process social memory. Among the subregions of the hippocampus engaged in social memory, the IL cortex receives direct inputs from vCA129. We used optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation to investigate the temporal window during which the activities of IL-projecting vCA1 (vCA1→IL) neurons are required for social recognition. We expressed ChR2 with either NpHR or YFP in the vCA1 and inserted optic fibers bilaterally into the IL to selectively inactivate vCA1→IL neurons (Fig. 5a). This allowed us to validate the inhibitory effect of NpHR as we recorded opto-EPSCs in IL neurons in ex vivo whole cell patch-clamp recordings (Supplementary Fig. 12a–c). We found that illumination with a 594-nm laser during social familiarization did not affect social recognition in either NpHR- or YFP-expressing mice during the social recognition session (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 13a).

To inhibit vCA1→IL neurons during the offline memory consolidation phase, we expressed hM4Di in vCA1→IL neurons (Fig. 5c). We confirmed that CNO treatment reduced the excitability of hM4Di-expressing vCA1→IL neurons (Supplementary Fig. 12d–f). By injecting CNO after social familiarization to inactivate these neurons, hM4Di-expressing mice showed deficits in social recognition. While they showed similar interaction times with familiar and novel conspecifics during the social recognition session (Fig. 5d), their interaction times with littermates remained as low as the controls (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 13b). We were also able to reproduce this behavioral phenotype by inactivating the hM4Di DREADD receptor during consolidation phase with deschloroclozapine (DCZ), an alternative DREADD agonist (Supplementary Fig. 14). In addition, optogenetic inhibition of vCA1→IL neurons during the retrieval phase also prevented NpHR-expressing mice from distinguishing between familiar and novel conspecifics during the social recognition session (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 13c). This is likely attributable to incomplete memory transfer from the hippocampus to the cortex rather than a block in memory recall, as the subject mice still showed lower interaction times with littermates (Fig. 5e). Both YFP and NpHR-expressing mice showed intact locomotor activity and place preference regardless of laser illumination (Supplementary Fig. 15a, b). Nor did chemogenetic inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons affect novel object recognition, suggesting a specific engagement of these projections in processing social context (Supplementary Fig. 15c).

As previously reported30, we observed that vCA1→IL neurons have collateral projections to the NAcSh (Fig. 5a, c, Supplementary Fig. 16). This raised the concern that the social memory deficits we observed in our previous experiment may have arisen from a blockade of the activity of vCA1 neurons that project to the NAcSh (Fig. 5d). To selectively inactivate vCA1→IL neurons, we expressed hM4Di in IL-projecting vCA1 neurons and infused CNO locally into the IL (Fig. 5f). While both mCherry- and hM4Di-expressing mice showed normal behaviors during the social familiarization session, hM4Di-expressing mice injected with CNO during the offline phase exhibited similar interaction times with familiar conspecifics and with novel mice, due mainly to increased investigation of familiar conspecifics (Fig. 5g, Supplementary Fig. 13d, e). Consistent with our systemic CNO injection result (Fig. 5d), hM4Di-expressing mice subjected to local CNO injection showed interaction times with littermates as low as controls. These data imply that the activity of IL-projecting vCA1 neurons during the offline phase is critical for the consolidation of memories of newly familiarized mice.

Interestingly, we found selective inactivation of vCA1 neuron terminals in the NAcSh during the offline phase also impaired the consolidation of newly formed social memories. hM4Di-expressing mice injected with CNO exhibited similar interaction times with familiar and novel conspecifics, while their interaction times with littermates remained low (Supplementary Fig. 17a, b). This result is consistent with our selective inactivation of vCA1-projecting neuron terminals in the IL (Fig. 5g). We found, however, that inactivation of vCA1→NAcSh neurons during social familiarization reduced social interaction times during the familiarization session, possibly causing the differences in the interaction times with familiar and novel conspecifics during the social recognition session to fall below the level of significance (Supplementary Fig. 17c). This result was consistent with a previous finding that chemogenetic inactivation of vCA1→NAcSh neurons disrupted social preference31. As vCA1→IL neuronal inactivation during social familiarization affected neither social memory encoding (familiarization) nor recall (recognition) (Fig. 5g), these results suggest overlapping but distinct roles for the vCA1→IL and vCA1→NAcSh neuronal populations.

To further determine whether projections from vCA1 are anatomically connected to IL→NAcSh neurons, we labeled both IL→NAcSh neurons and vCA1→IL neurons in the same mouse. We found that 20% of IL→NAcSh neurons are directly connected to vCA1 neurons (Supplementary Fig. 18).

In addition, to validate whether the inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons during the offline consolidation phase directly affects familiar conspecific-dependent cFos induction in IL→NAcSh neurons, we expressed the hM4Di DREADD protein in vCA1→IL neurons and labeled IL→NAcSh neurons with a retrograde AAV-GFP injected into the NAcSh (Supplementary Fig. 19a, b). After familiarizing hM4Di-expressing mice with a novel conspecific one day before being re-exposing them to the same conspecific, we sacrificed the animals to examine cFos expression in their IL→NAcSh neurons (Supplementary Fig. 19c). Consistent with our earlier result (Fig. 5d), the inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons during the consolidation phase increased interaction times with familiar conspecifics, indicating impaired social recognition (Supplementary Fig. 19d). Moreover, the CNO-injected group exhibited significantly less IL→NAcSh neuronal cFos expression than vehicle-treated controls, demonstrating that inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons during the consolidation phase directly affected the activity of the IL→NAcSh neurons (Supplementary Fig. 19e–g).

Since hippocampal inactivation during the offline period prevents consolidation of spatial or contextual memories32, we next examined the impact of vCA1→IL neuron inactivation during the offline phase on the neural representation of social information in the IL cortex. First, we used the Cre-Lox and fLp-FRT recombination systems to selectively express GCaMP protein in IL→NAcSh neurons and hM4Di or mCherry (control) in vCA1→IL neurons (Fig. 6a). Then, we recorded the Ca2+ activity of IL→NAcSh neurons during an extended version of the social familiarization/recognition task (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 20a–d). In this task, a subject mouse was familiarized with two social targets during the social familiarization session and then subjected to interaction with the same two familiarized mice, along with two novel conspecifics or two littermates on the next day to test its social recognition. In this extended social familiarization/recognition task, mCherry-expressing control mice injected with CNO showed significantly longer interaction times with the two novel mice than with either the two familiar mice or the two littermates (Fig. 6c). Consistent with our previous results (Fig. 5d, g), hM4Di-expressing mice injected with CNO during the offline phase did not distinguish familiar mice from novel mice (Fig. 6d). These mice still showed significantly shorter interaction times with their littermates than with familiar or novel mice, further demonstrating that vCA1 inactivation had prevented the subject mice from recognizing familiarized conspecifics as familiar (Fig. 6d).

After confirming the behavioral deficits of mice with vCA1→IL neuron inactivation in the extended social familiarization/recognition task, we analyzed social representations in IL→NAcSh neurons. mCherry- and hM4Di-expressing mice exhibited similar numbers of social cells (Supplementary Fig. 20f, g). Consistent with our results (Fig. 2i), we observed significantly more overlap of social cells for familiar conspecifics and littermates (F∩L) in vCA1 mCherry-expressing mice than in vCA1 hM4Di-expressing mice (Fig. 6e), suggesting vCA1 inactivation changes neuronal representations of social targets in IL→NAcSh neurons, subsequently impairing social recognition. We also found that an LSVM classifier was capable of predicting social identity with an accuracy above the level of chance even after vCA1→IL neuron inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 20h).

Next, we used a CCGP classifier to examine the impact of vCA1 inactivation on the representation of social familiarity in IL→NAcSh neural activity. We trained the CCGP classifier using data from interactions with familiar mouse 1 and novel mouse 2 on one side (e.g., F1left and N2left) during the social recognition session and tested it with data from familiar mouse 2 and novel mouse 1 on the opposite side (e.g., F2right and N1right) (Fig. 6f). The analysis was also repeated with training and testing datasets reversed, and the results were averaged. We found that IL→NAcSh neural activity showed high decoding performance for familiarity in mCherry-expressing mice even after CNO injection (Fig. 6g, i). Consistent with our behavioral data (Fig. 6d), however, vCA1 inactivation reduced the CCGP performance for decoding familiarity using IL→NAcSh neural activity in hM4Di-expressing mice (Fig. 6h, i). Moreover, after CA1 inactivation, the CCGP classifier failed to decode social targets before and after familiarization (F vs. FN, Fig. 6j). Both mCherry and hM4Di mice showed significantly higher CCGP performances for classifying littermates versus other social targets (L vs. FN, L vs. N; Fig. 6k, l). Last, to determine whether the CCGP classifier could decode familiarity even for cases in which the familiarity level differed between training and testing sets, we trained the classifier using data from interactions with a littermate and novel conspecific on one side (e.g., L1left and N2left) and then tested on data from interactions with a familiar conspecific and another novel conspecific on the opposite side (e.g., F2right and N1right). The mCherry-expressing mice exhibited a significantly higher decoding performance for familiarity, indicating that IL→NAcSh neural activity represents social familiarity regardless of the familiarity level (Fig. 6m). In hM4Di-expressing mice, however, the CCGP classifier failed to distinguish between familiar and novel mice when it was trained using data from interactions with littermates and novel mice (Fig. 6m). It is possible that the representations of IL→NAcSh neurons could produce a high performance CCGP if they encoded the passage of time across days. But when we trained and tested the CCGP with reference to time, it produced a decoding performance close to the level of chance for both mCherry- and hM4Di-expressing mice (Supplementary Fig. 20i). This demonstrates that the representation of IL→NAcSh neurons does not generalize due to the passage of time. In addition, we found CCGP decoding performance for the classification of interactions between littermates and novel mice was significantly higher than a null control when we trained and tested the decoder using data that were all acquired on the same day (Fig. 6l). Meanwhile, the performance of position-based CCGPs remained at the level of chance when comparing the neural representations of different social targets in both mCherry- and hM4Di-expressing mice (Supplementary Fig. 21). This suggests the neural representation of spatial information is not generalized in IL→NAcSh neurons. Together, these results demonstrate that inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons after familiarization prevents the formation of representations of newly familiarized conspecifics without disrupting social information previously stored in IL→NAcSh neurons.

While the role of the hippocampus in social memory has been extensively investigated10,14,33, it has remained unclear where social memories are stored in the neocortex. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of mPFC IL neurons that stores consolidated memory of familiarized conspecifics, including littermates. The neural activity of vCA1→IL neurons during the offline phase is also critical for these cortical social memory representations in male mice. These representations support the discrimination of familiar and novel conspecifics.

Previously, we showed that mouse IL→NAcSh neurons are activated by familiar conspecifics and that their activity is required for social recognition but not object recognition26. It remains unclear, however, whether the activity of these neurons represents social memory, and if so, which aspects of social memory they encode and at which stage of social memory processing they act. We found that inactivating IL→NAcSh neurons during the recognition phase of the social familiarization/recognition task, but not the familiarization or consolidation offline phases, impairs social recognition 24 h after familiarization. This demonstrates that these neurons store long-term social memory and are required for its retrieval.

Our results are consistent with the complementary learning system model proposed by O'Reilly and colleagues, which suggests that hippocampal representations are gradually transformed into neocortical representations due to the temporal gap in learning between brain regions3,34. We found that inactivating vCA1 to IL neural projections during the offline consolidation phase impaired recognition memory of newly familiarized conspecifics without affecting memory of littermates, supporting the critical role of vCA1-IL interactions in consolidating newly established social memories. Previous studies showed that dCA2 to vCA1 projections are crucial for encoding, consolidation, and recall of social memory11. Our study extends the known dCA2-vCA1 social memory circuits by connecting vCA1 to the IL and uncovers differences in the temporal engagements and representational dynamics of social information in these brain regions. Our data further demonstrate the relatively slow learning of prefrontal subpopulations, which allows for the formation of neural representations of social targets 24 h after familiarization. We also found that optogenetic inhibition of vCA1→IL neurons during the social memory recognition session impaired recognition of newly familiarized conspecifics. This suggests that the transfer of social memories from the hippocampus to the cortex may not be completed within 24 h, as has been shown for other forms of memory2. Additionally, previous studies showed that hippocampal dCA2 activity is necessary for recognizing littermates10,11, indicating that the hippocampus may play a sustained role in social memory retrieval. It is still unclear, however, whether the hippocampus eventually disengages or remains permanently engaged in social memory retrieval.

We asked which aspects of social information are encoded by IL→NAcSh neurons, finding that their activity can simultaneously represent the identity of familiar conspecifics as well as familiarity in general by tuning the geometry of neural representations in neural activity space. Moreover, our TRAP experiment results showing that inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons responding to a familiar mouse impaired recognition of other familiar mice (including littermates) strongly indicate that IL→NAcSh neurons encode social familiarity. This aligns with the previously established notion that learning induces a generalization within prefrontal representations with potential mixed selectivity6,35,36,37,38. Intriguingly, we also found that IL→NAcSh neuronal activity supports the decoding of littermate identity. Our decoding analyses demonstrate that non-overlapping social cells specific to different littermates are the main contributors to identity decoding, as indicated by CCGP results (Supplementary Fig. 9). These findings suggest that distinct neuronal populations selective for different familiar individuals encode social identity of familiar mice, while overlapping IL social cells represent generalized social familiarity.

Our study also highlights the distinct functional contributions of the IL→NAcSh and PL→NAc pathways in social behavior, suggesting that prefrontal cortical subregions engage in dissociable yet complementary roles. A previous study demonstrated that activation of NAcC-projecting PL neurons impaired social preference39. In addition, we previously showed that inactivation of PL→NAcSh neurons impaired both social preference and recognition26. The inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons, however, selectively impaired social recognition, highlighting a functional distinction between NAc-projecting IL and PL neurons26. Consistent with these results, we found in this study that IL→NAcSh neuronal inactivation affected neither social preference nor total social exploration time in the social familiarization/recognition task (Fig. 1d, g).

Although we demonstrated that IL→NAcSh neurons play a critical role in social recognition memory, we also found that IL→NAcSh neurons constitute a small proportion of IL neurons (Supplementary Fig. 18). Considering previous studies showing that the IL is involved in social recognition memory40,41, it is possible that other IL subpopulations also play roles in social recognition memory. For example, Noelia and colleagues showed that corticotropin-releasing hormone released from IL neurons that project to the lateral septum (LS) modulates social interaction time with familiar social targets42. In addition, the IL shares reciprocal connections with the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is implicated in reward-related behavior, and IL–BLA interactions were found to influence social preference43,44. Another recent study found a role for the cerebellar-IL pathway in social recognition, showing that increased cerebellar activity activated IL neurons, as evidenced by elevated c-Fos expression45. The specific roles these IL subpopulations play in social recognition memory require further investigation. While our findings underscore the functional specificity of IL→NAcSh neurons in social recognition, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that some PL neurons were included in our in vivo imaging study of the IL. To address this, we examined the locations of field of view for our miniscope imaging experiments and found that they were focused primarily within the IL (Supplementarys Figs. 4b, 20a).

The hippocampal dCA2 region is necessary for social memory across the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval phases10,11. In contrast, IL→NAcSh neurons are selectively required for social memory retrieval. We also found that vCA1→IL neurons are required for the consolidation of social memory. These findings suggest social memory processing involves multiple brain circuits, with each component playing distinct but also overlapping roles. For example, whereas dCA2 neurons respond primarily to novel social targets10,46, IL→NAcSh neurons are activated by familiar conspecifics26. Hassan et al. demonstrated that dCA2's generalization capacity allows it to distinguish social versus non-social odor cues9, suggesting it plays a broader role in social memory encoding.

It is worth noting that dCA2 and IL neurons represent social targets in distinct ways. A recent study demonstrated that dCA2 encodes novel animals using low-dimensional representations that facilitate identity discrimination independent of spatial location, whereas it encodes littermate mice with high-dimensional representations8. Moreover, while Boyle and colleagues were able to use a CCGP classifier to successfully predict the identities and spatial positions of novel mice, its performance for littermates did not exceed the level of chance8. This finding suggests CA2 neural activity supports a generalized decoding of both identity and spatial position only in the exploration of novel mice, consistent with the hypothesis that dCA2 encodes episodic memories integrating both “what” and “where” information. In contrast, IL→NAcSh projections appear to support a generalized (abstract) representation of the identity of familiar conspecifics rather than novel mice. Notably, for these projections, we were unable to decode mouse position using a similar CCGP classifier approach, regardless of familiarity. This is again consistent with previous studies showing that the prefrontal cortex encodes memory in a more generalized manner36,47. Together, these results indicate that the IL and dCA2 process social information differently. While dCA2 specializes in novel identity–position associations, the IL preferentially represents familiar identities. Given that IL neurons receive hippocampal inputs—including from vCA1, which is itself innervated by dCA2—this connectivity may facilitate the transformation of detailed social memory traces into broader behavioral and decision-making contexts, particularly through the storage of information about familiar conspecifics in the IL11,15.

We remain curious about other brain regions and their connections that play a role in social memory processing. vCA1 projects not only to the prefrontal cortex, but also to other brain regions, including the NAc and amygdala, via its collaterals30,48. Indeed, vCA1 to NAcSh projections were found to store social memories in mice14. Interestingly, we found that vCA1 projections to the NAcSh also play a role in social memory consolidation (Fig. 5, Supplementarys Figs. 16, 17). Silencing vCA1→NAcSh neurons during consolidation disrupted memory of newly familiarized conspecifics (Supplementary Fig. 17b), like vCA1→IL inactivation (Fig. 5g). Notably, vCA1→NAcSh inactivation during the encoding phase reduced social discrimination the following day, potentially due to the reduction in social interaction times with novel conspecifics as recently reported (Supplementary Fig. 17c)31. Inactivation of vCA1→IL neurons during encoding did not, however, affect social recognition (Fig. 5g), highlighting the distinct functional contributions of these pathways. Despite these collateral projections, there may be functional distinctions between these two circuits. The vCA1→NAcSh pathway may be more critical for regulating approach decisions during motivational conflicts31, whereas vCA1→IL projections may be more specialized for modulating context-dependent affective memory48. Understanding these differential roles will be crucial for clarifying hippocampal-cortical mechanisms underlying social memory. This multi-system organization likely enhances efficiency in processing social interactions, allowing the brain to navigate complex social dynamics without overloading any single region. Future studies employing computational modeling and electrophysiological recordings will clarify how these regions interact to encode familiarity.

Changes in vCA1 neuronal ensembles supporting social memory have been reported in mouse models of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)49,50. Previously, we demonstrated that chronic social isolation during the juvenile period produces impaired social recognition in mice accompanied by a selective reduction in the excitability of IL→NAcSh neurons26. This, in combination with our current results, hints that an examination of the dynamics of neural representations of IL→NAcSh neurons in ASD mouse models may provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying social recognition deficits in ASD.

Male C57BL/6NCrljOri mice were purchased from Orient Bio at PND (postnatal day) 35 and introduced to the animal facility at Seoul National University College of Medicine. Four male mice were allocated into each standard mouse cage. The mice were habituated in the animal facility, with some subjected to surgical procedures at PND 42, depending on experimental need.

B6.Cg-Igs7tm148.1(tetO-GCaMP6f,CAG-tTA2)Hze/J(Ai148D) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (USA, Strain #:030328) and were bred in the specific-pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility at Seoul National University College of Medicine. Homozygous mutant males were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NSNU females. Their heterozygous offspring were weaned at PND 21 before being used in experiments. Four or five mice from the same parents were allocated into a standard mouse cage and raised until PND 42. Wild-type Ai148 mice were used for miniscope recordings with chemogenetic manipulation. Mice were randomly assigned to receive viral vectors or chemical injections (DREADD agonist or vehicle).

All mice were kept under a fixed 12-h light and dark cycle (lights on: 8:00 am–8:00 pm; lights off: 8:00 pm–8:00 am the next day), while food and water were provided ad libitum. Experiments were conducted in accordance with the regulations of Seoul National University, College of Medicine, Department of Physiology and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seoul National University (IACUC #: SNU-240103-10-1).

Subject mice were anesthetized with a mixture of Zoletil (30 mg/kg) and Rompun (10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a volume that varied by subject mouse body weight. The skin above the mouse skull was gently rubbed with 70% (v/v) ethanol to sanitize it and the fur on the corresponding area was thoroughly shaved. Then, the anesthetized mouse was put into a rodent stereotaxic apparatus. The designated region of the mouse skull was drilled with a stereotaxically-fixed hand drill assembled with a 0.3-mm drill bit, and then virus was injected bilaterally.

The infralimbic cortex (AP +2.4 mm from bregma, ML ±1.0 mm from midline, DV −2.3 mm from skull; 10° angled injection to prevent virus expression in the prelimbic cortex), shell region of nucleus accumbens (AP +1.94 mm from bregma, ML ±0.55 mm from midline, DV −4.15 mm from skull), and CA1 region of ventral hippocampus (AP −3.3 mm from bregma, ML ±3.1 mm from midline, DV −3.9 mm from skull) were targeted for virus injection. For the virus injections, glass capillaries (#504949, WPI, USA) were pulled to the appropriate diameter with a Dual-Stage Glass Micropipette Puller (NARISHIGE, USA) and filled with mineral oil (M5904, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Virus was then added to the front side of each glass capillary. All viruses were purchased from Addgene (USA) except AAV8-fosCreERT2-PEST (Stanford GVVC, USA).

For GCaMP6f expression in Ai148 mice, AAVrg-Ef1a-mCherry-IRES-Cre was injected at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (250 nL) into the NAcSh. For TRAP labeling, AAV8-fosCreERT2-PEST was injected at 1 × 1013 GC/mL (200 nL) into the IL and AAVrg-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry or AAVrg-DIO-mCherry (for control) was injected at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL) into the NAcSh. For optogenetics, AAV5-hsyn-NpHR3.0-YFP or AAV5-hsyn-eYFP (for control) was injected into the IL or vCA1 at 2.5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL). For chemogenetic manipulation, AAVPHP.eB-hsyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry or AAV8-hsyn-DIO-mCherry (for control) at 5 × 1012 GC/mL was injected into the IL (200 nL) or vCA1 (300 nL) and AAVrg-Ef1a-eGFP-IRES-Cre was injected at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL) into the NAcSh or the IL. For the collateral tracing experiments, AAV8-DIO-synaptophysin-mRuby at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL) was injected into vCA1 and the same titer and volume of AAVrg-hsyn-HI-eGFP-Cre was injected into either the IL or the NAcSh. For the vCA1-IL-NAcSh connectivity tracing experiments, AAV1-Cre at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (300 nL) was injected into vCA1, a mixture of AAV2-DIO-YFP at 1 × 1013 GC/mL (100 nL) and AAV8-fDIO-mCherry at 1 × 1013 GC/mL (100 nL) was injected into IL, and AAVrg-Flp at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL) was injected into the NAcSh. For the miniscope recordings during vCA1 chemogenetic inactivation, wild-type Ai148 mice were injected with 250 nL of a 1:1 mixture of AAVrg-Ef1a-Flpo and AAV2-flex-GCaMP6f at 5 × 1012 GC/mL into the IL. AAVrg-Ef1a-Cre was injected at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (200 nL) into the NAcSh and AAV8-hsyn-fDIO-hM4Di-mCherry or AAV8-hsyn-fDIO-mCherry (for control) was injected at 5 × 1012 GC/mL (300 nL) into vCA1. The virus was diluted with filtered ACSF to the desired titer before use. The virus was delivered to the target region of interest at a rate of 20–30 nL/min. After virus injection, the glass capillary was kept still within the brain for at least 5 min before being slowly withdrawn. The incised skin was then sutured with sterilized suture thread and treated with additional Betadine to prevent infection. The mice were then placed on a heating pad until the anesthesia wore off and returned to their home cages for further rest.

To observe neural activity from the pyramidal layer of the IL cortex while preventing damage to the prelimbic cortex, a GRIN lens with a 1 mm diameter and 4 mm length (Inscopix, USA) was attached to a 1 mm right-angle prism with an aluminum coat (#86-621, Edmund optics, USA) using a droplet of optical adhesive (NOA65, Edmund optics, USA). The assembly was UV-cured for at least 10 min and then immersed in 70% ethanol to sterilize it before use.

Two weeks after virus injection, the injected mice were subjected to an additional stereotaxic surgery to prepare them for Ca2+ imaging. First, a sterilized steel screw with a 3 mm diameter was fastened to the skull prior to the craniotomy. To implant the GRIN lens, a 1.3 mm × 1.3 mm rectangular craniotomy was made above the IL viral injection site. The cortical tissue adjacent to the IL was carefully aspirated using a 28-gauge blunt needle. Cold saline was constantly applied during cortical aspiration to prevent tissue desiccation and further cell death. After aspiration of 1.5 mm of cortical tissue, a custom 1.2 mm laser-cut disposable blade was inserted into the cortex, adjacent to the IL, to create an additional 1 mm sheath for the integrated GRIN lens. After inserting the laser blade and gently moving it away from the midline, cold saline was applied to irrigate any excess bleeding. Once bleeding stopped, the integrated GRIN lens was quickly inserted to a depth of 2.5 mm. Following lens implantation, tissue adhesive (3M Vetbond) was applied to the junction between the GRIN lens and the skull, and dental cement (SUN MEDICAL, Japan) was applied in an appropriate amount to secure the lens and cover the exposed skull. After allowing at least 15 min for the dental cement to harden, a baseplate for miniscope recording was placed on top of the GRIN lens and cemented into position. A plastic dummy cap was then locked onto the baseplate to prevent photobleaching and lens damage. Dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) was administered during surgery and for a week post-surgery.

Electrophysiological recordings were performed as described previously26. Coronal slices of the mPFC (300 μm thick) were obtained by a vibratome (VT1200s, Leica) after isoflurane anesthesia and decapitation. Slices were cut in ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 93 N-Methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG), 2.5 KCl, 10 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 10 HEPES, 5 Na ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na pyruvate, 12 L- acetyl - cysteine, perfused with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The slices immediately transferred to the same cutting solution at 32 °C for 10 min, and then transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at room temperature containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, perfused with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. For vCA1 slices (300 μm thick), ice0cold sucrose-CSF solution containing (in mM): Sucrose 230, NaCl 1.3, KCl 2.5, CaCl2 0.5, MgSO4∙7H2O 5, NaH2PO4 1.25, glucose 10, NaHCO3 25, perfused with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, was used as cutting solution before transferred to ACSF. Slices were recovered in ACSF for 1 h before the experiment. All recordings were done within 5 h from recovery. Brain slices were placed in a submerged chamber and perfused with ACSF for at least 10 min before recording. All recordings were made at 32 °C. We used recording pipettes (4–5 MΩ) filled with (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 5 Mg ATP, 0.4 Na3GTP and 10 Tris(di) phosphocreatine (pH 7.20 adjusted by KOH). Data were acquired using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik) and PatchMaster software (HEKA Elektronik) with a 20 kHz sampling rate, and the signals were filtered at 2 kHz. Synaptic current data were analyzed using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft). Excitability data were analyzed by customized LabView (National Instruments) analysis programs (https://github.com/parkgilbong/Minhee_Analysis_Pack).

For opto-EPSC recording, a terminal of optic fiber shining 10 mW 473nm-light was attached to a headstage connected to an optopatcher (A-M Systems, US), while a terminal of optic fiber shining 10 mW 594nm-light was held by 3-axis manipulator on the other side. Both lasers were connected to D/A outputs of EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier for TTL. To validate the effect of DREADD agonists in hM4Di-expressing neurons, CNO or DCZ was diluted into the final concentration as 10 µM or 5 µM. While generating 10 action potentials with specific step current injection while whole cell recording of a fluorescent-expressing neuron (either hM4Di or control mCherry), CNO or DCZ was given to the slice to observe any change in its APs.

To induce local chemogenetic or optogenetic inactivation of neural terminals, the mice were subjected two weeks after virus injection to an additional stereotaxic surgery for target site implantation of either a drug cannula or an optic cannula. In brief, a 3 mm diameter sterilized steel screw was fastened to the skull to prevent movement artifacts. The designated region of the mouse skull was then drilled bilaterally using a stereotaxically fixed hand drill with a 0.5 mm drill bit. Either a guide cannula (#62003, RWD, USA) for micro-infusion or an optic cannula (#R-FOC-L200C-39NA, RWD, China) for local optogenetic silencing were slowly implanted at the target site using a 3D-printed cannula holder. For the micro-infusion in NAc, double guide cannula (#62025, RWD) was implanted at the designated site. After the implantation, tissue adhesive was applied to the gap between the bottom of the cannula and the skull, ensuring it did not spread to other skull holes. After waiting for 5 min to allow the adhesive to fully dry, the cannula was gently detached from the cannula holder. The other cannula was implanted in the remaining hole with a similar slow approach, and tissue adhesive was applied before the cannula holder was removed.

After cannula implantation, dental cement was applied in an appropriate amount to secure the cannula in the desired location and to cover the exposed skull. Once the dental cement had fully dried, a sterilized plastic dummy cap (#62102 or #62125, RWD) was inserted and tightly joined with each guide cannula to prevent any clogging of the guide cannula pathway during recovery for the micro-infusion. Dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) was administered during surgery and for three consecutive days post-surgery. Constant monitoring during recovery was necessary because mice tend to nibble on and remove the dummy cap. Dummy caps that were damaged or removed were replaced with new sterilized caps.

Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) dihydrochloride (#HB6149, Hellobio, UK) or deschloroclozapine (DCZ) dihydrochloride (#HB9126) were used to activate Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). CNO or DCZ was dissolved in 0.9% normal saline to yield a stock concentration of 4 mg/mL and stored in a −20 °C freezer for up to 6 months. For i.p. injection, CNO was diluted with 0.9% normal saline to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/mL and injected into subject mice at 3 mg/kg body concentration. DCZ was diluted into same final concentration with same solvent while injected into subject mice at 1 mg/kg body concentration. The same volume of saline was injected into controls. Behavioral assessments began 40 min after drug injection.

For local administration, after the subject mouse was isolated in a cage with clean bedding, 500 nL of 1 mM diluted CNO solution was infused per site over 5 min using a syringe pump (Pump11, Harvard Apparatus, USA) mounted on a 10 µL syringe (#701, Hamilton, USA). This allowed the mouse to move freely during the infusion. Then, the infusion cannula (#62203, RWD, USA) was gently removed, and the original dummy cap was tightly secured 3 min after the end of the micro-infusion to prevent drug reflux. The subject mouse was then returned to its home cage. To prevent any side effects from drug hydrolysis, at least a two-day interval was given between treatments with counterbalanced drugs.

We employed viral-mediated Targeted Recombination in Active Population (TRAP) technology to specifically tag neurons activated during interactions with a particular social target. Experiments were carried out according to published protocols28. For TRAP tagging, subject mice were habituated to home cage isolation for 1 h each day for 5 days. On day 6, each subject mouse was isolated, and then a perforated acrylic box containing a novel social target was introduced to allow the subject to investigate the novel conspecific for 30 min. After 30 min, the target mice were returned to their home cages, while the subject mice remained isolated for an additional 30-min post learning session before being returned to their home cages.

On the day of the experiment, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; #H6278, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was dissolved at 2 mg/ml with 2% tween-80 (#P1754, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 5% DMSO (#D2650, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in 0.9% normal saline. The subject mouse was isolated for 30 min prior to social investigation. As on previous days, the same social target was introduced, this time without the perforated chamber. During the subsequent 10-min investigation period, subject mice that exhibited excessive aggression towards the social target were excluded from further experiments. After the 10-min investigation period, the target conspecific was removed from the cage, while the subject mouse remained for an additional hour. Following this, the subject mouse was injected with the prepared 4-OHT (body concentration: 10 mg/kg) via i.p. injection to tag neurons that had been activated during the social interaction. Two hours after the 4-OHT injection, the subject mice were returned to their home cages. Behavior assessments to induce the expression of the Fos-dependent hM4Di designer protein began one week after the TRAP tagging procedure.

All behavior tests described below were performed in a soundproof chamber with dim light illumination during the light-on cycle. The order of subject mice for the behavior tests was randomized and the order of target mice was also randomized. All behavior tests were recorded via camcorder while the experimenters were blinded to the experimental conditions. Both the subject and target mice were habituated to handling prior to any behavior test. For the optogenetic inactivation of IL→NAcSh neurons or vCA1→IL neurons, the bilaterally-implanted optic fibers located above either the NAcSh or IL were connected to a laser (594 nm wavelength at 6 mW) with mating sleeves. The same experiment was repeated to assess the effect of inactivating the target circuit during the whole or only part of the behavior paradigm, as well as any effect of the laser treatment itself. The laser was administered to the subject mice in a randomly counterbalanced manner. For the social familiarization/recognition task, the same mice were used to observe the effect of neural inactivation during the social familiarization or recognition session, except for an additional batch subjected to vCA1→IL inactivation during the social recognition task (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 7c). For Ca2+ imaging, each subject mouse was fully habituated to handling and miniscope application for at least a week prior to the actual experiment. A custom LabVIEW program was used to synchronize mouse behavior (as monitored by a Basler camera) with Ca2+ activity, while using an active commutator to prevent any tension on the miniscope coaxial cable. Mouse behavior was manually analyzed by an experienced blind experimenter.

The social familiarization/recognition task was conducted over two days to examine the functional role of specific neural circuits during different stages of memory consolidation. During the social behavior test, mice were handled gently to minimize anxiety. Instead of being held by their tails, they were transferred by hand to reduce stress between test sessions.

At least two days before the task, littermates or conspecifics (6–8 weeks C57BL/6N mice with more than 10% less weight than subject mice) designated as target mice were habituated to the perforated acrylic target chamber (10 × 10 cm) for 10 min, twice per day, with a 3-h interval. This habituation period reduced unwilling anxiety of target mice.

On the test day, the subject mouse was isolated in a cage with fresh bedding for 5 min before testing. At the start of the task, the subject mouse was placed in a white opaque acrylic chamber (10 × 60 cm) for free exploration39. After a 5-min habituation period, a target mouse was introduced into the target chamber on a randomly determined side to prevent location bias. The chamber was covered with a transparent perforated lid to prevent any chance of distraction or escape. The subject and target mice interacted for 5 min before being returned to their isolation cages for a short rest. This interaction cycle was repeated twice more, with the target chamber position switched randomly each time. After three interaction sessions, the subject and target mice were returned to their original cages. After 24 h, the subject mouse underwent a social recognition test in the same linear chamber. In this test, the subject mouse was exposed to a familiar conspecific, a novel conspecific, or a littermate in a randomized order, with two 5-min intervals between sessions.

Depending on the study requirements, some subject mice were equipped with an integrated GRIN lens to monitor IL→NAcSh neuron activity using an open-source miniscope (UCLA Miniscope V4, Open Ephys, USA). If necessary, these subject mice were familiarized with two novel social targets during the social familiarization session and then allowed to interact with two familiar conspecifics, two novel conspecifics, or two littermates during the social recognition session. In addition, a DREADD agonist was administered to some mice via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or an infusion cannula implanted in the skull.

The same behavior chamber from the social familiarization/recognition task was used to carry out the consecutive littermate recognition task. At least two days prior to the behavior tests, littermates to be used as target mice were placed inside a perforated chamber within the interaction chamber so they could be habituated to the interaction chamber while the subject mouse watched. On the test day, the subject mouse was isolated in a cage with fresh bedding until the behavior task. The subject was placed in the behavior chamber and allowed to freely explore. For the familiarization session, two of the subject mouse's littermates were isolated as target mice in separate cages with fresh bedding prior to the behavior task. After 5 min of familiarization, one of the target mice was placed in the perforated acrylic chamber on either the left or the right side. After 5 min of interaction, the subject and target mice were returned to their respective isolation cages to rest. Then, the subject mouse was moved back to the linear chamber with a different target mouse in the opposite perforated chamber for a second interaction. This cycle of the subject mouse interacting with its littermates was repeated (two more littermate interactions) with a different position in the linear track compared to the initial session. After these social interactions, both the subject and target mice were returned to their original cages.

The consecutive novel mouse interaction task was carried out like the consecutive littermate recognition task except for using two novel conspecifics as target mice.

A subject mouse was placed in the center of a white opaque acrylic cylinder with a 20 cm diameter and allowed to move freely for 5 min. This was then followed by an additional 5 min of exposure to yellow light. The order of these yellow-light and no-light sessions were randomly switched to avoid artifacts.

A subject mouse was placed in the center of a white opaque acrylic box (33 × 33 cm) and allowed to move freely for 10 min. During this period of exploration, the location of the subject mouse was tracked live. When the subject mouse entered a randomly determined quadrant of the behavior chamber, the live-monitoring system sent an external TTL signal that activated a 594 nm yellow laser (ADR-800A, Shanghai Laser and Optics Century, China) attached to an optical stimulation cannula. This caused the targeted brain area to receive a 10 mW pulse of 594 nm yellow light when the subject mouse entered the intended quadrant area.

The training and test sessions for the novel object recognition test were conducted on the same day. A subject mouse was placed in the center of a white opaque acrylic box (33 × 33 cm) to move freely for 10 min of familiarization. After the familiarization session, two identical objects were placed in the behavior chamber, and the subject mouse was allowed to investigate them for the duration of a 10-min training session. After the training session, the subject mouse was removed from the behavior chamber, and one of the objects was randomly replaced with a novel object. To avoid providing any scent cues, the remaining original object placed inside the test area was wiped with 70% ethanol. Immediately after object replacement, the subject mouse was reintroduced to the behavior chamber and allowed to explore for 10 min. To investigate the effect of chemogenetic inactivation, each subject mouse underwent the novel object recognition test twice with two different pairs of objects.

After the behavior experiments, the brain of each subject mouse was extracted following transcardial perfusion with cold PBS and then a 4% PFA solution (T&I, Korea). The perfused brains were immersed in 4% PFA and stored at 4 °C for 24 h. Then, the fixed brains were immersed in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution for 48 h at 4 °C. The brains were then frozen at −20 °C in frozen section compound (#FSC22, Leica, Germany), cut into 30-μm sections, and stored in cryopreservation solution until the next usage. To stain for cFos, brain slices were incubated for 40 min in a blocking solution containing 4% (v/v) goat serum, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and PBS. The brain slices were then incubated in primary antibody (#2250, Cell signaling Technology, USA) diluted in blocking solution at 4 °C and gently shaken at 30 RPM for the next 48 h. After that, the brain slices were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody (#A-21206, Invitrogen, USA) diluted in blocking solution at room temperature for 4 h and then washed with PBS. A solution of 0.01% (v/v) DAPI (#62247, Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for counterstaining. Fluorescent images were obtained using an Axio Scan Z1 (Zeiss, Germany), and fluorescently labeled cells were counted manually by an experimenter blind to mouse identity. If necessary, fluorescence was measured with the software Zen (Zeiss, Germany).

After obtaining Ca2+ imaging video at 20–30 FPS from the open-source miniscope during rodent behavior, the videos were concatenated and converted to a TIFF format with the Image J software package. A custom-modified Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for micro-Endoscopic data (CNMF-e) was used to extract the fluorescence signals from individual regions of interests (ROIs). For each trial with a subject mouse, Ca2+ transients from the custom-modified CNMF-e were used to analyze neuronal activity with further processing. Cell activities from multiple days were registered, showing more than 80% ROI preservation without discernible GCaMP expression artifacts (Supplementarys Figs. 4c–f, 7a–d, 20a–d). Ca2+ transients from each subject mouse were synchronized with the behavior data obtained via manual scoring. The behavior data were classified with binary labels of either 0 or 1, with 0 indicating no interaction and 1 indicating social interaction. The 11 Ai148 mice in Fig. 2 exhibited 558 social cells out of a total of 1181 detected cells. In Fig. 6, the 8 mCherry-expressing mice exhibited 454 social cells out of a total of 1038 detected cells, and the 9 hM4Di-expressing mice exhibited 361 social cells out of a total of 862 detected cells.

To identify whether an individual IL→NAcSh neuron is socially responsive, all Ca2+ traces were z-scored and a binary event vector was generated based on the presence (1) or absence (0) of social stimuli. The activity of each neuron based on the range of binary social stimulus thresholds was calculated for an ROC analysis51. By applying a binary threshold to the Ca2+ signal and comparing it to a binary event vector representing behavioral bouts, the detection of behavioral events based on neural activity can be summarized in a true positive rate (TRP) and a false positive rate (FPR) for individual neurons. ROC curves were then drawn based on the TRP against the FPR over the binary threshold range17. The area under each neuron's ROC curve (auROC) was compared to 1000 auROCs obtained from randomly circular permuted Ca2+ signals of the same cell. Neurons were considered responsive “social cells” if their auROC values fell above the 95th percentile of the random distribution. The identities of these social cells were recorded and compared among different interaction sessions to define the overlapping social cell population of the behavioral paradigm.

To examine the effect of familiarization, the interaction-dependent Ca2+ AUCs of social cells responding to familiar mice were obtained during social familiarization (FN, FN', and FN”) and recognition (F) tasks. To determine whether the reactivity of these social cells depended on familiarity, the interaction-dependent Ca2+ AUCs were calculated individually for social cells responding to familiar conspecifics (F), novel conspecifics (N), or littermates (L) during interactions with their corresponding social targets.

The population activity decoding analysis was performed with reference to a published method8,24. A linear classifier based on a support vector machine (SVM) was used with custom MATLAB and Python scripts based on the scikit-learn SVC package for cluster visualization52.

First, the interaction times for different sessions were examined to balance the amount of Ca2+ transient data between trials. For example, if the interaction time with conspecific A lasted 30 s and the interaction time with conspecific B lasted 60 s, we used only the first 30 s worth of data from the interaction with conspecific B so that the duration would match that of the interaction with conspecific A.

We applied data expansion using pseudo-populations from the neural activity data8. By removing temporal dependencies and reducing potential cell-to-cell interaction correlations (e.g., those arising from gap junctions), this approach allowed us to focus on the relationship between social stimuli and their corresponding neural responses instead of on time-based dynamics. This is because it minimized potentially confounding session-to-session variations. Second, the neural activity recordings made during social interactions contained both stimulus-evoked responses and noise53. Assuming the noise had a mean of zero, we used random selection-based data expansion to reduce noise correlations within each session. This step ensured the noise did not artificially inflate correlations, improving the reliability of the decoding analysis54,55.

For pseudo-trials, Ca2+ transient data from the total population responding to social interaction bouts were used and divided into 200-ms time bins. Mean event activity was calculated by averaging all Ca2+ transients within each bin. 75% of the pseudo-trial data were used to train the classifier and the remaining 25% were used to test the trained classifier and assess decoding performance for each subject. Pseudo-population activity vectors were obtained from both the training and testing datasets. q randomly sampled population vectors (where q = 5 unless otherwise noted) from all neurons in the training dataset for each subject were concatenated into a single qn-long vector, where n is the total number of recorded neurons for each subject. The same procedure was repeated to construct a training dataset of pseudo-population activity vectors. For a meaningful comparison of decoding results across experiments, only subject mice that spent more than 3 s exploring in each session were included in the decoding analysis8.

To assess the statistical significance of the decoding performance, a null model was constructed in which the binary labels (0 or 1 as described above) for the pseudo-trials were randomly shuffled. The same procedures were repeated for each decoder to obtain the decoding performance with the null model.

Dimensionality was reduced to three dimensions to visualize the population vectors in 3D space as a means of improving reader comprehension of the functional representation of IL→NAcSh neurons. To visualize the pseudo-population activity vectors in a reduced-dimensional space, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the training and testing datasets. Then, the resulting dimensional reduction was projected in a 3-dimensional space.

For each trial, the mean of each cluster sample (\(x\)) as the position of the corresponding centroid (\({C}_{t}\)) was defined via the following expression:

with t as the trial and S as the number of samples in the reduced dataset.

The mean distance from all samples to the centroid of each cluster was defined as the radius (\({R}_{t}\)) of the corresponding cluster and calculated via the following expression:

in which \({||}{{{\rm{x}}}}_{{{\rm{i}}}}-{{{\rm{C}}}}_{{{\rm{t}}}}{||}\) represents the Euclidean distance from the centroid to the samples.

CCGP was computed as described8,24. To make training and testing datasets, pseudo-population activity vectors for each trial were constructed to extract features as described above. To carry out CCGP, the features extracted from the experimental datasets were grouped into pairs for the training and testing datasets. Each training and testing dataset contained binary labels (0 or 1) corresponding to the decoding trial conditions (identity or position). Then, CCGP was calculated by averaging the decoding performances from e epochs (where e = 5 unless otherwise noted) with two randomly extracted pairs from the training and testing datasets. For the CCGP analyses (except the one assessing cross-position), the training and testing datasets were reversed, and the decoding performance was averaged. For example, identity CCGP for littermates was measured by training a linear classifier to decode the identity of two littermates on the left side (L1left and L2left) and tested on data from littermates on right side (L1right and L2right). The process was repeated by training the classifier with data from the littermates on the right side and testing it on data from the left side, with the decoding performances averaged together. The CCGP analysis for cross-familiarity was performed based on the target conspecific's orientation. For example, CCGP was measured by training a linear classifier to decode the identity of two conspecifics on the left side (L1left and N2left) and then tested on data from different conspecifics on the right side (F2right and N1right). In addition, the decoding performance of the linear classifier was tested by training it on two conspecifics on the right side (L2right and N1right) and testing it on data from the left side (F1left and N2left). The two resulting CCGP performances were then averaged. For the cross-position analysis, CCGP was measured by training a linear classifier to decode the position of two known conspecifics (F1left and L2right) and then tested on data from two novel conspecifics (N1left and N2right).

To assess the effect of experimental manipulation, 2–3 independent batches of experiments using 8–10 mice per group were performed. Our chosen sample size as based on standard practice in similar behavioral/neuroscience studies14,21, which typically use sample sizes within this range to achieve reliable and reproducible results while minimizing animal use.

Mouse behavior and Ca2+ data were assessed via paired t-tests, one-sample t-tests, one-way and two-way repeated-measure analyses of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate and followed by the appropriate post-hoc adjustments for multiple comparisons. When analyzing the data via ANOVA, we applied the Greenhouse-Geisser correction for cases in which the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon value fell below 0.75. Statistical analysis was carried with Prism 9 (Graphpad Software Inc, USA). Detailed descriptions and results of the statistical analyses are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Mildly Menacing Mating Calls Lead to Discovery of New Gecko Species

Scientists found new gecko species hidden in plain sight in pristine deserts of southern Africa, thanks to their loud, barking mating calls

On a cool, starry night six years ago, a young scientist crept barefoot across dunes in the Namib Desert in southern Africa. With his pants slung over one arm and his flashlight sweeping the sand, the researcher, François Becker, was hunting—not for the black rhinos, elephants, ostriches or hyenas that make their homes there but for an elusive creature called the barking gecko. These ultra-shy lizards are only about the size of a stick of string cheese, but they possess powerful vocal cords to sing their nightly love songs. These tunes would eventually lead Becker to a startling discovery about the species that make them.

Males issue the calls, which sound like a cartoon villain's evil laugh, from the entrance of their burrows to attract mates (and sometimes frighten tourists, who can be surprised that such small creatures can make such a loud noise). But because the animals' calls vary slightly in pitch and frequency, they also intrigued Becker, who was doing research at Gobabeb Namib Research Institute. He was curious to find out why the mating calls sounded so different in two nearby areas that were thought to be home to a single species, Ptenopus garrulus.

Becker had previously worked with frogs and knew that different species have unique mating calls to prevent interbreeding. “So when I heard those call differences, I was immediately like, ‘Okay, there's something happening here,'” he says.

During that night on the dunes, and others like it since then, Becker would sneak up on the geckos—lizards in the suborder Gekkota, which includes the only lizards with true vocal cords—partially clothed so that the swish of his pants wouldn't scare them away. He collected specimens from the Namib Sand Sea in western-central Namibia, where he heard one type of call, and from the nearby gravel plains found on the opposite side of the Kuiseb River, where he heard another.

He sent DNA samples from the geckos out for genetic sequencing. When they didn't match, he realized they were from distinct species (Ptenopus maculatus and Ptenopus circumsyrticus). He spent several years scooping up even more geckos from other areas of varied terrain in the Namib and Kalahari deserts, working under the hypothesis that separate species might prefer different soils for their burrows.

A male gecko (P maculatus) calls from the entrance of his burrow.

This month Becker—now the chief curator of natural science at the National Museum of Namibia—published a paper in Vertebrate Zoology that revealed that the three species of barking geckos known to inhabit southern Africa are actually nine species. “Some of these species that were previously put together as one species are actually separated by 25 million years of evolution,” Becker says.

But it's little wonder that these lizards hid under the same species name for so long. Barking geckos leave their burrows so rarely that even farmers who have heard the creatures on their land for decades likely have never seen one. The geckos look so similar that the fleeting glimpses scientists usually get of them are insufficient to tell them apart. Some of them look almost identical, like vermillion-speckled twins.

That's why zoologists have shifted away from identifying species based mainly on physical traits and toward using what is called integrative taxonomy, where several pieces of evidence are used to decide on classifying new species, says Aaron Bauer, a gecko expert at Villanova University, who was not involved in the research but was a reviewer for the paper and an examiner on Becker's Ph.D. committee. “This paper is an excellent example of this, with morphology, color, calls and DNA sequence data all being used to support the authors' decisions,” Bauer says.

Now that the geckos are properly classified, scientists can more accurately assess their distribution patterns, habitat preferences and physical traits. “Anything we do in biology requires that we understand what species we are talking about,” Bauer says. “We would come to the wrong conclusions if we lumped two or more species under one name.”

Becker and other scientists are keen to ensure barking geckos continue to thrive. “They're weird and very cute, just an adorable and quite interesting little group,” he says. “I think they deserve a bit of extra attention.

Lack of reliable diagnostics for the presence, type and severity of infection in patients presenting to emergency departments with non-specific symptoms poses considerable challenges. We developed TriVerity, which uses isothermal amplification of 29 mRNAs and machine learning algorithms on the Myrna instrument to determine likelihoods of bacterial infection, viral infection and need for critical care interventions within 7 days. To validate TriVerity, the SEPSIS-SHIELD study enrolled 1,222 patients with clinically adjudicated infection status and need for critical care intervention within 7 days as endpoints. The TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores had higher accuracy than C-reactive protein, procalcitonin or white blood cell count for the diagnosis of bacterial infection with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.83, and viral infection (AUROC = 0.91). The TriVerity Severity score had an AUROC of 0.78 for predicting illness severity and allowed reclassification of risk for critical care interventions compared to clinical assessment (quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) alone. Each of the three scores had rule-in specificity >92% and rule-out sensitivity >95%. Comparison of antibiotics administration at presentation with post-follow-up adjudication found that TriVerity could potentially reduce false positives and false negatives for inappropriate antibiotics use by 60–70%. Further clinical testing in an interventional setting is needed to prove actionability and clinical benefit of TriVerity.

Sepsis, an often fast-progressing and potentially fatal condition, is defined as a life-threatening acute organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection1. Sepsis requires rapid administration of antimicrobials and fluids2,3 because the risk of death from sepsis continues to be high4,5. Sepsis is often subtle and difficult to detect, and the diagnosis is frequently missed, with potentially deadly consequences. As a result of difficult diagnosis and an imperative for early treatment, many patients with suspected sepsis who have alternative diagnoses are overtreated with antibiotics and hospitalization, which is costly, potentially harmful and contributes to antibiotic resistance. The need to determine whether a patient with suspected sepsis should be treated with anti-infective therapy (for example, antimicrobials and/or surgical source control) or not, and whether they should be hospitalized or not, underscore the need to assess a patient with suspected infection along two ‘axes': infection presence and severity6,7.

There are currently no tests used in clinical practice that rapidly and reliably determine the presence and severity of infection6,8. Protein-based biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, or direct pathogen detection tests can assist in the diagnosis of infection but often lack the accuracy and/or speed to allow identification of the presence of infection or to distinguish bacterial from viral etiology that is important for antibiotic decision-making at the time of presentation9,10. Patients with suspected infection (for example, belly pain) may in fact have a non-infectious cause of illness (pancreatitis); hence, a ‘sepsis' test should also be able to diagnose whether a patient is infected or not. Although early admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is imperative for patient survival advantages11, biomarkers (for example, lactate and cellular morphology tests) and clinical scores (for example, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA)) for estimating risk can be time-consuming to collect and have limited accuracy for predicting the likelihood of decompensation in broader populations12,13.

We developed the TriVerity test to address this unmet need by determining (1) the likelihood of a bacterial infection, (2) the likelihood of a viral infection and (3) all-cause risk of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and/or new renal replacement therapy (RRT) within 7 days (‘ICU-level care'). TriVerity assigns a sample into one of five interpretation bands ranging from Very Low to Very High for each of the three likelihood scores using machine learning algorithms applied to semiquantitative measurements of 29 host immune mRNAs, which were previously reported as associated with infection status, type and severity14,15,16,17. Testing takes approximately 30 minutes using the cartridge-based Myrna instrument, with an operator hands-on-time of under 1 minute. The scores each fall into one of five interpretation bands ranging from Very Low to Very High.

Here we report the results of the SEPSIS-SHIELD study conducted for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance (obtained 10 January 2025; K241676) across 22 emergency departments in the United States and Europe. Building on previous observational studies18,19,20,21, we prospectively recruited 1,441 patients with suspected acute infection or suspected sepsis and evaluated whether TriVerity can (1) diagnose bacterial infections versus viral infections versus non-infectious mimics and (2) predict need for ‘ICU-level care'. We compared the accuracy of TriVerity to established diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and performed a preliminary investigation of potential clinical utility for improving appropriate administration of antibiotics and prediction of sepsis.

Between March 2020 and May 2024, 1,441 adult patients with suspected acute infection or suspected sepsis and (1) at least one abnormal vital sign or (2) at least two vital sign changes with a blood culture order were enrolled from 22 emergency departments (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). After excluding screen failures and withdrawals, 1,222 patients had valid TriVerity results, and 729 of these were clinically adjudicated as consensus for the presence of a bacterial and/or viral infection (Yes or No adjudication status; Methods). We present these consensus-adjudicated patients as the main population (primary diagnostic endpoint); the secondary outcome of forced adjudication includes all 1,222 patients but with less certain adjudication status (Yes plus Probable and Unlikely plus No adjudications are grouped together; Methods). For the prognostic endpoint, 1,120 patients were evaluable (Fig. 1).

Overview of the study design and results for consensus clinical adjudication and clinical outcome.

Mean age, sex, race and ethnicity were representative of the US emergency department population (Extended Data Table 1). Among patients evaluable for the diagnostic endpoint, the mean age was 50.6 years, and 47.3% of the patients were female. Most patients were White (63.2%), followed by Black (30.6%) and Hispanic/Latino (13.3%). Similar percentages were observed among those evaluated for the prognostic endpoint (Extended Data Table 1). Metabolic/endocrinological, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases were the most prevalent medical conditions. There were no marked differences between patients evaluable for the diagnostic endpoint versus those evaluable for the prognostic endpoint. Overall, 132 patients (18.1%) evaluable for the diagnostic endpoint were immunosuppressed compared to 206 patients (18.4%) evaluable for the prognostic endpoint. Malignancies were the most frequently found type of immunosuppression (approximately 10% of patients), followed by solid organ transplantation, steroid treatment and HIV/AIDS (Extended Data Table 1).

The mean leukocyte counts in patients eligible for the diagnostic endpoint was 11.8 × 109 per liter, the mean neutrophil percentage was 76.9 and the mean lymphocyte percentage was 12.5; similar numbers were observed in patients eligible for the prognostic endpoint (Supplementary Table 2a). Mean concentrations of biomarkers (CRP, procalcitonin and lactate) are shown in Supplementary Table 2b.

Among 1,120 patients eligible for the prognostic endpoint, 24.3% were discharged to home, 55.8% were admitted to a regular ward and 13.8% were admitted to an ICU (Extended Data Table 2a). The mean length of hospital stay was 5 days and of ICU stay was 6.1 days; there was no significant difference in consensus-adjudicated patients. Out of the 1,120 patients, 122 (10.9%) met the primary severity endpoint, which included mechanical ventilation (n = 63, 51.6%), vasopressor use (n = 99, 81.2%) and/or RRT (n = 23, 18.9%) (Extended Data Table 2b). Among 147 patients who were transferred to the ICU, 98 (66.7%) received the ‘ICU-level care' interventions (composite primary severity endpoint). Extended Data Table 2b also shows differences in clinical outcomes stratified by clinically adjudicated infection status.

Out of 729 consensus-adjudicated patients for diagnostic endpoint, 448 (61.5%), 165 (22.6%) and 12 (1.6%) had bacterial, viral and bacterial–viral co-infection, respectively, whereas 104 (14.3%) were adjudicated to not have an infection (Table 1). Among 460 patients adjudicated to have bacterial infections, urinary tract infections (n = 142, 30.9%) and skin or soft tissue infections (n = 133, 28.9%) were most frequent, followed by bloodstream (n = 92, 20%), gastrointestinal tract (n = 69, 15%) and respiratory tract (n = 58, 12.6%) infections. Among 177 patients adjudicated to have viral infections, 169 (95.5%) had respiratory tract infections, followed by gastrointestinal tract infections (n = 4, 2.3%). Three parasitic infections were diagnosed (Giardia lamblia enterocolitis, n = 1; Trichomonas vaginalis vulvovaginitis, n = 2). The percentage of bacterial infections was relatively high (63.1%), driven by seasonal epidemiology and the broad inclusion criteria allowing for enrollment of patients with all types of suspected infections (not only respiratory infections). Infection status for the forced adjudication cohort is shown in Supplementary Table 3a.

TriVerity provides three scores: Bacterial, Viral and Severity. Each score ranges from 0 to 50 and is divided into five interpretation bands (Very Low (0–10), Low (11–20), Moderate (21–30), High (31–40) and Very High (41–50)) that reflect increasing likelihoods of the corresponding infection type or severity. The suggested clinical interpretation of the two highest bands (‘Very High' and ‘High') is ‘rule-in', whereas, for the two lowest bands (‘Very Low' and ‘Low'), it is ‘rule-out'. Accuracy of TriVerity scores was evaluated as compared to post hoc clinical adjudications (Methods and ref. 22). For each of the three scores, when considering them separately, 80–86% of the patients were assigned to one of the rule-in or rule-out bands. When considered together, almost all of TriVerity results (99.6% and 99.3% of patients in the consensus and forced adjudication cohort, respectively) fell into one of the four clinically actionable interpretation bands (that is, Very Low, Low, High and Very High) for at least one of the diagnostic and prognostic scores.

The Bacterial score had an AUROC of 0.83 (80% CI: 0.81–0.85) for detecting bacterial infections in the consensus population. Probability of bacterial infection, as measured by likelihood ratio, ranged over 100-fold and increased monotonically by interpretation band (likelihood ratios: Very Low, 0.08 (80% CI: 0.05–0.11); Low, 0.54 (0.45–0.63); Moderate, 1.14 (0.94–1.42); High, 2.50 (1.97–3.31); Very High, 8.04 (5.66–12.43) (Table 2). The Bacterial score had specificity of 95.5% and 90.7% for the Very High and High bands, respectively, and sensitivity of 97.2% and 81.5% for the Very Low and Low bands, respectively (Table 2). Notably, 81.3% of the patients with consensus adjudication (and 80.4% of those with forced adjudication) fell into one of the clinically actionable Very Low, Low, High and Very High interpretation bands for bacterial infection. At a prevalence of 63.1% for bacterial infections, the probability of having a bacterial infection for the Very High interpretation band was 93.2% and for Very Low was 12.1%. Using forced adjudication (entire population including ‘uncertain' adjudication—that is, probable and unlikely cases), the area under the curve (AUC) for the detection of bacterial infections was 0.76 (80% CI: 0.75–0.78) (Supplementary Table 3b); sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio for the accuracy of TriVerity Bacterial scores are shown in Extended Data Table 3a.

The Viral score had an AUROC of 0.91 (80% CI: 0.89–0.93) for the detection of viral infections. Likelihood of viral infection increased monotonically more than 400-fold by interpretation band (likelihood ratios: Very Low, 0.09 (80% CI: 0.05–0.14); Low, 0.32 (80% CI: 0.22–0.41); Moderate, 0.87 (80% CI: 0.64–1.13); High, 2.36 (80% CI: 1.68–3.25) and Very High, 40.93 (80% CI: 27.73–72.16)). The Viral score had specificity of 98.6% and 94.0% for the Very High and High bands, respectively, and sensitivity of 95.5% and 90% for the Very Low and Low bands, respectively (Table 2). Notably, 86.1% of patients with consensus adjudication (and 81.3% of those with forced adjudication) fell into the clinically actionable Very High, High, Low and Very Low bands. At a prevalence of 24.3% for viral infections, the probability of having a viral infection in the Very High band was 92.9% and for Very Low was 2.9%. In the forced adjudication, the Viral score had an AUROC of 0.83 (0.81–0.85) for the detection of viral infections; sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio for the accuracy of TriVerity Viral scores are shown in Extended Data Table 3b.

The accuracy of the Viral score was robust in patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 (Extended Data Table 4a), demonstrating its applicability and generalizability to emerging pathogens. Median Viral scores were highest in patients with infection from influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2; patients diagnosed with human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus had intermediate Viral scores, whereas those with adenovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus had the lowest Viral scores (Extended Data Table 4b).

Cross-classifications of both Bacterial and Viral scores for patients clinically adjudicated as bacterial infection, viral infection, co-infection and non-infected are shown in Supplementary Table 4a–d.

Overall, the Bacterial and Viral scores were strongly associated with increasing likelihoods of bacterial and viral infections, respectively. Notably, the Bacterial and Viral scores increased monotonically, and the 80% CIs for adjacent bands did not overlap in any of the analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).

The AUROC of the Bacterial score (0.83, 80% CI: 0.81–0.85) was significantly higher than those of commonly used biomarkers for the diagnosis of infections, including procalcitonin (AUROC = 0.71, 80% CI: 0.68–0.73), CRP (AUROC = 0.74, 80% CI: 0.72–0.77) and white blood cell (WBC) counts (0.76, 80% CI: 0.73–0.78) (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons; Extended Data Table 5a). Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the correlation of WBC, CRP and procalcitonin concentrations with TriVerity Bacterial interpretation bands; Extended Data Table 2d shows the AUROCs for these biomarkers in the forced adjudication cohort.

In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of TriVerity generalized across races better than other biomarkers. Specifically, although the overall AUROC for procalcitonin was 0.71 for diagnosis of bacterial infection, it was substantially lower in Blacks (AUROC = 0.66) and other races (AUROC = 0.62) compared to Whites (AUROC = 0.74), highlighting lower clinical utility of procalcitonin in non-White populations. By contrast, the Bacterial score's overall AUROC of 0.83 remained virtually identical in Whites (0.82) and Blacks (0.83) and was higher in other races (0.91) (Extended Data Table 5b).

Because TriVerity measures the host immune response to infection, we investigated whether the Bacterial and Viral scores maintained their diagnostic accuracy in immunocompromised patients, who also have an increased risk of infection. The AUROCs for TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores were not significantly different between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients (0.80, 80% CI: 0.75–0.85 versus 0.83, 80% CI: 0.81–0.85 for Bacterial scores; 0.89, 80% CI: 0.86–0.94 versus 0.91, 80% CI: 0.89– 0.94 for Viral scores) (Extended Data Table 6a,b). Lastly, when considering median Bacterial and Viral scores for specific anatomical sites of infection, patients adjudicated as positive for bacterial infection in the bloodstream had the highest median Bacterial score, followed by patients with bacterial infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts (Extended Data Table 7a,b). Only AUCs for the Bacterial scores in patients with bloodstream infections were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the overall bacterial AUCs.

The Severity score predicted the need for ‘ICU-level care', defined as an acute need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and/or RRT within 7 days, with an AUROC of 0.78 (80% CI: 0.75–0.81). Risk of requiring ICU-level care monotonically increased by interpretation band over 50-fold (likelihood ratios: Very Low, 0.22 (80% CI: 0.14–0.31); Low, 0.43 (80% CI: 0.30–0.57); Moderate, 1.63 (80% CI: 1.35–1.97; High, 2.41 (80% CI: 1.96–2.91); Very High, 11.33 (80% CI: 7.07–17.75)). The Severity score demonstrated specificity of 98.7% and 86.1% for the Very High and High bands, respectively, and sensitivity of 91.8% and 87.7% for the Very Low and Low bands, respectively (Table 3). Most patients (79.6%) were in the clinically actionable Very High, High, Low and Very Low interpretation bands. At a prevalence of 10.9%, the probability of requiring ICU-level care within 7 days was 58.1% for the Very High band and 2.7% for the Very Low band. Likelihood ratios of the Severity scores for the three different individual components of ‘ICU-level care' were similar to the overall likelihood ratios presented above (Extended Data Table 8). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis also found significantly increasing hazard ratios for the need of ‘ICU-level care' between days 0 and 7 from ‘Very Low' to ‘Very High' Severity bands (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Lactate, a mandated biomarker commonly used to estimated severity as part of the SEP-1 bundle, had an AUROC of 0.76 (80% CI: 0.73–0.80) for predicting the need for ICU-level care. In the same patients, the Severity score had an AUROC of 0.78 (80% CI: 0.75–0.80). Lactate higher than 4 mmol l−1 demonstrated specificity of 95.8%, similar to the Very High and High bands for TriVerity Severity score. By contrast, sensitivity in patients with lactate lower than 2 mmol l−1 was 66.7% (Extended Data Table 9a), which was substantially lower than the sensitivity for Very Low and Low bands for the Severity score (>87%). In total, 213 patients had indeterminate lactate concentrations (2–4 mmol l−1), of whom 58 needed ‘ICU-level care' or died (Extended Data Table 9b). Of these 58, TriVerity identified 46 (79.3%) as Moderate to Very High risk of severe illness, substantially reducing the uncertainty in identifying patients at higher risk of severe illness compared to lactate (Extended Data Table 9b). Hence, despite similar AUROCs, TriVerity demonstrated significantly lower false-negative and higher true-positive rates in patients with indeterminate lactate concentrations.

The severity of a patient's clinical condition at the time of presentation in the emergency department can be assessed using clinical scores, such as the qSOFA score. We investigated whether integrating qSOFA with the TriVerity Severity score would further improve the accuracy of predicting ‘ICU-level care'. We determined pre-test and post-test probabilities of sequential qSOFA plus Severity scores (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5). ICU-level care requirement among patients with low-risk qSOFA scores (0–1) was 7.7% and for those with high-risk qSOFA scores (2–3) was 46.3% (Fig. 2). However, stratifying patients by TriVerity Severity score interpretation bands markedly increased predictive accuracy in both the low and high clinical risk patients. For instance, a patient with qSOFA 0–1 (7.7% risk overall) would increase to a 52% risk with a ‘Very High' TriVerity Severity score, whereas a patient with qSOFA 2–3 (46% risk overall) would decrease to a 18–25% risk with a ‘Low' or ‘Very Low' Severity score. The overall sensitivity of predicting ‘ICU-level care' using qSOFA scores alone was 33.93%. When we combined qSOFA with the Severity score, the sensitivity increased significantly to 84.82% (P < 0.05).

a, Patients with low qSOFA risk (scores 0–1). b, Patients with high qSOFA risk (scores 2–3). Overall percentages of patients with need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and/or RRT (‘ICU-level care') within 7 days independent of qSOFA and TriVerity results (= pre-test probabilities) are shown in black circles, whereas gray circles represent percentages of patients requiring ‘ICU-level care' based on qSOFA scores alone. Colored circles represent the percent of patients requiring ‘ICU-level care' based on combined qSOFA plus TriVerity Severity scores; colors represent TriVerity Severity score interpretation bands (Very Low, dark green; Low, bright green; Moderate, orange; High, bright red; Very High, dark red).

Finally, the Severity score also predicted the composite need for ‘ICU-level care' and/or 28-day mortality with a specificity of 99.0% for the rule-in Very High band and a sensitivity of 95.0% for the rule-out Very Low band, which further supports its predictive value of severe illness (Supplementary Table 6).

To examine the potential clinical utility of TriVerity, we performed several preliminary analyses. We note that these analyses were not part of the preplanned analyses. First, we investigated whether the Bacterial scores could help reduce inappropriate antibiotic treatment using post hoc clinically adjudicated infection status as the gold standard (Fig. 3a). Thirty-three patients were adjudicated to have a bacterial infection but did not receive antibiotics on the day of presentation, of whom 10, 11 and 3 (overall 24 (72.7%)) had a Bacterial score of Moderate, High or Very High, respectively (Fig. 3a), suggesting that TriVerity Bacterial score could have helped emergency department providers avoid delays in antibiotic administration. On the other hand, 103 patients were adjudicated to not have a bacterial infection but received antibiotics on the day of presentation, of whom 62 (60.2%) had a Bacterial score of Low or Very Low (Fig. 3a), suggesting that TriVerity results could have helped emergency department providers avoid antibiotic overprescription.

Pre-test and post-test probabilities for the five TriVerity Bacterial score bands are hypothetical but cover the entire range of possible probabilities. Dotted vertical and horizontal lines indicate physician decision thresholds (treat or not treat with antibiotics)23. c, Percent of patients in each combination of TriVerity Bacterial and Severity bands with bacterial sepsis, as by adjudicated bacterial infection and either delta in SOFA ≥ 2 or requirement of ICU-level care within 7 days.

Second, we applied likelihood ratios associated with TriVerity Bacterial bands to calculate theoretical post-test probability of bacterial infection for a range of hypothetical pre-test probabilities—ranging from 0 to 1 in 0.1-increment bins (Fig. 3b)—to reflect that physicians will use the Bacterial score in a variety of patients, including in those they judge infection is unlikely (for example, pre-test probability of 10%) or very likely (for example, pre-test probability of 90%). Using a threshold of 69% probability of bacterial infection for providers to prescribe antibiotics23, the post-test probability crosses the threshold in patients with ‘Very High' Bacterial scores and pre-test probability as low as 0.3. Similarly, a ‘High' Bacterial score results in a post-test probability of 0.69 in patients with a pre-test probability greater than 0.5. Conversely, Bacterial scores in the Very Low and Low bands reduce post-test probability below the 0.69 threshold for patients with a pre-test probability less than 90% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 3b). This analysis demonstrates that TriVerity Bacterial scores can assist emergency department providers in providing antibiotics to patients most likely to have bacterial infections and avoid antibiotics in patients less likely to have bacterial infections.

Finally, we explored whether the combination of high Severity and Bacterial scores would identify cases of bacterial sepsis. Because sepsis was not an adjudicated endpoint in the study, we used the definition of adjudicated bacterial infection and a change in SOFA score of ≥2 or requiring ICU-level care as a surrogate and examined the percent of patients with each combination of Bacterial and Severity score who met this definition for sepsis (Fig. 3c). We found that 68% of patients with a ‘Very High' Bacterial score and a ‘Very High' Severity score met this definition of sepsis. In addition, 33% of patients with a ‘High' Bacterial score and a ‘Very High' Severity score, or vice versa, met this definition of sepsis. In contrast, no patients with a ‘Very Low' Bacterial score and a ‘Low' or ‘Very Low' Severity score had sepsis. Less than 3% of patients with a ‘Low' Bacterial score and a ‘Low' or ‘Very Low' Severity score had sepsis.

Using a logistic regression model for infection status, including vital signs and laboratory values, and TriVerity (even though the adjudicators were blinded to all TriVerity results), the Bacterial score was the most significant variable associated with infection status, followed by WBC and procalcitonin (Supplementary Table 7).

Diagnosis and prognosis of patients presenting with symptoms of acute infections or suspected sepsis is an ongoing clinical challenge. Current diagnostic tools have limited sensitivity or require a long time to obtain results and do not assess prognosis or etiology6,8,24. Patients with suspected acute infection or suspected sepsis need to be evaluated along two clinical ‘axes' (infection and severity) for appropriate treatment6. However, no single biomarker can adequately resolve a patient regarding presence (infected or not), type (bacterial or viral) and severity (risk of decompensation and organ dysfunction) of infection.

The SEPSIS-SHIELD study demonstrated high overall accuracy of the FDA-cleared TriVerity test, with sensitivities and specificities in the Very Low and Very High bands of 92–99% for establishing infection status and need for ‘ICU-level care'. This was true across multiple subpopulations and outperformed existing biomarker tests. Although a high proportion of patients were immunosuppressed, no significant differences were observed in the accuracy of TriVerity compared to immunocompetent patients. Notably, the performance in immunocompromised patients has not been determined in clinical studies for other host response tests, as these were validated in patient cohorts excluding immunosuppression25.

Our results suggest that TriVerity has potential to assist emergency department clinicians in several clinical decisions, including identifying patients who would benefit from anti-infective therapy, while mitigating antibiotic overuse, thereby assisting in reducing common side effects of antimicrobials and combating further emergence of antimicrobial resistance26,27. Notably, TriVerity met the expert consensus target product profile for diagnostic assays to differentiate between bacterial and non-bacterial infections for reducing antimicrobial overuse28. Recently introduced protein-based host response tests only distinguish bacterial versus non-bacterial etiologies but do not distinguish viral infections from non-infectious inflammation or co-infections29,30. By contrast, to our knowledge, TriVerity is the first direct ‘biomarker' for the diagnosis of viral illness; specific and accurate identification of patients with viral infections will be adjunctive to other approaches for emergency department clinicians to decide on pathogen-specific viral diagnostics, antiviral treatment and isolation measures to prevent spread of infection. Furthermore, the simultaneous presentation of TriVerity Bacterial and Viral scores may reinforce the impact of a single bacterial result in support of antimicrobial stewardship. TriVerity Viral results were stable across different viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, although SEPSIS-SHIELD enrollment occurred before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The virus-agnostic design and the high accuracy of TriVerity for the diagnosis of infection with SARS-CoV-2 also suggests its potential to assist in detection of emerging viral pathogens before pathogen-specific tests become available.

In addition, TriVerity also diagnosed bacterial–viral co-infections. Although the prevalence of co-infection is low in the emergency department, ruling out bacterial co-infections is important to allow withholding antibiotics, especially when radiographic or other clinical features introduce diagnostic uncertainty and during pandemic threats31,32. Finally, TriVerity results indicating low probabilities of bacterial and viral infection allow clinicians to focus their efforts on non-infectious diagnoses, thereby avoiding ordering of expensive pathogen identification tests.

The early identification and treatment of suspected sepsis is critical33, but there is disagreement among major societies regarding exact guidance and timing for optimizing clinical care. For example, the SEP-1 bundle from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines strongly recommend the rapid administration of antibiotics to patients with suspected sepsis, but physician-based societies (for example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America) have argued that providers do not have adequate tools to judge who has sepsis, resulting in overtreatment and substantial costs associated with patients given unnecessary antibiotics34,35, including the rise of antimicrobial resistance. However, occult sepsis continues to be overlooked in a substantial proportion of emergency department patients. Although qSOFA ≥ 2 conveys a high mortality rate, further classification of patients with qSOFA ≤ 1 is needed because, despite low mortality rate, 30% of sepsis deaths occur in patients with low qSOFA36. In a post hoc analysis, after stratifying patients based on qSOFA, using TriVerity Severity score further improved the risk prediction dramatically by improving accuracy in those patients clinically at low risk but at substantially higher risk of severe illness. TriVerity also correctly identified those patients with substantially lower risk who had been clinically identified as high risk. The Severity score also provided additional information to aid in identification of patients with sepsis. An alternative test based on host mRNA expression was developed as an aid to differentiate infection-positive sepsis from infection-negative systemic inflammation but is cleared only for ICU use37. TriVerity also demonstrated high accuracy in ruling in and ruling out ICU transfer and predicted 28-day mortality with high accuracy. Taken together, these results suggest that TriVerity could improve patient management in the emergency department, with results offering potential for better informed clinical decision-making, including disposition decisions.

Taylor et al.23 recently surveyed 153 US clinicians responding to real-world derived vignettes of suspected sepsis to analyze decision thresholds to treat or not with antibiotics, using infection prediction models and varying case severities. Although the overall threshold to treat was 69% probability of infection, it varied significantly, such that it was 55% for high illness severity versus 84% for low illness severity. These findings strongly suggest the potential of the combined TriVerity diagnostic (Bacterial and Viral) and illness severity scores to further increase the threshold for antibiotic initiation. Incorporating context-dependent thresholds—potentially specific for TriVerity results in the outer Very High and Very Low bands versus the inner High and Low bands—into discriminating and well-calibrated models will inform the development of future clinical decision support systems.

Our preliminary results also demonstrate the potential clinical utility of the diagnostic and prognostic scores from TriVerity. In the SEPSIS-SHIELD study, TriVerity could have substantially reduced inappropriate antibiotic treatment by reducing both false positives (treated with antibiotics but no bacterial infection) and false negatives (bacterial infection not treated with antibiotics), which, in turn, could assist emergency department providers in acting as antimicrobial stewards. TriVerity also correctly identified patients who died without receiving the ICU-level care, demonstrating its potential to reduce the false negatives for prognosticating illness severity. The limitations of clinical estimation of infection and severity probabilities by emergency department providers reported here are in line with reports in the literature24. Further interventional studies are required to determine the clinical benefits of TriVerity.

Results of the present study, along with those of other studies18,19,20,21, support broad generalizability of our findings. Demographics of participants were representative of the emergency department patients with respect to age, sex, race and ethnicity, underlying conditions, immune status and clinical outcomes. Unlike procalcitonin, which has historically been less accurate in Black/African American and Hispanic subgroups38, TriVerity Bacterial scores maintained significantly higher accuracy than procalcitonin across White, Black and other races, suggesting its potential for improved diagnostic accuracy in minority populations. We also observed broad generalizability across patients with diverse suspected infection sites. Notably, we did not observe significant differences in the performance of TriVerity among patients with infections localized at different anatomical sites, except for bloodstream infections, which is expected because bloodstream infections would lead to stronger immune responses.

Notably, our statistical analysis approach ensured inclusion of all patients, as there was no equivocal adjudication (adjudication categories were Yes, Probable, Uncertain or No) and included all patients with results that fell into the ‘Moderate' TriVerity bands. This approach is critical because several studies of other tests have been published in which statistical analysis excluded both patients with uncertain adjudication (a clinically critical ‘gray zone' population) or uninfected and those in the middle (for example, equivocal) interpretation bands, thereby unfairly overstating those testsʼ overall accuracy25,39,40,41,42.

Our study has limitations. First, without a true gold standard, we used clinical adjudication as the reference standard to determine patient infection status22. As expected, the accuracy of the TriVerity test for diagnosing bacterial and viral infections was highest in the consensus population (certain infection status). Although consensus adjudication is the most accurate comparator to assess infection status, it excludes a fraction of patients with uncertain infection. As expected, including patients with uncertain infection status reduced the accuracy due to potential misclassifications in forced adjudication. Second, the prevalence of bacterial infections was higher than viral infections and non-infectious diseases, which was likely driven by (1) the broad inclusion criteria resulting in approximately 50% of all patients having abdominal, skin and soft tissue or urinary tract diseases (rarely caused by viral pathogens) and (2) the seasonality of bacterial versus viral infection. Depending on local epidemiology and setting, TriVerity may have varying positive and negative predictive values. However, we note that SEPSIS-SHIELD enrolled patients over cold and other seasons. Therefore, we think that the results reported here are unlikely to be affected by these factors. Furthermore, the development of the machine-learning-based TriVerity classifiers was based on a large number of datasets from highly diverse cohorts of patients with suspected infections and/or suspected sepsis43. Lastly, the percentage of patients who required ICU-level care was lower than expected; thus, although results of the TriVerity Severity score indicate high accuracy for the prediction of ‘ICU-level care', future validation studies are warranted prior to use in substantially sicker populations. We previously showed consistently high accuracy of the TriVerity Severity score among patients admitted to the ICU44,45,46.

In conclusion, TriVerity rapidly detects bacterial infections, viral infections and bacterial–viral co-infections, can rule out bacterial and viral infections and has superior accuracy compared to routine biomarkers. TriVerity can also predict the severity of illness and, when combined with clinical scores, adds granularity and potential clinical utility for predicting severe infection, including sepsis. Interventional studies are needed, and are currently underway, to provide evidence of actionability and clinical benefit of TriVerity. These will determine whether TriVerity can enable personalized management of patients with suspected acute infections and suspected sepsis for improved overall healthcare outcomes.

This study was approved by local institutional review boards (enrolling sites) or a central institutional review board (Advarra). Written consent was obtained from each patient. The study was conducted with the highest respect for the individual patients and in accordance with the protocol; the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki; the informed consent regulations stated in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 50; International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use; Good Clinical Practice (E6) §4.8; and all applicable local and FDA regulations.

Patients were enrolled in the ‘TriVerity in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Emergency Department Patients with Suspected Infections and Suspected Sepsis' (SEPSIS-SHIELD; NCT04094818) study, a prospective, non-interventional, minimal-risk study enrolling adult patients presenting to the emergency department with (1) suspected acute infection and at least one abnormal vital sign or (2) suspected sepsis with at least two vital sign changes and a blood culture order. Patients were enrolled from 22 emergency departments (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Emergency departments of community and academic hospitals were located at 21 geographically diverse locations throughout the United States and at one site in Europe (Supplementary Table 1). During the ‘FROZEN' phase of the study (2 March 2020 to 16 February 2023), blood samples were frozen and sent to one of two reference laboratories to perform TriVerity after thawing the frozen samples. During the ‘FRESH' phase of the study (8 December 2023 to 28 May 2024), TriVerity was performed on freshly obtained blood samples (no freezing) at the enrolling site. Fresh–frozen equivalency was established by comparing the accuracy between results obtained in the FRESH phase versus those in the FROZEN phase of the study (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The study plan, conduct and statistical analysis were guided by detailed discussions with the FDA via the Q-Submission Program and in sprint discussions under the FDA's Breakthrough Devices Program. Power analyses were based on performance characteristics of TriVerity (bacterial, viral and illness severity) and estimated prevalences of infections, non-infectious differential diagnoses and severe outcomes.

Inclusion criteria were as follows:

age ≥18 years

suspected acute infection (for example, respiratory, urinary, abdominal, skin and soft tissue infection, meningitis/encephalitis or any other infection)

at least one vital sign change (heart rate >90 beats per minute, temperature >38 °C or <36 °C, respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute or PaO2 <60 mmHg or SpO2 < 90%, systolic heart pressure <100 mmHg, altered mental status per clinical examination) or suspected sepsis of any cause (defined as blood culture order by the treating physician and at least two vital sign changes)

able to provide informed consent or consent by a legally authorized representative

Exclusion criteria were as follows:

Patient-reported treatment with systemic antibiotics, systemic antiviral agents or systemic antifungal agents within the past 7 days prior to the emergency department visit (use of antiviral treatment for HIV and hepatitis B and C, topical antibiotics, topical antivirals or topical antifungal agents, anti-herpes prophylaxis, perioperative (prophylactic) antibiotics and a single dose of antimicrobials during the present emergency department visit (<10 hours before blood draw) did not result in exclusion)

patients receiving palliative or hospice care or those receiving limited interventional care

prisoners, those mentally disabled or those unable to give consent

patients receiving experimental therapy or already enrolled in an interventional clinical trial in which a patient received some type of intervention, which could include, but was not limited to, investigational drugs, medical devices or vaccines

patients previously enrolled in this clinical trial

Of note, patients with any form of immunosuppression were eligible for SEPSIS-SHIELD.

All patients had routine samples collected as per the standard of care and were managed as per standard of care independent of the study conduct. The study intervention consisted of blood collection via venipuncture (2.5 ml of whole blood into PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytix) for TriVerity testing and 5 ml of whole blood for central laboratory testing of serum CRP and procalcitonin) and a nasopharyngeal swab collection from patients with suspected upper respiratory tract infections. Patients were followed for up to 28 days; those discharged earlier were contacted via phone call to collect follow-up information (readmission, etc.).

Data collection using a case report form occurred from the day of presentation in the emergency department (covering 7 days before enrollment) to the follow-up phone call after day 28. Data collected included detailed information on demographics; medical history; clinical, laboratory and imaging findings; and information related to management, including treatment with antibiotics and ICU-level treatment. Furthermore, at the time of enrollment, a questionnaire was presented to the emergency department provider and was completed no later than 24 hours after the time of enrollment. The questionnaire included questions on the provider's presumptive diagnosis, the provider's assessment of probability of bacterial and viral infection as well as the need for ‘ICU-level care'. All data were stored pseudonymized in a secure database (Medrio).

The primary endpoints for bacterial and viral etiology were determined by independent adjudicators following a transparent and standardized clinical adjudication process developed for the SEPSIS-SHIELD trial by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and laboratorians22. Adjudicators were blinded to the TriVerity results at all times and did not adjudicate cases enrolled at their own institution. In brief, two independent physicians (randomly chosen from a pool of 12 emergency department physicians) reviewed comprehensive clinical, laboratory and other patient information to adjudicate the presence or absence of bacterial and viral infections into Yes, Probable, Unlikely and No categories (no equivocal adjudication allowed). Discordant cases were resolved by one of two expert physicians (experienced and involved in generating the adjudication protocol) who were blinded to the initial reviewer results. Cases adjudicated as Yes and No (the subgroup with certain infection status) formed the consensus cohort presented in the main body of this report. Cases adjudicated as Probable or Unlikely were forced into categories of Yes/Probable and No/Unlikely to form the forced cohort (all patients including uncertain and certain adjudications). Results for the forced adjudication analysis are presented in Extended Data Table 2a–d. The primary severity outcome (patients requiring ‘ICU-level care') was defined as receipt of acute mechanical ventilation, vasopressor and/or new RRT within 7 days. Admission to the ICU was captured independently.

TriVerity (formerly HostDx or InSep) is a gene expression profiling assay that quantifies the relative expression of 29 host response genes from 2.5 ml of whole blood collected in PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes. The TriVerity system (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 5a) comprises the TriVerity cartridge and the Myrna instrument with embedded software and proprietary preprocessing and machine learning classification algorithms that process expression data and deliver result readouts. In brief, the 29 mRNAs were selected from extensive multicohort analyses of thousands of blood transcriptome profiles across tens of independent cohorts to diagnose presence16, type15 and severity17 of infection and were further optimized19. On the Myrna device, the signal processing estimates 29 relative gene expression values based on the cartridge well camera images taken at regular intervals during loop-mediated isothermal amplification47. We apply two logistic regression classifiers to the mRNA expression data to estimate probabilities of bacterial, viral or no infection and the probability of severe illness. These classifiers (described in detail in ref. 43) were finetuned using a combination of hyperparameter optimization and grouped cross-validation approaches, which was found to reduce overfitting during a classifier development. The system is designed for single-sample testing. TriVerity converts probabilities to the three scores corresponding to (1) the likelihood of a bacterial infection, (2) the likelihood of a viral infection and (3) the severity of the patient's illness. They fall into actionable interpretation bands ranging from Very High to High, Moderate, Low and Very Low (Extended Data Fig. 1b). TriVerity received FDA clearance on 10 January 2025. Results of analytical studies, including limit of detection, equivalency of fresh versus frozen samples, interfering substances, quality controls and other details of the TriVerity system, are described in the FDA Decision Summary (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K241676) and in a separate report48.

The analysis population consisted of all patients who provided consent, met all inclusion criteria, met no exclusion criteria and had PAXgene blood samples successfully processed (resulting in three TriVerity scores). The overall analysis population was divided into diagnostic and prognostic analysis populations. The diagnostic endpoint population included patients who had been adjudicated for bacterial and viral infection to define the ground truth, defined as either a certain (Yes or No) or an uncertain (Probable or Unlikely) infection status. The diagnostic population was further classified as Consensus (only contains patients with a certain (Yes or No) adjudication) and Forced (all patients adjudicated as (Yes or Probable) versus (No or Unlikely)). The primary prognostic endpoint population included patients with complete information regarding the presence of acute need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use and/or RRT within 7 days. The secondary prognostic endpoint included patients who met the primary endpoint and/or 28-day mortality.

TriVerity bands were assessed in terms of likelihood ratio, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values (post-test probabilities) dependent on the band (whether intended as a rule-in band with a case being a true positive or a rule-out band with a case being a false negative). For continuous variables (for example, age and WBCs), results were summarized with the numbers of observations, means, standard deviations, medians and ranges and 80% CIs. These calculations and endpoints were determined in discussions with the FDA and were used in prior FDA registrational clinical studies (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K210254.pdf). Fisher's exact test determined significance for differences in need of ‘ICU-level care' across patients as well as tested if there were significant differences in positive rate for each of the TriVerity Severity bands stratified by qSOFA scores. P values for differences between the AUROCs of TriVerity and biomarker values, clinical scores (qSOFA) and differences across races were calculated using DeLong's test; P values comparing immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients as well as COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients were calculated using bootstrapping. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS software version 9.4 or R software version 4.2.

Metrics details

Critical care syndromes such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and trauma continue to have unacceptably high morbidity and mortality, with progress limited by the inherent heterogeneity within syndromic illnesses. Although numerous immune endotypes have been proposed for sepsis and critical care, the similarities and differences between these endotypes remain unclear, hindering clinical translation. The SUBSPACE consortium is an international consortium that aims to advance precision medicine in critical care through the sharing of transcriptomic data. Here, evaluating the overlap of existing immune endotypes in sepsis across >7,074 samples from 37 independent cohorts, we developed cell-type-specific gene expression signatures to quantify dysregulation within immune compartments. Myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation were associated with disease severity and mortality across all cohorts. Importantly, this dysregulation was also observed in patients with ARDS, trauma and burns, suggesting a conserved mechanism across various critical illness syndromes. Moreover, analysis of randomized controlled trial data revealed that myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation are associated with differential mortality in patients treated with anakinra in the SAVE-MORE trial (n = 452) and corticosteroids in the VICTAS (n = 89) and VANISH (n = 117) trials, underscoring their prognostic and therapeutic implications. In conclusion, our proposed immunology-based framework for quantifying cellular compartment dysregulation offers a potentially valuable tool for understanding immune dysregulation in critical illness with prognostic and therapeutic significance.

The field of critical care has expanded dramatically since the first intensive care units (ICUs) were developed1. However, progress has slowed and reduction in ICU mortality has plateaued2. One reason for this plateau is that most ICU admissions are related to physiology-driven syndromic definitions such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and trauma, which ignore inherent biological and clinical heterogeneity3. Over 100 clinical trials of immune-modulating medications in sepsis, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, have failed to achieve consistent clinical benefits4. On the other hand, countless secondary analyses have identified biological subgroups that may benefit from targeted therapies5,6,7,8,9,10. To advance precision medicine in the ICU, we must redefine critical illness based on biological mechanisms, rather than clinical syndromes11.

In sepsis, transcriptomic and proteomic endotyping schemas have successfully identified subgroups, retrospectively, of patients at higher risk of mortality and those who respond differentially to immune-modulatory therapies12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Importantly, although these endotypes were developed in ‘sepsis', there were substantial differences in patient populations, infectious etiology, severity and the clustering approach. For example, Wong et al. evaluated gene expression in pediatric septic shock and identified two endotypes: one high risk and one low risk17. Despite potential age-related differences in the host response, these endotypes were congruent with two endotypes developed in adult patients with pneumonia by Davenport et al. that were later shown to have a differential response to steroids5,12. Scicluna et al. identified four transcriptomic endotypes across two ICUs (medication administration records (MARS) 1–4)20, whereas Sweeney et al. identified three endotypes (inflammopathic, coagulopathic and adaptive) in both critically ill and noncritically ill patients with bacterial sepsis14. Finally, Zheng et al. described four continuous immune severity scores (the severe-or-mild (SoM) signature) that are conserved across a broad array of viral and bacterial infections10,19.

The convergence of results by these independent research groups on sepsis endotypes offers promise for advancing molecular endotyping. However, how these schemas are related to each other, whether they generalize beyond the cohorts in which they were originally identified and whether they represent the same or different underlying biology remain important questions that must be answered to fundamentally redefine critical illness syndromes and advance precision medicine.

The goal of the subtyping in sepsis and critical illness (SUBSPACE) consortium is to advance precision medicine in sepsis and critical care syndromes by identifying and understanding the underlying biological pathways and redefine critical illnesses based on molecular biology, rather than traditional clinical categorizations. We hypothesized that the comparison and integration of existing transcriptomic endotyping frameworks across multiple critical illness cohorts would reveal distinct molecular pathways and immune cell-specific dysregulation. These biological insights could provide a basis for redefining critical care syndromes, enabling a more precise, biology-driven classification that can inform targeted therapies and improve patient outcomes in critical care.

Our primary objective was to evaluate whether the existing gene expression endotyping signatures for patients with sepsis identified similar biology. To ensure validity and reproducibility, we applied the same methods in parallel across the public and SUBSPACE cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 1). First, we assigned standardized severity labels to each of the 1,460 blood samples from 19 independent public studies, encompassing adult and pediatric patients infected with 1 of 15 types of bacterial and viral infections21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38 (Supplementary Table 1): healthy, mild or moderate infections (those who did not require ICU admission), severe infections (those who required ICU admission) and fatal infections19. Next, we used combat co-normalization using controls (COCONUT) to co-normalize these datasets and ensured that there were no batch effects post-normalization (Supplementary Fig. 1).

We excluded two endotype signatures, Cano-Gamez sepsis response signature (SRS) and Davenport SRS, from the public dataset analysis because several of their genes were not measured in all datasets. For the remaining five endotyping schemas (Fig. 1a), we generated continuous endotype scores for all samples and used hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and network analysis to evaluate the overlap between them. Each method identified similar clusters across endotype schemas (Fig. 1b–d), suggesting that these schemas identified the same endotypes despite using different methodologies and populations. Silhouette index analysis found that the ideal number of clusters varied between two and four, depending on the etiology and severity of infections (Extended Data Fig. 2a–e). For instance, when using all infections, irrespective of severity, the optimal number of clusters was three; however, when using only severe infections, the optimal number of clusters was four. Importantly, across all clustering methods, the same set of endotypes grouped together across four clusters, regardless of the optimal number. Bootstrapping with 1,000 repetitions confirmed this result (P < 0.01; Extended Data Fig. 2f). Therefore, we carried forward these four consensus clusters to further evaluate whether there were important biological and clinical differences. Among these four clusters, two included endotypes that have been previously associated with worse outcomes, which we refer to as detrimental clusters, whereas the other two included endotypes that have been previously associated with improved outcomes, which we refer to as protective clusters. Importantly, this corroborates prior pathway analyses, which have suggested that the biology underlying these endotypes may overlap despite using different endotype-defining genes (Extended Data Table 1). Finally, analysis of pairwise correlation of genes across these four clusters, showing that genes within each cluster were highly correlated, again suggested that these endotype schemas were identifying common biology despite the use of different genes identified using different methods and patient populations (Extended Data Fig. 3).

We calculated the five sepsis signatures and scaled values for unsupervised clustering. b, Unsupervised hierarchical clustering performed by scaled gene expression score (x axis) across all samples (y axis) identifying four consensus endotypes. c, The four identified consensus endotypes separated well in PCA. d, Network analysis performed on scaled scores using Spearman's correlation >0.33 to identify edges. Clusters were identified using a greedy forward algorithm, which identified four clusters mirroring those identified by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The thickness of the line represents correlation between the nodes it connects. Coag, coagulopathic; Inflamm., inflammopathic; Mod, module.

Next, we investigated whether these 4 molecular endotypes were reproducible using 4,106 blood samples from 3,380 patients across 12 independent prospective cohorts from 10 centers integrated through the SUBSPACE consortium. These samples represented broad heterogeneity, including pediatric and adult patients, noncritical and critically ill patients and infected and noninfected patients, inclusive of both bacterial and viral sepsis (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). All gene expression data, except the MESSI cohort due to a lack of healthy participants, were COCONUT co-normalized. Housekeeping genes and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) showed appropriate co-normalization (Supplementary Fig. 2). We calculated continuous endotype scores from each of the seven gene expression signatures for each sample. Once again, unsupervised hierarchical clustering and network analysis identified four gene expression-based clusters, with the addition of quantitative SRS (SRSq) scores clustering with detrimental endotypes (Fig. 2b–e). In the SUBSPACE cohorts, unsupervised clustering identified identical clusters to the public data whereas network analysis identified similar subgroups with the exception of the Sweeney coagulopathic signature and the Wong signature clustering with the detrimental endotypes now containing SRSq, suggesting some similarities between these endotypes. Importantly, none of the clusters was driven by a single cohort (Fig. 2c).

Samples did not cluster together by cohort. d, The four identified consensus endotypes separating well on PCA. e, Network analysis performed on scaled scores using Spearman's correlation >0.47 (median correlation) to identify edges. The clusters were identified using a greedy forward algorithm, which identified four clusters. The thickness of the line represents correlation between the nodes it connects.

Collectively, our results demonstrated that, despite the biological, clinical and technical heterogeneity across cohorts, the endotypes identified by different schemas converge to four consensus molecular clusters, henceforth called consensus endotypes. These molecular subgroups separated based on detrimental and protective endotypes. Overall, this suggests that prior sepsis transcriptomic signatures share a biological basis that may be leveraged to better understand sepsis pathogenesis and treatment.

After identifying the consensus of these discrete endotyping signatures, we next evaluated the immunological underpinnings of these consensus endotypes and developed a more generalizable immune framework. We evaluated the 7 endotyping signatures using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by integrating 602,388 immune cells from 258 samples from 4 publicly available COVID-19 and sepsis scRNA-seq datasets that included neutrophil profiles39,40,41,42 (Supplementary Table 3). We identified 14 unique cell types (Fig. 3a and Methods) and found that cell type and severity explained the largest variability (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). The consensus endotypes separated along cellular origin and detrimental or protective effects, which we defined based on whether the corresponding endotype was associated with worse or improved prognosis (that is, higher severity or mortality) in prior studies. Consensus endotypes included a detrimental myeloid cluster (Sweeney inflammopathic, Yao innate, SoM modules 1 and 2, and MARS2), a protective myeloid cluster (Wong score, MARS4 and SoM module 4), a protective lymphoid cluster (Sweeney adaptive, Yao adaptive, SoM module 4 and MARS3) and a mixed myeloid or lymphoid cluster (Sweeney coagulopathic, Yao coagulopathic and MARS1) (Fig. 3b).

a, Integration of 4 whole-blood scRNA-seq datasets from patients with COVID-19 and sepsis, inclusive of the neutrophil compartment and identifying 14 unique cell types using the Seurat and Scanpy pathways. The UMAP of cell types is shown. b, Evaluation of scaled gene expression signatures across these cell types, showing that the scores included in each consensus molecular endotype were expressed in similar cell types. The red cluster (MARS2, SoM module 1 or 2, Sweeney inflammopathic, Yao innate and SRS signatures) was predominantly expressed with immature neutrophils. The blue cluster (MARS3, Yao adaptive, Sweeney adaptive and SoM module 4) was predominantly expressed in T or NK cells. The purple cluster (MARS1, Sweeney coagulopathic and Yao coagulopathic) was a mix of intermediate expression of neutrophils and T or NK cells. The green cluster (MARS4, Wong score and SoM module 3) was predominantly expressed in mature neutrophils and monocytes. c, Development of a cell-type-specific score by evaluating scaled expression of each gene across all endotype signatures and selecting 104 genes that were selectively expressed (defined by >1 s.d. greater than other cell types evaluated) in myeloid or T or NK cell types. We then divided these genes into detrimental or protective genes based on whether the signature from which they were derived was associated with worse or better outcomes in prior studies. cDC, classical dendritic cell; HSPC, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell; PB, peripheral blood; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cell.

Although predominant cell-type expression explained these consensus endotypes to some extent, genes in these signatures were expressed across multiple cell types (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). To isolate myeloid-specific and lymphoid-specific dysregulation scores, we evaluated the cell specificity of all genes used in the 7 signatures and identified 104 genes that were selectively expressed in either myeloid or lymphoid cells. We divided these genes into myeloid detrimental, myeloid protective and lymphoid protective subgroups based on whether the original endotyping signature in which they were included was considered detrimental or protective as previously defined (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 4). Importantly, no lymphoid-specific genes were found in any of the detrimental signatures evaluated. We then defined myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores as the difference between the geometric mean of detrimental genes (when applicable) and the geometric mean of protective genes, for a given cell lineage. Evaluation of myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores using scRNA-seq data confirmed their cell-type specificity (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). Myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores were moderately correlated with each other (r = 0.49, P < 2.2 × 10−16; Supplementary Fig. 6) in bulk transcriptome data from the SUBSPACE cohorts.

Overall, scRNA-seq data demonstrated that the four consensus endotypes were associated with distinct expression profiles in myeloid and lymphoid immune cells.

Association of consensus molecular endotypes with distinct immune cell types presented an opportunity to define an immune response-based evaluation framework, which we term the human immune dysregulation evaluation framework (Hi-DEF). We hypothesized that use of these gene expression-based scores to quantify myeloid- and lymphoid-specific dysregulation for each patient would reduce between-patient heterogeneity.

To test this hypothesis, we computed the lymphoid and myeloid dysregulation scores as defined above for each sample in the public datasets. Both myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores increased significantly with severity across public datasets (Jonckheere–Terpstra (JT) t-test P < 2.2 × 10−16 for both scores; Fig. 4a). Next, we defined an abnormal lymphoid or myeloid dysregulation score using the 95th percentile of each score in healthy participants, which corresponds to a z-score of 1.65, and defined four quadrants: balanced, lymphoid dysregulation, myeloid dysregulation and system-wide dysregulation (Fig. 4b). Patients with either a myeloid or a lymphoid dysregulation score ≥1.65 had a significantly higher risk of severe infection or mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 5.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9–7.0, P < 2.2 × 10−16) compared with those with both scores <1.65 (Fig. 4c,d). The risk of severe infection or mortality was highest for patients with system-wide dysregulation, with 51% of these patients experiencing severe infections compared with 24% in the myeloid dysregulation subgroup, 10% in the lymphoid dysregulation subgroup and only 6% in the balanced subgroup (P < 0.01 across all comparisons; Fig. 4d). These results remained significant across multiple sensitivity analyses, including adult and pediatric cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 7), bacterial and viral infectious etiologies (Supplementary Fig. 8) and US versus non-US cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 9).

a, Myeloid (left) and lymphoid (right) scores (calculated as z-scores relative to healthy participants) calculated for all public samples (n = 2,096). The box plots represent the median and interquartile range (IQR) whereas whiskers represent the range of data excluding outliers (1.5× the IQR). The association of increasing scores (y axis) with increasing severity (x axis) was calculated using the JT t-test. Myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores were associated with severity (P < 2.2 × 10−16 for both scores). b, Theoretical framework for defining immune dysregulation with myeloid dysregulation on one axis and lymphoid dysregulation on the other. This provides a means of subgrouping patients into four subgroups depending on the level of dysregulation present: (1) balanced: both dysregulation scores low; (2) lymphoid dysregulation: only lymphoid dysregulation score elevated; (3) myeloid dysregulation: only myeloid dysregulation score elevated; and (4) system-wide dysregulation: both myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores elevated. c, The immune dysregulation framework applied to public co-normalized data (n = 2,096). Cut-offs are defined by a z-score of 1.65 relative to healthy participants. The black dots represent patients with severe infections (defined by ICU admission), whereas the tan dots represent nonsevere infections. d, Barplot representing the proportion of severe infections (y axis) by immune dysregulation framework subgroup (x axis). The OR was calculated using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons, comparing patients with dysregulation on any axis relative to the balanced subgroup. Dysregulation on either the myeloid or the lymphoid axis (inclusive of lymphoid dysregulation (n = 449), myeloid dysregulation (n = 197) and system-wide dysregulation (n = 259) subgroups) was associated with severe infections with an OR of 5.2 (95% CI 3.9–7.0, P < 2.2 × 10−16) compared with patients in the balanced subgroup (n = 1,191). e, Myeloid (left) and lymphoid (right) scores (calculated as z-scores relative to healthy participants) were calculated for baseline SUBSPACE samples with phenotype data available (n = 2,212). The box plots represent the median and IQR whereas the whiskers represent the range of data excluding outliers (1.5× the IQR). The association of increasing scores (y axis) with severity (x axis) was calculated using the JT t-test. Myeloid dysregulation and lymphoid dysregulation scores were associated with severity (P < 2.2 × 10−16 for both scores). f, Forest plots showing log(OR) and 95% CIs of 30-d mortality across each site, calculated using logistic regression and showing strong association with mortality: myeloid dysregulation score (left) and lymphoid dysregulation score (right). Patient numbers by site were: ACUTELINES (n = 275), Amsterdam (n = 717), Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (n = 184), Charles University (n = 12), SAVE-MORE (n = 452), Stanford University (n = 236), University of Florida (n = 172) and VICTAS (n = 137). g, The immune dysregulation framework applied to SUBSPACE co-normalized data (n = 2,212). Cut-offs were defined by a z-score of 1.65 relative to healthy patients. The black dots represent critically ill patients, whereas the tan dots represent noncritically ill patients. h, Barplot representing the proportion of severe infections (y axis) by immune dysregulation framework subgroup (x axis). The OR was calculated using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons, comparing patients with dysregulation on any axis relative to the balanced subgroup. Dysregulation on either the myeloid or the lymphoid axis (inclusive of lymphoid dysregulation (n = 615), myeloid dysregulation (n = 133) and system-wide dysregulation (n = 1,050) subgroups) was associated with severe infections with an OR of 7.1 (95% CI 5.6–8.9, P < 2.2 × 10−16) compared with patients in the balanced subgroup (n = 564).

Similar to the public datasets, both dysregulation scores increased with severity in the co-normalized SUBSPACE cohorts (JT t-test P < 2.2 × 10−16 for both scores; Fig. 4e). Both the myeloid and the lymphoid dysregulation scores were associated with 30-d mortality across all cohorts with an OR of 1.9 (95% CI 1.3–2.0, P < 0.001) and 1.6 (95% CI 1.6–2.8, P < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 4f). Myeloid dysregulation was most significantly (P < 0.05) associated with mortality in predominantly ICU and bacterially infected cohorts (Stanford and VICTAS), whereas the lymphoid dysregulation score had a more significant (P < 0.05) association with mortality in cohorts with predominantly viral infections (Amsterdam PANAMO and SAVE-MORE), a trend that was further highlighted when we evaluated differences in outcomes solely in virally or bacterially infected patients (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Using a z-score of 1.65 relative to healthy partcipants as a dysregulation threshold, both dysregulation scores ≥1.65 were significantly associated with severe illness requiring ICU level of care or dying within 30 d (OR = 7.1, 95% CI 5.6–8.9, P < 2.2 × 10−16; Fig. 4g,h) in the SUBSPACE cohorts. When considering only 30-d mortality, it was significantly higher in those with either myeloid or lymphoid dysregulation (OR = 3.5, 95% CI 2.3–5.4, P = 5.3 × 10−12; Extended Data Fig. 5), where the system-wide dysregulation subgroup had the highest mortality rate (18%). Importantly, Hi-DEF also validated in the MESSI cohort, although it was not co-normalized with the SUBSPACE cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 10).

We evaluated whether Hi-DEF was differentiable clinically. Although there were differences in age and white blood counts across subgroups (Supplementary Table 5), there was substantial overlap. In the Stanford cohort, dysregulation was associated with vital and laboratory derangements (Supplementary Table 6); however, overlap would again limit clinical detection. Although the myeloid and lymphoid scores were correlated with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (Supplementary Fig. 11), both myeloid (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.7–2.7, P < 0.001) and lymphoid (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 2.3–3.5, P < 0.001) scores remained associated with severity and mortality after adjusting for the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.

A key limitation of existing transcriptomic sub-phenotyping schemas is that they often ‘force' subgroupings and thus lack generalizability beyond the populations in which they were developed. For instance, an ‘appropriate' immune response to an upper respiratory tract infection or viral pneumonia may be inadequate for Gram-negative bacteremia; however, current endotyping schemas do not allow this nuanced evaluation.

To illustrate this issue, we analyzed differences in myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation by severity (Fig. 5a), recruitment location (Supplementary Fig. 12) and infectious etiology (Extended Data Fig. 6a). These analyses confirmed substantial differences in the magnitude and range of immune dysregulation. For example, patients enrolled in emergency department or non-ICU settings had lower dysregulation scores than those enrolled in an ICU (Supplementary Fig. 12). Next, analysis of the proportion of healthy participants, and those with mild, severe or fatal illness across myeloid and lymphoid score quintiles, found that the composition of patients varied substantially across these quintiles (Fig. 5b,c). These results show that differences in cohort composition (that is, a mix of critically and noncritically ill individuals versus solely critically ill patients) affect the dysregulation measured and subsequent results of endotyping schemas, which is in line with the analysis that showed differences in ‘ideal' cluster number by severity and infectious etiology (Extended Data Fig. 2). Importantly, we found that the thresholds for optimal sensitivity and specificity varied depending on whether the goal was to differentiate mild disease from healthy participants compared with differentiating severe or fatal disease from mild cases (Fig. 5d,e). In addition, these thresholds varied depending on whether a patient had a viral or a bacterial infection (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Together, these results further suggest that the differing number of endotypes identified by prior unsupervised approaches, even though they identified similar biology, may stem from the differences in cohort composition. Overall, these results also demonstrate the need for a flexible, generalizable framework to better evaluate immune dysregulation across these diverse clinical contexts.

The individual dots represent patient samples colored by severity and circles the mean and s.d. of lymphoid dysregulation scores. Together this shows the differences that patient cohort composition may have on endotype-defining gene expression signatures. b, Evaluation of the proportion of severity subgroups within the quintiles of myeloid dysregulation scores, indicating how different thresholds would affect the patient population above each threshold. c, Evaluation of the proportion of severity subgroups within the quintiles of lymphoid dysregulation scores, indicating how different thresholds would affect the patient population above each threshold. d, Evaluation of the sensitivity (solid line) and specificity (dashed line) of different myeloid dysregulation score thresholds when identifying mild or moderate infections from healthy participants (blue), severe from mild or moderate infections (yellow) and fatal from nonfatal (red) cases. These results show that the ideal dysregulation threshold will depend on the clinical question. e, Evaluation of the sensitivity (solid line) and specificity (dashed line) of different lymphoid dysregulation score thresholds when identifying mild or moderate infections from healthy participants (blue), severe from mild or moderate infections (yellow) and fatal from nonfatal (red) cases. These results show that the ideal dysregulation threshold will depend on the clinical question.

Prior studies have highlighted the similar pathobiology underlying systemic inflammation in sepsis, burns and trauma3. We evaluated whether Hi-DEF could offer insights into other critical illness syndromes. We first examined the Glue Grant cohort43, which included 430 noninfected, critically ill patients with trauma or burns. We integrated gene expression data from the Glue cohort with SUBSPACE data using COCONUT co-normalization and defined dysregulation as myeloid or lymphoid scores greater than or equal to the median scores across all SUBSPACE patients who required ICU level of care. Higher myeloid or lymphoid dysregulation scores were significantly associated with severe outcomes, defined as multi-system organ failure or mortality (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.7, P = 0.02; Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). This association was predominantly driven by myeloid dysregulation and remained significant after adjusting for sex and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score (adjusted myeloid dysregulation score: OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.8, P = 0.045), whereas lymphoid dysregulation was not associated with multi-system organ failure or mortality.

Next, we evaluated whether Hi-DEF was associated with ARDS in the Stanford cohort using the same cut-off as the Glue Grant cohort. Higher myeloid or lymphoid dysregulation scores were significantly associated with the presence of ARDS (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.3–6.0, P = 0.005; Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). After adjusting for sex and APACHE II score, the lymphoid dysregulation score was significantly associated with ARDS (adjusted OR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.02–1.37, P = 0.03), but the myeloid dysregulation score was not. Together, these results suggest that Hi-DEF may provide insights into similarities and differences across diverse critical illness syndromes.

To investigate the generalizability of Hi-DEF in immunosuppressed patients, we evaluated two cohorts (Stanford ICU and MESSI) that recruited from quaternary care center ICUs with substantial immunosuppressed populations. In the Stanford and MESSI cohorts, 28% and 46% of patients, respectively, were immunocompromised. Myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores were significantly higher in immunocompromised patients in the Stanford cohort (Wilcoxon's P = 0.002, P = 0.02, respectively) but were not different in the MESSI cohort. In the Stanford cohort, immunocompromised patients were more likely to be dysregulated (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.3–6.7, P = 0.006), but not in the MESSI cohort (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d). In both cohorts, although immunocompromised status was associated with worse outcomes, this did not differ significantly by assigned subgroup (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). In both cohorts, the myeloid dysregulation score remained significantly associated with 30-d mortality after adjustment for immune status (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). Overall, these results suggest that Hi-DEF is not significantly affected by baseline immunocompromise as defined in these cohorts and can be used to further substratify this high-risk population.

Numerous clinical trials of immune-modulating agents in critical illness have been negative, which is often attributed to underlying biological heterogeneity causing differential treatment response4. We hypothesized that our proposed Hi-DEF would reduce the biological heterogeneity and be associated with a differential treatment response.

To test this hypothesis, we first used the SAVE-MORE cohort, a randomized controlled trial of anakinra in noncritically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and elevated soluble urokinase plasminogen-activating receptor, which showed a mortality benefit of anakinra in the entire cohort44. In this study, dysregulation was defined by a z-score greater than or equal to the median dysregulation score in noncritically ill, infected patients across all SUBSPACE cohorts. Patients with lymphoid dysregulation at baseline treated with anakinra had a significantly lower rate of 28-d mortality (2.2%) compared with those treated with placebo (20.8%, Fisher's P = 0.02, P (interaction) = 0.05; Fig. 6a). There was no difference in 28-d mortality rate in patients without baseline lymphoid dysregulation (P = 0.77). It is interesting that the subgroup of patients with lymphoid dysregulation experienced the highest mortality benefit from anakinra, but those with only myeloid dysregulation did not (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). This survival benefit in patients with lymphoid dysregulation remained significant even after adjustment for age, sex and baseline sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0.06, 95% CI 0.008–0.53, P = 0.01; Fig. 6b). Together these results suggest that anakinra preferentially benefits patients with baseline lymphoid dysregulation.

a, Evaluation of 28-d mortality rate on the y axis stratified by high and low lymphoid dysregulation scores (defined by z-score ≥ 1.65) and anakinra (gold) versus placebo (gray) treatment in patients with COVID-19 in the SAVE-MORE clinical trial, using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Dysregulation was defined based on median scores across all noncritically ill, infected patients in SUBSPACE. Lymphoid dysregulation is associated with a disproportionate benefit from anakinra therapy relative to patients with low (balanced) lymphoid responses. b, Evaluation of Kaplan–Meier survival curve for 28-d survival in patients with lymphoid dysregulation stratified by anakinra (gold) and placebo (gray) in the SAVE-MORE trial. Cox's proportional HR is adjusted for age, sex and SOFA score. c, Evaluation of 30-d mortality (y axis) in the VICTAS trial (a randomized controlled trial of vitamin C, thiamine and hydrocortisone in critically ill patients with sepsis) stratified by high and low lymphoid dysregulation score and treatment (red) versus placebo (gray). Dysregulation was defined by the median score across all infected, critically ill patients in SUBSPACE, and the significance was assessed using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons. The results indicate that lymphoid dysregulation was associated with disproportionate benefit from steroids, vitamin C and thiamine therapy. d, Evaluation of Kaplan–Meier survival curve for 30-d survival in patients with lymphoid dysregulation stratified by treatment (red) versus placebo (gray) in the VICTAS trial. Cox's proportional HR is adjusted for age and sex. e, Evaluation of the 28-d mortality rate (y axis) in the VANISH trial (a clinical trial of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock) stratified by high and low lymphoid dysregulation score (defined by median score) and randomized steroid treatment (red). The significance was assessed using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons. Patients with a low (balanced) lymphoid dysregulation score were disproportionately harmed by steroid therapy.

Next, we evaluated whether Hi-DEF was associated with a differential response to corticosteroids using two independent studies. The VICTAS trial was a randomized controlled trial of hydrocortisone, vitamin C and thiamine in 501 patients with sepsis45. A subset of patients (n = 141) had blood transcriptome data available. We excluded the 52 (37%) patients who received open-label steroids (and were thus randomized only to receipt of thiamine and vitamin C versus placebo). Patients were divided into subgroups based on whether dysregulation scores were greater than or equal to median scores across all infected, critically ill patients in the SUBSPACE consortium. In this limited cohort of patients with available RNA-seq data, there was a trend toward mortality benefit (26% mortality rate in placebo versus 11% with the three-drug active treatment; Fisher's P = 0.11). Again, this apparent benefit was driven by the patients with lymphoid dysregulation at baseline. In patients with high lymphoid dysregulation scores, those treated with hydrocortisone had significantly lower mortality rates compared with those in the placebo arm (11% versus 39%, OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.03–1.06, Fisher's P = 0.03; Fig. 6c). This survival difference was robust after adjustment for age and sex (adjusted HR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.06–0.85, P = 0.03; Fig. 6d). The differences were not observed in patients with myeloid dysregulation (Supplementary Fig. 13c,d).

We also evaluated whether lymphoid dysregulation was associated with a differential response to corticosteroids in the VANISH cohort, a randomized controlled, factorial trial that evaluated norepinephrine versus vasopressin and hydrocortisone versus placebo in patients with septic shock46, with no difference in mortality rate related to hydrocortisone administration in the overall trial of 409 patients. In the subset of 176 patients with RNA expression data, hydrocortisone treatment was associated with a 38% mortality rate in those treated with hydrocortisone, compared with 22% in those not treated with hydrocortisone (P = 0.03). Unlike the SAVE-MORE and VICTAS trials, where the benefit of treatment was limited to subgroups with lymphoid dysregulation, this difference in the VANISH cohort was driven largely by increased mortality in patients with low (balanced) lymphoid dysregulation scores treated with hydrocortisone relative to those who did not receive steroids (28-d mortality rate 42% versus 16%, OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.2–12.6, P = 0.02; Fig. 6e). This difference was not seen based on myeloid dysregulation (Supplementary Fig. 13e,f).

Collectively, these results demonstrated that Hi-DEF provides flexibility for context-specific evaluation and has the potential to identify appropriate immunomodulatory treatment for patients with critical illness, reducing the heterogeneity of treatment effects.

In this study, we demonstrated that previously defined sepsis endotypes are biologically similar, leading to the identification of four consensus endotypes. We further found that these endotypes were defined by detrimental and protective immune responses and cellular origin (myeloid or lymphoid). Based on these results, we proposed an immune dysregulation evaluation framework, Hi-DEF, that is defined by two continuous scores and generalizes to both infectious and noninfectious critical illnesses, including sepsis, burn, trauma and ARDS, irrespective of patient age and immunosuppression status. Finally, we demonstrated that Hi-DEF could identify molecularly homogeneous groups of patients with a differential response to anakinra in COVID-19 and steroids in sepsis, suggesting its potential application for targeted therapeutic intervention.

Our findings mirror those identified by Scicluna et al.47, who used independent cohorts of predominantly bacterial sepsis to assess overlap among a subset of endotyping schemas analyzed here (SRS, MARS and Sweeney). They identified three consensus transcriptomic subtypes (CTSs) that align with our findings: CTS1 includes SRS1, MARS2 and inflammopathic endotypes; CTS2 includes MARS1 and coagulopathic endotypes; and CTS3 includes SRS2, MARS3 and adaptive endotypes. CTS1, CTS2 and CTS3 correspond broadly to myeloid dysregulation, lymphoid dysregulation and lymphoid protective clusters in our results. The fourth myeloid protective cluster defined in our analysis, which included MARS4 and SoM module 3, is predominantly driven by mature neutrophil and monocyte populations and interferon responses. Its identification in this study is likely due to the inclusion of additional protective myeloid scores (SoM module 3 and the Wong signature) as well as inclusion of numerous viral infections, where monocyte interferon responses play a crucial role, further highlighting the importance of context in identifying clinically relevant subgroups.

Importantly, we found that the number of endotypes varied based on disease etiology and severity, suggesting the number of ‘clinically relevant' endotypes may depend on the clinical question posed. For instance, if the goal is prognostication, two endotypes (high risk versus low risk) based on lower dimensional ‘system-wide' dysregulation may be sufficient, such as is seen for ARDS latent class analysis sub-phenotypes, the TriVerity severity score and the original SRS1 and SRS2 endotypes12,48,49. However more nuanced clinical trial designs may rely on and benefit from sub-phenotyping based on specified myeloid or lymphoid dysregulated endotypes. Finally, any immune response is context dependent, with appropriate responses depending on the severity of the insult and/or pathogen. Therefore, we believe that Hi-DEF, in which axes of myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation may be used in isolation or collectively, has the potential to define immune dysregulation across critical illness syndromes and allow for rapid advancements in the field of critical care.

Our findings provide further evidence that neutrophils, particularly immature neutrophils, and loss of protective T and natural killer (NK) cells are associated with infection severity50,51,52,53. It is interesting that lymphoid dysregulation was more strongly associated with severe viral infections, whereas myeloid dysregulation showed a stronger link to severity in bacterial infections, burns or trauma. This aligns with the distinct immune pathways activated by viral versus bacterial pathogens and highlights the utility of Hi-DEF's flexibility. Notably, we found that ARDS was more closely linked with lymphoid dysregulation, even though myeloid dysregulation was more associated with mortality. Prior studies have suggested that T cell dysregulation may be associated with ARDS and these results warrant further evaluation across other ARDS cohorts54.

In addition, the association of lymphoid dysregulation with a differential treatment response to corticosteroids is in line with prior studies5,18. As interleukin-1 is predominantly released by myeloid cells, however, the differential treatment effect to anakinra seen in this subset of patients is counterintuitive. Overall, ‘lymphoid dysregulation' in this study is related to loss of protective lymphocyte subsets, potentially correlating with the ‘immune exhaustion' state that has previously been described12. In particular, T or NK cells are known to play an important role in mitigating inflammation in the macrophage activation syndrome; thus loss or dysfunction of these cells likely plays a key role in the uncontrolled inflammation that anakinra is targeting55,56. Our results suggest that limiting cytokine activation in this ‘exhausted' immune state may be beneficial and show that further study into the mechanism of anakinra's benefits in this subgroup is indicated.

Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the largest multi-cohort analysis to date aimed at understanding the biology of critical illness. Integrating >7,000 samples with rich metadata enabled robust evaluation of the similarities between endotyping schemas, their comparison to clinical markers and their association with outcomes. The SUBSPACE cohorts and gene expression data represent a monumental step forward for critical care transcriptomic research because these 4,106 samples enriched for high severity patients have not previously been evaluated. The significance of these findings across multiple gene expression measurement techniques, cohorts, age groups, etiologies and disease states adds to the credibility and generalizability of these findings. The use of healthy participants, when possible, to define dysregulation further increases the generalizability of these findings and could facilitate cross-platform quantification and endotyping. Inclusion of noninfectious critical care data provides evidence of the similarities in systemic dysregulation. The inclusion of single-cell data allowed for nuanced evaluation for the underlying biology of these findings. The inclusion of treatment data shows the association of these scores with treatment outcomes and the potential of this framework to advance precision medicine.

Our study has several limitations. Hi-DEF aims to provide a unifying template for quantifying immune dysregulation by consolidating published endotyping signatures and is purposefully simplistic. In particular, the continuous scores outlined here were designed as a proof of concept and are a conglomerate of genes derived from the signatures used to identify these consensus endotypes. We included all genes that met inclusion criteria and defined detrimental and protective genes based on empirical evidence from prior studies. Thus, although these genes in aggregate were somewhat selective for myeloid and lymphoid compartments, more selective cell-type-specific genes may be identified. More discovery-oriented approaches may also identify other relevant genes or cell-specific or pathway-specific dysregulation. Finally, the genes and thresholds used in this study were used to demonstrate the potential for clinical utility. These scores and thresholds require further fine-tuning depending on the patient, disease and treatment contexts. In addition, the immune dysregulation quantified by Hi-DEF is correlated with, but may not be causative of, severe outcomes. These samples were also predominantly collected within the first 24–48 h of hospitalization or ICU admission and disproportionately represent patients from the United States of America and Europe. Finally, across all clinical trials assessed for differential treatment response, only a subgroup of patients in the broader studies underwent gene expression analysis, which may introduce bias. Furthermore, the analyses of treatment responsiveness were post-hoc and exploratory in these small subgroups. Thus, these results are preliminary and should be interpreted with caution. Future prospective studies across broader population and infectious etiologies are needed to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of these results and validate these findings.

In summary, Hi-DEF provides a launching point for further prospective multi-omic investigations into critical illness immunobiology, as well as a more readily translatable, biology-based schema for developing precision medicine tools in the ICU. The Hi-DEF framework provides a shared, measurable foundation for biological endotyping and addresses several key issues observed with other sub-phenotyping schemas to facilitate clinical translation. First, by pinpointing biological pathways that are specifically enriched within each of the four consensus endotypes, it has the potential to help streamline candidate therapeutic targets for future hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies. Second, identifying cell-specific drivers of these consensus endotypes could pave the way for precision therapies aimed at modulating particularly detrimental cell subsets or states. In addition, our ability to quantify immune dysregulation on a continuous score further allows for adjustments based on patient, infection or insult type and the question being asked (that is, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment). Third, Hi-DEF is flexible and could be further refined and extended. For example, future research into more specific immature neutrophils, monocytes or T or NK cell subsets or addition of other cell types may enhance this framework. Perhaps more importantly, the methodology used here to build an endotyping consensus could provide a scaffold to build similar consensus and biological frameworks in heterogeneous disease states. Finally, using multiple gene expression measurement platforms (microarrays and RNA-seq) and defining dysregulation based on healthy participants provides an opportunity to facilitate translation to a rapid point-of-care measurement platform.

Together, these factors highlight the clinical potential of Hi-DEF as well as a path forward for this and other endotyping signatures. Although cross-platform validation is difficult and will require prospective validation, recent advances in RNA-seq technology have enabled the development of point-of-care, multivariate, gene expression signatures such as the TriVerity or Myrna platform, which is a sepsis diagnostic test that quantifies expression of 29 genes in approximately 30 min49. Future studies should focus on three key factors for clinical translation: (1) development of the framework into a parsimonious gene signature and identification of appropriate weighting and thresholding based on context to facilitate development and interpretation of point-of-care testing; (2) prospective validation of the utility of this framework and integration with existing clinical decision tools; and (3) measurement in therapeutic and platform trials to facilitate precision medicine clinical trials in critical care.

All age groups, races, ethnicities and sex or genders that met inclusion criteria with available gene expression data were included.

This study was designed as a large-scale biological evaluation of existing sepsis signatures. Analysis was split across three primary cohorts: public data, single-cell data and SUBSPACE data (Extended Data Table 1). Public data were collected through systematic review of publicly available whole-blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression data from the Genome Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress. All samples across all ages, with healthy controls and necessary severity metadata and gene expression data, were included in the analysis with an expectation of collecting >1,000 samples to be able to adequately assess the biological overlap of signatures. SUBSPACE was a consortium formed to collate existing biobanked whole-blood gene expression data from international collaborators with the intention to collect >4,000 samples. Samples were inclusive of all ages from neonate to >80-year-old individuals. Sex was self-reported across all sites.

All signatures, including the framework, were calculated blinded to patient phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Unsupervised clustering analysis methodologies (hierarchical clustering, PCA and network analysis) were pre-planned and performed in parallel across public and SUBSPACE data to ensure replicability with iterations across subgroups to ensure robustness of results.

Single-cell samples were collected from publicly available peripheral blood single-cell data inclusive of the neutrophil compartment in patients with infections. Sepsis signatures were calculated blinded to patient phenotype and collated according to the predefined clusters to evaluate the single-cell biology leading to sepsis dysregulation. Criteria to select genes for Hi-DEF were predefined and all genes meeting inclusion criteria were included for all subsequent analyses.

Subgroup cut-offs within Hi-DEF were predefined and subgroups were identified blinded to clinical outcomes. The analytical plan of outcomes and differential response to treatment were predefined. All samples that included necessary phenotypic information were included in primary analyses and performed in parallel when possible across public and SUBSPACE data to ensure reproducibility. Sensitivity analyses by site and clinical characteristics were performed to ensure robustness.

We performed a systematic review of publicly available whole-blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression data from infected individuals in the GEO and ArrayExpress (Supplementary Table 1). Cohorts were assessed and studies were excluded if they did not have healthy participants, the necessary severity metadata or the gene expression data needed for score calculation. Patients were assigned as severe versus nonsevere, with severe being defined based on ICU admission requirement or mortality.

Cohorts were co-normalized using COCONUT co-normalization. Co-normalization was assessed by evaluating expression of housekeeping genes and through UMAP analysis.

The SUBSPACE consortium is an international consortium of researchers focused on developing a better understanding of the underlying biology behind sepsis endotypes. Institutions and patient characteristics are outlined in Supplementary Table 2.

Before processing, samples in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes were removed from −80 °C to thaw at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were then inverted several times to achieve homogeneity. RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions with an elution volume of 80 μl.

The library preparation was done using the QIAseq Stranded Total RNA Library Kit with QIAseq FastSelect rRNA and globin depletion. The amount of 100 ng of starting material was heat fragmented. QIAseq FastSelect rRNA Globin or HMR was used to reduce the amount of unwanted RNA species. After first-strand and second-strand synthesis, the complementary DNA was end-repaired and 3ʹ-adenylated. Sequencing adapters were ligated to the overhangs. Adapted molecules were enriched by using 18 cycles of PCR and purified by a bead-based cleanup. Library preparation was quality controlled using capillary electrophoresis (Tape D1000). High-quality libraries were pooled based on equimolar concentrations. The library pool(s) were quantified using quantitative PCR and the optimal concentration of the library pool used to generate the clusters on the surface of a flow cell before sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina Inc.) instrument (on four S4 flowcells, 2× 75, 2× 10), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Data were co-normalized using COCONUT co-normalization. The MESSI cohort was excluded from co-normalization due to lack of healthy participants and used as a separate validation cohort. Co-normalization was assessed through evaluation of housekeeping genes and UMAP analysis.

We applied a total of seven previously defined gene expression sepsis endotyping signatures: Sweeney endotype signature, Yao endotype signature, Davenport SRS, Cano-Gamez SRS, Wong score, MARS endotype signature and the SoM signature. Continuous scores were calculated based on prior publications and scaled for analysis12,14,16,17,18,19,20.

We first performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis by applying the Ward method to Euclidean distances between scaled scores. The optimal number of clusters across infectious etiologies and severities were assessed by silhouette width. Significance was assessed by generating bootstrap P values with 1,000 repetitions. We then performed network analysis to identify interrelatedness of scores. Edges were defined based on a Spearman's correlation greater than the median or 0.33, whichever was greater. Score clusters were generated by a cluster-greedy forward algorithm.

To evaluate the immune cell origin of molecular endotypes, four peripheral blood scRNA-seq datasets inclusive of the neutrophil compartment were integrated. Integration was performed using the Seurat and Scanpy pathways. Cell assignments were made based on canonical cell markers cross-referenced with Seurat cluster assignments. Scaled scores were calculated for each individual cell, results were assessed by UMAP and conglomerate results of scaled scores by cell type were plotted to assess trends across sepsis signatures.

After identifying the cell type of origin, we then set out to develop a more granular score to interrogate specific parts of the immune response. We first separated single-cell expression data into four cell types of interest: immature neutrophils, neutrophils, monocytes and T or NK cells. We then evaluated scaled gene expression by cell line for all genes used across the seven signatures. To ensure cell specificity, a gene was included as part of the myeloid or lymphoid dysregulation score only if its scaled gene expression was >1 s.d. higher than other cell lines. Genes were then divided into detrimental and protective, based on whether the signature from which these genes were derived was previously defined as a detrimental or a protective cluster.

After identifying myeloid and lymphoid protective and detrimental genes, myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores were calculated as the geometric mean of detrimental genes minus the geometric mean of protective genes. Cell specificity was assessed using scaled scores overlaid on UMAPs.

To evaluate the association of myeloid and lymphoid scores with clinical outcomes, we first evaluated the performance of the continuous myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores. We evaluated the association of these scores across all severity levels using the JT t-test. We evaluated the association of these scores with severe infections and mortality using logistic regression.

We then set out to evaluate whether clinically meaningful cut-offs for myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation could be developed. To develop theoretical cut-offs, we evaluated scores relative to healthy participants. Within healthy participants, myeloid and lymphoid scores were generated as above and the population mean and s.d. were calculated. We then used this mean and s.d. to calculate a z-score for nonhealthy individuals. Dysregulation was defined as a z-score ≥ 1.65 across the SUBSPACE consortium, indicative of a score in the 95th percentile of healthy patients. This then allowed for subgrouping of patients into four theoretical subgroups: balanced (myeloid and lymphoid z-score < 1.65), myeloid dysregulation (myeloid z-score ≥ 1.65, lymphoid z-score < 1.65), lymphoid dysregulation (lymphoid z-score ≥ 1.65, myeloid z-score < 1.65) and system-wide (myeloid and lymphoid z-scores ≥ 1.65). For more specific, cohort-level questions, z-score thresholds were defined across the subspace dataset based on median dysregulation scores for the same patient population. For instance, when evaluating ICU cohorts, abnormal dysregulation was defined as greater than or equal to the median dysregulation across all ICU-level patients in the SUBSPACE consortium dataset. When healthy participant gene expression was not available to allow for co-normalization, dysregulation was defined based on median myeloid and lymphoid scores within the cohort. Using these cut-offs, we evaluated the association of each subgroup with severity and mortality using Fisher's exact test.

To evaluate why prior subgrouping schemas identified different numbers of endotypes, we evaluated how myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation differed across patient cohorts. We evaluated the differences in mean and s.d. of myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation by severity and infectious etiology. We then evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of different myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores for discriminating mild, severe and fatal diseases.

We then tested whether myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation was associated with a differential treatment response to immune modulation. We first evaluated treatment response to anakinra in the SAVE-MORE trial, which was included in the SUBSPACE consortium. The SAVE-MORE trial was a randomized controlled trial of anakinra in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had elevated soluble urokinase plasminogen-activating receptor levels. We evaluated the differential mortality in patients with myeloid or lymphoid dysregulation, defined based on dysregulation scores greater than or equal to those present in infected, noncritically ill patients, using Fisher's exact test. Interaction terms were generated using logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and the SOFA score. Cox's proportional HRs were calculated, adjusting for age sex and the SOFA score.

To evaluate the association of steroid treatment with differential outcomes, we turned to two randomized controlled trials: VICTAS, a randomized controlled trial of hydrocortisone, thiamine and vitamin C in critically ill sepsis patients45; and VANISH46, a randomized controlled factorial trial comparing norepinephrine versus vasopressin and hydrocortisone versus placebo. In VICTAS, which had healthy participants for co-normalization, dysregulation was defined as greater than or equal to the median dysregulation score across all infected, critically ill patients. In VANISH, which did not have healthy participants to allow for co-normalization, dysregulation was defined by the median score within the cohort. We evaluated differential outcomes among myeloid and lymphoid dysregulated patients using Fisher's exact test. For both cohorts, logistic regression was performed, adjusting for sex and APACHE II score. In the VICTAS cohort, where survival data were available, Cox's proportional HRs were calculated, adjusting for sex and APACHE II score.

Cluster: a broad definition denoting a group of similar patients or samples. In general, cluster is used in this paper to broadly denote samples that are identified as similar based on their biomarker profiles before evaluating biological relevance.

Endotype: a subgroup within a syndrome, based on distinct pathways, profiles or signatures that drive the disease.

Signature: a predefined analytical tool to identify patient endotypes. In general, signature is used in this paper to denote a priori defined methods using gene expression data to identify sepsis endotypes.

Modules: a set of independent units that are combined to calculate a single more complex signature or score. In this paper, this is used in the context of the SoM endotyping signature, which is divided into four modules: two detrimental modules (1 and 2) and two protective modules (3 and 4) that together define a patient's SoM score.

*Consensus clusters and how they are utilized to define the framework are denoted by the color scheme (blue, green, purple, and red). This color scheme is found throughout applicable clustering figures.

Silhouette width index identifies differing “ideal” number of clusters depending on patient inclusion criteria. (a) Silhouette width index if all patient's are included (healthy and infected). (b) Silhouette width index if only patients with infections are included. (c) Silhouette width index if only severe infections (those requiring intensive care unit) are included. (d) Silhouette width index if only bacterial infections are included. (e) Silhouette width index if only viral infections are included. (f) Two-sided bootstrap probabilities generated with 1000 repetitions show significance of these four clusters.

Spearman correlation coefficients of up-regulated genes within each of the 7 endotypes signatures in public (bottom left) and SUBSPACE (top right) data indicates that while different genes were used across the prior endotyping signatures, that these genes are highly correlated.

Forest plots showing log(odds ratio) and 95% confidence intervals of 30-day mortality in viral and bacterial infections in the SUBSPACE dataset by myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores shows that lymphoid dysregulation is more associated with outcomes in viral infections whereas myeloid dysregulation score is more associated with outcomes in bacterial infections.

(a). The immune dysregulation framework applied to SUBSPACE co-normalized data. Cut-offs are defined by a Z-score of 1.65 relative to healthy patients. Black dots represent patients with severe infectious (defined by ICU admission) while tan dots represent non-severe infections. (b). Barplot representing proportion of 30-day mortality (y-axis) by immune dysregulation framework subgroup (x-axis). Odds ratio calculated using two-sided Fisher's exact test unadjusted for multiple comparisons comparing patients with dysregulation on any axis relative to “Balanced” subgroup. Dysregulation on either myeloid or lymphoid axis (inclusive of lymphoid dysregulation (n = 586), myeloid dysregulation (n = 125), and system-wide dysregulation (n = 896) subgroups) was associated with 30-day mortality with an odds ratio of 3.4 (95% CI 2.3 – 5.4, p = 4.1e-11) compared to patients in the balanced subgroup (n = 606).

Mean and standard deviation of myeloid and lymphoid dysregulation scores by infection status in patients requiring intensive care unit level of care indicating that values differ by infectious etiology even amongst similar severity levels. (b). Sensitivity (solid line) and specificity (dashed line) of myeloid dysregulation score for discriminating severe from non-severe infections in viral (purple) vs bacterial (gold) infections shows that “ideal” threshold may vary across infectious individuals. (c). Sensitivity (solid line) and specificity (dashed line) of lymphoid dysregulation score for discriminating severe from non-severe infections in viral (purple) vs bacterial (gold) infections shows that “ideal” threshold may vary across infectious individuals.

The Atlas blue butterfly, also known as Polyommatus atlantica, has been genetically confirmed as having the highest number of chromosomes out of all multicellular animals in the world.

This insect boasts 229 pairs of chromosomes, while many of its close relatives have only 23 or 24 pairs. Researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (IBE: CSIC-UPF), Barcelona, have revealed that these chromosomes have been broken up over time, instead of duplicated.

The first genomic study of this butterfly, published on September 10 in Current Biology, allows experts to begin to explore the evolutionary reasons behind this extreme number of chromosomes. Chromosome changes are also seen in human cancer cells, and therefore, understanding this process in different species could help inform cancer research.

This is the first time that the Atlas blue butterfly has been sequenced. From this, experts have produced a gold-standard reference genome for this species, allowing researchers to compare this extreme genome to other butterflies and moths to understand more about how species form and change over time.

Evolution and the development of new species happen over millions of years, making it hard to study practically. Instead, experts can use the DNA of a species and compare this to others in the same family to understand which genes and traits have been kept and which have been lost and then make informed guesses as to why.

Having the genetic story of a species also allows us to understand how the next chapter might go. For example, we might be able to understand how a species could respond to the increasing global temperature and if they have any genes or mechanisms that might protect them. This could inform conservation efforts as well as research into producing more resilient crops.

The Atlas blue butterfly is found in the mountain ranges of Morocco and northeast Algeria. While it had been suspected to have the most chromosome pairs in the animal kingdom, this is the first time experts have sequenced the butterfly genome to confirm1. For comparison, a close relative found widely in the UK, the Common blue butterfly, has 24 chromosomes.

Changes in chromosome numbers are thought to contribute to the process of new species forming and help species adapt to their environment. The group to which the Atlas blue butterfly belongs contains many closely related species that evolved over a short period of time.

In this new research, the team found that the chromosomes had been spilt up at points where the DNA is less tightly wound. This means there was roughly the same amount of genetic information, but it was packaged in smaller sections. All of the chromosomes, apart from the sex chromosomes, were cut up, and the researchers estimate that this caused the chromosome number to go from 24 to 229 over roughly three million years -- a relatively short amount of time by evolutionary standards.

Usually, it is assumed that this kind of extreme chromosomal change is negative; however, the Atlas blue butterfly has evolved and survived for millions of years. It is only now, due to climate change and human impacts on the environment, such as the destruction of cedar forests and overgrazing, that its populations are under threat.

This research raises multiple questions that can now be addressed in the future. Splitting up the chromosomes could help give greater genetic diversity by allowing more frequent shuffling of genome parts or give other unknown benefits. While this may help butterflies to rapidly adapt, species with many chromosomes may also face challenges due to the extra complexity of this, potentially making them more vulnerable to extinction over time. Further investigations and comparisons with other butterflies could highlight whether any genes have been lost or preserved, giving us more information on the biology of the butterflies, but also a deeper understanding of evolution.

Chromosomal rearrangements also happen in human cancers, and therefore, studying these processes in the Atlas blue butterfly DNA could lead to new developments in human health and highlight possible ways to reduce or stop this phenomenon in cancer cells.

Dr Roger Vila, senior author at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology, said: "Breaking down chromosomes has been seen in other species of butterflies, but not on this level, suggesting that there are important reasons for this process which we can now start to explore. Additionally, as chromosomes hold all the secrets of a species, investigating whether these changes impact a butterfly's behaviour could help form a full picture of how and why new species occur."

Dr Charlotte Wright, first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "When we set out to start to understand evolution in butterflies, we knew we had to sequence the most extreme, and somewhat mysterious, Atlas blue butterfly. Thanks to Roger Vila, who had previously worked with his colleague to find and identify this elusive butterfly, we were able to sequence this species, highlighting the collaborative nature of science. Being able to see, in detail, how the Atlas blue butterfly chromosomes have been split over time in specific places, we can start to investigate what benefits this might have, how it impacts their ability to adapt to their environment, and whether there are any lessons we can learn from their DNA that might aid conservation in the future."

Professor Mark Blaxter, senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: "Genomes hold the key to how a creature came to be, but also, where it might go in the future. To be able to tell the story of our planet, we must have the story of each species and see where they overlap and interact with each other. It also allows us to apply learnings from one genome to another. For example, rearranging chromosomes is also seen in human cancer cells, and understanding this process in the Atlas blue butterfly could help find ways to limit or stop this in cancer cells in the future."

Key takeaways

UCLA researchers have uncovered a link between "morning sickness" symptoms and the body's natural, but complex, inflammatory response to biological and bodily changes during pregnancy.

According to the National Institutes of Health, up to 80% of early-stage pregnant mothers experience some nausea, vomiting and aversions to certain foods and smells. While uncomfortable, these symptoms are not typically a sign that anything is wrong with the health of the mother or the developing fetus, but rather an indication of a delicate balance unique to pregnant women.

"During pregnancy, a mother's immune system faces a tricky challenge: it has to protect both her and the fetus from infection, but without accidentally attacking the fetus, whose genetic identity is half-foreign because it is half derived from the father. Normally, the immune system attacks anything that seems foreign, so in pregnancy, it has to carefully adjust to keep the fetus safe while still defending against infection," said UCLA anthropology professor Molly Fox.

Fox is the corresponding author of the study "Of scents and cytokines: How olfactory and food aversions relate to nausea and immunomodulation in early pregnancy," recently published in the journal Evolution, Medicine and Public Health.

The researchers believe that this delicate balance, which protects mother and fetus, is achieved by a unique mix of inflammatory responses. They function to prevent the mother's body from rejecting the fetus, alongside adaptive behavioral mechanisms, like nausea, that encourage the mother to avoid foods that are potentially harmful, especially in the first and second trimesters when the fetus is most vulnerable.

"Nausea, vomiting or aversions to foods or smells are not indications that something is going wrong for the mother or the fetus. It's likely an indication that everything is moving along normally, and a reflection of the body's healthy and helpful immune response," said UCLA anthropology professor and paper co-author Daniel Fessler.

Methodology and findings

For the study, the UCLA-led team of anthropologists and epidemiologists collected and analyzed blood samples to measure immune system molecules called cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that send signals to help the body launch a quick defense against sickness and regulate inflammation. Participants also filled out questionnaires that asked about morning sickness-related symptoms and food and smell aversions during the early stages of pregnancy. The participants were 58 Latina women in Southern California who were followed beginning in early pregnancy through the postpartum.

Sixty-four percent of study participants experienced odor or food aversions, primarily to tobacco smoke and meat. Sixty-seven percent reported nausea and 66% experienced vomiting.

The study team measured cytokines that promote inflammation (pro-inflammatory) as well as cytokines that suppress inflammation (anti-inflammatory). They found that women who experienced an aversion to tobacco smoke showed a noticeable shift toward a more inflammatory response. Food aversions, nausea and vomiting were also associated with a more pro-inflammatory immune balance.

Natural selection?

The correlation is consistent with researchers' theory that these symptoms may be part of an evolutionary adaptation that helps pregnant mothers' bodies minimize exposure to harmful substances, though the study's authors caution that the evidence is not definitive and more research is needed.

They emphasized that the study allowed the team to look at both human biological and behavioral responses during pregnancy.

"In many mammals, the fetal compartment has barriers separating it from the mother's blood supply, where her immune cells are. But in humans, we have a unique setup -- fetal cells are bathed in maternal blood. Humans have the most invasive of all placentas, burrowing deep into maternal tissue. So humans need unique strategies to prevent the mother's immune system from attacking the fetus," said Fox.

These immunological changes may induce nausea, which in turn encourages food avoidance that might act as an additional layer of protection, according to the researchers

"Nowadays, you will see labels on packages of ground beef or soft cheese that warn pregnant women to be cautious about these products because of the risks of foodborne illness during pregnancy. Aversions to certain odors and foods, and nausea and even vomiting, appear to be evolution's way of achieving that same objective," said Fessler.

Practical implications

The researchers, including first author Dayoon Kwon, who just completed her Ph.D. in epidemiology at UCLA (and is now a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford), said that the study could help bolster recognition that nausea and vomiting are normal symptoms with biological underpinnings associated with healthy pregnancies. The study's results could help in paving the way for common-sense workplace accommodations, such as more efficient deployment of health care benefits and other helpful resources to reduce stigma, excessive absences and lost productivity.

They also encourage other researchers to continue to look into the questions raised by the study, to not only explore the evolutionary questions, but to work toward providing clinicians with non- or low-invasive measures of prognoses.

Strong Northern Lights-like activity is the standout feature of today's weather report, which is coming at you from a strange, extrasolar world, instead of a standard TV studio. That is thanks to astronomers from Trinity College Dublin, who used the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope to take a close look at the weather of a toasty nearby rogue planet, SIMP-0136.

The exquisite sensitivity of the instruments on board the space-based telescope enabled the team to see minute changes in brightness of the planet as it rotated, which were used to track changes in temperature, cloud cover and chemistry. 

Surprisingly, these observations also illuminated SIMP-0136's strong auroral activity, similar to the Northern Lights here on Earth or the powerful aurora on Jupiter, which heat up its upper atmosphere.

“These are some of the most precise measurements of the atmosphere of any extra-solar object to date, and the first time that changes in the atmospheric properties have been directly measured,” said Dr Evert Nasedkin, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Trinity College Dublin's School of Physics, who is the lead author of the research article just published in leading international journal, Astronomy & Astrophysics. 

“And at over 1,500 °C, SIMP-0136 makes this summer's heat wave look mild,” he continued. “The precise observations we made meant we could accurately record temperature changes smaller than 5 °C. These changes in temperature were related to subtle changes in the chemical composition of this free-floating planet, which is suggestive of storms – similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot – rotating into view.”

Another surprise finding was the lack of variability of the clouds on SIMP-0136. One might expect changes in the cloud coverage to lead to changes in the atmosphere, similar to observing patches of clouds and blue sky here on Earth. Instead, the team found that the cloud coverage was constant over the surface of SIMP-0136. At the temperatures of SIMP-0136 these clouds are unlike those on earth, instead composed of silicate grains, similar to sand on a beach. 

This is the first publication from the new ‘Exo-Aimsir' group led by Prof. Johanna Vos in Trinity's School of Physics, and includes contributions from all the group members, including PhD candidates Merle Schrader, Madeline Lam and Cian O'Toole.

These data were initially published by a similar team led by Allison McCarthy at Boston University, but the new analysis has revealed more details about the atmosphere. 

“Different wavelengths of light are related to different atmospheric features. Similar to observing the changes in colour over the surface of the earth, the changes in the colour of SIMP-0136 are driven by changes in the atmospheric properties,” added Dr. Nasedkin. “So by using cutting-edge models, we could infer the temperature of the atmosphere, the chemical composition, and the position of the clouds.” 

Prof. Vos said: “This work is exciting because it shows that by applying our state-of-the-art modelling techniques to cutting-edge datasets from JWST, we can begin to piece together the processes that drive weather in worlds beyond our solar system. Understanding these weather processes will be crucial as we continue to discover and characterize exoplanets in the future.”

“While for now these types of spectroscopic variability observations are limited to isolated brown dwarfs, like this one, future observations with the Extremely Large Telescope and eventually the Habitable Worlds Observatory will enable the study of the atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets, from Jupiter-like gas giants to rocky worlds.”

On Tuesday, OpenAI announced the release of Sora 2, an audio and video generator to succeed last year's Sora. Along with the model, the company also launched a linked social app called Sora, where users can be able to generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. OpenAI's work on a new social platform was previously reported by Wired.

While we haven't been able to test the invite-only app and Sora 2 model ourselves yet, OpenAI has shared impressive examples. In particular, Sora 2 is better at following the laws of physics, making the videos more realistic. OpenAI's public clips depict a beach volleyball game, skateboard tricks, gymnastics routines, and cannonball jumps from a diving board, among others.

“Prior video models are overoptimistic — they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. “For example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard.”

The Sora app comes with an “upload yourself” feature called “cameos,” which allows users to drop themselves into any Sora-generated scenes. In order to use their own likeness in a generated video, users will have to upload a one-time video-and-audio recording to verify their identity and capture their appearance.

This feature also allows users to share their “cameos” with their friends, allowing them to give other users the permission to include their likeness in videos that they generate, including videos of multiple people together. 

“We think a social app built around this ‘cameos' feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2,” the company wrote.

The Sora iOS app is available to download now and will initially roll out in the U.S. and Canada, though OpenAI says it hopes to expand quickly to other countries. While the Sora social platform is currently invite-only, ChatGPT Pro users should be able to try out the Sora 2 Pro model without an invite.

Once videos are generated, they can be shared in a feed within the Sora app, which seems like it'll be similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or other short form video feeds. Interestingly, Meta announced just last week that it added a video feed called “Vibes” to its Meta AI app (it's basically all mindless slop).

To curate its algorithmic recommendations, OpenAI will consider a user's Sora activity, their location (attained via their IP address), their past post engagement, and their ChatGPT conversation history, though that can be turned off. The Sora app also ships with parental controls via ChatGPT, which allow parents to override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithmic personalization, and manage who can direct message their child. However, these features are only as powerful as the parent's technical know-how. 

The Sora app will be free at launch, which OpenAI says is “so people can freely explore its capabilities.” The company says that at launch, the only plan for monetization to charge users to generate extra videos in times of high demand.

The launch of a social platform will require significant user safety measures from OpenAI, which has struggled with the same issues in ChatGPT. While users can revoke access to their likeness at any time, this sort of access can easily be abused. Even if a user trusts someone they know with access to their AI likeness, that person could still generate deceptive content that could be used to harm that person. Non-consensual videos are a persistent problem with AI-generated video, causing significant harm with few laws explicitly governing platform responsibility.

Bothell, Wash.-based Portal Space Systems says it has successfully tested its solar thermal propulsion system at operational temperatures inside a vacuum chamber, marking a first for the commercial space industry.

The test marks a key step in the development of Portal's 3D-printed heat exchanger thruster, known as Flare. The thruster is part of a propulsion system that converts concentrated sunlight into heat. That heat would, in turn, warm up an ammonia-based propellant to produce thrust and send Portal's Supernova satellite platform where it needs to go.

Supernova is designed to maneuver payloads quickly between orbital locations — for example, to head off close encounters between a growing number of commercial satellites, or to respond to space-based threats from rivals such as China and Russia.

NASA and the U.S. Air Force have experimented with solar thermal propulsion since the 1960s, but Portal is the first commercial venture to capitalize on the concept. Solar thermal propulsion would make Supernova more maneuverable than traditional spacecraft — with the ability to change orbits within hours or days, rather than weeks or months.

“With maneuverability becoming a defining advantage in space operations, Supernova is built to give national security and commercial operators the ability to reposition, respond and persist across orbits,” Portal CEO Jeff Thornburg said today in a news release. “This propulsion system unlocks mission tactics and timelines that traditional chemical or electric systems simply can't support.”

For the vacuum chamber test at Portal's Bothell lab, engineers used an electrical induction system to simulate the sun's heating power. The apparatus reached temperatures in the range of 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,700 degrees Fahrenheit), and the performance of the thruster validated Portal's propulsion architecture for integration with future flight hardware.

Supernova's first full-scale demonstration mission is currently scheduled for launch in 2026. Last year, Portal received a commitment of $45 million in funding through the U.S. Air Force's SpaceWERX STRATFI program to support spacecraft development. In April, the company reported raising $17.5 million in private seed funding.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon unveiled an updated slate of Echo, Kindle, Ring, Fire TV and Blink devices at an event Tuesday morning in New York City — reviving its past tradition of unleashing a dizzying array of new hardware and services in advance of the holiday shopping season.

If there was a common thread, beyond Amazon devices chief Panos Panay's well-known obsession with hardware design, it was artificial intelligence.

The company showed AI upgrades across the lineup, many of them integrating its Alexa+ voice assistant — its latest bid to close the gap with ChatGPT and other AI chatbots. 

Echo and Alexa+: Amazon introduced four new and upgraded Echo models — Echo Dot Max, Echo Studio, Echo Show 8, and Echo Show 11 — designed to work with Alexa+, the revamped voice assistant, which has been rolling out through an early access program this year.

The company said the new devices use custom AI silicon and a new sensor platform called Omnisense to enable more natural conversations, proactive reminders, personalized wellness suggestions, and responses that are more aware of the user's context.

Amazon also announced a new Alexa+ Store — a marketplace for third-party services and add-ons designed to expand its capabilities.

Kindle: A new “Story So Far” feature will give readers spoiler-free recaps, while “Ask this Book” lets them highlight passages and get AI-generated context about characters or scenes.

Amazon's redesigned Kindle Scribe e-ink tablet can search handwritten notes and generate summaries. Amazon previewed a feature to send documents to Alexa+ for follow-up conversations. It also comes in a new color version, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft.

Amazon said the next generation of Kindle Scribe will roll out later this year in the U.S., starting at $499.99, with the new color version, Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, starting at $629.99. A lower-priced black-and-white model without a front light is slated for early next year at $429.99.

Ring: An AI-powered “Search Party” feature is designed to help reunite lost dogs with their families. When a neighbor reports a missing pet in the Ring app, people with nearby outdoor Ring cameras can participate in the search, with AI flagging possible matches and notifying them if the dog appears. 

Amazon says Ring users will remain in control of their privacy, with the choice to ignore alerts or share information with neighbors.

Separately, a new “Familiar Faces” feature reduces unnecessary alerts by recognizing people you know. According to Amazon, it's designed to cut down on routine notifications while adding context to events captured in the Ring app

A new “Alexa+ Greetings” feature on Ring cameras turns Alexa into a virtual doorman, handling deliveries, greeting visitors, or turning away solicitors.

Fire TV: Amazon also introduced new and updated Fire TV Sticks and televisions. The company says the devices are faster and more efficient, with slimmer designs and improved picture quality, and run on a new operating system called Vega. 

Alexa+ is built into the new models, enabling more conversational searches, personalized recommendations, and features such as finding specific scenes or surfacing live sports stats

Blink: New 2K+ cameras add AI-powered person and vehicle detection, along with stitched panoramic views through a new “Blink Arc” system.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek

MediaTek's chips power over 2 billion devices a year. From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever. As AI moves from the edge to the cloud, MediaTek's high-end chips make intelligent devices even smarter.

Peter Thiel's Armageddon speaking tour has—like the world—not ended yet. For a full two years now, the billionaire has been on the circuit, spreading his biblically inflected ideas about doomsday through a set of variably and sometimes visibly perplexed interviewers. He has chatted onstage with the economist podcaster Tyler Cowen about the katechon (the scriptural term for “that which withholds” the end times); traded some very awkward on-camera silences with the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat; and is, at this very moment, in the midst of delivering a four-part, off-the-record lecture series about the Antichrist in San Francisco.

Depending on who you are, you may find it hilarious, fascinating, insufferable, or horrifying that one of the world's most powerful men is obsessing over a figure from sermons and horror movies. But the ideas and influences behind these talks are key to understanding how Thiel sees his own massive role in the world—in politics, technology, and the fate of the species. And to really grasp Thiel's katechon-and-Antichrist schtick, you need to go back to the first major lecture of his doomsday road show—which took place on an unusually hot day in Paris in 2023. No video cameras recorded the event, and no reporters wrote about it, but I've been able to reconstruct it by talking to people who were there.

The venue was a yearly conference of scholars devoted to Thiel's chief intellectual influence, the late French-American theorist René Girard. (Thiel identifies as a “hardcore Girardian.”) On the evening of the unpublicized lecture, dozens of Girardian philosophers and theologians from around the world filed into a modest lecture hall at the Catholic University of Paris. And from the dais, Thiel delivered a nearly hourlong account of his thoughts on Armageddon—and all the things he believed were “not enough” to prevent it.

By Thiel's telling, the modern world is scared, way too scared, of its own technology. Our “listless” and “zombie” age, he said, is marked by a growing hostility to innovation, plummeting fertility rates, too much yoga, and a culture mired in the “endless Groundhog Day of the worldwide web.” But in its neurotic desperation to avoid technological Armageddon—the real threats of nuclear war, environmental catastrophe, runaway AI—modern civilization has become susceptible to something even more dangerous: the Antichrist.

According to some Christian traditions, the Antichrist is a figure that will unify humanity under one rule before delivering us to the apocalypse. For Thiel, its evil is pretty much synonymous with any attempt to unite the world. “How might such an Antichrist rise to power?” Thiel asked. “By playing on our fears of technology and seducing us into decadence with the Antichrist's slogan: peace and safety.” In other words: It would yoke together a terrified species by promising to rescue it from the apocalypse.

For our politics issue, WIRED examines the state of tech's influence on governmental power—and the people who will change everything in the future.

By way of illustration, Thiel suggested that the Antichrist might appear in the form of someone like the philosopher Nick Bostrom—an AI doomer who wrote a paper in 2019 proposing to erect an emergency system of global governance, predictive policing, and restrictions on technology. But it wasn't just Bostrom. Thiel saw potential Antichrists in a whole zeitgeist of people and institutions “focused single-mindedly on saving us from progress, at any cost.”

So humanity is doubly screwed: It has to avoid both technological calamity and the reign of the Antichrist. But the latter was far more terrifying for the billionaire at the podium. For reasons grounded in Girardian theory, Thiel believed that such a regime could only—after decades of sickly, pent-up energy—set off an all-out explosion of vicious, civilization-ending violence. And he wasn't sure whether any katechons could hold it off.

When Thiel was finished, a moderator kicked off the Q&A session by noting, in so many words, that the speech had been a huge bummer. If the world was hurtling toward an apocalyptic crisis, he asked, what might the billionaire suggest we do?

Fend off the Antichrist, came the reply. But beyond that, Thiel said that he—like Girard—wasn't really in the business of offering practical advice.

A few moments later, someone in the audience stood and offered a correction. “It's not true what you said about Girard,” a man's voice said.

Thiel—who often has a tendency to stonewall or steamroll his interlocutors—squinted in the speaker's direction, trying to determine exactly who was pushing back. The voice had the rounded vowels and soft Rs of a recognizably Austrian accent and conveyed a quiet, familiar authority. “On many occasions,” the speaker went on, “young people asked Girard, ‘What should we do?' And Girard told them to go to church.”

Thiel finally seemed to recognize who was speaking. He leaned in toward the microphone: “Wolfgang?”

The voice belonged to Wolfgang Palaver, a 64-year old theologian from Innsbruck, Austria, whom Thiel had last seen in 2016, the year they both delivered eulogies at Girard's funeral. Palaver has a round face, a bookish white mustache, and eyes permanently crinkled at the corners by laugh lines. But that night in Paris, there was no trace of humor in his voice. And he evidently commanded the billionaire's respect.

Six months later, Thiel delivered his Armageddon lecture again, now at The Catholic University of America. According to a recap posted by one attendee, Thiel's argument was pretty much the same. Except this time Thiel told his listeners how they might personally navigate the slender path between Armageddon and the Antichrist: “Go to church.”

In an October interview at the Hoover Institution, Thiel echoed the line again: “Girard always said you just need to go to church, and I try to go to church.” This spring, during one of the podcaster Jordan Peterson's many failed attempts to interject, Thiel cut him off: “Girard's answer would still be something like: You should just go to church.”

It's not just that line. Although Thiel has never publicly acknowledged Wolfgang Palaver, the Austrian theologian's influence arguably runs through nearly everything Thiel has ever said or written about the Antichrist and the katechon. In the 1990s, Palaver wrote a series of papers about Carl Schmitt, the German legal theorist tapped by the Nazis to justify Germany's slip from democracy to dictatorship. Palaver's papers critiqued a lesser-known, theological, and apocalyptic line of Schmitt's thinking—and they seem to have fascinated Thiel ever since the two men first met in 1996. In his recent doomsday lectures and interviews, Thiel's language often mirrors Palaver's scholarship directly, sometimes closely paraphrasing it. (Thiel did not respond to WIRED's requests for comment.)

You know you live in strange times when one of the most influential billionaires in the world—an investor who lit the financial fuses on both Facebook and the AI revolution, who cofounded PayPal and Palantir and launched the career of an American vice president—starts dedicating his public appearances primarily to a set of ideas about Armageddon borrowed heavily from a Nazi jurist. (As in: the guy who rapidly published the most prominent defense of Hitler's Night of the Long Knives.)

Carl Schmitt

But the times have been even weirder for Palaver. A lifelong peace activist, he first wrote about Schmitt's apocalyptic theories in hopes of driving a stake through their heart. Yet for years now, Palaver has watched as his own Girardian take on Schmitt seems to have provided a roadmap not only for Thiel's speaking tour but for his considerable strategic interventions in global politics—from his investments in military tech to his role in shaping the careers of JD Vance and Donald Trump to his support of the National Conservatism movement. If Thiel takes his own thinking seriously, he seems to regard these moves as interventions in the end of human history.

For the past year or so, the two men have been in regular touch, meeting together once at Thiel's home and debating with each other over text and email. In August, Palaver even hosted Thiel at the University of Innsbruck for a two-day, closed-door “dress rehearsal” of the billionaire's four-part San Francisco Antichrist lecture series. In an interview with the Austrian news outlet Falter, Palaver said he'd agreed to the event with Thiel “in the hope of getting him to reconsider his positions.” In my own months of conversation with Palaver, he has said he fears that the investor has arrived at a potentially catastrophic interpretation of Schmitt.

And believe it or not, the nature of Palaver and Thiel's relationship gets even more complicated. Palaver has been reluctant to oppose Thiel publicly, and in our conversations he sometimes downplays his own influence and disagreements with the billionaire. Perhaps that's because, as followers of Girard, both men believe that any two figures who oppose each other strongly enough—as Palaver has opposed Schmitt, as Thiel opposes the Antichrist—are bound to mimic each other and become entangled. As Thiel himself has said, “Perhaps if you talk too much about Armageddon, you are secretly pushing the agenda of the Antichrist.”

In some ways, Palaver and Thiel have always been mirror images of each other.

Palaver grew up in a small town in the Austrian Alps, less than an hour from the German border. The landscape of his childhood was idyllic: rolling valleys and meadows, dotted with small churches and boxed in by towering, snow-capped mountain ranges. The historical context was less so. Palaver was born 13 years after the Allies dropped their last bombs on Austria, and within a month of his fourth birthday, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.

From a young age, Palaver was a peace activist, registering as a conscientious objector at 18 and then organizing against nuclear weapons in college. It was in a class about the roots of human violence where he came to study the work of Rene Girard—whose unusual theories were generating buzz in parts of Europe.

Mimetic rivalry: The violence that results from humans' fundamental tendency to imitate each other—specifically to mimic each other's desires. A key concept for Rene Girard, Thiel's biggest intellectual influence.

Scapegoat mechanism: The process by which humans find unity—and relief from mimetic rivalry—in ganging up on one target who gets blamed for all the community's problems. According to Girard, scapegoating has provided less and less cohesion since the time of Christ.

The Antichrist: The figure, described briefly in the Bible, who ushers in the end times. For Thiel and the Nazi theorist Carl Schmitt, the Antichrist's evil is pretty much synonymous with any attempt to unify the world.

Apocalypse: For some Girardians, the final explosion of violence that will result from unchecked mimetic rivalry in an age of world-killing weaponry.

The katechon: A Greek term, appearing in just two sentences of the Bible, for “that which withholds” the Antichrist and the end times. After World War II, Schmitt's vision of the katechon was for a fragmented world of nationalist states, with no global unity. Thiel seems to envision something similar.

Girard's core insight, Palaver would learn, is that all humans are imitators, beginning with their wants. “Once their natural needs are satisfied, humans desire intensely,” Girard wrote, “but they don't know exactly what they desire.” So people mimic the aspirations of their most impressive neighbors—“thus ensuring for themselves lives of perpetual strife and rivalry with those they simultaneously hate and admire.”

According to Girard, this “mimesis”—this relentless copying—builds as it ricochets across relationships. In groups, everyone starts to look alike as they converge on a few models, ape the same desires, and furiously compete for the same objects. And the only reason this “mimetic rivalry” ever fails to break out into omnidirectional warfare is that, at some point, it tends to get channeled into a war of all against one. Via something Girard called the “scapegoat mechanism,” everyone aligns against an unfortunate target who is held responsible for the group's ills. This mechanism is so essential to cultural cohesion, Girard wrote, that scapegoat narratives are the founding myths of every archaic culture.

But the arrival of Christianity, Girard believed, marked a turning point in human consciousness—because it revealed, once and for all, that scapegoats are actually innocent and mobs are depraved. In the crucifixion narrative, Jesus is murdered in a heinous act of collective violence. But unlike nearly every other sacrificial myth, this one is told from the perspective of the scapegoat, and the audience cannot help but understand the injustice.

With this epiphany, Girard wrote, the old scapegoating rituals instantly started to lose their effectiveness, having been unmasked and discredited. Humanity no longer gets the same relief from collective acts of violence. Communities still scapegoat all the time, but with less and less unifying cohesion to show for it. What awaits us at the end of history, then, is the unchecked, contagious, and ultimately apocalyptic violence of mimetic rivalry.

The upside of the crucifixion narrative, however, is that it offers humanity moral redemption. For Girard, the conclusion was clear: No matter the endgame, one must wholly reject scapegoating. Imitation remains inescapable, but we can choose our models. And the sound path forward, as he saw it, is to mimic Jesus—the one model who will never become a “fascinating rival”—in leading lives of Christian non-violence.

Girard's theory almost immediately became a lodestar for the young Palaver, who recognized it as a bridge between his peace activism and theology. “You discover Girard,” Palaver says, “and you suddenly have a perfect tool to criticize all the scapegoaters.” And the young activist already had certain major scapegoaters in his sights.

In 1983—the same year as that first class on Girard—the bishop of Innsbruck tried to stop Palaver from rallying a group of young Catholics to join the largest-ever protest against American missiles in Europe. Dismissing Palaver's views as geopolitical naivete, the bishop told him to read a German essay collection called Illusions of Brotherhood: The Necessity of Having Enemies. The book, Palaver realized, was full of references to an idea—coined by Carl Schmitt—that politics is grounded in distinguishing friends from enemies. Reading the book, Palaver realized he was “more or less against every sentence.”

So as a doctoral candidate, the young Austrian decided to write a Girardian critique of Schmitt. He would use Girardian theory against a legal architect of Europe's last great calamity, who was now inspiring the Cold Warriors stoking its next. “Focusing upon Schmitt,” he explained, “meant for me turning against the archenemy of my pacifist attitude.”

By the late 1980s, Palaver had become one of a small cadre of Girardian devotees on faculty at the University of Innsbruck. Girard's ideas were also picking up steam in academic circles elsewhere in Europe. But Girard himself continued to develop his theories in relative obscurity across the Atlantic, at Stanford University.

When Thiel arrived at Stanford in the mid 1980s, he was a teen libertarian with a zeal for Reagan-era anti-communism, a hatred for conformity stemming from his time in a draconian South African prep school, and a drive, as he has described it, to win “one competition after another.” He quickly filled the role of a classic overachieving conservative campus gadfly. He played on the Stanford chess team, maintained excellent grades, and was the founding editor of The Stanford Review, a right-wing student publication—which heaped scorn on the trendy politics of diversity and multiculturalism at a time when mass student demonstrations were railing against the Western canon and South African apartheid.

So it's not surprising that Thiel found himself drawn to Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a cantankerous, theologically conservative Stanford campus minister who once referred to himself as a “bumpkin from South Africa armed with fascist boarding school education.” Hamerton-Kelly taught classes on Western Civilization and, according to the school newspaper, was booed on at least one occasion by anti-Apartheid audiences on campus. According to several people who knew them both, Thiel came to see Hamerton-Kelly as a mentor. And it was through him that Thiel got to know Girard personally.

Hamerton-Kelly was one of Girard's closest friends at Stanford and one of mimetic theory's loudest champions in the United States. He also led a biweekly Girardian study group in a trailer on campus, and at his invitation, Thiel became a regular fixture in the early 1990s. By Thiel's own admission, his initial attraction to Girard's mimetic thinking was simply contrarian. “It was very much out of temper with the times,” Thiel said in a 2009 interview, “so it had a sort of natural appeal to a somewhat rebellious undergraduate.” Beyond that, Thiel's first impression was that mimetic theory was “crazy.”

But at some point, Thiel came to realize that—contrary to Ayn Rand's fantasy of a few heroic, self-determined individualists striding against a backdrop of pale conformists—no one is immune to imitative desire and its frustrations. After graduating from Stanford law school, Thiel landed a highly coveted job as a securities lawyer at a prestigious Wall Street firm—and almost instantly hated it. “From the outside it was a place where everybody wanted to get in,” Thiel would later say. “On the inside, it was a place where everybody wanted to get out.” Then, when he applied to clerk under the conservative US Supreme Court justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, both men turned him down. By his own account, Girard's theory of rivalry was gradually hitting home for the hyper-mimetic Thiel. “As I had this rolling quarter-life crisis in my twenties,” he has said, “there was something about this intense competition and desire to win that I came to question.”

On numerous occasions, Thiel has described his investment in Facebook as a wager on the explanatory power of Girardian theory. “I bet on mimesis,” Thiel would later say.

Finally, after a brief stint as a derivatives trader at Credit Suisse Group, Thiel headed home to the Bay Area to launch the career in tech that would make him famous. But in returning to California, Thiel was also coming back to Girard. In the summer of 1996, the 28-year old Thiel attended the annual conference of Girardians, held at Stanford that year. On the final day of the event, he found a seat in a lecture hall. Wolfgang Palaver—whom Thiel had never met—was squaring up to present one of the first English-language critiques of Carl Schmitt's theories about the Antichrist and the katechon. It would help set a new course for Thiel's thinking for the next 30 years.

As a theorist, Schmitt is best remembered for two things: his incisive Weimar-era critique of liberalism and his decision to join the Nazi party in the run-up to the Second World War (before being cast aside by the Reich in 1936). Schmitt's embrace of the Nazis, Palaver told his audience, stemmed from his fear of “the satanic unification of the world” under a global state, which Schmitt treated as synonymous with the reign of the Antichrist.

During the Second World War, Schmitt saw the globalist ambitions of the USSR as presenting precisely this kind of apocalyptic risk, according to Palaver. Schmitt, he said, was desperate to locate a katechon—the shadowy figure, referenced in Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians, who stands in the way of the Antichrist in order to hold off the end of the world. Schmitt's “greatest failure,” Palaver told his audience, “had been to think that Hitler was a katechon able to prevent the coming of a destructive world state.”

According to Girard's mimetic theory, Schmitt was trying to solve an unsolvable political problem. Schmitt's support of Hitler was effectively a bet that cranking up the volume on the scapegoat mechanism could work—that Germany would achieve social stability by channeling all of its fury toward Jews, the Roma, foreign powers, and all the other enemies that the Nazis designated as poisonous to the Reich. But Schmitt's katechon, Palaver said, was doomed from the start.

“Far too late did Schmitt realize that his support of Hitler was actually serving the Antichrist,” Palaver told the Girardians. Schmitt was correct to warn against “the totalitarian dangers of a unified world,” but the old scapegoating rituals were no longer sustainable. Schmitt relied on a brutal nationalist ethos that saw countrymen as friends and everyone else as vile enemies. Girard had proved the world was evolving beyond the workability of such a scheme. So ultimately, Schmitt's plan backfired. The atrocities perpetrated by the Nazi party had been so revolting, they'd prompted the spontaneous formation of the first truly global institution in human history. The Holocaust paved the way for the United Nations. His katechon had been an Antichrist all along.

This is the Girardian conundrum. If the old structures for containing violence no longer work, a violent world-ending apocalypse seems all but inevitable. For anyone who wants to shape history, Palaver suggested, there are two available courses of action: Follow in the footsteps of Schmitt or follow in the footsteps of Jesus. To follow Schmitt would be to invest in the katechon. By creating systems that permit violence against scapegoats, one might be able to postpone the far greater violence of the apocalypse. But for Palaver, the only morally acceptable answer was clear. Even if scapegoating could hold off the apocalypse for a time, we should not scapegoat. He ended his paper by quoting Girard's call for “the definitive renunciation of violence.”

The “strange new thoughts” Thiel wanted his audience to entertain were, it turned out, largely those of Carl Schmitt.

After the presentation ended, Thiel rushed to introduce himself to Palaver. “He was familiar with Schmitt,” Palaver told me, because he knew Schmitt had been important to Leo Strauss, a key intellectual influence among conservatives around the time Thiel was running the Stanford Review. But much of Schmitt's writing, taboo as it was, had never been translated into English. Now here was Palaver's scholarship, bridging the gap between Thiel's interest in conservative political theory and the work of René Girard, and Thiel was eager to discuss it.

That day, they joined around 20 other participants for an after-party at Girard's house. “There, we talked for one and a half hours about how I see Strauss and Schmitt,” Palaver told me. The young Austrian was thrilled to learn that someone in the audience had found his presentation interesting.  “Usually in academia, not many people will eagerly listen,” he said. “ So I was happy to find a conversation partner who was really interested in the topic.” It would be years before Palaver started to realize how much their fascinations with the same subject diverged.

In the summer of 2004, Thiel and his old mentor Hamerton-Kelly organized a weeklong Girardian seminar at Stanford and invited Girard and Palaver to take part. The gathering was a small, closed symposium with only eight participants and served as Thiel's self-orchestrated debut as a Girardian intellectual. Newly wealthy after having sold PayPal in a deal valued at $1.5 billion, he footed the bill for the week and also helped underwrite the publication of a book that would collect all the papers presented at the seminar.

At Palaver's suggestion, the theme of the conference was “Politics and Apocalypse.” It had been three years since 9/11, and mimetic theorists were still processing whether the terror attacks augured history's final explosion of “planetary mimetic rivalry.” But for Thiel—who sat at the head of the seminar table—the attacks mainly exposed the West's deep and pathetic inability to protect itself.

“The brute facts of September 11 demand a reexamination of the foundations of modern politics,” Thiel wrote in the paper he presented that July. “Today, mere self-preservation forces all of us to look at the world anew, to think strange new thoughts, and thereby to awaken from that very long and profitable period of intellectual slumber and amnesia that is so misleadingly called the Enlightenment.”

It would quickly become apparent that Thiel had spent some time considering the paper Palaver presented the day the two men met in 1996. The “strange new thoughts” Thiel wanted his audience to entertain were, it turned out, largely those of Carl Schmitt.

Where Palaver had been repulsed, Thiel extolled Schmitt's “robust conception of the political,” in which “humans are forced to choose between friends and enemies,” and everything else is delusion. “The high points of politics,” he quotes Schmitt as saying, “are the moments in which the enemy is, in concrete clarity, recognized as the enemy.” In Thiel's mind, Osama bin Laden was capable of this kind of politics. The West, with its fetish for individual rights and procedures, was not.

Schmitt, Thiel conjectured, would have responded to 9/11 by calling for a holy crusade against Islam. But the West was instead slipping beyond politics altogether, Thiel seemed to fear, toward the creation of a bland “world-embracing economic and technical organization.” This was Schmitt's nightmare scenario. In such a world, Thiel said, “a representation of reality might appear to replace reality: Instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be ‘intrigues of all sorts,' as in a soap opera.” But that counterfeit reality, Thiel argued, would just be the “brief harmony that prefigures the final catastrophe of the Apocalypse”—the harmony, in Schmitt's telling, of the Antichrist.

Thiel's discussion of Schmitt didn't mention Hitler or the Nazis once.

Then, about halfway through his paper, Thiel switched gears completely. As if having second thoughts, he ruled out Schmitt's “drastic solutions” as “fraught with far too much violence” in an age of nuclear weapons. Then he shifted toward imagining “a way to fortify the modern West” that involved working around democratic institutions via misdirection, hidden meanings, and a lack of transparency—an approach he identified with the theorist Leo Strauss. (He titled his paper “The Straussian Moment.”)

“A direct path forward is prevented by America's constitutional machinery,” Thiel said. “Still, there are more possibilities for action than first appear.” Strangely for someone so suspicious of global unity, Thiel saw one such possibility for action in the creation of a worldwide surveillance network. “Instead of the United Nations, filled with interminable and inconclusive parliamentary debates that resemble Shakespearean tales told by idiots,” Thiel said, “we should consider … the secret coordination of the world's intelligence services, as the decisive path to a truly global pax Americana.” This surveillance supersystem, Thiel wrote, could act as “a political framework that operates outside the checks and balances of representative democracy as described in high school textbooks.”

“His theory of mimetic rivalry—that we tend to compete over the things that other people want—spoke directly to some of the pressures I experienced at Yale,” JD Vance wrote of Girard. “But it was his related theory of the scapegoat—and what it revealed about Christianity—that made me reconsider my faith.”

Sitting down the seminar table from Thiel, Palaver had no idea that Thiel had more than an academic interest in spycraft. Just a year earlier, Thiel had quietly incorporated a new company called Palantir Technologies, where he would spend the next two decades developing some of the most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure in human history. At the time of the conference, the firm was still in its infancy. But it would soon land its first major client: the CIA.

As Palaver recalls it, Thiel's paper received little pushback from the Girardians around the table in 2004. “I reread it recently,” Palaver tells me. “You can feel the anxiety. You feel that he was worried.” After 9/11, Palaver sighs, “I think Thiel's first reaction was: We have to build tools to never again be in a situation where people can sneak into the United States without discovery.”

About a month after the symposium, Thiel committed his most famous act of putting his money where his Girardian mouth was. In August of 2004, he put $500,000 in TheFacebook.com, becoming Mark Zuckerberg's first major investor. On numerous occasions, Thiel has described this as a wager on the explanatory power of Girardian theory. “I bet on mimesis,” Thiel would later say. LinkedIn intellectuals began referring to Girard as “the godfather of the Like button.” One critic even speculated that Thiel saw Facebook as “a mechanism for the containment and channeling of mimetic violence.”

But that wasn't the only investment Thiel would make based on the power of his favorite theories.

After World War II, according to Palaver, Schmitt himself eventually soured on the idea that Hitler was the katechon. Clearly, the Führer had been a bad bet.

In Schmitt's postwar book The Nomos of the Earth, he pitched a new kind of katechon. This would be a world order “based on the equilibrium of several independent large blocs,” as Palaver summarized it in 1996. In Schmitt's multipolar world order, each hegemonic power would have its own distinct “culture, race, language, and national heritage.” The world would be disunified by design. There would be no global regulatory bodies and no global enforcement mechanisms—no United Nations, no International Criminal Court.

In July of 2019, Thiel went onstage to present a keynote lecture at the inaugural US conference of a new international political force: the National Conservatism movement. Established that year by the Israeli political theorist Yoram Hazony, National Conservatives are opposed to “universalist ideologies” and want to “see a world of independent nations—each pursuing its own national interests and upholding national traditions that are its own—as the only genuine alternative.”

Thiel has presented a lecture at all but two US-based conference of the National Conservatives, where illiberal world leaders meet with their international counterparts and where right-leaning intellectuals from across the globe gather to give talks on the failures of liberalism, the necessity of reevaluating the separation of church and state, and the virtues of closed borders and self-interested, soil-deep nationalism. In 2021, Thiel was listed among the conference's biggest donors of $50,000 or more.

Almost since the beginning, observers have noted that Hazony's theories—and those of the National Conservatives in general—appear to be “suffused with the ideas of the German jurist Carl Schmitt,” though Hazony has disavowed the connection. Among the relatively few people associated with National Conservatism who do cite Schmitt openly in their own work are Thiel and Michael Anton, the essayist and sometime Trump administration official.

In 2023, Thiel returned to Schmitt's ideas yet again when he gave his first major lecture on the Antichrist before the Girardians in Paris. This time he did refer obliquely to Schmitt's “misadventure in nationalism”—a cute way of referring to his vigorously prosecuted Nazism—and gave much more air to the idea of the katechon.

After Thiel finished his talk—and Palaver issued his “go to church” correction from the audience—the Austrian went up to Thiel to say hello and make sure there were no hard feelings. As Palaver recalls it, Thiel responded that, in fact, he hoped they could discuss the substance of his lecture more deeply. So a year later, at Thiel's invitation, Palaver flew to California to meet with Thiel in his sprawling Los Angeles home.

Before he arrived, the theologian was surprised to learn that Thiel had already decided what they would discuss: one of Palaver's old papers critiquing Schmitt. “I had to reread it myself,” Palaver told me, “and I was partly astonished by what I had collected there and had to address.” It had been years since he'd thought about his mid-'90s scholarship. By the evening's end, Palaver realized the same could not be said for his host.

As time went on, Palaver realized that he may have become a major vehicle for his once-taboo archenemy's thought. “Some of those crazy ideas were really presented by myself for the first time,” Palaver says in his somewhat broken English. “And now they are all over the place.”

As the National Conservatism movement picked up steam, its members began angling to have a man in the White House by 2024. They pinned their early hopes on Ron DeSantis, but when his campaign fizzled out, all eyes turned toward Ohio senator JD Vance.

It's no secret that Vance is largely a product of Thiel—the billionaire has helped architect nearly every professional endeavor of Vance's adult life, including his meteoric political rise. After Vance converted to Catholicism in 2019, he published an essay in the Catholic magazine The Lamp, partly attributing his conversion to the influence of two men: Peter Thiel (“he was possibly the smartest person I'd ever met”) and the late René Girard. “His theory of mimetic rivalry—that we tend to compete over the things that other people want—spoke directly to some of the pressures I experienced at Yale,” Vance wrote. “But it was his related theory of the scapegoat—and what it revealed about Christianity—that made me reconsider my faith.”

As Vance put it, “Christ is the scapegoat who reveals our imperfections, and forces us to look at our own flaws rather than blame our society's chosen victims.” In applying this to his own life, Vance focused mainly on his generation's petty online habits in the 2010s. “Mired in the swamp of social media, we identified a scapegoat and digitally pounced,” he wrote. “We were keyboard warriors, unloading on people via Facebook and Twitter, blind to our own problems.”

It was a fairly shallow gloss on Girard's theory. But to many Girardians, it suggested Vance knew exactly what he was doing when—two months after Donald Trump selected him as a running mate—the nominee began tweeting that immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating domestic pets. And when, on the campaign trail and in televised debates, he contorted himself to blame nearly every American crisis on immigrants.

For some Girardians, this was a breaking point. The mimetic theorist Bernard Perret lambasted Vance and his billionaire mentor in a French political journal, accusing them of “casting a shadow over Girard's legacy.” Within months, several more prominent Girardians followed suit. “It's difficult to claim Girard, who fundamentally believes that violence is linked to exclusion, and at the same time to accuse Haitians of eating dogs,” Girardian scholar Paul Dumouchel told a Canadian newspaper. “Either you didn't understand Girard, or you're a liar.”

It's possible that Vance may have genuinely misunderstood the scapegoat mechanism. Or he may have been familiar enough with Girardian mimetic theory to recognize that, while the old sacred rituals might not work perfectly, they aren't entirely broken yet. Collective acts of violence still bind people together somewhat—perhaps enough to win an election. “They feel relieved of their tensions and they coalesce into a more harmonious group,” Girard wrote. “They now have a single purpose, which is to prevent the scapegoat from harming them by expelling and destroying him.”

By February of 2025, Thiel's Armageddon tour had gotten to the point where he was handing out T-shirts that said “Don't Immanentize the Katechon.” (This was a nerdy Thielian play on the anti-utopian quote, “Don't immanentize the eschaton”—meaning don't try to manifest heaven on Earth.) In a recent interview, Thiel was asked whether or not Donald Trump might be the katechon, and he refused to answer. His reticence to name a katechon is a lesson he seems to take directly from Palaver's account of Schmitt and Hitler. “If you identify too much as one thing, that can go very wrong,” Thiel told Cowen. “There's always a risk that the katechon becomes the Antichrist,” he said, echoing Palaver's 1996 paper.

Throughout Thiel's strange circuit as an itinerant preacher, he and Palaver have been in frequent touch. The first time I spoke with Palaver, he'd recently emailed Thiel to express his disgust over JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference, where the vice president called for greater inclusion of nationalist populist parties like Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany. Thiel engaged with Palaver's criticism of Vance without really conceding it, Palaver says. Whether the message trickled down to the vice president is unclear.

Last summer, I signed up to attend the 35th annual Girardian conference in Rome so I could spend time with Palaver in person. In the days leading up to it, I had dozens of unplanned conversations with mimetic theorists—in between lectures, in the back seats of taxis, and over espressos and cigarettes at tiny Roman cafés. The Girardians are a remarkably welcoming bunch, and many were reasonably eager to express how misrepresented they felt by the media. Several noted how disturbed they'd been to see a recent illustration, which accompanied a story in the Financial Times, of a smirking carved bust of Girard wearing a bright red MAGA hat.

By virtue of his enormous fortune (and his tendency to name-drop Girard whenever he speaks to the media), Thiel is easily the most well-known Girardian on the planet. He does not, however, speak for the vast majority of mimetic theorists—particularly the European contingent. Certainly, none of the Girardians I spoke with seemed remotely interested in constructing katechons.

It's not that they aren't thinking about the apocalypse. There's no way to take Girard's mimetic theory seriously without acknowledging his conclusion: As scapegoating becomes less and less effective, the world begins to fall apart. It was just that the Girardians I met seemed to be at peace with the thought that we might be living through the denouement of human history.

They were not interested in building katechons, they told me, because they do not want innocent people to get hurt. Their work is concerned with scapegoating less, not scapegoating more. Come what may. “Christ allows us to face this reality without sinking into madness,” Girard wrote. “The apocalypse does not announce the end of the world; it creates hope.”

Palaver wanted to make sure I understood that he, too, was concerned with scapegoating less—he seemed worried that I might be scapegoating Peter Thiel. It was a lesson he himself had learned over and over. “Schmitt was the type of thinking I was fighting against,” Palaver told me. “And partly I'm still fighting against Schmitt.” But over the years, Girard had prodded him to see that he was becoming mimetically entangled with his opponent. “To understand mimetic theory properly means to reflect also on your own possible scapegoats.” So when I wanted to talk to him about Thiel's hand in Palantir and National Conservatism, Palaver kept steering the conversation back to the condition of the billionaire's soul.

In a June interview, the conservative columnist Ross Douthat asked Thiel whether he—with his heavy investments in AI, military tech, and the data analysis firm Palantir—is actually building tools that work in the service of the Antichrist. The halting six seconds the men subsequently devoted to unpacking the idea, which immediately became a meme, were remarkably underwhelming.

Thiel: I obviously don't think that that's what I'm doing.

Douthat: I mean, to be clear, I don't think that's what you're doing either.

Less than a month before Douthat spoke with Thiel, I posed the exact same question to Palaver, and it elicited more of a response. Why was Thiel, given his fixation on preventing a one-world state, building surveillance tools that a totalitarian dictator could use to seize power? Was he on the side of the katechon or the Antichrist?

Palaver told me he wasn't entirely sure. “There's a tension between those two things, and in some ways he goes along with both of them,” he told me. “It's a good strategy, if you have the means—to have something at stake on all the sides.” In other words, maybe the billionaire is hedging his bets—investing heavily in both the katechon and the one-world, totalitarian Antichrist.

But to understand why Thiel may be willing to take that risk, Palaver says you need to first understand that he's human. “What I've observed are traces of deep fear,” he told me. “Fear of death, fear of terrorism.” It all comes down to a lack of trust and a craving for security, Palaver suspects. “There are so many cases where he expresses fears and concerns and a need for protection,” Palaver says. “And if your main thing is seeking protection, you play with fire.”

Palaver has decided that he has to pick his battles with Thiel. “We have different political views of the world. That's quite clear for him and for me,” he says. But matters of religion are different. “That's where I hopefully can have an influence on him,” Palaver says. Ultimately, Thiel needs to choose who he is going to imitate. “In the end, you have to decide: Are you really going to be a Christian in a proper sense? Or are you a Schmittian?”

As a counter, I found that if you add an incorrect statement or fact that lies completely outside the realm of the logic-attractor for a given topic that the output is severally degraded. Well more like a statement or fact that's "orthogonal" to the logic-attractor for a topic. Very much as if it's struggling to stay on the logic-attractor path but the outlier fact causes it to stray.Sometimes less is more.

Sometimes less is more.

Kevin Marcus has always had fun building and innovating with the enterprise startups he helped launch. That feeling is intact with his latest venture, especially since fun is what the company is about.

Marcus has gotten into video games with the launch of KATforge Studios, an indie studio he's working on with his wife Annemarie Marcus and son Trevor Marcus.

“I'm one of those people that really struggles to do things I don't like,” Marcus told GeekWire. “So every company has always been something that I enjoy doing or find fun in working on. Doing this is a different type of fun.”

Marcus is a Seattle-area startup veteran who co-founded internet search and directory services company InfoSpace back in 1996, and background check provider Intelius in 2003. In 2012 he helped launch Versium, a startup whose suite of tools helped marketers make sense of data. He stepped away in April after a 13-year run.

With KATforge, Marcus and his family aren't just out to create puzzle games to rival popular offerings such as “Wordle” in what he considers an increasingly saturated market. They're leveraging technology, including AI, to test ideas quickly and to create games that resonate with players in search of something new.

The studio's debut title, “Lextris,” is a fast-paced word puzzle that looks a little like if “Tetris” and “Scrabble” were mashed up. Letters fall from the top of the screen in block-drop style, and players must quickly arrange them into words before the screen fills up. Points are scored for longer and more complex words.

Marcus appreciates the popularity of games being offered by non-traditional outlets such as The New York Times, or the experimentation that's bringing daily games to platforms like LinkedIn. But he thinks an important piece of engagement is missing from their puzzles — community.

The goal with KATforge is to bring people together to solve things that they couldn't necessarily do on their own. By targeting book clubs or retirement communities where people are already gathering together, Marcus sees an opportunity to extend the reach of his games. Team competition, for example, is a feature that could be coming to “Lextris.”

The ability to try different ideas and designs has been sped up a great deal by AI and the vibe coding that KATforge is employing for early testing. They used Anthropic's Claude model to build the first version of “Lextris.”

“It was clunky,” Marcus said. “If you looked at the code it was 15,000 lines and it was terrible. You wouldn't be able to maintain it. But it allowed us to test it, play with it, and put it in front of some people to say, ‘Hey, what do you think of this?'”

After collecting feedback they coded it all for real, with no AI. It's a process they'll repeat in the development of future games.

“The ability to rapidly prototype it and put it out and see what happens, that is something we could not have done before, because it would have taken just way too long,” Marcus said.

The actual testing and deploying of games isn't the only area where Marcus sees the impact of AI. He thinks the rise of the technology and its impact on work is one of the reasons people will even have time to play his games.

If robots and agents are doing more of the work, people are going to have more free time. Maybe they'll use that time to be outdoors and exercise. Maybe they'll play more puzzle games and exercise their brains.

KATforge is self-funded and “Lextris” is free to play and there are no ads or in-game purchases built in yet. The next game that's planned is a role playing game called “Gear Goblins.”

At Amazon's fall hardware event, the company announced will bring its upgraded AI, Alexa+, to its Fire TV devices. With Alexa+, Fire TV users will have access to expanded capabilities, like the ability to ask the AI more complex questions, get more tailored recommendations, find specific scenes in movies, and more.

For instance, Fire TV owners could previously ask Alexa+ for recommendations beyond basic questions, like “what's a good movie for a family movie night?” Now, they could also ask for a recommendation that's similar to a show they had binged last weekend, or for something featuring a favorite actor, among other things.

In addition, users can ask Alexa+ questions while they watch, including things like where something was filmed, where you know that actor from, questions about the soundtrack, or get behind-the-scenes trivia.

During live sporting events, Alexa+ can tell you the score from your favorite team, share player stats, and help you find live events across streaming services like Prime Video, Sling TV, DirecTV, and Fubo. You can also ask for information about a prior game's highlights and commentary. 

Another feature will let you use Alexa+ to find the right scene in a movie or show, just by asking in natural language voice commands. Initially, this feature works with “thousands” of titles on Prime Video, with more coming soon across other platforms, Amazon said.

Meanwhile, the Fire TV software interface will offer improvements in areas like its Channel Guide, Watchlist, Continue Watching row, and live TV and sports discovery features. 

Amazon also announced a new lineup of Fire TV devices, including Fire TV 2-Series, 4-Series, Omni QLED TVs, and a new streaming stick called the Fire TV 4K Select. These devices will also be the first to receive the Alexa+ upgrade, along with select TVs from Panasonic and Hisense.

In 2025 alone, Amazon has launched 250 TVs with its various hardware partners, noted Aidan Marcuss, VP of Fire TV, speaking to press at Amazon's live event in New York. And, to date, customers have purchased nearly 300 million Fire TV devices globally.

At the event, Marcuss also showed off the latest flagship TV, the Fire TV Omni QLED Series, which can adjust itself to the brightness in the room and even turn itself on when you enter. The new line is said to be 60% brighter than earlier models with double the local dimming zones, and offers brighter white and crisper blacks. It also includes an upgraded processor, Dolby Vision, and HDR 10+ Adaptive technology.

These TVs will start at $479.99 and come in 50″, 55″, 65″, and 75″ options. 

The Fire TV 2-Series and 4-Series will also include this auto-adjusting brightness feature, dubbed “Omnisense,” for the first time, as well as something called Dialogue Boost, which will dynamically adjust film and TV audio to make dialogue clearer. Both are 30% faster, due to their new quad-core processor, Amazon told press.

2-Series TVs start at $159.99 and come in 32″ and 40″ options, while 4-Series TVs start at $329.99 and come in 43″, 50″, and 55″.

The Fire TV Stick 4K Select ($39.99) is designed to be a more affordable 4K streaming stick with HDR 10+ support and is powered by Amazon's new operating system, Vega OS. It will work out of the box with all standard streaming services and will soon support Alexa+ as well as Xbox Gaming and Luna.

Last year, Amazon launched the Kindle Colorsoft, its first e-reader with a color E Ink display, alongside refreshes for the Kindle Scribe, basic Kindle, and Kindle Paperwhite. It was a decent reboot to the Kindle lineup, but all of BookTok (that's book fans on TikTok for you boomers) was pretty upset that the Kindle Scribe—Amazon's most expensive e-reader that supports a stylus—didn't get the color screen upgrade. Well, today might as well be Christmas because Amazon just announced the 11-inch Kindle Scribe Colorsoft.

“Until now, this couldn't be done on an E Ink device,” said Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay. He said Amazon reengineered everything, from the display digitizer to the stylus to allow for colors that look accurate.

See Kindle Scribe at Amazon

Amazon showed off a new home screen and a “Quick Notes” feature that puts notes front and center. A new “Workspace” stack brings books, files, and notes into one folder. You can also sync documents and files from Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive. Handwritten notes can be searched used Alexa+.

The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft doesn't come cheap, though: $630! That's even more expensive than the previous model. It does come with the stylus for free. Preorders start today and availability won't be until “later this year.”

The new Kindle Scribe is 5.4mm and weighs 400 grams. Panay described it with his signature descriptions, calling it perfectly balanced, and saying it helps you “stay in your flow,” a phrase he's used many times over the past decade to describe Microsoft Surface products, which he spearheaded.

“It just feels like you're writing on paper,” Panay effused. Panos said the latency from the “ink” of the stylus is only 12ms. “It's 40% faster on the things that really matter, like page turns and writing.”

The new 2025 Kindle Scribe without a color screen, comes in two models: $430 without a front light and $500 with one. Preorders start today. The Kindle Scribe without a front light will be available “later this year” and the version without it will come “early next year,” according to Amazon.

Beating Google to the announcement of new smart home devices by a day, Amazon today unveiled a family of new Ring doorbell cameras with “Retinal Vision”—all powered by its more intelligent and conversational Alexa+, of course. Amazon also announced new Blink security cameras with improved video and audio capture.

If you haven't been paying attention to camera-equipped home doorbells and smart cameras that infused with AI and computer vision, new Ring cameras can send AI summary notifications that describe what's happening in footage. No more parsing through hours and hours of footage to find a specific clip.

New products announced at Amazon's event include the $180 Wired Doobell Plus 2K, $60 Indoor Cam Plus 2K, $200 Outdoor Cam Pro 4K, $250 Spotlight Cma Pro 4K, $$250 Wired Doorbell Pro 4K, and $280 Floodlight Cam Pro 4K. Yeah, that's a lot of cameras.

Ring founder Jamie Siminoff, who rejoined Amazon earlier this year, said with “Retinal Vision,” Ring doorbell cameras will be able to see better in low light and come with 10x enhanced zoom. A feature called “Retinal Tuning” allows Ring's new smart cameras to record even better video with color night vision.

“Ring reimagined what the doorbell could be, but it's now redefining what home security should be,” said Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay.

On the Blink home security camera front, there's the new $50 Blink Mini 2K+ and $90 Blink Outdoor 2K+. The cameras have 2K-resolution video, 4x zoom, color night vision, and improved audio capture with noise cancellation. Amazon says the batteries in the Blink cameras “last years.”

Then, there's the $100 Blink Arc, a security system with two cameras that cover two high-res video feeds to create a 180-degree panoramic view. “No more blind spots,” Amazon claims.

David Berg learned a lot about the waste management industry by driving a garbage truck around the country as the first employee at Ohio-based Battle Motors. 

He discovered that despite the sheer number of sales prospecting platforms, selling to the waste management industry is still an offline endeavor.  

“All of them had a unanimous way of going to market, which was old-school ways of pen and paper, door-to-door knocking, [and] little-to-no technology on both CRM prospecting or any bit of the sales funnel,” Berg told TechCrunch. “We saw an opportunity there to be the first, not only to build within the space, but to disrupt an entire market.” 

Berg launched CommanderAI in early 2024 as a customer relationship manager (CRM) and sales prospecting platform built for waste management — and other industrial services like dumpster rentals and industrial recyclers — to fill that gap.  

Berg, who is also the CEO of CommanderAI, said that while Salesforce or HubSpot could be customized for the waste management industry, the technology is too complicated and lacks the necessary nuances about the industry to see widespread adoption. CommanderAI's software is also better suited to the types of contracts that waste management companies use, he said.

These platforms don't have the specific types of data that waste management companies use to find customers, Berg said. Waste management companies sell to small, standalone businesses that might not have an online presence, and to new construction projects that aren't widely advertised. CommanderAI pulls that information for its users using AI.  

“Although that data is inherently available somewhere on the public web, to be able to segment it and actually repurpose it to where it's useful took a lot of work,” Berg said. “That's where the AI [large language model] pipeline comes in. There's many more nuances within waste.” 

Waste management isn't a small industry. The U.S. waste management industry generated more than $100 billion in revenue in 2024, according to an industry trade organization. The players in the industry are a diverse mix, ranging from waste haulers with just a handful of trucks up to the $90 billion behemoth Waste Management.  

“The way that we're approaching it to them is, ‘Hey, look, we know you have a way of selling. You've been doing this for 20-plus years. All we're here to do is help you sell more efficiently,'” Berg said. “'We're not here to replace your sales team. We're not here to change your way of doing things.'” 

The company's platform is designed to work for haulers with one truck up to enterprise-size businesses, Berg said, and is currently focused on mid-to-large regional players. Currently, the company is finding success with medical and hazardous waste management companies.   

CommanderAI has just raised a $5 million seed round led by 11 Tribes Ventures with participation from Watchfire Ventures, Gaingels, and Rad Fund. Berg said the company will use the capital to “pour gasoline on the fire” and bulk up the company's sales team in addition to continuing to build out the product with features including mapping, marketing, and routing.  

“Most investors, at least a list of investors, don't have any real investments within waste management,” Berg said. “There are only around 10 active software providers in the entire industry. A lot of it was really just investor education. Here's who we're selling to, here's how they operate.” 

The company plans to expand outside of waste management and into adjacent industries when the timing is right as well.  

“We'd like to have 30% of the waste management industry using CommanderAI AI as their lead source of AI tooling and really any sort of tooling within their tech stack,” Berg said.

This piece has been updated to correct the spelling of Battle Motors.

On Tuesday, DoorDash unveiled Dot, a small robot it built in-house that can autonomously drive on roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks to deliver food and small packages at speeds up to 20 miles per hour. Dot is designed to look friendly and even cartoonish — painted bright red, with big LED eyes and a mouth that swings open to reveal where it holds your food — though I'd argue it's slightly creepy.

DoorDash says it's already testing the robot with early access partners in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and plans to make it available to the region's 1.6 million residents by the end of 2025.

It might sound odd for a food-delivery app like DoorDash to compete with trillion-dollar companies like Google and Tesla on autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. In San Francisco, Austin, and cities around the country, hailing a robotaxi is already commonplace for many residents. DoorDash argues that a similar reckoning is coming for the food delivery space, and that Dot's size and design are key.

The stakes are high for this little, cute (terrifying?) robot. Countless startups have flamed out in the AV space, with some even facing penalties and fines when their machines caused harm. Robotaxis have also become a symbol for Silicon Valley's broader automation push — and a target for public anger. Waymos have been vandalized on city streets, and it's easy to imagine Dots becoming the next symbol of that tension.

On Monday at the company's San Francisco headquarters, DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang told reporters that autonomous delivery in suburbs and cities could become a large market. Tang said a key to delivery robots is navigating “the first and last ten feet,” referring to picking up and dropping off deliveries. Sidewalk robots, such as those developed by companies like Serve Robotics, address this challenge of negotiating tight spaces, but they can't drive on roads or at high speeds like Dot can.

“You don't always need a full-sized car to deliver a tube of toothpaste or pack of diapers,” said Tang. “Dot is purpose-built for the millions of deliveries we facilitate every day. It is small enough to navigate doorways and driveways, fast enough to maintain food quality, and smart enough to optimize the best routes for delivery.”

Dot has four wheels and stands less than five feet tall and three feet wide. It's roughly a tenth the size of a car and weighs 350 pounds. Press a button on what can only be described as Dot's “mouth,” and enough cargo space is revealed to fit six pizza boxes or up to 30 pounds of food. There are various inserts that merchants can put inside of a Dot to meet their needs, including cupholders and coolers.

There's also an LED strip on top of the vehicle to display text, and speakers that can emit a robotic voice. DoorDash says there's even a microphone on Dot, which could one day be used to facilitate AI-powered conversations between customers and Dot.

Each unit runs on an interchangeable battery that can be charged separately. The company says this was a key design feature to decouple storage and charging of the vehicles.

For navigation, Dot uses eight external cameras, alongside four radar and three lidar sensors to detect obstacles. DoorDash says the cameras are hooked up to a real-time AI model that combines deep learning and search based algorithms to find the best path to customers.

The company has spent the last seven years building toward Dot. Back in 2019, DoorDash acquired the AV startup Scotty Labs, and brought on the co-founders of another AV mapping startup, Lvl 5. In 2021, the company hired Ashu Rege, a former executive at the Amazon-owned AV company Zoox, to lead its autonomy division.

In an interview with TechCrunch, Rege says that DoorDash's early conversations with lawmakers regarding Dot have been positive. He says city and state officials have touted small vehicle delivery as a way to reduce traffic congestion.

Human delivery workers may be less enthusiastic. In a press release, DoorDash says humans will still fulfill a vast majority of their daily orders, while automation will let some “focus more on the high-value orders that require human judgment and care.”

Another hurdle for Dot is safety. Rege says Dot is trained to be deferential to bicyclists and pedestrians, while being large enough to be visible to drivers.

If a Dot runs into trouble on the road, Rege says Dots cannot be remotely operated by humans. DoorDash believes teleoperation isn't the right approach for Dot, and instead, trains it to simply wait and pull over to the side of the road (though that's easier said than done in some cases). Rege says a field operator will be dispatched to the Dot's location in serious circumstances.

In Phoenix, DoorDash has created an ecosystem to support its small fleet of Dots: warehouses to store the robots, charging stations to fill up their batteries, and field operators to clean and rescue them. Rege declined to disclose headcount or costs for this ecosystem.

Much like people have vandalized Waymos, it seems likely that people will try to mess with Dots. DoorDash says it included a camera inside Dot's cargo space, partially to ensure small humans don't climb inside. Dot is also light enough to be tipped over by a few people, but Rege says field operators can flip them back upright if that ever happens.

While Dot may look playful, it's a serious and massive undertaking for DoorDash. The company would surely like to beat Uber and Instacart to market on autonomous delivery vehicles. Dot could reshape DoorDash's position in the delivery market, but it could also introduce a wide array of new challenges.

When we first got close to Dot, DoorDash's new delivery robot, we looked right into its big blue, pixelated eyes and gave it a kick. A little one. A tap, really.

It's not WIRED's policy to be mean to 350-pound hunks of plastic on wheels. But it's a big, cruel world out there, and delivery robots like Dot will have to face—are already facing, because Dot has just started doing deliveries in metro Phoenix—myriad dangers and challenges.

So many challenges, in fact, that although companies are making big strides in autonomous vehicles—two more companies launched public rides in the US just this month—delivery robots like Dot have followed a rockier road.

A fleet of Dots.

DoorDash showed off the nearly 5-foot-tall robot, studded with cameras and sensors, at an event in San Francisco on Monday. The company says the vehicles are built to travel up to 20 mph on roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks, and can carry up to 30 pounds of cargo—a bunch of pizzas, a mountain of pad thai, or a small grocery order. The vehicle is electric, has a swappable battery, and can travel up to six miles per charge.

DoorDash cofounder and DoorDash Labs head Stanley Tang emphasized that the company plans to pursue a “hybrid” model for deliveries going forward—working with human Dashers but also drones and autonomous vehicles. (The company also introduced on Monday a new “Autonomous Delivery Platform” that can dispatch orders between all three.) “We definitely want to get this to as many places as we can,” Tang said about Dot. “We're trying our hardest.”

The Dot is packed with sensors to help it find its way in the world.

App-based companies have publicly spoken for years about the money-saving potential of autonomous vehicles. These firms have poured billions of dollars into recruiting and managing the independent contractors who do the delivering and driving for them, and millions more ensuring they'll stay independent contractors and not employees. What if the firms could skip all that? What if robots did all the work, or at least some of it?

Still, with today's announcement, DoorDash is throwing its lot into an industry that has faced some choppy waters. And, of course, the threat of public kicks.

Delivery robots were hyped during the onset of the Covid pandemic as a solution to that other very human problem of contagion. Since then, however, Amazon and FedEx abandoned their delivery robot projects; others working on delivery bots have pivoted to software or industrial uses. The companies that remain have mostly focused on smaller deployments on college campuses or a select few cities, and those don't seem to be growing as quickly as hoped.

Estonian company Starship Technologies, the biggest one still standing in the delivery robot space, has found a niche operating on mostly university campuses, where streets and sidewalks are wide, well-maintained, and relatively friendly, and where those desperately seeking 2 am pizzas and burritos are at their least price-sensitive. Postmates spinoff Serve Robotics launched in 2017 but has built only 400 robots, according to its most recent financial flings, with goals to build 2,000 by the end of the year.

Contrast that with the growth in autonomous vehicles. Though robotaxi services are still limited to a handful of global cities, they're picking up and dropping off customers to the tune of hundreds of thousands of rides per week.

The reason for the slower growth in delivery robots is actually pretty simple, says Bern Grush, the executive director of the nonprofit Urban Robotics Foundation: “You're trying to solve a much harder problem with far, far, far less capital and far, far, far less compute.”

Consider the technical challenge Dot has ahead of it: DoorDash says the robot is built to operate on sidewalks, bike lanes, and roads. It's meant to pilot in and out of parking lots to pick up food and to navigate driveways and apartment complexes to drop it off. That means the software needs to “understand,” predict the movement of, and get around a remarkable number of situations, vehicles, and living things: cars, trucks, school buses, strollers, children's bicycles, aggressive mopeds, motorized wheelchairs, dogs, squirrels, toddlers, people with limps, runners, competitive cyclists. And on and on.

Each Dot can carry 30 pounds of cargo, drive up to 20 mph, and go about six miles on a charge.

Delivery robots face “all the challenges of the real world,” says Nikolas Martelaro, an assistant professor at the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2021, he and colleague Sarah Fox followed around a small test fleet of delivery robots in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “They had trouble navigating sidewalks, they got stuck, they had interactions with people that were not always ideal,” he says. Just this month, he noted, a video of a motorized wheelchair user trying and failing to get around a sidewalk delivery robot in Los Angeles went viral, echoing a similar incident that happened when the bots were testing in Pittsburgh. “They're still sort of unsolved problems,” Martelaro says.

Still, DoorDash executives say the company has built something that's robust enough to last on the streets and cute enough to look like a good neighbor. (In their research, Martelaro and Fox did observe a good Samaritan helping a stuck robot out of a planter. It's possible to build something that everyone doesn't want to kick.) Big googly eyes on the front act as headlights and expressive lenses. Push a button and the hull peels back like a big gaping mouth to reveal the delivery sitting inside. There are cup holders for drinks and temperature-controlled sections for different types of food. On the outside, DoorDash's designers even gave Dot a little speck of a nose, for maximum anthropomorphization.

Dot is big for a delivery vehicle; standing next to it, it feels like a slightly smaller Smart car. Tang says the size and heft should discourage people from messing with it. “It's harder to pick up than a sidewalk robot,” he says.

Restaurant workers drop the order in and close the lid.

DoorDash isn't sharing many details about how Dot's “early access” deliveries in Arizona are going; executives wouldn't say how many Dots exist, how many orders they've completed, how many restaurants are working with Dot, or where Dot will go next. (“We're rapidly adding robots to meet the demand we're seeing while Dot is in early access,” spokesperson Mattie Magdovitz says in an email.) They wouldn't say how much money they're investing in Dot or how big the team working on Dot is, though Tang noted that the company has a “world-class autonomy program with world-class talent.”

Dot's success may be determined not by how its performance compares with other robots but by how it compares to humans. Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst with market research firm Forrester, says that customers like app-based delivery because of the convenience—and because it means someone drops off their goods exactly where they want them. But Dot, and other delivery bots, don't climb stairs or open doors or gently place a carton of eggs on the porch. “Why are we trying to get sidewalk robots that nobody asked for?” Kodali says.

Dot is heading out onto the sidewalks and into the bike lanes of the world regardless, where it will face all manner of hurdles and harassment. At the end of the DoorDash event, we asked if we could kick Dot again, for real this time, to test out how robust it was. A bigger one anyway, the sort of kick the bot might receive in an interaction with an annoyed cyclist, a frustrated wheelchair user, or a distracted driver. The DoorDash PR rep said we had to wrap. Ashu Rege, DoorDash Labs' head of autonomy, fixed us with a plaintive look.

“Please don't kick my robot,” he said.

Update, September 30 at noon: This story was updated to correct an error in citing Dot's mileage. It can travel up to six miles on a full battery.

President Donald Trump was suspended from numerous online platforms after he inspired an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a failed attempt to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. And YouTube will now settle a lawsuit brought by Trump and other right-wingers over their suspensions.

Google, which owns YouTube, has agreed to pay $24.5 million, with $22 million going to Trump and an organization called the Trust for the National Mall, which is covering the cost of a White House ballroom through private funds. The remaining $2.5 million will be allocated to other plaintiffs, including the American Conservative Union and conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf, according to the Wall Street Journal.

If you're wondering why the parties landed on $24.5 million rather than a round number, that's because Google wanted to pay less than Meta, the owner of Facebook, which paid $25 in a similar lawsuit settled earlier this year. Most of Meta's settlement will go to a private foundation that's ostensibly building Trump's future presidential library. X, previously known as Twitter during the Jan 6 insurrection, agreed to pay about $10 million earlier this year over claims that Trump was censored.

Trump's YouTube channel was restored in March 2023, and it was used to spread campaign messages and pro-Trump news clips in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election. While banned from major platforms, Trump spent his time spinning up his own social media platform, Truth Social, which is where he primarily sends out his unhinged proclamations to this day.

Incredibly, none of these settlements really need to be paid from a strict legal perspective. As the Wall Street Journal notes, the lawsuit against Twitter was dismissed in 2022, and the lawsuits against Meta and YouTube were closed by a judge in 2023. When X paid out to Trump in February, that set off a domino effect, and the president's lawyers sought to reopen the cases against Meta and YouTube.

Trump has been cleaning up with major companies lately, extracting huge payouts from firms that have no real legal obligation to pay him. By all accounts, those companies are making calculated decisions to reduce government pressure on their businesses. And while that might be a logical calculation, it's a bad precedent in a country that's supposed to be a liberal democracy.

Paramount, the parent company of CBS, agreed to pay Trump $16 million over a frivolous claim that 60 Minutes had deceptively edited an interview with Kamala Harris in an attempt to help her with the 2024 election. The settlement happened just before Paramount and Skydance received approval to merge, something late-night host Stephen Colbert characterized as a “bribe.” Colbert's show was later cancelled, and it will end when his contract is up in the spring.

Reached for comment Monday, a spokesperson for Google didn't provide an explanation beyond saying they would point us to the settlement “as our response.”

EVERETT, Wash. — In a quiet room lined with giant computer monitors, a team of seven Zap Energy engineers prepares to generate super-heated plasmas in a demo fusion device.

Like mission control at a space launch, a Zap operator checks with her teammates one-by-one to ensure the systems are ready. One engineer oversees capacitors stored in black shipping containers that charge from the grid and send a massive energy surge to the fusion reactor. Another verifies the silvery liquid metal cooling the reactor core is circulating properly. Each component must play its role on cue.

“Starting sequence, and three, two, one.”

“Charging.”

Outside the room one hears the successful “thump” of the plasma firing, followed by a flash of purple-hued light.

Zap is one of four fusion companies in the Pacific Northwest and roughly 45 worldwide that are doggedly working to do what's never been done before: replicate on Earth the reactions that power the sun and the stars in pursuit of clean, nearly limitless electricity.

Earlier this year, the Everett, Wash.-based company hit a new milestone, creating more than 1,000 consecutive plasmas — the state of matter required for fusion — over three hours. Since then, Zap's Century system has delivered more than 10,000 plasma-forming shots under different configurations. On a recent tour of the site, the engineers demonstrated the technology for a small group of journalists. 

Each run provides a little more data, nudging the science another step closer to the goal of capturing “a star in a jar,” as Ben Levitt, Zap's vice president of R&D, describes the reaction.  

The concept of fusion energy is simple enough. Reactors generate ion-containing plasmas that are sufficiently hot, dense, and long lasting to create conditions in which atoms that don't want to combine are forced together and release energy. But physicists have spent decades trying to create fusion and produce more power than is required to run the devices, and no one knows if or when it will be accomplished. 

Despite the long-standing uncertainty, skyrocketing demand for electricity to fuel data centers and AI operations has stoked interest in the clean power source and billions of dollars have flowed into the sector in recent years. 

Fusion has attracted investments from deep pockets in the tech sector, including Chris Sacca's Lowercarbon Capital and Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures investing in Zap, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is backing Helion Energy, also located in Everett.

Physicists are chasing fusion with different kinds of reactors using high-powered magnets and lasers to create and hold plasmas. Zap's solution is to run a super high current through the plasma in its reactor, which produces a magnetic field that compresses the matter.

“This is literally a tame lightning bolt,” said Matthew Thompson, Zap's vice president of systems engineering.

In truth, it's even more intense — the current inside the plasma is cranked up 20 times higher than a bolt of lightning.

The Zap team touts its approach as more affordable and scalable than other strategies given that it has a much smaller footprint than most. Its reactor chamber is about the size of a hot water heater and doesn't require ultra-complex magnets and lasers. 

“It's this so-called self-organized plasma structure which confines itself with its own magnetic field,” Levitt said. “And it makes its own magnetic field just when it needs it, for those few microseconds, and then it goes away.”

Zap launched in 2017 with research out of the University of Washington. It has raised $330 million from investors and $13 million in U.S. Department of Energy grants. Zap's headcount totals 150.

Its R&D approach is two-pronged, with part of the team working on improving the plasma and fusion reactors while the other works on integrating the other components needed to produce the power for the reactors and capture the energy generated by fusion to put it on the grid.

“These are parallel efforts,” said Levitt. “It's getting the plant technology ready while we perfect the plasma performance.”

The company commissioned Century in 2024 and has already increased 20-fold the average power it can deliver to the system for plasma creation, reaching 39 kilowatts. The next target is 100 kilowatts, then 1 megawatt, with a commercial-scale system requiring 10 megawatts.

Speed is another challenge. Century initially fired one plasma shot every 10 seconds, and has since doubled that rate. But the progress needs to be exponential, not linear.

“Ultimately, for a power plant, you're going to need to do that [shot] 10 times a second, so much faster,” Levitt said. “But we're not worrying about that right now.”

Data center GPUs from Nvidia have become the gold standard for AI training and inference due to their high performance, the use of HBM with extreme bandwidth, fast rack-scale interconnects, and a perfected CUDA software stack. However, as AI becomes more ubiquitous and models are becoming larger (especially at hyperscalers), it makes sense for Nvidia to disaggregate its inference stack and use specialized GPUs to accelerate the context phase of inference, a phase where the model must process millions of input tokens simultaneously to produce the initial output without using expensive and power-hungry GPUs with HBM memory. This month, the company announced its approach to solving that problem with its Rubin CPX— Content Phase aXcelerator — that will sit next to Rubin GPUs and Vera CPUs to accelerate specific workloads.

The shift to GDDR7 provides several benefits, despite delivering significantly lower bandwidth than HBM3E or HBM4; it consumes less power, costs dramatically less per GB, and does not require expensive advanced packaging technology, such as CoWoS, which should ultimately reduce the product's costs and alleviate production bottlenecks.

Pascari X200: High-capacity data centers need reliable and comprehensive storage solutions. Phison's Pascari X200 SSD provides the performance you're looking for, with top-notch PCIe Gen5 performance and efficiency. Built with enterprise workloads in mind, Phison's engineering offers cutting-edge tech that will make your life simpler and more energy efficient.

Modern large language models (such as GPT-5, Gemini 2, and Grok 3) are larger, more capable in reasoning, and able to process inputs that were previously impossible, which end-users utilize extensively. The models are not only larger in size, they are also architecturally more capable of using extended context windows effectively. Inference in large-scale AI models is increasingly divided into two parts: an initial compute-intensive context phase that processes the input to generate the first output token, and a second phase that generates additional tokens based on the processed context.

As models evolve into agentic systems, long-context inference becomes essential for enabling step-by-step reasoning, persistent memory across tasks, coherent multi-turn dialogue, and the ability to plan and revise over extended inputs, as otherwise these capabilities would be limited by context windows. Perhaps the most important factor why long-context inference becomes important is not just because models can do it, but because users need AI to analyze large documents, codebases, or generate long videos.



This type of inference presents distinct challenges to hardware. The context phase of inference — where the model reads and encodes the full input before producing any output — is compute-bound and requires extremely high compute throughput to produce 1+ million token context workloads, plenty of memory (but not necessarily plenty of memory bandwidth), and optimized attention mechanisms (which is the model developers' job) to maintain performance across long sequences. Traditional data center GPUs have plenty of onboard HBM memory, and while they can handle such workloads, it is not very efficient to use it for this task. Therefore, Nvidia intends to use Rubin CPX GPUs with 128GB of GDDR7 onboard for the context phase.

During the second phase, the model generates output tokens one at a time using the encoded context from the first phase. This step is memory bandwidth and interconnect-bound, requiring fast access to previously generated tokens and attention caches. Traditional data center GPUs — such as the Blackwell Ultra (B300, 288GB HBM3E) or Rubin (288GB HBM4) — handle this efficiently by streaming and updating token sequences in real-time.

To address emerging demands, Nvidia has designed specialized hardware — the Rubin CPX GPU — specifically for long-context inference.

The Rubin CPX accelerator card is built on Nvidia's Rubin architecture, delivering up to 30 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS of compute throughput (which is quite a lot, as the 'big' Rubin R100, featuring two chiplets, achieves 50 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS), and it comes with 128GB of GDDR7 memory. The processor also has hardware attention acceleration (which involves additional matrix multiplication hardware), which is crucial for long-context inference without speed drops, as well as hardware support for video encoding and decoding for processing and generating videos.

The use of GDDR7 is one of the key distinctive features of the Rubin CPX GPU. While GDDR7 provides significantly lower bandwidth than HBM3E or HBM4, it consumes less power, costs dramatically less per GB, and does not require expensive advanced packaging technology, such as CoWoS. As a result, not only are Rubin CPX GPUs cheaper than regular Rubin processors, but they also consume significantly less power, which simplifies cooling.

 




A quick look at Nvidia's die shot of the Rubin CPX GPU indicates that its floorplan resembles that of high-end graphics processors (to a degree that even its heatspreader resembles that of GB202). The ASIC indeed has 16 graphics processing clusters (GPCs,) allegedly with graphics-specific hardware (e.g., raster back end, texture units), a massive L2 cache, eight 64-bit memory interfaces, PCIe, and display engines. What the chip does not seem to have are interfaces like NVLink, so we can only wonder whether it communicates with its peers only via a PCIe interface.

We can only wonder whether the Rubin CPX uses the GR102/GR202 graphics processor (which will power next-generation graphics cards both for consumers and professionals) or if the unit uses a unique ASIC. On the one hand, using a client-grade GPU for AI inference acceleration is not a new concept: the GB202 offers 4 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS, whereas the GB200 features 10 NVFP4 PetaFLOPS. On the one hand, packing plenty of NVFP4-capable FPUs and hardware attention accelerators into a GPU for graphics may not be the most optimal choice from a die size perspective. But on the other hand, taping out two near-reticle-size processors with similar functionality instead of one could be inefficient from a cost, engineering effort, and timing perspective.

Rubin CPX will operate alongside Rubin GPUs and Vera CPUs in the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX system, which delivers 8 ExaFLOPS of NVFP4 performance (3.6 ExaFLOPS using 'Big' Rubin GPU and 4.4 ExaFLOPS using Rubin CPX GPUs) and 100TB of memory in a single rack. Just like other rack-scale products from Nvidia, the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX will utilize Nvidia's Quantum-X800 InfiniBand or Spectrum-XGS Ethernet connectivity, paired with ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, for scale-out connectivity.

Nvidia said that its Rubin CPX architecture is not limited to Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX full-rack installations. The company intends to offer Rubin CPX compute trays for integration into Vera Rubin NVL144 systems. However, it appears that existing Blackwell deployments will not be able to accommodate Rubin CPX trays for optimized inference performance, although the reason for this is unclear.

Regardless of deployment scale, Rubin CPX is intended to provide noticeable economic benefits, according to Nvidia. A $100 million investment in this platform can potentially yield up to $5 billion in revenue from token-based AI applications, translating to a 30- to 50-times return on capital invested, the company claims. This claim is grounded in the ability of Rubin CPX to reduce inference costs (as Rubin CPX is cheaper and consumes less than full-blown R100) and expand the scope of feasible AI workloads.

On the software side, Rubin CPX is fully supported by Nvidia's AI ecosystem, including CUDA, frameworks, tools, and NIM microservices required for deploying production-grade AI solutions. Rubin CPX also supports the Nemotron family of models, designed for enterprise-level multimodal reasoning.

 




Developers of AI models and products will not need to manually partition the first and second inference phases between GPUs to run on Rubin NVL144 CPX rack-scale solutions. Instead, Nvidia proposes using its Dynamo software orchestration layer to intelligently manage and split inference workloads across different types of GPUs in a disaggregated system. When a prompt is received, Dynamo automatically identifies the compute-heavy context phase and assigns it to specialized Rubin CPX GPUs, which are optimized for fast attention and large-scale input processing. Once the context is encoded, Dynamo seamlessly transitions to the generation phase, routing it to memory-rich GPUs like the standard Rubin, which are better suited for token-by-token output generation. Nvidia says that Dynamo can manage KV cache transfers as well as minimize latency.

Several companies are already planning to integrate Rubin CPX into their AI workflows:

Ever since Pascal and Volta GPUs about a decade ago, Nvidia's GPUs were AI accelerators for CPUs. With Rubin CPX, these GPUs now get their own accelerators. By decoupling two stages of inference — context processing and token generation — Nvidia enables more targeted use of hardware resources, improving efficiency at scale, which represents a shift of how AI infrastructure is being optimized for maximum efficiency.

Optimization of long-context inference processing not only cuts hardware costs and TCO, but also enables high-throughput inference platforms capable of sustaining million-token workloads. Such platforms could enable even more sophisticated AI-assisted software and hardware engineering, as well as full-length video generation and other AI applications that are not feasible today.

Nvidia's first Rubin CPX-enabled platform, the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX, is expected to be available by the end of 2026.

Anthropic is prepared to repurpose conversations users have with its Claude chatbot as training data for its large language models—unless those users opt out.

Previously, the company did not train its generative AI models on user chats. When Anthropic's privacy policy updates on October 8 to start allowing for this, users will have to opt out, or else their new chat logs and coding tasks will be used to train future Anthropic models.

Why the switch-up? “All large language models, like Claude, are trained using large amounts of data,” reads part of Anthropic's blog explaining why the company made this policy change. “Data from real-world interactions provide valuable insights on which responses are most useful and accurate for users.” With more user data thrown into the LLM blender, Anthropic's developers hope to make a better version of their chatbot over time.

The change was originally scheduled to take place on September 28 before being bumped back. “We wanted to give users more time to review this choice and ensure we have a smooth technical transition,” Gabby Curtis, a spokesperson for Anthropic, wrote in an email to WIRED.

New users are asked to make a decision about their chat data during their sign-up process. Existing Claude users may have already encountered a pop-up laying out the changes to Anthropic's terms.

“Allow the use of your chats and coding sessions to train and improve Anthropic AI models,” it reads. The toggle to provide your data to Anthropic to train Claude is automatically on, so users who chose to accept the updates without clicking that toggle are opted into the new training policy.

All users can toggle conversation training on or off under the Privacy Settings. Under the setting that's labeled Help improve Claude, make sure the switch is turned off and to the left if you'd rather not have your Claude chats train Anthropic's new models.

If a user doesn't opt out of model training, then the changed training policy covers all new and revisited chats. That means Anthropic is not automatically training its next model on your entire chat history, unless you go back into the archives and reignite an old thread. After the interaction, that old chat is now reopened and fair game for future training.

The new privacy policy also arrives with an expansion to Anthropic's data retention policies for those that don't opt out. Anthropic increased the amount of time it holds onto user data from 30 days in most situations to a much more extensive five years, whether or not users allow model training on their conversations. Users who opt out will still be under the 30 day policy.

Anthropic's change in terms applies to commercial-tier users, free as well as paid. Commercial users, like those licensed through government or educational plans, are not impacted by the change and conversations from those users will not be used as part of the company's model training.

Claude is a favorite AI tool for some software developers who've latched onto its abilities as a coding assistant. Since the privacy policy update includes coding projects as well as chat logs, Anthropic could gather a sizable amount of coding information for training purposes with this switch.

Prior to Anthropic updating its privacy policy, Claude was one of the only major chatbots not to use conversations for LLM training automatically. In comparison, the default setting for both OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini for personal accounts include the possibility for model training, unless the user chooses to opt out.

Check out WIRED's full guide to AI training opt-outs for more services where you can request generative AI not be trained on user data. While choosing to opt out of data training is a boon for personal privacy, especially when dealing with chatbot conversations or other one-on-one interactions, it's worth keeping in mind that anything you post publicly online, from social media posts to restaurant reviews, will likely be scraped by some startup as training material for its next giant AI model.

Zhaoxin borrows a page from AMD's game-changing playbook.

Zhaoxin may not produce the best CPUs for gaming, but the leading Chinese fabless semiconductor enterprise is undoubtedly preparing to unleash a highly impressive server chip. Zhaoxin has unveiled its next-generation Kaisheng KH-50000 processors, which the company describes in its press release as "presenting a 'technological gift' on the eve of the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China."

The KH-50000 utilizes Zhaoxin's latest Century Avenue architecture, named after a famous road in Shanghai. The company is fond of naming its architectures after famous locations within Shanghai because, after all, Zhaoxin is a joint venture between VIA Technologies and the Shanghai government. Century Avenue is the current architecture used by the company for its mainstream KaiXian KX-7000 processors; consequently, it is logical for Zhaoxin to align its latest server processors accordingly. Although Century Avenue is an in-house developed architecture by Zhaoxin, speculation suggests that Century Avenue may be a derivation from Centaur Technology's CNS core, prior to the company's split from VIA Technologies in 2021.

Zhaoxin utilizes a chiplet design for the KH-50000, similar to AMD's Ryzen and EPYC processors, with a greater emphasis on the latter, given the high number of cores. A chiplet design would enable Zhaoxin to push the core boundary on the KH-50000, effectively matching AMD's EPYC 9004 (codenamed Genoa) series that tops out at 96 cores. Zhaoxin has planned two variants of the KH-50000: the flagship 96-core SKU and a more affordable 72-core SKU, both of which lack simultaneous multithreading (SMT). The KH-50000 represents a monumental leap forward for Zhaoxin, as it provides 3X more cores than the company's existing KH-40000.

Zhaoxin's photograph of the KH-50000 reveals that the chipset layout exhibits minor differences from that of AMD; however, the core design remains consistent. The gargantuan I/O die is centrally positioned on the processor, encircled by four clusters of compute dies. Each cluster contains three compute dies, totaling twelve. Each die incorporates eight cores and 32MB of L3 cache. When assembled, the resulting processor comprises a 96-core configuration with 384MB of L3 cache.

The clock speeds on the KH-50000 aren't too shabby and fall in line with what you'd expect from a server chip. The 96-core variant has a 2.2 GHz base clock and 3.0 GHz boost clock. Since the 72-core chip has fewer cores, Zhaoxin could push the base clock to 2.6 GHz but maintained the same boost clock. Although the company has taken the wraps off the KH-50000, it didn't reveal the TDP or other power metrics for the upcoming server chip. The thing with a chiplet design is that Zhaoxin can effectively utilize older process nodes for the KH-50000. Sanctions don't hurt as much if you don't care about power consumption.

For comparison, AMD has historically kept its top EPYC chips around the 300-350W range, and that's with SMT. Nonetheless, the chipmaker has recently pushed the power envelope up to 500W, which is understandable when its EPYC processors are maxing out at 192 cores.

In addition to core count, the KH-50000 advances the development of Chinese server processors. It now supports up to 12 channels of DDR5-5200 RAM, allowing for a maximum of 3TB of memory, in contrast to the 2TB supported by DDR4-3200 on the KH-40000. Zhaoxin has added Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnect support. Furthermore, the expansion capabilities of the KH-50000 have enjoyed an upgrade to include 128 PCIe 5.0 lanes and 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes, compared to the 128 PCIe 3.0 lanes available on the KH-40000.

The SATA and USB ports experienced a slight decrease in numbers when comparing the KH-50000 to the KH-40000. However, Zhaoxin has upgraded the latter to support the latest USB 3.2 Gen 2 specification.

 




The KH-50000 supports x86 32-bit and 64-bit instructions, including SSE4.2, AVX, and AVX2. Support for virtualization is also present. To adhere to China's security guidelines, the KH-5000 supports the country's proprietary SM2, SM3, and SM4 encryption standards. Notably, Zhaoxin has integrated National Technology's fourth-generation trusted computing chip (likely the NS350) beneath the KH-50000, where the contacts are situated. This chip meets the security requirements of China's GM/T 0012-2020 cryptographic module standard and complies with the international TPM 2.0 (SPEC 1.59) standard.

The footprint of the KH-50000 measures 72 x 76 mm, which is considerably larger than that of the KH-40000. Notably, it shares dimensions with AMD's Genoa and Bergamo processors, which measure 72 x 75.4 mm and are compatible with the socket SP5. Therefore, the size of the KH-50000 is precisely the same as that of AMD's more recent EPYC chips.

The KH-50000 slots into a socket with a Land Grid Array (LGA) design, meaning the pins are located on the motherboard rather than on the processor. Zhaoxin's latest server chips are scalable, similar to AMD's EPYC and Intel's Xeon chips. The KH-50000 embraces 2S and 4S systems, where you can accumulate up to 384 cores on the latter. Zhaoxin built its own ZPI (Zhaoxin Processor Interconnect) 5.0 for inter-chip communication.

Contrary to AI GPUs, companies in China can still acquire server chips without significant difficulty, albeit potentially at increased costs. Nonetheless, Zhaoxin continues to make considerable progress in the domestic market, and with Chinese authorities firmly committed to utilizing domestically produced technology, the company could achieve success even if the KH-50000 does not rival AMD or Intel's latest server chips.

There is no “perfect” mouse. Even Logitech's long-rumored MX Master 4 and its tried-and-tested blend of form and function won't be everybody's everything. A mouse is merely a computer controller, one that should have enough switches and buttons neatly at your fingertips. The older MX Master mice had most of what any productivity-minded wannabe professional required. The new $120 MX Master 4 has one extra feature with a haptic button that could offer a bounty of extra options. If you already have your favorite keyboard shortcuts etched into your brain like the Ten Commandments carved in slate, you'll find the rumble in your thumb wholly unnecessary.

Logitech MX Master 4

There aren't so many true upgrades, and the Action Ring may not be all that, but the MX Master 4 is an excellent successor to the best-feeling wireless work mouse.

Pros

Cons

The design for Logitech's “perfect” mouse didn't need to change. If you're a proud user of a Logitech MX Master 3 or 3S (the latter retailed for $100 in 2023), and you haven't worn away the silicone thumbrest with your affections, you don't need another mouse. Then again, the new MX Master 4 is so nice, so precise, and so feature-rich, I can't think of another mouse I'd rather drag my cursor around with. The smooth operation on my desk, combined with the near-silent clicks and free-spinning magnetic aluminum scroll wheel, feels as satisfying as it ever did. You simply can't expect any real upgrades from this mouse. Even with haptics and software features, the MX Master 4 will still be a companion that's so thick and heavy it will rarely, if ever, leave your desk.

There are a few minimal visual design changes to differentiate the MX Master 4 from the MX Master 3S. Logitech dragged the left and right click below the scroll wheel. That moves the middle “Shift wheel mode” button slightly downward, which swaps from a free-spinning wheel to something more traditional. There's also a new clear plastic ring around the twin click buttons. There are an additional three programmable side buttons and the lovely side-scrolling wheel that's handy for both spreadsheets and video editing. The shelf for the thumb sticks out more compared to previous generations, making the MX Master 4 appear even larger than the two-year-old MX Master 3S even though they're nearly equivalent in stature. There's one odd thing about the revised design. I was using a MacBook Pro, and the height of the mouse was just enough that the left-click button sat at exactly the height of the opened laptop. This would halt a click, leading to an odd moment of confusion. You can't call this a flaw, exactly, but just a small thing to note considering just how well it works with the average Mac.

The MX Master 4 is a heavy mouse at 150g, and more hefty than the previous version, though it rolls as smooth as a buttered chicken on a water slide over most surfaces. Just like previous iterations, the mouse lacks the long begged-for compartment for the Bolt USB-C receiver. Ignoring ways Logitech could have improved the overall design, it feels ergonomic in a way that's not completely as extreme as a full vertical mouse. Your hand slides into its shape with the thumb cupped in the cradle of the new textured silicone that doubles as the new haptics button.

Logitech didn't want to enhance the base specs to entice buyers. Indeed, the company didn't boost the polling rate—how often the mouse communicates with the computer—or DPI, the dots per inch that measure accuracy, compared to the MX Master 3S. The MX Master 4 is stuck at a maximum 125Hz polling rate—whether you're using Bluetooth or the Logitech Bolt USB-C dongle—and a respectable 8,000 DPI. The DPI dictates how well the mouse tracks on various surfaces, and the MX Master 4 routinely proves it's good for everything, from mouse pads to wood and even glass. That polling rate pales in comparison to the specific gaming mice designed for the most precise experience. For instance, Logitech's upcoming G Pro X2 Superstrike gaming mouse with its haptic click is based on an 8,000Hz polling rate sensor. Can you still use the MX Master 4 for gaming? It's a far heavier mouse than any game-specific controller, and it's hard to exclaim “boom, headshot” when your mouse clicks are as silent as the grave, but you do you.

Instead of working out the usual mouse upgrades of better polling rate or DPI, Logitech focused mostly on the new haptics in its new top-of-the-line mouse. The button has a capacitive sensor that doesn't physically depress, even though it feels like it does when you squeeze it. You'll now feel a little rumble, depending on your settings. Your thumb might shudder if you move the cursor between two displays, for instance. The haptics belie the most important control change. Logitech hopes you'll use the new software feature called Action Ring. If you hit the haptic button with your thumb, you can mouse over a ring full of customizable actions that appear in a circle of bubbles on your screen. On a Mac, by default the ring brings up options for a Finder window, a shortcut to screenshot the page you're on or create a note, or summon up AI chatbots (because Logitech still thinks mice need an AI button like its M750).

To customize the ring, you need to dig into the Logi Options+ app. The interface is minimal and clean. Here, you can also set the level of haptics from minimal to thumb-shuddering. It's here you can enable multiple different profiles for the Action Ring. Logitech includes one setup for Photoshop (it's enabled for Adobe's other apps like Lightroom and Premiere), Zoom, and more. You can look through the applications on your device and set up shortcuts for those apps, or else just create your own. Each action on the ring can also contain multiple folders, in case you want to bury specific actions all from your mouse.

I can see how this is useful, though in the weeks I spent using the mouse for work, I only ever hit up the Action Ring when I was trying to get it to work with outside apps. In my day-to-day grind, I have all the necessary keyboard shortcuts down pat. When I'm typing out a new review or getting my text onto Gizmodo.com, I'm not jumping to my mouse first, at least most of the time. What's the time difference between sliding the cursor down to the Mac's dock to open up Finder versus hitting a button and then clicking on the shortcut?

However, if you are using an app with more annoying controls, it can be especially handy. The Logi Marketplace currently houses 39 apps for application-specific controls, though most of them are Adobe apps. You may not make much use of the Action Ring on Spotify or Apple Music, unless you want to pause or play without opening the app first. Take Discord, for example—exchanging audio or mic input and output is annoying to access in the best of times, and having that accessible from the MX Master 4 can be incredibly handy. We'll have to wait for more apps available in the store to show what the feature is fully capable of.

Logitech claims the MX Master 4 has an optimized antenna placement that results in better connectivity, but the mouse still won't work outside the usual 30-foot range for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections. The MX Master 4 makes up for it with an “Easy-Switch” button on the bottom of the mouse. You can pair it with up to three devices and hit the button to swap between them. This means you could have it paired with your phone (it's compatible with iPadOS, iOS, and Android) and two computers. Pressing the switch swaps between each device. The Logi Options+ app also lets you see which devices are paired. Easy Switch was already a positive mark for the MX Master 3S, but it's made even better thanks to the Action Ring, which lets you swap between devices without flipping the mouse onto its back.

Battery life among high-end mice is already at the point where most of us won't be plugging our devices in for months. The MX Master 4 promises a 70-day battery life. I've used the mouse for three weeks, nearly every day in the office, and I've been incapable of running through its battery just by myself in that time. It came out of the box at a little more than 50%, and by the time I was done writing my review, it was stuck at 45%. Even if the mouse does run out of juice, the MX Master 4 supports quick charging with up to 70% from 3 hours of charging, or up to three hours of use from one minute of charging.

I won't stop using the MX Master 4 anytime soon, though that's because I didn't already have the MX Master 3 or 3S at home. Logitech didn't spend time putting real physical hardware upgrades into its new mouse. Unless you have a very specific use case for the Action Wheel, you'll be perfectly serviced with your older working MX Master mouse. Instead, if you want the best wireless mouse and you're tired of your old crusty work one, this is easily the best one—still—perfect or not.

The executive in charge of Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital space program has laid out plans to scale up the operation for weekly launches — and says the company is looking into setting up a second launch site, perhaps outside the U.S.

Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for New Shepard, discussed the road ahead over the weekend at the Global Spaceport Alliance's International Spaceport Forum in Sydney, Australia. His remarks were reported by Aviation Week as well as SpaceNews.

Customer demand is a major factor behind the expansion plans. “The demand is really strong,” SpaceNews quoted Joyce as saying. “We're continuing to see sales every week, every day.” Blue Origin's backlog reportedly extends more than a year out.

To meet the demand, Jeff Bezos' space venture plans to phase in three next-generation New Shepard rocket ships starting next year, Joyce said. Those vehicles would be powered by an upgraded version of Blue Origin's hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine.

The plan calls for retiring the two reusable rocket ships that are currently carrying crew by the end of 2027.

Since 2015, Blue Origin has been flying New Shepard suborbital spacecraft at its Launch Site One facility in West Texas. The first 15 flights were uncrewed, leading up to the first crewed flight (with Bezos on board) in 2021. Starting with that mission, Blue Origin has sent 75 people on suborbital space trips, five of whom have been on multiple flights.

Over the past year, Blue Origin has launched nine New Shepard missions, six of which carried crew. Joyce said that going to weekly flights would max out capacity at Launch Site One, and that Blue Origin is looking into offering New Shepard flights at a new location. “We are trying to find a partner that is willing to invest,” Aviation Week quoted Joyce as saying.

That site could be outside the U.S., depending in part on what's convenient for Blue Origin's customers. “A lot of our target customer base, ultra-high net worth individuals, don't want to spend a day and a half getting to the destination, so that's a consideration,” SpaceNews quoted Joyce as saying.

Blue Origin hasn't disclosed how much its customers are paying to ride New Shepard — but during an auction that was conducted in advance of the first crewed flight in 2021, crypto billionaire Justin Sun bid $28 million for a ticket. Sun finally got his trip to space last month.

Exercise can help to restore a more normal, well-regulated immune system in people with post-COVID syndrome, according to a gold-standard randomized-controlled trial presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

The study was presented by Dr. Enya Daynes, from a team of researchers led by Professor Nicolette Bishop from Loughborough University, UK.

Dr. Daynes told the Congress: "Research suggests that those with post-COVID syndrome are at an increased risk of immune dysregulation where, instead of protecting the body, the immune system can become overactive or misdirected, attacking the body's own healthy cells or reacting strongly to things that are not harmful.

"This can lead to ongoing inflammation and symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, and generally feeling unwell, many of which overlap with what people experience in post-COVID syndrome."

The trial included a group of 31 patients diagnosed with post-COVID syndrome who had been treated for COVID in hospital. Some of the patients were randomly assigned to take part in an eight-week exercise-based rehabilitation programme which included treadmill walking, cycling and strength training, while other patients were given standard care.

The researchers found that people who completed the exercise programme had significant improvements in their naïve immune cells compared to the control group. Naïve immune cells are important for recognizing and responding to new infections.

We found improvements in central memory CD4+T cells. These are responsible for providing a quick response to any infections that the body has encountered before, which could include COVID. We also found that central and effector memory CD8+T cells improved throughout the body. These cells can identify and fight future infections more rapidly, providing a crucial systemic immune response, and long-term immunity."

Dr. Enya Daynes

Dr. Daynes believes that exercise likely helps by improving blood flow, mobilising immune cells and improving their ability to monitor for threats. This also improves communication between immune cells helping them to coordinate an immune response, and increases the production and turnover of cells, reducing chronic inflammation, and creating a balanced environment for immune function.

The team now plan to investigate if these benefits are the same in patients who have not been hospitalized with their initial COVID infection.

Dr. Guido Vagheggini from the European Respiratory Society's expert group on respiratory clinical care and physiology, based at Portoferraio, Isola d'Elba, Italy, who was not involved in the research, said: "Post-COVID syndrome effects people of all ages. Symptoms can last for many months and can prevent people from returning to everyday activities at work or school.

"Research suggests that COVID can cause the immune system to attack the body, and we need to understand how to treat this.

"This research shows that people with post-COVID syndrome who are able to complete an exercise-based rehabilitation programme may experience benefits in their immune cell function. This could mean they experience fewer symptoms of immune dysfunction such as fatigue and joint pain. They may also be better at fighting COVID and other infections in the future.

"The findings are important for patients who fear repeated infections of COVID and provides a potential solution to this concern."

Oral cancer is one of the most common head and neck cancers worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed every year. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, survival rates remain poor. One of the main challenges is that tumors quickly adapt and develop resistance to drugs that previously controlled them.

A key factor behind this resistance is hypoxia-or the shortage of oxygen that develops inside tumors as they grow. Hypoxia not only promotes aggressive cancer behavior but also makes treatments less effective. Scientists have long suspected that hypoxia interacts with critical growth pathways in cancer cells, but the exact mechanisms have remained unclear.

Now, a new study published online on 12 September 2025, in volume 17, issue 1, in the International Journal of Oral Science, addresses this and uncovers an unexpected answer. The study was led by Distinguished Professor Zhiyuan Zhang and Associate Professor Qin Xu at the Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China, and reports that hypoxia can directly activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-a protein that normally drives cell growth and survival when switched on by external signals. Here, however, EGFR becomes active without its usual triggers.

In a remarkable discovery, the team identified a previously unknown long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which they named EUDAL-short for EGFR ubiquitination- and degradation-associated lncRNA. Unlike messenger RNAs that code for proteins, lncRNAs regulate other molecules inside cells. Normally, EGFR is kept under control by a cellular "tagging" system, where helper proteins such as c-Cbl/Grb2 attach small molecular labels that signal it for disposal. EUDAL blocks this step by binding to EGFR and preventing its breakdown. As a result, EGFR remains permanently active, triggering downstream signaling pathways (STAT3/BNIP3; Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) and promoting autophagy-a recycling mechanism that cancer cells hijack to survive chemotherapy.

"We were surprised to discover that oxygen shortage alone was enough to switch on EGFR in oral cancer cells," says Prof. Zhang. "This noncanonical activation gives tumors a survival advantage and helps explain why many patients do not respond to chemotherapy."

To test the role of EUDAL, the researchers carried out experiments in both, cell and animal models. They found that oral cancer cells with high EUDAL levels resisted cisplatin, a standard chemotherapy drug. However, when EUDAL was blocked, cancer cells regained their sensitivity to the drug treatment.

Animal studies demonstrated similar results. Tumors rich in EUDAL continued to grow even after cisplatin therapy, but when combined with inhibitors of STAT3 or autophagy, chemotherapy became effective again, significantly reducing tumor size.

The team also examined tumor samples from patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. Those with higher levels of EUDAL, active EGFR, and STAT3 were far more likely to have poor responses, while patients with lower levels responded better to treatment.

Discussing these results further, Dr. Xu says, "Our results suggest that EUDAL is not just a marker but a driver of resistance. In practice, measuring EUDAL levels could help predict which patients are unlikely to benefit from standard chemotherapy, allowing doctors to choose alternative or combination strategies."

These findings also reshape our understanding of cancer biology. EGFR is a well-known cancer driver and a common target for therapies, but its activation was previously thought to depend on mutations or external growth factors. This study shows that the tumor microenvironment-in this case, lack of oxygen-can also fuel EGFR activity through a novel RNA-based mechanism. However, further research is needed before these insights can be translated into clinical practice.

Overall, the findings of this study highlight EUDAL as both a biomarker of poor treatment response and a potential therapeutic target. Drugs that block EUDAL or its downstream signaling could one day be paired with chemotherapy to outsmart resistant tumors. By revealing how tumors exploit EUDAL to survive, this study exposes a hidden vulnerability in oral cancer. Cutting off this escape route may offer patients a better chance at successful treatment and longer survival.

Tagomics Ltd., a pioneering biomarker discovery and diagnostics company, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study in Cell Reports Methods, underpinning its epigenomic profiling technology, Active-Seq, the basis of Tagomics' Activace™  platform. The paper, titled 'Genome-wide profiling of unmodified DNA using methyltransferase-directed tagging and enrichment', built on research from the University of Birmingham, describes Tagomics' enzymatic approach to epigenomic profiling that targets unmethylated DNA for enrichment, and its application to biomarker identification and disease profiling in colorectal cancer patients.

Current gold standard approaches for assessing genome-wide DNA methylation levels are poorly suited to the challenge of working in liquid biopsy (blood) samples, limiting the performance of cell-free DNA based diagnostic tests. Addressing these limitations, the paper describes Active-Seq (Azide Click Tagging for In Vitro Epigenomic sequencing), a base conversion-free methodology that does not alter the underlying DNA sequence and provides a scalable and comprehensive solution for the discovery of novel biomarkers in liquid biopsy samples. Activace, built on the Active-Seq technology, is a streamlined workflow that incorporates sequencing library preparation with enrichment of unmethylated DNA. The workflow is compatible with low DNA input quantities, down to one nanogram, and has been optimized for the analysis of DNA methylation in cfDNA derived from liquid biopsy samples.

The published paper demonstrates application of Active-Seq for the detection of abnormal DNA methylation signals in a cohort of colorectal cancer patients, identifying thousands of hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions in tumor-derived tissue, both of which are associated with cancer. The study lays the groundwork for application of the approach to the deconvolution of the tissue of origin of cell-free DNA in blood, improving detection and characterization of disease.

This paper is an important milestone for Tagomics, demonstrating the groundbreaking technology that underpins our Activace and Interlace platforms. We show that our platform enables the sensitive detection of unmethylated genomic regions, which are key markers for DNA tissue of origin. We're excited about the insight this is providing into the biology of cell-free DNA and are looking forward to seeing new applications for the platform in cancer diagnostics and patient safety monitoring for therapeutics."

Blood loss and leakage are significant complications that can occur during dialysis treatment. These incidents can be life-threatening for patients and challenging for medical personnel and nephrology nurses.

This is where a blood leak detector comes in. It monitors fluid transmission and detects potential leaks.

Blood leak detectors are designed to identify unwanted blood leakage within the dialyzer's blood compartment. Hemodialysis systems typically feature a blood leak alarm that can recognize even minimal traces of blood in clear fluids.

During the hemodialysis process, a patient's blood circulates through a device called a dialyzer. The machine facilitates blood flow, removes excess fluids and harmful substances, and then recirculates the purified blood back into the body. This mechanism helps eliminate waste materials like salts and water.

Ensuring proper filtration is essential because blood must not breach the dialysate membrane. If it comes into contact with the unsterile dialysate, the patient's safety could be compromised. Reusing dialyzers—especially after disinfection procedures involving bleach and heat—can weaken the membrane and increase the risk of rupture.

Clinical evidence suggests that blood loss during dialysis can lead to severe outcomes such as fainting, low blood pressure, or even cardiac arrest. Additionally, catheter insertion may trigger discomfort in the chest, neck, or shoulder regions, cause pain in the groin or lower abdomen, or result in hemoptysis.

An optical sensor in the detector uses a light source to identify red blood cells. Once a specific threshold is reached, it triggers an alarm. This sensor can be adjusted for compatibility with other devices by changing the wavelength used.

Based on findings from the American Nephrology Nurses' Association VND survey, nearly half of dialysis patients express concern about the risk of severe blood loss. To address this, several non-invasive blood detection methods—including pad-based, optical, and moisture sensors—have been developed for use in dialysis treatment.

One such solution is Introtek's BC1 miniature blood component detector, which features advanced fluid detection capabilities for clear tubing. Its key characteristics include:

These devices utilize high-sensitivity detection to reduce the likelihood of false blood leak alerts, which are often caused by factors like air bubbles or system issues stemming from grease accumulation.

The Introtek sensor supports targeted clinical uses, such as minimizing blood loss and avoiding fluid contamination during dialysis. Additionally, customers may request tailored design adjustments to suit specific application needs.

Introtek has produced non-invasive ultrasonic air bubble detectors, continuous liquid level sensors, optical blood component detectors, and now pressure occlusion detectors. Introtek sensors utilize a patented pulse-type ultrasonic technology that detects air bubbles, air-in-line, and liquid levels with the highest degree of accuracy and reliability, thereby maintaining an extremely high MTBF. Introtek sensors are not susceptible to the limitations exhibited by continuous wave, capacitive, or load-cell sensors.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly aggressive malignancy, with most patients presenting at locally advanced stages. While immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 blockade, have reshaped treatment strategies, only a minority of patients achieve durable benefit. Accurate biomarkers for predicting treatment response remain an urgent unmet need.

A multicenter study led by Prof. Shuixing Zhang and Prof. Bin Zhang from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University enrolled 246 patients with locally advanced NPC treated with immunotherapy. By applying artificial intelligence algorithms, the team extracted and selected optimal radiomic features from medical imaging to construct a predictive model. Results demonstrated that this AI-based radiomics model achieved an AUC of 0.760, significantly outperforming traditional clinical models (AUC 0.559) in predicting treatment response. For prognosis, the optimal model reached a C-index of 0.858, accurately stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups.

Beyond predictive performance, the study also explored the biological interpretability of the model. Through image-pathology correlation analysis using whole-slide H&E and IHC images, researchers uncovered strong associations between radiomic features and key immune cell markers, including CD45RO, CD8, PD-L1, and CD163. These findings reveal a clear link between imaging-derived features and the immune landscape of the tumor microenvironment, providing biological validation of the radiomics approach.

Together, this work highlights the promise of radiomics as a powerful, non-invasive tool for precision immunotherapy in NPC. By combining advanced imaging analytics with pathology correlation, the study not only improves predictive accuracy but also bridges radiomic signatures with tumor biology, offering new insights into patient stratification and personalized treatment.

Group-based and online lifestyle counselling can support middle-aged and older men in making health-promoting dietary changes. These dietary changes, in turn, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, especially among men with a high genetic risk, a study conducted at the University of Eastern Finland shows.

The T2D-GENE study investigated the effects of group-based and online lifestyle counselling on dietary changes among men living in the eastern part of Finland, and how these changes influenced their risk of type 2 diabetes. The study also examined whether a high genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes has an impact on the benefits gained from dietary changes.

Men in the intervention group received lifestyle counselling over a three-year period. The study found that lifestyle counselling delivered in group sessions and through a web portal helped participants adopt healthier dietary habits.

Health-promoting dietary choices were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, particularly among individuals carrying a high number of diabetes-associated risk genes. Moreover, participants carrying the genetic variant TCF7L2, which is known to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, benefitted most from a fibre intake that meets the nutrition recommendations.

Participants in the intervention group successfully increased their intake of fibre, whole grain products, berries, vegetables, fish and plant-based oils. At the same time, reported consumption of sausages, high-fat cheeses, low-fibre grain products, sweets and butter decreased. By the end of the study, those receiving lifestyle counselling were, in general, consuming more health-promoting foods than those in the control group.

Numerous previous studies have shown that type 2 diabetes can be prevented, or at least delayed, through health-promoting lifestyle habits.

"We need to find resource-efficient ways within health care to support these lifestyle changes. Group-based and online counselling is more resource-efficient than individual counselling," Doctoral Researcher Ulla Tolonen of the University of Eastern Finland notes and adds:

Our new findings show that group-based and online counselling is sufficient to support lifestyle changes among individuals with a high genetic risk of type 2 diabetes."

Ulla Tolonen, University of Eastern Finland

Participants' consumption of individual foods was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, while fiber intake was evaluated both through food records and by measuring plasma alkylresorcinol, which is a biomarker of whole grain intake. The incidence of type 2 diabetes and blood glucose levels were measured by an oral glucose tolerance test. Genetic risk was assessed either by a risk score calculated on the basis of 76 risk genes, or by the genotype TCF7L2, a known risk gene for type 2 diabetes. All participants had impaired fasting blood glucose at baseline.

Asking people how much money they would accept to experience pain again can provide a more accurate and comparable measure of pain levels than the familiar 1-10 scale, according to an international research team led by Lancaster University.
Published in the journal Social Science & Medicine , the study indicates that people's theoretical willingness to accept money in exchange for enduring pain offers a more reliable way to measure discomfort than conventional 'self-reported' measures of pain levels such as number scales or visual charts.
In a series of experiments involving more than 300 participants, volunteers aged between 18 and 60 were exposed to mild painful stimuli and asked either to rate the intensity on a numerical scale or to indicate how much financial compensation they would require to repeat the experience. The experiment also included an analgesia study of people experiencing the same painful stimuli but with one group receiving a placebo and the other the pain relief cream.
The results revealed that the monetary measure:

The familiar "rate your pain from one to ten" question is widely used in clinical and research settings, but its limitations are well known. Individuals interpret the scale differently, making it difficult to compare results across people or groups. By contrast, the authors of the study say that putting a price on pain creates a shared frame of reference.
Professor Carlos Alós-Ferrer, from Lancaster University Management School explained: "We've all been asked to rate our pain from one to ten—but one person's three might be another's five, and those numbers can shift with experience. Our research proposes a better way: turning pain into money—not to commodify suffering, but to create a scale we can all share.

Different people still will put a different price on the same pain, but there is no problem interpreting the question. As a result, measurements are more precise and the shift from low to high levels of pain is clearly reflected in the monetary scale. This makes it useful for clinical trials to study the effectiveness of painkillers and treatments, because participants are randomly assigned to different groups."

Carlos Alós-Ferrer, Professor, Lancaster University

The authors of the study say that refining pain self-reported measurement is important because inaccurate pain measurements can lead to inadequate pain management for example in an emergency, a reduction in quality of life for those with longer term conditions, as well as imposing a considerable burden on health care systems. For example, more than US $600 billion are spent annually in the USA to treat pain, surpassing the cost of treating heart disease and diabetes. The authors suggest that their method provides a complementary approach to reliably measure experienced pain across individuals and could open the door to future research improving pain measurement and management.

Girls who overeat regularly in the preschool years are more likely to experience anxiety, impulsivity and hyperactivity in adolescence, according to a new study led by researchers at McGill University and the Douglas Research Centre.

The study followed more than 2,000 Quebec children using provincial data, tracking eating patterns reported by caregivers in early childhood and assessing mental-health symptoms when participants turned 15. The link between overeating and later difficulties was seen in girls, but not in boys.

The findings suggest that children's eating patterns can be early signals of mental-health challenges. The researchers emphasize, however, that the results show only associations, not that certain eating patterns necessarily cause later mental health challenges.

"Occasional overeating is normal, but if a child frequently overeats, it can be a sign of emotional struggles," said senior author Linda Booij, Professor in McGill's Department of Psychiatry and clinician-scientist at the Douglas Eating Disorders Continuum and Research Centre.

The answer isn't restriction. In fact, strict control can make things worse and even increase the risk of disordered eating. Instead, parents and caregivers should also pay attention to children's emotional well-being."

Linda Booij, Professor, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University

The differing results for girls and boys may be partly explained by sociocultural factors, Booij said.

"It could be that parents may sometimes monitor girls' eating more closely than boys', and restrictive environments could be linked to increased risk of disordered eating later in life. The social context around girls' eating habits may partly explain why overeating is linked with later difficulties for them," she said.

The researchers identified three patterns of overeating in young children: about 60 per cent showed no signs of overeating, roughly 14 per cent began overeating early between ages two and four, and about 26 per cent started later, around age four.

Girls who started to overeat either early or later on were more likely than were the non-overeaters to report such symptoms as anxiety, hyperactivity and impulsivity at age 15.

Looking at picky eating told a different story. About one-third of the children were picky eaters in early childhood, and those habits tended to stay the same during their childhood. But unlike overeating, picky eating showed no connection to mental-health struggles in adolescence.

While many parents worry about picky eating, Booij says it is often a common developmental phase that, on its own, does not necessarily signal later emotional or behavioral problems. However, if picky eating persists over time or begins to interfere with a child's growth, nutrition, emotional or daily functioning, it may be a sign of a more serious concern.

Can a traditional Mayan leafy green help tackle diabetes? A new review examines Chaya's bioactive compounds, animal study findings, and interaction concerns, positioning the plant as a candidate for future complementary treatments.



Review: Chaya Leaf: A Promising Approach for Diabetes Management. Image Credit: Sugeng Un / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Pharmaceuticals, researchers summarized the role of the chaya plant in diabetes management.

Medicinal plants have increasingly garnered research attention, as they can be utilized to develop food items and medications for the prevention and management of chronic illnesses. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, cancer, and heart diseases, among others, require continuous attention and management, and are the leading cause of disability and death worldwide.

In Mexico, more than 1.5 million cases of NCDs were reported in the first half of 2021. Mexico has a diverse array of plants, with approximately 4,500 species, but only around 5% have been subject to pharmacological evaluation. Chaya is an underexplored plant with numerous health benefits. However, information on bioactive compounds accounting for the health benefits of chaya is lacking.

In this study, researchers investigated the role of the chaya plant in diabetes management. First, they conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scielo, Google Scholar, and Dialnet databases, using relevant search terms. Studies were selected based on relevance to the plant's pharmacological, ethnobotanical, and nutritional aspects.

The chaya plant is a domesticated, spineless variant (Cnidoscolus chayamansa) of C. aconitifolius, also known as quelite or tree spinach, and originates from the Mayan regions in the Americas. The stems and leaves of the plant contain proteins, minerals (calcium, phosphorus, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium, etc.), and vitamins (beta carotene, retinol, ascorbic acid, niacin, thiamine, and riboflavin).

The plant stands out for its protein content, which exceeds 5%, and contains seven of the nine essential amino acids. Additionally, its crude fiber content also exceeds 2%. As such, chaya leaves are incorporated into human diets or consumed as infusions or teas. Chaya leaves also contain fatty acids, including palmitic, stearic, myristic, lauric, arachidonic, and oleic acids, and flavones, such as kaempferol, astragalin, and quercetin.

Because chaya leaves contain cyanogenic glycosides (notably linamarin), they should be cooked before consumption. The review reports hydrogen cyanide levels well below FDA limits after roughly five minutes of cooking, supporting culinary use when properly prepared.



Mechanism of action of quercetin. Akt = protein kinase B; FOXO1 = Forkhead box protein O1; G6Pase = glucose-6-phosphatase; GLUT1–4 = glucose transporter 1–4; GLUT 4 = glucose transporter type 4; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1; IRS-1 = insulin receptor substrate 1; miR-29 = microRNA-29; PEPCK = phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase. 

Chaya extracts contain flavonoids, such as rutin and quercetin, that may help reduce blood sugar levels. Antioxidants in chaya may enhance insulin sensitivity, which can help manage blood sugar levels. The reduction of oxidative stress by antioxidants may potentially improve beta-cell function, particularly in terms of insulin synthesis. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of methanolic extracts of C. chayamansa on blood sugar levels in diabetic rats.

One study tested several doses of the methanolic extract in rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The study found that only the 70 mg/kg dose effectively decreased postprandial blood sugar levels compared to rats treated with glibenclamide, an anti-diabetic medication, while it did not lower fasting glucose like insulin. Another study investigated the effect of combining metformin with black and green teas derived from C. aconitifolius on the health of rats with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

The study group that consumed both teas, along with metformin, showed improvements in fasting glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, as well as reductions in creatinine, urea, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase. A separate rat study observed antagonistic effects when chaya was combined with metformin, with glucose levels remaining high in most groups, highlighting the need to investigate potential drug-herb interactions.

Another study evaluated the effects of methanolic extracts of C. aconitifolius leaves in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes. Different doses of the extract reduced blood sugar levels, outperforming chlorpropamide, a commonly used anti-diabetic medication.

T2D patients commonly experience inflammation. A study explored the anti-inflammatory properties of specific fractions of the aqueous extracts of chaya in rats with diabetes. Two sample fractions showed marked anti-inflammatory effects, surpassing those of the crude extract. Ferulic acid was suggested to have been the major contributor to the observed effects.

A study investigated the glycemic load (GL) and index (GI) of tamal and rice prepared with and without quelites (chaya and alache) in 10 healthy people. White rice without quelites had a GL of 36.17 and GI of 75.35. Conversely, rice prepared with alache had a GL and GI of 33.74. Tamal had a GL of 26.65 and GI of 57.33, whereas tamal prepared with chaya had a GL of 23.36 and GI of 46.73. These data indicated that quelites could serve as beneficial dietary alternatives.

Overall, evidence supports the anti-diabetic effects of chaya. Chaya methanolic extracts significantly decrease blood glucose in rats with diabetes, while aqueous extracts additionally improve lipid profiles and overall health. Combining chaya extracts with standard therapies, such as metformin, has shown both beneficial and antagonistic effects, indicating that further research is needed to optimize their use.

Overall, Chaya is a promising complementary candidate; however, human clinical trials, dose standardization, extract characterization, and interaction studies are still necessary before routine therapeutic use is recommended.

Children lose 8.45 million days of healthy life each year globally due to second hand smoke, according to research presented at the European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Children from low socio-economic regions face the biggest impact of breathing second hand smoke, also known as passive smoking.

The study was presented by Dr Siyu Dai, Assistant Professor in the School of Clinical Medicine at Hangzhou Normal University and an Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Paediatrics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

She told the Congress: "Second-hand smoke is a major contributor to preventable illness and death in children and there is no safe exposure level. It is linked to chest infections, cardiovascular disease, and neurodevelopmental problems and makes asthma symptoms worse. Young children are especially susceptible because their bodies and lungs are still developing and they have little control over their own environments.

"Data from the World Health Organization estimate that second-hand smoke exposure causes 1.2 million premature deaths annually, including approximately 65,000 among children under the age of 15. But we know that many more children will suffer illness caused by other people smoking around them, so we wanted to quantify this problem globally and regionally, to provide evidence for more precise tobacco control policies."

In the first global study to examine the impact of second-hand smoke (SHS) on children under 14 years old, Dr Dai and her colleague Miss Ruiying Jin analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease Study [2], a large international project that tracks deaths and illness from major diseases, injuries, and risk factors across the world.

One of its key measures is the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which represents the total burden of disease. In simple terms, one DALY equals one year of healthy life lost (whether from dying too early or living with illness or disability).

Looking at data across more than 200 countries and territories, Dr Dai estimated the years lost to second-hand smoke across major disease categories from 1990 to 2021 in children aged 0–14 years. She then compared this to the Socio-demographic Index, which combines information on the economy, education, and fertility rate of countries around the world, as a representation of social and economic development.

She found that in 2021, SHS exposure contributed to 3.79 million DALYs from lower respiratory infections (acute bronchitis, pneumonia), 0.80 million from ear infections, and 3.86 million from chest infections and tuberculosis globally among children.

The researchers found that SHS continues to pose a serious health risk to children worldwide, but is particularly problematic in poorer regions, where the rates of disease burden (measured in DALYs) were much higher.

Regions that score highly on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) reported age-standardised DALY rates of 7.64 and 10.25 per 100,000 children for lower respiratory infections and respiratory infections/tuberculosis, respectively, compared to low-SDI regions which showed rates of 302.43 and 305.40.

Dr Dai explained: "The impact of second-hand smoke on children's respiratory health remains severe, but in some parts of the world, children are suffering even more than in others. Children in lower-SDI regions bear a disproportionate share of this preventable health burden. This likely reflects a combination of factors such as lower public awareness about the dangers of second-hand smoke, more overcrowded and poorly ventilated homes, and weaker tobacco control policies. These conditions may lead to higher exposure for children.

"In 2021 alone, exposure to second-hand smoke was linked to nearly 8.45m years of healthy life lost due to respiratory infections and tuberculosis, highlighting a preventable burden that falls most heavily on the least developed areas. Children are losing all these years of healthy life, but this could be prevented if they were protected from other people's smoke," she added.

Dr Dai plans to carry out further analyses of SHS-related respiratory disease burden based on age, gender, and other factors, to support more precise and targeted interventions in the near future.

Dr Filippos Filippidis, Chair of the European Respiratory Society's tobacco control committee, based at Imperial College, London, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "Around the world, hundreds of millions of people are still smoking and many are being exposed to second-hand smoke. Sadly, children often suffer the most as their lungs are still developing and they cannot avoid smoking in the home.

"This study quantifies the enormous harm children are suffering from second-hand smoke around the world. It is a wake-up call that we need to do much more to protect children. In particular, we need to create and enforce laws that limit smoking in places where children live or go to school. However, the most efficient approach is to reduce smoking across all age groups, which would substantially limit second-hand smoke exposure for children as well.

"As tobacco companies intensify marketing of emerging products, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, it is also important to explore how these may indirectly affect children's health when they are exposed to second-hand vapors."

For patients with intermediate-risk, localized prostate cancer, radiation therapy delivered in five sessions reduced patient-reported side effects compared to longer courses of radiation, according to results of a large, randomized phase III trial. Patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) reported fewer declines in bowel, urinary and sexual functioning but were more likely to experience a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Initial results of the NRG Oncology GU005 trial will be presented today at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting.

These findings provide important new evidence to help guide treatment decisions for patients with localized prostate cancer, a disease with typically high cure rates and long life expectancy. The results help clarify what patients can expect from shorter versus longer courses of radiation therapy and enable more personalized treatment decisions based on individual priorities."

Rodney Ellis, MD, principal investigator of the trial and professor of radiation oncology at the University of South Florida/Tampa General Hospital

Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in male patients. Roughly 70,000 U.S. adults each year are diagnosed with intermediate-risk disease confined to the prostate, for which radiation therapy is a standard treatment option. Historically, patients received external beam radiation in 35 to 45 daily sessions over seven to nine weeks, but research over the past decade has established moderately hypofractionated courses of 20 to 28 sessions over four to six weeks as equally effective.

More recently, investigators have tested whether SBRT, which delivers higher doses in as few as five sessions, can further shorten the course of therapy while maintaining high cure rates. SBRT uses advanced imaging and treatment planning techniques to target tumors with extreme precision, minimizing radiation exposure to nearby organs such as the bladder and rectum. The approach offers practical advantages, including fewer visits, less travel and lower average costs, but it requires specialized technology and expertise that may not be widely available.

The NRG-GU005 trial was designed to test whether SBRT would outperform moderately hypofractionated radiation for both cancer control and patient-reported outcomes. Researchers enrolled 698 patients with previously untreated, intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer across multiple centers internationally from 2017 to 2022.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either SBRT (36.25 Gy in five fractions, n=353) or moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (MH-IMRT, 70 Gy in 28 fractions or 60 Gy in 20 fractions, n=345). Co-primary endpoints combined clinical measures of disease control with patient-reported outcomes collected via questionnaires administered at baseline, 12 months and 24 months after treatment to track whether patients experienced clinically meaningful declines in bowel, urinary or sexual functioning.

Fewer patients treated with SBRT reported a clinically meaningful decline in bowel function at two years (34.9% vs. 43.8% with MH-IMRT, p=0.034). Overall urinary quality of life was equivalent between the groups, but urinary incontinence was less common two years after SBRT (declines for 25.9% vs. 34.7% with MH-IMRT, p=0.023). Sexual function scores favored SBRT at one year (34% vs. 44%, respectively, p=0.026) but were similar at two years (43 vs. 41%, p=0.67).

Regarding disease-free survival, 88.6% of patients in the SBRT group were free from disease progression after three years, compared to 92.1% receiving longer courses of radiation. The difference was driven mainly by higher rates of biochemical failure, or rising PSA after treatment, in the SBRT arm (7.8% vs. 4.2%, p=0.037).

"The PSA findings require careful interpretation," noted Dr. Ellis. "With treatments involving larger doses per fraction, patients can experience temporary PSA elevations, or 'benign bounces,' that resolve over time. We need five-year follow-up to determine whether these elevations translate into actual disease progression."

The GU005 trial used a lower total SBRT dose than other recent studies (36.25 vs. 40 Gy), which Dr. Ellis said may alternatively explain the higher rate of PSA progression. By comparison, the PACE-B trial, reported at ASTRO in 2023, found equivalent cancer control with the higher dose, though with increased bowel side effects. Longer follow-up from GU005 will help clarify whether the lower dose affects long-term outcomes.

Local recurrence rates did not differ between the arms (1.2% SBRT vs. 1.0% MH-IMRT at 3 years, p=0.97), and three-year overall survival was equally high at 97% in each group (p=0.62). Severe genitourinary complications were rare with either treatment, though less common with SBRT (0.6% vs. 2.5%, p=0.04).

The study also found that rectal spacers, which are gel-like devices that temporarily separate the rectum from the radiation field, appeared to reduce bowel side effects in both treatment groups when used (in 56% of patients on the SBRT arm and 55% on the IMRT arm).

Dr. Ellis said future research will address SBRT's potential for patients with higher-risk disease and test additional strategies to further reduce side effects while maintaining survival outcomes. For now, he said patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer have clearer information to guide their treatment decisions: more convenient treatment with better quality of life outcomes, or longer therapy courses with potentially stronger biochemical cancer control.

"Patients have different priorities and values when it comes to their care," Dr. Ellis noted. "Some may prioritize convenience and minimizing impact on daily life, while others focus primarily on achieving the strongest possible cancer control measures. These results help inform those deeply personal decisions."

In a new study, Yale School of Medicine (YSM) researchers unveiled a novel diagnostic method for detecting leptospiral virulence-modifying (VM) proteins in the blood and urine of hamsters, an advance that could pave the way for early diagnosis of the tropical disease leptospirosis in humans and improved treatment options. The findings were published in the journal Microbiology Spectrum.

Found around the world, leptospirosis affects approximately 1 million people annually, with nearly 60,000 fatalities. The disease is caused by the bacterium Leptospira and is spread through the urine of infected animals. Despite the potential of the disease to cause severe illness when left untreated, early diagnosis has been a significant challenge due to the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic methods.

The research, led by Yale's Dr. Joseph M. Vinetz and his team, in collaboration with Luna Bioscience, a company founded by Vinetz to develop vaccines for emerging global infectious diseases, has led to the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based capture immunoassay. This assay detects VM proteins, a recently identified family of leptospiral proteins crucial for disease pathogenesis. 

We have long known that leptospirosis severely impacts multiple organ systems, leading to conditions like jaundice, acute kidney injury, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Our discovery of these VM proteins as circulating exotoxins gives us a specific target for both diagnostics and potential therapeutic interventions."

Dr. Joseph M. Vinetz, professor of medicine (infectious diseases), Yale School of Medicine

Leptospirosis is the first systemic bacterial disease mediated by a toxin - such as tetanus, botulism, or diphtheria - that has the potential for rapid antigen detection by a novel test, he added.

The research lays the groundwork for developing rapid, inexpensive diagnostics that can be used in resource-limited settings, where leptospirosis is most prevalent, according to Vinetz, who is also a professor of epidemiology (microbial diseases) at the Yale School of Public Health. The novel diagnostic method holds promise for transforming leptospirosis management globally, he said. 

"By enabling early detection, health care providers can initiate timely treatments, potentially saving lives and mitigating disease severity," Vinetz said. "Furthermore, understanding the role of VM proteins in disease pathogenesis could lead to new therapeutic targets and vaccine development opportunities."

Researchers from Queen Mary University of London's School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences, using the simple fission yeast as a model, have shown that new TOR inhibitor rapalink-1 prolongs chronological lifespan. 

The new study, published in Communications Biology journal by Juhi Kumar, Kristal Ng and Charalampos Rallis, sheds light on how drugs and natural metabolites can influence lifespan through the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway. 

TOR is a conserved signalling pathway active in humans as well as yeast. It is a central regulator of growth and aging fundamental in age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration and is already a major focus of anti-aging and cancer research, with drugs such as rapamycin showing promise in extending healthy lifespan in animals. 

Rapalink-1, the new drug studied by the team, is a next-generation TOR inhibitor currently under investigation for cancer therapy. The researchers found that rapalink-1 not only slowed aspects of yeast cell growth but also significantly extended lifespan, working through TORC1 - the growth-promoting arm of the TOR pathway. 

Unexpectedly, the study revealed a key role for a set of enzymes called agmatinases, which break down the metabolite agmatine into polyamines. These enzymes act as part of a previously unknown "metabolic feedback loop" that keeps TOR activity in check. When agmatinase function was lost, cells grew faster but aged prematurely - highlighting a trade-off between short-term growth and long-term survival. Supplementing yeast with agmatine or putrescine, the compounds linked to this pathway, also promoted longevity and benefited cells under certain conditions. 

By showing that agmatinases are essential for healthy aging, we've uncovered a new layer of metabolic control over TOR - one that may be conserved in humans. Because agmatine is produced by diet and gut microbes, this work may help explain how nutrition and the microbiome influence aging." 

Dr. Charalampos Rallis, Queen Mary University of London's School of Biological and Behavioural Sciences

Rallis acknowledges that agmatine supplements are available in the market, but stresses: "We should be cautious about consuming agmatine for growth or longevity purposes. Our data indicate the agmatine supplementation can be beneficial for growth only when certain metabolic pathways related to arginine breakdown are intact. In addition, agmatine does not always promote beneficial effects as it can contribute to certain pathologies". 

The findings have broad implications for healthy aging research, cancer biology, and metabolic disease, pointing to new strategies that combine TOR-targeting drugs with dietary or microbial interventions.

Kylian Mbappe bagged a brilliant hat-trick to mark a fine night's work for Real Madrid in the Champions League as they saw off FC Kairat, 5-0. 

Madrid almost conceded within 15 seconds. The home side went straight down the other end from the kickoff, with Dastan Satpaev's tame header falling into the relieved gloves of Thibaut Courtois. 

That seemed to wake the European giants up. The following 20 minutes was a flurry of shots and chances from Madrid. The inevitable opener came from the penalty spot. Franco Mastantuono chased down a looping clearance. The goalkeeper flew off his line, missed the ball, and collided with the player. Mbappe, ever the reliable one from the spot, converted.

And Los Blancos grew into it from there. The second half was the Mbappe show. He added two more to complete his hat-trick, providing two lovely finishes to put the result beyond doubt. Eduardo Camavinga's header sealed things for good late on and Brahim Diaz followed on to make it five.

Good Morning Texas

ARLINGTON, Texas — No news does not necessarily mean bad news, soccer fans.

Millions of people signed up for FIFA World Cup tickets via the Visa Presale Draw in early September. Fast forward to the end of the month and Sept. 29 -- Monday -- was the first day that randomly-selected applicants would be notified to give them a day and time to buy available tickets.

Well, plenty of you likely did not receive an email notification on Monday or Tuesday ... yet.

But that doesn't mean you won't get lucky.

We talked it over with the powers that be, and FIFA officials assured us that you're not being ghosted if you haven't received word about tickets.

In fact, emails will be going out over the next couple weeks, telling people 48 hours ahead of their scheduled day and time they'll be slotted for buying tickets. By the end of this first phase, everyone who didn't get selected will get an email confirming their rejection.

Hey, at least you'll know for sure, right?

The good news is that another phase of applications is opening at the end of October and it will be for everyone -- not just Visa cardholders. FIFA will open its own resale process at the end of all phases, so there won't be any other secondary markets selling tickets.

More than 4.5 million people in 216 different countries signed up for the the Visa Presale Draw, according to FIFA.

In the first 24 hours, 1.5 million people had signed up.

FIFA officials said most of the applications came from the United States, Mexico and Canada, which makes sense given they will jointly host the 2026 World Cup next summer. The top 10 countries, in order of demand, were rounded out by Germany, England, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain and Italy.

“These are not only outstanding figures, but also a strong statement,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “The whole world wants to be part of the FIFA World Cup 26: the biggest, most inclusive and most exciting event ever seen. From Canada, Mexico and the United States to countries big and small across every continent, fans are proving once again that the passion for football truly unites, as they are looking forward to attending matches in all three host nations. And in 2026, with 48 teams playing in 16 incredible cities, the world will come together in North America like never before.”

Tottenham boss Thomas Frank is set to tie down star midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur to a new deal. The Uruguay international's current contract expires in the summer of 2026 and Spurs are not willing to let him leave for free next season. Bentancur has made a bright start to the season under new boss Frank and has started in four out of their first six Premier League matches.

SoccerToday features original articles with exclusive interviews plus influential columnists covering youth and professional soccer, coaching, nutrition, and the wonderful soccer life.

In a move with real potential to shift the coaching landscape, the United States Consortium of State Associations (USCSA) and Women and Girls in Soccer (WAGS) have unveiled the first all-female U.S. Soccer National B License Course, targeted at youth coaches across the country.

This is more than pro-female coaches symbolic announcement: this effort builds a visible pathway for women in coaching to raise their license level, earning capacity and overall value. 

“WAGS is privileged to sponsor our first-ever All-Female National B Course, advancing our mission to empower and support female coaches in their educational journey,” said Kerry Diederich, WAGS Executive Director. “We look forward to our collaboration with the USCSA and its 16 State Association members to provide this pathway to higher license for female coaches, ensuring their personal goals in soccer can be realized. Fulfilling this initiative also reflects the long-standing vision of our Chairwoman, Lula Bauer, who has long championed expanding access to the highest-level coaching education for women in the game.”

WAGS: With more than 50 years of history, WAGS is one of the oldest organizations in the U.S. dedicated to advancing soccer opportunities for girls and women. It has already pioneered all-female courses (such as its National C License cohorts) and coach education paths.

USCSA: Launched in 2024, the Consortium is a network of state soccer associations aimed at aligning resources, scaling operations, and promoting growth. Today it comprises 16 US Youth Soccer state associations and claims representation over some 900,000 players. USCSA+1

Their collaboration is supported by U.S. Soccer's “Growing the Girls Game” grant, under the Innovate to Grow initiative.

“As we continually work to enable coaches to acquire and further develop knowledge, and skills, we recognized the importance of empowering more female coaches to gain further coaching qualifications,” said Evan Dabby, USCSA President and CEO of New Jersey Youth Soccer. “Through this collaboration with Women and Girls in Soccer (WAGS), enabled by the significant support from US Soccer, our goal is to expand upon that ambition to create more opportunities for women in the sport.”

New Jersey Youth Soccer is a founding member of the United States Consortium of Soccer Associations, which was founded in early 2024 with a vision to create a highly functioning network of state associations focused on growing soccer participation. 

The National B License Course runs for six months and follows a blended learning format. It includes two in-person meetings and, on average, one virtual meeting per week. The online portion features live webinars with guest speakers, individual meetings with assigned coach educators, and independent learning assignments. The in-person sessions emphasize small group activities and individualized field work. 

To qualify, coaches must be at least 18 years of age, old a U.S. Soccer C license for at least one (1) year and have three (3) or more years of coaching experience (any level) plus have access to a team playing 11v11 (U13+) for the duration of the course. Additional qualifications may apply.

Reimbursement for the coaches course: In 2019, U.S. Soccer launched the Jill Ellis Scholarship Fund to empower and advance female coaches, together with the SheChampions Mentorship Program, presented by Volkswagen, to provide hands-on support to women navigating everyday challenges in the coaching industry.  As you probably already know, Jill Elis is the former U.S. Women's National Team Head Coach and the 2x FIFA Women's World Cup Champion Head Coach.

WAGS is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Its mission is to provide opportunities to sponsor, develop, or provide educational and character-building programs for the benefit of girls and women through teaching and promoting an interest in the game of soccer.  WAGS is on the web at www.womenandgirlsinsoccer.org. WAGS Tournament is on the web at www.wagstournament.com. 

The United States Consortium of State Associations (USCSA) is a game-changer in the soccer ecosystem, currently representing 16 USYS State Associations and more than 900,000+ players. Working in collaboration with U.S. Soccer and US Youth Soccer, the USCSA's mission is to maximize and unlock the true potential of state associations by creating a highly functioning network of state associations.

It was obvious that Jose Mourinho was finished at Fenerbahce the moment the full-time whistle blew in last month's Champions League qualifier at Benfica. However, it also felt like his time at the top was over, too, because Mourinho no longer seemed quite so special.

During this year in Turkey, he had continued to court controversy like no other figure in football, but he failed to win a trophy, which is why Fenerbahce decided that the outspoken Portuguese was more trouble than he was worth and, thus, dismissed him on August 29 - two days after the 1-0 loss in Lisbon.

And yet less than three weeks after his sacking, Mourinho was asked to return to the Estadio da Luz, with Benfica president Rui Costa having come to the rather surprising conclusion that the best man to replace Bruno Lage was the coach he'd just outwitted to reach the Champions League proper.

Consequently, Mourinho is not only back at Benfica, he's also back where he belongs - at least as far he's concerned.

"I was lucky in my career to coach a lot of giants: Real Madrid, Inter, Manchester United and Chelsea. Benfica is also a giant and a giant club entails giant responsibilities, giant expectations - it's all giant," Mourinho told UEFA. "But it's the kind of challenge I need."

Whether it's the kind of challenge he can still overcome remains to be seen. Indeed, as the 62-year-old prepares to lead the Eagles out in Tuesday's Champions League clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, the scene of some of his most memorable triumphs, Mourinho is undeniably under pressure to prove that he can still cut it at the very highest level.

Sydney Schmidt is on her way to compete against the best young soccer talent on the planet.

The United States Soccer Federation selected the Sporting Club Jacksonville fullback to the roster for the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup in Morocco, which extends from Oct. 17 to Nov. 8.

A repeat Florida High School Athletic Association champion with St. Johns Country Day School and the Times-Union's All-First Coast girls soccer player of the year in 2023-24, Schmidt is among 21 players selected to represent the United States under head coach Katie Schoepfer.

In the group stage, the United States will face Ecuador at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 18; China at 12 p.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 21; and Norway at 9 a.m. on Friday, Oct. 24. All of the American group games are set for the Football Academy Mohammed VI Stadium in Sale, near Rabat.

The group stage, if the United States women advance, would begin on Oct. 28. The Americans finished third at the most recent U-17 Women's World Cup, which North Korea won.

Schmidt, who is committed to Florida State for the 2026 class but competes alongside professionals in the Gainbridge Super League under a youth academy contract that preserves her NCAA eligibility, made her first league start on Sept. 28 against Carolina Ascent FC.

She becomes the first Jacksonville-area player to represent the national team at the U-17 Women's World Cup since Fleming Island's Lia Godfrey in 2016. Current locals in the full national team are Mandy McGlynn (Sandalwood High School) and Avery Patterson (Bolles School).

Sporting Jax captain Sophie Jones also appeared on a United States roster for the U-17 Women's World Cup in Uruguay in 2018.

TOPICS:

When the United States Men's National Team last convened in early September, manager Mauricio Pochettino proclaimed that it would be his final opportunity to experiment with new players.  The presumption was that each camp moving forward leading up to the 2026 World Cup would involve a core group of players, all of whom stand a realistic chance of making Pochettino's final roster.  The problem, however, is that with the next set of friendlies taking place on October 10th and October 14th, some of those core players are currently out dealing with injuries.

Gio Reyna and Ricardo Pepi recently returned to their respective club's lineups after missing time with injuries only to once again find themselves in the physio's office.  Reyna missed out on last weekend's match for Borussia Monchengladbach thanks to a thigh injury while Pepi was forced off after just 32 minutes in PSV Eindhoven's latest match due to what the club called a “minor strain in his upper leg.”



On the most recent episode of Unfiltered Soccer with Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the former USMNT duo spoke about the wave of injuries that has befallen the team and the dilemma of key players not being able to bring those talents to the national team.

“These guys are becoming what I would say is unreliable,” said Donovan.  “And whether it's through performance or mostly through injury or both in Gio's case, if you're a coach, you just need to know what you're getting. And these guys are becoming unreliable. And so, I just... It's hard for me to imagine them continuing to get called in [to the national team], or in Ricardo's case, starting games, if he's not reliable in that way.”

Whether it was down to injury or lack of minutes with his club team, Reyna has played just 21 minutes for the U.S. in 2025 while Pepi hasn't appeared for the national team in nearly a year after suffering a knee injury in January.

A rash of additional injuries to American players left Donovan wondering if there is more that can be done on an individual level to help stay fit.

“I used to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on taking care of my body – Pilates, yoga, doing structural alignment, the way I eat, the way I did things – hundreds of thousands of dollars out of my pocket to make sure that I was available. And I also took care of myself, right? Again, not looking for a pat on the back, but that is part of being a professional and being able to play at the highest level.”

Howard echoed those sentiments saying that he had a personal chef, massage therapist and physio on his personal payroll.  “I could go to the club and get stuff, but four days a week at home before bed, I was getting a massage. I was getting physio, right? And I wasn't asking for the club to pay for it because it was my career, and it was important to me to be available.”

Mauricio Pochettino is expected to name his squad later this week for the team's upcoming October friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.

Chicago Stars Forward, Micayla Johnson, will join the U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, U.S. Soccer announced today. The forward will join the U.S. following the Chicago Stars' match against Utah Royals FC October 5.  

Johnson started her journey to the U-17 World Cup in January with a call-up to the team's training camp where she was one of four players called back after participating in the 2024 U-17 World Cup. In late March and early April of this year, Johnson received a second call-up, this time for the FIFA U-17 qualifiers against Trinidad & Tobago, Honduras and El Salvador. Johnson scored a team-high four goals to help the U.S. qualify for the World Cup: one against Trinidad and Tobago; a goal and assist against Honduras; and a brace against El Salvador. In 2024, Johnson made three starts in six appearances for the Stars and Stripes. The 17-year-old scored in the 43rd minute of the team's group stage match against Colombia October 19, 2024, helping the United States advance to the knockout rounds of the tournament before the U.S. eventually took home third place, the team's best finish since the inaugural tournament in 2008. 

Johnson signed with the Chicago Stars in January of 2025 and made her professional debut March 14 against the Orlando Pride. This season in the National Women's Soccer League, the forward has made 14 appearances for a total of 146 minutes. Johnson received her first professional start against Palmeiras in the Teal Rising Cup July 15.  

The U.S. will open the tournament against Ecuador (3 p.m. ET / 8 p.m. local time) Saturday, Oct. 18. The team will then face China PR Tuesday, Oct. 21 (Noon ET / 5 p.m. local) and finish Group C play against Norway on Friday, Oct. 24 (9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. local). All three of the US' Group C games will be played at the Football Academy Mohammed VI (Pitch 3) in Sale, which is just outside of the capital of Rabat. 

The 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup marks the first time this tournament will feature 24 nations, up from the previous 16. The 24 countries are divided into six groups of four teams each. After round-robin play within the groups, the top two teams in each group plus the four best third-place finishers will advance to the Round of 16, at which time the competition becomes a knockout tournament. This year's tournament marks the first of what will now be an annual competition with the next first editions being held in Morocco. The tournament will run from October 17 to November 8.  

The Chicago Stars take on the Utah Royals October 5 for the club's Nuestra Ciudad match celebrating the contributions of Latin American and Caribbean people to the city of Chicago. The match kicks off at 3 p.m. CT at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois. Following the match, the club will host a Lucha Libre exhibition on the stage at SeatGeek Stadium. Tickets are available now at chicagostars.com/tickets.

Despite the recent 5-2 defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid, it must be admitted that Real Madrid were one of Spain's best-performing teams in the month of September.

The Spanish giants secured three wins in four La Liga matches, including Espanyol and Levante.

While Kylian Mbappe was the obvious protagonist for Los Blancos during this period, another player who showcased his talents pretty well this month is Arda Guler, who has now been rewarded for his efforts.

In light of his excellent performances in the month of September, La Liga has confirmed that Arda Guler has won the U-23 Player of the Month award.

The Turkish international has enjoyed a stellar September, having been involved in no less than two goals and two assists in four matches.

Guler, in fact, was involved in both goals during Real Madrid's defeat to Atletico Madrid. Xabi Alonso, in fact, admitted that he made a mistake by subbing him off in the game.

However, the key highlight for the former Fenerbahce starlet this month was his goal against Real Sociedad, as he wriggled his way around the defence before a nice interplay with Kylian Mbappe.

The goal turned out to be the winner for Real Madrid, in a narrow 2-1 victory over the Txuri-Urdin.

Overall, this season, Guler has racked up eight competitive appearances, during which he has racked up three goals and three assists. If we count the FIFA Club World Cup in the summer, the youngster has been involved in nine goals.

Quite evidently, the Turkish international has been one of the beneficiaries of Xabi Alonso's arrival to the squad.

This has led to Guler becoming a key component in Xabi's creative setup and the youngster will hope the momentum continues as Real Madrid gear up for a clash against Kairat Almaty this midweek.

Christian Gray scoring at the Club World Cup (Photo by Alex Grimm/Getty Images)

Out of the 130 different players who scored at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, there were World Cup champions like Thomas Müller, Antoine Griezmann, and Sergio Ramos, all-time great strikers like Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappé, and Harry Kane, and Ballon d'Or winners like Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembélé. Only one, however, was an amateur footballer: Christian Gray.

Born in the Gisborne Region of New Zealand, Gray grew up in the shadow of two national sporting icons. His mother, Sandra Edge, won a gold medal in the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow, before winning silver with New Zealand in 1991 in Sydney and a bronze medal in 1995 in Birmingham. As for his father, Rodger Gray captained New Zealand's football team and scored four goals in 39 caps between 1989 and 1997, in addition to also representing Mt Wellington, Waitakere City F.C., and Waitemata FC. Gray took after his father by playing as a center back at Wellington College before launching his senior career with Waitakere United in 2016.

“I didn't actually become a center-back until I was 16,” stated Gray in an exclusive RG interview. “When I was younger, I wanted to score goals, but I worked my way back from a striker to a midfielder and then to a center back. I watched a lot of my dad's videotapes when I was younger, even though he was still playing in the lower levels when I was growing up. We probably have a few of the same characteristics as center backs – he was quite good in the air and scored a lot of headers from set-pieces. He played in the amateur National League his whole career in addition to working full time and playing for New Zealand.”

Gray bounced around from Waitakere United to Hamilton Wanderers to Birkenhead United before eventually joining Eastern Suburbs in 2019, where he established himself as a regular in the middle of defense and made 46 appearances. These performances eventually attracted the interest of Auckland City, who signed him to the club on January 1, 2022.

Since being founded in 2004 following the inception of the New Zealand Football Championship, Auckland City have established himself as a heavyweight at the national and regional level, winning 10 New Zealand Football Championships, including last year's edition. 

As opposed to New Zealand's only two professional clubs (Auckland FC and Wellington Phoenix), who play in the Australian league, Auckland City are an amateur side that compete in the domestic league and has consequently been allowed to form a chokehold on the OFC Champions League – the premier men's club football competition in Oceania. They've won a whopping 13 OFC Champions League titles, including the last four, and as such, they've also played in more FIFA Club World Cups (12) than any other team in world football, coming away with a bronze medal in the 2014 edition against all odds.

“It was a bit of a no-brainer….I didn't have much to think about. Auckland City have been at the top of the domestic league for about 20 years now, they have a proud and successful history. 

They already had quite a strong legacy of National League and Oceania titles before I had joined the club four years ago, which is why I was so excited to join them. Winning trophies is in the Auckland City DNA, that's the standard and expectation they have.”

After making the move to Auckland, Gray has been able to travel the world and play against some of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was an unused substitute on February 1, 2023 when Auckland lost 3-0 to Egyptian heavyweights Al Ahly in the first round in Morocco. 10 months later, Gray was given the start against Saudi powerhouse Al-Ittihad, which featured ex-Premier League icons N'Golo Kanté and Fabinho in midfield and Karim Benzema, who was one year removed from winning the Ballon d'Or. 

Gray delivered an impressive account of himself against Benzema, making two clearances and two tackles and completing six out of eight long balls, but he was unable to prevent Auckland from losing 3-0 in Saudi Arabia. Nine months later, he remained on the bench for the entirety of their 6-2 loss at Emirati giants Al Ain in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup – previously known as the FIFA Club World Cup. And this month, his Auckland side lost 3-0 at Egyptian behemoths Pyramids in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.

Once a mid-season tournament featuring seven teams from six different continents, FIFA decided to expand the Club World Cup to 32 teams and hold the inaugural edition in the United States between June 14 and July 13, 2025. As the highest-ranked club among the winners of the confederation's top club competition between 2021 and 2024, Auckland City were Oceania's sole representatives. And this time, they weren't just going to get one match to prove themselves, but at least three.

Some of Auckland's players missed out on a chance to participate in the Club World Cup after failing to secure annual leave from their day job, whereas some had to take unpaid leave from their job. There is a cap of 150 New Zealand dollars ($86 USD) per week for amateur footballers in New Zealand covering basic expenses such as gym membership; some players simply couldn't afford to take the financial risks to play against three of the biggest teams in world football: Bayern Munich, Benfica, and Boca Juniors.

“The whole organization is obviously unique in that we juggle a lot of commitments, it's not just football for us. It's been a 4-year ride that we've been on together up until this point, which has been full of a lot of obstacles to overcome from work to injuries. I've had a few problems like knee injuries and vertigo, I've missed a lot of football over the past four years. I injured my groin in the last match in New Zealand before going over to the States, so I missed the warm-up matches and the Bayern game before coming on in the Benfica game and getting my opportunity vs. Boca. There were moments where I was unsure if I'd even feature at this Club World Cup, so the way it worked out was pretty special.”

After watching from the bench as German giants Bayern Munich thrashed Auckland 10-0 in Cincinnati, Gray replaced Michael Den Heijer in the 79th minute of their match against Benfica in Orlando. The Portuguese giants were already cruising to a 5-0 demolition when Gray came on, with Ángel Di María putting the cherry on top with a last-second penalty to secure a 6-0 victory. With nothing left to play for in their third match, Auckland manager Paul Posa decided to hand Gray a start in central defense against Argentine powerhouse Boca Juniors.

All signs pointed to Auckland suffering yet another humiliating beatdown in Nashville. After all, Auckland had lost each of their last eight matches in the Club World Cup, and unlike Boca, who were fighting for second place in the group and a trip to the knockout round, Auckland were already eliminated.

Whereas Boca boasted a team featuring battle-hardened veterans like Agustín Marchesín and Luis Advíncula, scintillating youngsters like Carlos Palacios and Exequiel Zeballos, and one of the greatest strikers of his generation in Edinson Cavani, Auckland boasted a team of real estate agents, Coca-Cola sale representatives, and sundry professions. Thankfully for Gray, the match wasn't played on paper or a spreadsheet, but a football pitch.

When Boca opened the scoring in the 26th minute via an own goal, it seemed that the floodgates had opened. Instead, Auckland weathered the storm and narrowly escaped the first half with a fighting chance. They didn't take it for granted, leveling the scoring in the 52nd minute as Jerson Lagos whipped in a corner kick for Gray who, despite being tightly marked by Rodrigo Battaglia, managed to steady himself and fire a bullet header into the back of the net. Gray excelled at the back both on and off the ball, completing 11 out of 15 passes, blocking a shot, and making 12 clearances as Auckland prevailed with a historic 1-1 stalemate.

“I won't forget that moment, it's the best moment of my career, and it'll be something that this group will talk about for years to come, but I think it's taken a while to properly sink in. It's interesting, because we all came back from the tournament and went straight to our normal lives, we had deadlines to meet. I had my normal responsibilities to get back to, so I didn't take the time to reflect on it until more recently.”

After returning to New Zealand as a Kiwi hero, Gray went back to his day job of working as a Physical Education and Health Teacher at Auckland Grammar School and Mt. Roskill Intermediate School, as well as coaching the school's boys' football team. Every day, he wakes up at 5 a.m. and coaches his junior side from 6:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., before teaching his classes from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. He will then enjoy a brief slice of freedom until going to training (3-4 times a week) from 5:45 to 8:30 before returning home, and on top of that, he's got to squeeze in online lectures as he studies for a graduate diploma.

Gray is set to graduate from his one-year program in December and become a registered teacher, but first, he'll be looking to lead Auckland to the National League title. Auckland will kick off their league campaign on October 4, which will last for two months. The top two teams of the 11-team table will then face off in a single-leg playoff to determine the champion of New Zealand.

“We're fortunate to have had a little break with a bye in the first round, because it's been quite a long season. We started in mid-January and have been playing through, and we definitely want to finish the year on a high and win the title. It's definitely been a sprint, and now we're starting fresh, as we've got 10 National League games where we can't afford to slip up at all. It would be a nice way to finish the year with the title.”

At 28 years of age, Christian Gray has already followed in his father's footsteps by excelling as a center back in New Zealand's premier football league, but he hasn't yet been able to replicate his father in representing the New Zealand national team. Out of the 24 players who were called up for this month's Soccer Ashes matches against Australia, all of them were playing at the professional level. But whilst Gray is comfortable in his multifaceted role as a teacher/coach/player, he is holding out hope of making it as a professional footballer and playing for the All Whites.

“I haven't played professionally before, and these days if you want to play for the national team, you need to be playing professionally. Our captain [Mario Ilich] played a few times for the All Whites last year, but it's a bit different now. Back in the day, you could play for Auckland City and the All Whites, but it's changing now. There's still something in me that wants to see how good I can be if I commit 100% to it and pursue a football career. I like to think I'm still young, but this year I've committed to a few things and I'm committed to seeing them through. In the back of my mind, there's still that competitive side of me that is thinking how far can I get if I put all my eggs in that basket.”

Soccer news just in. The 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States will be accompanied by a fresh approach to domestic soccer coverage that will tell the story of the sport's growth in 2026 and beyond. 

One new high-profile media outlet, Kickback Soccer Media, has teamed up with Bluesky and joined a growing group of independent outlets spearheading coverage of the game in the US in this potentially pivotal moment.

Some of this new approach is by design: there is no better way to engage with soccer fans and provide the kind of coverage they want than by immersing a media outlet in that culture, and reporting on that as much as the games and the sport itself.

It is also partly by necessity. Domestic American soccer has struggled to get a foothold in the country's national and mainstream media. When national outlets do cover soccer, they are more likely to cover soccer stories from the English Premier League or elsewhere in Europe, thousands of miles away, than they are to cover the game locally. 

As a result, domestic soccer coverage has always originated from other channels. From a passion for the game and for the culture and community it embraces. Done primarily for the love of the sport.

The interest and participation has always been there and is increasingly so, but in the past, those more mainstream outlets might have done one story on an MLS team every few months and then complained that no one reads them and took that as evidence that no one is interested.

It needs to be built over time, and from the right place. The soccer media has faced as many obstacles and setbacks in the United States as the game itself, but it's no surprise that a certain style of dedicated (in all senses of the word) media coverage is the one that is making the best go of succeeding.

“The media activity in this country has largely vacillated between the rights holders and the momentary interest of various other outlets that lasts around a World Cup, or a tent pole even, but I think a couple of things have shifted,” says Kickback co-founder and CEO John Parker.

“I hear regularly from people who'll say: ‘I've been hearing for 30 years that soccer's the sport of the future, I don't get it.' 

“I think it's partly because it's already here, but we're still just kind of repeating the same refrain.

“In terms of the monetary investment and the scale of fandom in this country, it's arguably already the third biggest sport, based on all the data, and all of that data says that once the current generation of people 35 and under becomes 55 and under over the next 20 years, it's going to be the second biggest sport. 

“It's not the sport of the future. It's already arrived.”

From fansites like Hudson River Blue on the East Coast and Sounder At Heart on the West, to national independent outlets and newsletters including Backheeled, Protagonist Soccer, and Beyond the 90, there is a new era of soccer media that is connecting with fans and providing more interesting coverage of their teams and leagues.

The two aforementioned fansites themselves emerged from a more mainstream media company, SB Nation (Vox Media), that gave up on domestic soccer and ditched all of its MLS outlets in 2023, but both have thrived and become more successful since going it alone. Again, partly by design, but partly because it was the only option.

By providing thoughtful, knowledgeable, respectful, and considered coverage, these outlets, using a new media model, will become the destination for U.S.-based fans looking for coverage of the world's most popular sport in the coming years.

“At Soccerwise, we don't pretend these are silly or little things, we value what happens post a Seattle Miami game, or post the Nashville Philly game, the same way that someone who's covering Chelsea or Manchester United would value their coverage,” says David Gass, who founded and hosts the Soccerwise podcast, and is the chief media officer and co-founder at Kickback.

“We think it matters to the people, it matters to the players, it matters to the coaches. One of the things I think that a lot of people who have tried to sell soccer in America have done is belittle their own product at times by overvaluing external products or trying to legitimize it by connecting it to external things.

“I just did an interview about college soccer, and the University of Maryland has a supporters group that has bounced for 30 plus years because they value themselves, they put a good product on the field, and they make it feel like it matters.

“If you do that, people can engage with it. People will give that energy and effort to it because they feel like it's worth their time. I think that's one of those things that soccer has struggled a lot with, but is one of the things I think we're really primed to help provide fans.”

There is more evidence of this in Tuesday's announcement that Kickback will partner with the Philadelphia Union and the United States national team supporters' group, American Outlaws, to provide free tickets for fans who are looking to experience a soccer match for the first time.

Between now and the Women's World Cup in 2027, Kickback will provide free tickets for those first-time fans in the supporters section for U.S. Soccer-controlled matches, while at the Union, tickets will be provided for new fans in the River End supporters' section for the match against New York City FC on October 4.

While the timing of Kickback Soccer Media's creation has coincided with the upcoming World Cup, these kinds of moves show that, though the high-profile tournament will be part of their growth and coverage, it is the growth beneath and beyond the World Cup that will really help move things forward.

“As a business, I think we have approached the industry with a very 2025 and beyond lens, and that is one of our advantages,” says Parker.

“There are so many great people in this industry who have been susceptible to all the vacillation I referenced before. So part of our rallying cry, part of the reason we exist, is that in this conversation with our seven or eight people who feature across our media ecosystem, and the people are behind the scenes building all of this, was that question of ‘how do we create something that can be our legacy, a place that we can build for years to come, versus just being a gun for hire for the [World Cup] next year?'

“We believe that the modern monetization model of media allows us to create a platform for those people to cover the leagues, to cover the sport, to amplify the voices in the U.S.

“It will allow us to create the scalability that is necessary to employ people and give them the platform, and give the sport the platform that it deserves.”

As well as finding new ways to reach fans through modern media, many independent organizations have also found a more palatable and helpful social media outlet.

Bluesky is emerging as the social media platform of choice for creators, writers, and journalists. Unlike others in the sphere, its algorithm does not suppress posts that share links to work published elsewhere. 

This has meant a better experience for fans and creators alike, one that is driven by sharing and discussion, rather than a race to the bottom built around outrage or engagement based solely on numbers rather than interaction and connection.

“I think when it comes to Bluesky, what we really want to accomplish is to put primacy back on people who are leading genuine conversations and who authentically want to support and celebrate the culture that they care about,” says Bluesky's partnerships lead, Harry Packer.

“I think the way in which we give people lots of control and granularity around their moderation means that you can actually have conversations on Bluesky. You can have disagreements as well, which is great, and they don't necessarily explode into these crazy arguments.

“I think we really build around depth of engagement and conversation, and because we have people who have come to us for that purpose, I think we offer really unique engagement in that regard.

“We want to be a place where it is as much about celebration of the culture as opposed to the commercialization of it.”

Major outlets like The Guardian have already abandoned X (formerly Twitter) and moved all their social media properties across to Bluesky. Among the U.S. soccer media, Hudson River Blue has done the same, while Kickback has partnered with Bluesky ahead of the World Cup. 

Though no social media site is without its issues, Bluesky is becoming the go-to platform where the reporters and supporters, the readers and the writers, the broadcasters and the viewers, can have genuine conversations. 

This could also improve the second-screen experience of soccer and create links between everyone involved, as Twitter once did.

“The connection with Bluesky has been really big for us,” says Gass. “It feels like it's brought back some of the online engagement that Twitter had in its heyday, especially in soccer, where people can be physically disconnected.

“Online has been such a powerful source for soccer fandom in America, and so I think we are using those avenues to constantly get feedback from people saying, ‘this is what we want, this is what we like, this is what we're looking for.'”

Though most of this is still focused on the World Cup, Kickback knows that it will be around after the tournament, simply because many of those involved have that aforementioned dedication.

“What differentiates us is that we know we are all going to be working in the industry in 2036,” summarizes Parker. 

“World Cups [in the U.S.] could be a decade ago, two decades ago, and we're still going to be here.

“For us, after 2026, there's not a question of did we do well enough, it's a question of how do we build from this to the next thing? 

“So right now, with everything we're building, we're not thinking about how we optimize it for 2026, we're thinking about how that best positions us in the soccer community for what comes after?”

Gass adds, “The 2027 Women's World Cup in our time zone is going to be massive, and I think that's been underrated with the excitement around 2026—having a gold medal, reigning champion in the U.S. playing in Brazil, in our time zone, in a country that most people associate with the sport—there's going to be big things to cover. I think we do it as well as anyone.”

Jurgen Klopp has doubled down on his criticism of the Club World Cup by reiterating his belief that the tournament is putting players at greater risk of injury. The Club World Cup took place in the United States this summer, with Chelsea triumphing at the end of the expanded format.

The competition involved 32 teams and 48 games and often took place amid stifling heat, attracting plenty of concern. The issue of player burnout and fatigue was a constant theme in the background and Klopp was the loudest detractor, branding it the “worst idea ever implemented in football”.

The former Liverpool manager, who is now the global head of soccer for Red Bull, has always been vocal in his opinion that the football calendar is over-saturated. He is concerned about player welfare and believes the push towards more fixtures is based solely on greed.

His opinion saw some backlash, with ex-Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger and Bulgarian football legend Hristo Stoichkov among those to push back. Meanwhile, Sky Sports News reporter Kaveh Solhekol went viral after passionately defending the Club World Cup and telling Klopp he doesn't have to watch it.

In an interview with The Athletic, Klopp has stuck to his guns. “Did I read this morning that Chelsea have an injury crisis? Maybe they would have had injuries (anyway),” he said.

“My expertise is I know how much you can expect from football players. I know about intensity in training. We always ask for more. We go, go, go. I don't doubt it was a great tournament. I didn't watch it. Chelsea were super happy to win it. Great, a lot of money. But at one point we have to take care of the few people this game would not exist without: the players.

“There's no solution besides stopping organising new tournaments in the summer break. There's no break anymore for the best players in the world. You wouldn't do this in any other part of life. Imagine you put the best artist out every night until they fall down and then we say sorry, he lost focus…”

Klopp is backed up by the Professional Footballers Association, who have warned that players could go on strike if their worries about burnout are not taken seriously. It comes after a report by FIFPRO, the world players' union, showed none of the teams at this summer's Club World Cup had the recommended 28 days' rest period.

As Liverpool manager, Klopp frequently made headlines for clashing with broadcasters for scheduling his side to play early kick-offs on Saturdays after European away days in mid-week. But Klopp is unlikely to ever have to deal with such problems directly, having stated he doesn't see himself returning to club management.

September 30 – World players' union FIFPRO has once again raised the issues of player workload and welfare ahead of next summer's World Cup as the organisation continues to await talks with FIFA. 

On Monday, FIFPRO published a 51-page report titled “Overworked and Under-Protected — The Player Health and Performance Impact” covering the 2024-25 season, highlighting the impact of workload, rest and the effects of the recent Club World Cup in the United States.



FIFA launched the maiden edition of its expanded Club World Cup this summer, but FIFPRO's study showed that the off-seasons and pre-seasons of Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich were all heavily altered because of the competition.  

Players did not get the recommended 28-day summer rest period. On top of that, the Club World Cup saw matches played in extreme heat, a scenario that may be repeated at next year's 48-team World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada.  

“You've got the perfect storm of how not to treat a human,” said FIFPRO consultant Dr. Darren Burgess. “You've got players playing a large number of games, followed by fewer than the recommended off-season days and preseason days, followed by a large number of games again. The cycle keeps repeating.” 

“This leads to injury at worst and at best reduced capacity to perform.” 

FIFPRO Director of Policy and Strategic Relations Alexander Bielefeld added: “This year, with the impact at the Club World Cup, and the pathway towards the World Cup in the US, Mexico and Canada, it felt necessary to include it in the report this year. The risk to player health is clearly rising.”  

The world players' union called on FIFA to reconsider kick-off times and venues at the 2026 World Cup, but FIFPRO is still waiting for the world governing body to schedule talks.  

Last summer, FIFA and the union fell out after FIFPRO were not invited to a meeting on the sidelines of the Club World Cup held by the world federation in New York City. FIFA then claimed a “consensus” was reached for mandatory rest periods.  

“We have informal discussions on a regular basis on different levels, technical levels, be that medical or any other department,” said Alex Phillips, FIFPRO's Secretary General. “But nothing major or specific with regards to the World Cup next year. 

“We have multiple concerns and that's just one tournament of many and the vast majority of players around the world, their bread and butter is national leagues and national competitions. But yes, it is a concern.  

“So we will proceed as we did with the Club World Cup and provide the science and the data to FIFA well in advance of the tournament. We are doing the same with others, not just FIFA. We're doing the same, for example, with the Women's Asian Cup which is happening in Australia next March. 

“Same principle. Well in advance, we say to them, ‘look, you've scheduled matches at 1:00 p.m, you do realise that in Australia they don't play matches at 1:00 p.m. in March or in the summer?' to try and help them to either reschedule the matches or if not, at least implement better protocols and mitigating measures as happened in the Club World Cup.”

by Dante Gonzalez September 30, 2025

The 2026 World Cup is less than a year away, marking the first time the tournament will be hosted by three countries and expanded to 48 teams. With qualifiers underway, FIFA has sanctioned a former host nation in a ruling that could jeopardize its chances of making it to the competition.

One of the confederations producing surprising results is the Confederation of African Football (CAF), where several nations are eyeing a historic first appearance on the world stage. Among them is South Africa, but the 2010 World Cup hosts now find themselves on the brink of missing another global tournament.

On Monday, FIFA's Disciplinary Committee sanctioned the South African Football Association for fielding an ineligible player in March's World Cup qualifier against Lesotho. The match ended 2-0 to South Africa, but Teboho Mokoena was included in the lineup despite serving a one-game suspension.

As a result, FIFA has ruled the match a 3-0 forfeit loss, stripping South Africa of three crucial points and denting its goal difference. The federation was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs (about $12,500), while Mokoena received only a warning.

The sanction dealt a major blow to South Africa, which has now dropped behind Benin at the top of Group C. Both teams have 14 points from 10 matches, but Benin holds a narrow advantage on goal difference. Nigeria and Rwanda sit three points back, keeping the group wide open.

As in UEFA qualifying, group winners automatically book their place at the 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Runners-up advance to a four-team African playoff in November, while the rest are eliminated.

South Africa will finish qualifying in October with matches against Zimbabwe on the 10th and Rwanda on the 14th. To keep their hopes alive, Bafana Bafana must win both games and hope Benin slips, or else secure a superior goal difference to earn a direct qualification to the World Cup.

Learner Tien advanced to his first ATP Tour title match on Tuesday at the China Open in Beijing, where he became the second-youngest finalist in tournament history. The 19-year-old rallied from 3-5 down in the second set against Daniil Medvedev, eventually advancing 5-7, 7-5, 4-0 after the 29-year-old was forced to retire due to injury.

The #NextGenATP American Tien was competing in his maiden tour-level semi-final and looked down and out when he trailed 1-4 and 3-5 in the second set. However, he capitalised on some Medvedev errors in the closing stages of the second set and then benefited from the 29-year-old's lack of movement in the decider to advance after two hours and 26 minutes. Medvedev struggled to track down the balls in the third set, seemingly cramping.

"I was down 3-5 and 2-4 in the second and clawed my way back," Tien said. "I didn't think anything was wrong with him and then he came out of the bathroom break kind of limping, so I was not sure if he was cramping or if he was injured as he had tape on his leg. I think it was cramping and I have been there and it is not fun. All the best to him and it is not how you want to come through a match but I am happy to be in the final."

Carlos Alcaraz served Taylor Fritz some quick revenge on Tuesday at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, where he ousted the American to win his eighth title of the season.

Just nine days removed from his Laver Cup defeat to Fritz, the World No. 1 stamped his authority with a classy 6-4, 6-4 championship-match performance in Tokyo, capping a remarkable debut run at the ATP 500 event. Now boasting a Tour-best 67 wins and eight trophies in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz is threatening to better his rival Jannik Sinner's tally of 73 wins from last year.

“It's been my best season so far without a doubt,” Alcaraz said. “Eight titles, 10 finals… That shows how hard I've worked just to be able to experience these moments and accomplish my goals. I didn't start the year that good, struggling emotionally, so how I came back from that, I'm just really proud of myself, and of all the people around me who have helped me to be in this position.”

Another city, another crown 👑🏆@carlosalcaraz defeats Fritz 6-4 6-4 to conquer Tokyo for the first time and claim his 8th title of the season.@japanopentennis | #kinoshitajotennis pic.twitter.com/qhUBaSQpTp

Since losing to Sinner in the Wimbledon final in July, Alcaraz has responded with three consecutive titles at the ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati, the US Open and now Tokyo. With his 24th career tour-level crown, the 22-year-old Spaniard tied Alexander Zverev for the most among men born since 1990.

Although Fritz, who twice took a medical timeout to receive treatment on his left thigh, was unable to contain Alcaraz's trademark firepower in the final, he has strengthened his bid to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals. Last year's runner-up has jumped one spot to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin.

In the first ATP 500 final between two Top-5 players since October last year, there was no shortage of breathtaking winners and early entertainment. Yet it did not come without drama, and more fitness concerns for Alcaraz, who suffered an injury scare in his first-round win over Sebastian Baez.

After a nine-shot exchange in the fourth game, which ended with Alcaraz planting a high backhand volley into the net, the Spaniard stooped at the back of the court in a bid to regain his breath. He received a time violation warning from ATP umpire Fergus Murphy before taking a few extra seconds to regroup, but he then found a trademark lob over Fritz to hold serve in the ensuing point.

Watch Alcaraz leave Fritz out to dry with lob perfection: 

Armed with his typically explosive forehand and instinctive returns, Alcaraz overwhelmed Fritz from all corners of the court and eventually converted his sixth break point to serve for the opener. During the first set, the Spaniard clocked a 9.7 Shot Quality on his forehand wing, from which he fired seven winners to just four unforced errors.

“I enjoyed every single second, [apart from] the five minutes I was on the floor after I hurt my ankle,” Alcaraz joked about his Tokyo debut. “I'm really happy with the level that I played, with everything. Starting the week not good with the ankle, and the way that I came back from that, I'm just really happy about it.”

Fritz took a medical timeout at the end of the first set to receive treatment on his left thigh, which was strapped after three games of the second. The American's movement was significantly hindered, and he struggled to cope with Alcaraz's variety throughout the second set.

Even though Fritz drilled a low backhand winner down the line to earn one of the breaks back late on, Alcaraz recovered by serving out the match on his second attempt after 93 minutes. He now leads Fritz 4-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Fresh off an impressive victory over No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev, the eighth-seeded Medvedev won the first set against Tien in a rematch of their five-set Australian Open thriller. But much like in Melbourne, the American was finding his way back when Medvedev began to fade.A point from falling behind 2-0 in the final set, Medvedev was issued a code violation for not giving his best effort from umpire Adel Nour, prompting Medvedev to appeal to supervisor Roland Herfel.“You don't talk now. I talk to him,” said Medvedev.

A point from falling behind 2-0 in the final set, Medvedev was issued a code violation for not giving his best effort from umpire Adel Nour, prompting Medvedev to appeal to supervisor Roland Herfel.“You don't talk now. I talk to him,” said Medvedev.

“You don't talk now. I talk to him,” said Medvedev.

When Herfel sought confirmation of Nour's ruling—which Nour explained stemmed from Medvedev's lack of movement—Medvedev jumped in again.“So, you prefer that I retire?” he asked. “Say to the cameras that you prefer that the guys are retiring.“I'm giving my best effort, so why the hell is he giving me best effort? Who are you to decide for me? Who are you? What's your name?”The 29-year-old Medvedev was playing only his second tournament since a chaotic first-round defeat at the US Open, where he was fined $42,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct during his loss to Benjamin Bonzi.“I want to do something bad. I'm not allowed because I'm disqualified. Why is every referee in the world trying to intimidate me? I didn't say one word. After US Open, I'm trying to be good and this guy is doing that? And I'm supposed to act good?”Medvedev ultimately retired two games later for a final score of 5-7, 7-5, 4-0 to Tien, who is into his first ATP final against Jannik Sinner.

It would likely be fair to say that Coco Gauff had a solid day Tuesday in Beijing. Not only did she come from a set down to defeat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 and advance to the China Open quarterfinals, but she also continued her title defense and clinched a spot in the 2025 WTA Finals.

Coco Gauff stepped onto the court Tuesday with more at stake than usual for a fourth-round match.

A win would send her to the China Open quarterfinals for the third straight year, keep her title defense alive and allow her to officially clinch a spot in the 2025 WTA Finals -- her fourth consecutive qualification for the year-end tournament. 

And while it wasn't easy, the two-time Grand Slam champion checked every box, rallying for a gritty 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 victory over Belinda Bencic in 2 hours and 29 minutes.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

It marked Gauff's fourth win in six meetings with Bencic -- three of them coming in 2025.

“It was a tough match,” Gauff said afterward. “I had chances in the first set to close it out, but overall, I'm happy with how I fought. She was being really aggressive, but I tried my best. … I'm happy to be back in Riyadh and I'm glad I was able to [qualify] here.”

Gauff came out firing, dominating on serve and racing to a 4-1 lead. She looked poised to cruise through the first set and possibly the match.

Then things got tricky. 

Bencic stormed back, winning five straight games to steal the opening set and later went up a break in the second set. But as she so often does, Gauff dug in.

The American was 1-for-8 on break points before converting her second of the match to level the second set at 4-all. She then held serve to force a tiebreak, where both players had a reason to feel confident.

Gauff entered the day with a 9-5 record in tiebreaks this year; Bencic was slightly better at 9-4. But it was Gauff who came from a mini break down to win the tiebreak and force a decider.

The third set was all Gauff. She broke twice as she improved to 12-2 in three-set matches this season, once again showing the resilience of a champion when it matters most.

Here are three fun facts from Thursday's match:

Home away from home: Gauff says she loves playing in Beijing and given the number of gifts she continues to receive from fans, it's easy to see why.

“I hope so,” Gauff said when asked if more presents might be coming. “I love gifts.”

As to why Chinese fans feel so connected to Gauff, it may have to do with the fact that since 2023, Gauff has earned 16 WTA-level wins on Chinese soil, second only to China's Zheng Qinwen (17).

Three strikes and you're out: If you're Bencic or Leylah Fernandez, please look away.

With Tuesday's win, Gauff has now beaten Bencic three times in four tries this season. Coincidentally, she's also defeated Fernandez three times in 2025.

The third win against each sent both players packing in their search for Beijing glory.

Youngest to ever do it: It's easy to forget that Gauff is still only 21 years old.

Until you realize she's the youngest player to register nine consecutive wins in women's singles at the China Open since the tournament began in 2004.

And that she's also the youngest to play 14 matches, win 13 matches and reach three quarterfinals at the event -- all since its inception.

Gauff will face Eva Lys in the quarterfinals in what will be the first meeting between the two. A win would send Gauff to her third consecutive China Open semifinal and third WTA 1000 semifinal of the season.

It would likely be fair to say that Coco Gauff had a solid day Tuesday in Beijing. Not only did she come from a set down to defeat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2 and advance to the China Open quarterfinals, but she also continued her title defense and clinched a spot in the 2025 WTA Finals.

Since then, he's 1-5 against Alcaraz and 19-0 against all other Top 10 opposition.De Minaur did snap one streak on Tuesday, though—by winning the second set, he ended Sinner's run of 39 sets in a row against Top 10 players other than Alcaraz.

But there's an even bigger picture domination growing, too: Sinner has now won his last 19 matches in a row against Top 10 players other than Carlos Alcaraz, a stretch that dates back to the Masters 1000 event in Canada last year, where he fell to then-No. 8 Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinals.

Not only had Sinner won all 10 of his previous meetings against De Minaur, he had won their last 20 sets in a row, too—and he made that 21 in a row with a routine first set in Beijing on Tuesday. But De Minaur had other plans—after nine straight holds to start the second set, he pounced in the 10th game, breaking Sinner for the first time to send the match to a decider.De Minaur finished the second set with 11 winners to 8 unforced errors, while Sinner's game went awry, producing 10 winners to 20 unforced errors.But the Italian snapped right back into it from the start of the third set, breaking at love in the opening game and eventually building a 4-0, double-break lead in just 20 minutes. The two then held from there until it was over."I felt like it was a very high level," Sinner said. "We had many great rallies and many chances both ways—I had my chances in the second set and couldn't use them, and also he had more chances, so it was quite an even match."In the third set I tried to raise my level, and I broke him early, which gave me confidence serving against him for the rest of the set. I'm happy about today and obviously very happy to be back in the final here in Beijing."

How well do the F1 drivers know their car's parts?

Lewis Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, has passed away, a few days after being admitted to hospital due to serious illness.

Lewis Hamilton has announced the passing of his dog, Roscoe, following a health battle.

Roscoe was recently admitted to hospital and placed in a coma after being treated for pneumonia, with Hamilton missing a Pirelli tyre test last week to be by his side.

On Monday, Hamilton took to social media to share an emotional post confirming that Roscoe had died in his arms on Sunday evening.

It comes five years after another of Hamilton's dogs, Coco, passed away.

“After four days on life support, fighting with every bit of strength he had, I had to make the hardest decision of my life and say goodbye to Roscoe,” wrote Hamilton. “He never stopped fighting, right until the very end.

“I feel so grateful and honoured to have shared my life with such a beautiful soul, an angel and true friend. Bringing Roscoe into my life was the best decision I ever made, and I will forever cherish the memories we created together.

“Although I lost Coco, I have never been faced with putting a dog to sleep before, though I know my mum and many close friends have. It is one of the most painful experiences and I feel a deep connection to everyone who has gone through the loss of a beloved pet.

“Although it was so hard, having him was one of the most beautiful parts of life, to love so deeply and to be loved in return.

“Thank you all for the love and support you've shown Roscoe over the years. It has been so special to witness and feel.”

Lewis Hamilton has withdrawn from a Pirelli tyre test after his beloved dog, Roscoe, was taken ill.

Lewis Hamilton has shared an update with fans on the health of his much-loved dog, Roscoe, after withdrawing from a Pirelli tyre test due to the bulldog being admitted to hospital.

Hamilton had been set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but the seven-time World Champion was replaced by Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu.

In a social media post, Hamilton told his followers that Roscoe was in a coma after being treated for pneumonia.

“Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts. I want to keep you all updated,” Hamilton wrote on Friday.

“Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped.

“They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support.”

Hamilton's post was met with well wishes from his followers, including former team mate George Russell who wrote: “Thinking of you mate.”

Roscoe – who has his own Instagram account followed by 1.3 million fans – has been a regular fixture by Hamilton's side since 2013, with the Briton's beloved dog joining him at many Grands Prix over the years.

Max Verstappen kept himself busy between the Azerbaijan and Singapore Grands Prix with a successful GT3 race weekend at the Nurburgring.

Max Verstappen added another note to his impressive motorsport CV by winning on his GT3 race debut at the Nurburgring Nordschleife last weekend, as the Dutchman continues to explore endurance competition.

Alongside team mate Chris Lulham, who usually contests the GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup for Verstappen.com Racing, the four-time F1 World Champion stormed to victory in the ninth round of the NLS (Nürburgring Langstrecken-Serie).

Verstappen and Lulham took on the four-hour race in a Verstappen.com and Red Bull-liveried Ferrari 296 GT3, which was run by Swiss team Emil Frey Racing – the pair coming out on top in a field of 110 cars, of which 10 participated in the fastest category (SP9).

“It was great!” Verstappen beamed, after qualifying third and seizing the lead at the start of the race. “During my first two stints, the car was amazing.

“After Qualifying, I knew the car would be good on a dry track. Everything went well in terms of traffic, and we didn't make any big mistakes. To win my debut race here is amazing.”

As for what might come next in his growing endurance career, Verstappen added: “Of course, we really want to race the 24-hour race, here at the Nordschleife. If that's going to be next year, I don't know yet.

“We need more experience, so hopefully we can enter a few more NLS races next year.”

Verstappen will return to F1 duties at the upcoming Singapore Grand Prix, with the Red Bull racer aiming to further cut the gap to McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship standings.

	When life gives you “Lemonade,” you make a new album … at least in Louis Tomlinson‘s case. On Tuesday, the musician released his single “Lemonade,” and announced that he'll drop his third studio album, How Did I Get Here?, on Jan. 23, 2026.


	“I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make,” Tomlinson said in a statement. “My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music.”

A post shared by Louis Tomlinson (@louist91)


	He added, “I'm still learning and getting better as a singer and a songwriter. I find it impossible to be complacent; it's not in my vocabulary. For the first time now, I'm allowing myself to be the artist I'd always hoped to be.”


	Tomlinson worked on the project during a three-week trip to Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, alongside his primary collaborator, Nico Rebscher. “Taking all of the steps I did to get here was important. I needed to the confidence to become the artist I wanted to be and make a hopefully big, but personal album. I think I did,” he continued.

	











	To lead the album, Tomlinson released his single “Lemonade,” dedicated to a lady who's “so bitter” and “so sweet” at the same time. “The most important thing was for the first single to sound ambitious sonically. It had to be big and fun,” Tomlinson added. “To me, ‘Lemonade' really has instant and natural personality. It ended up being the perfect way to begin this chapter.”

THR's iconic Roundtable series expands to include top contenders for the newly introduced Golden Globes best podcast category.


							By 

	THR Staff



	Coinciding with The Hollywood Reporter's Creators A-List issue and event, THR will — for the first time ever — produce a dedicated Podcast Roundtable featuring top contenders for the newly introduced best podcast category at the Golden Globes.  


	The announcement fittingly debuts on International Podcast Day, marking the medium's growing global impact.




	The addition of podcasters to THR's prestigious Roundtable lineup spotlights the voices driving today's audio renaissance and contemporary entertainment trends bringing podcasting into the heart of the awards conversation.

	“We are thrilled to launch The Hollywood Reporter's inaugural Podcast Roundtable in partnership with Spotify, shining a spotlight on the creative forces driving today's most compelling storytelling — an essential and rapidly growing frontier in entertainment,” said THR editor-in-chief Maer Roshan, “and we're deeply grateful to Spotify for helping us elevate this important conversation.” 


	Spotify has become home to millions of shows and creators. Today, there are nearly 7 million podcasts on the platform, and more than 1 billion people have pressed play, making podcasts a natural part of daily life for a global audience.


	“At Spotify, we've long believed that podcasts are shaping the future of storytelling and culture. The Golden Globes' new category is a historic acknowledgment of the creators building a global community through both audio and video, and it's why we're partnering with The Hollywood Reporter to launch the first Podcast Roundtable. Together, we're spotlighting the extraordinary range of voices in this space and celebrating the power of podcasts alongside the most influential achievements in entertainment,” said Roman Wasenmüller, global head of podcast business at Spotify.

	











	The Golden Globes announced earlier this year that it would be adding a new category to its awards slate, honoring the best podcast of the year. The new category, debuting as part of the 83rd annual event on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2026, is a landmark inclusion for the Golden Globes recognizing the extraordinary and diverse talents in podcasting.  


The Hollywood Reporter's full Podcast Roundtable will air in November on THR's platforms, and for the first time on Spotify, bringing this high-profile conversation directly to fans worldwide.

Nicole Kidman is a proud mother of four children. The “Big Little Lies” star shares two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret, with country singer Keith Urban, whom she separated from in September 2025 after 19 years of marriage. But Kidman's journey as a mom began much earlier, with her two children from her marriage to Tom Cruise.

Kidman and Cruise adopted their daughter, Isabella “Bella” Jane, and son, Connor Anthony, in the 1990s, while they were still married. Though the couple split in 2001, Kidman has consistently spoken with warmth and pride about her two older children. “They are generous, kind and hardworking,” she told PEOPLE. “And these are traits that I love to see in my children.”

Kidman and Cruise adopted Bella shortly after her birth in Miami on December 22, 1992. Kidman later told Vanity Fair that she had long wanted to be a mother.

“From the minute Tom and I were married, I wanted to have babies,” she said in 2007. “And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that's when we would adopt [our daughter] Bella.”

Though she grew up primarily in Beverly Hills, Bella has kept her life fairly private. She studied at Delmar Academy of Make-up and Hair in London before moving into fashion. She once worked for Holmes & Yang, the fashion line created by Katie Holmes and Jeanne Yang, before launching her own label, BKC (Bella Kidman Cruise), in 2018. Her line features t-shirts decorated with her original illustrations.

“Bella has been an artist her entire life. Her go-to medium is marker on paper with her inspiration for her artwork drawn largely from friends, fashion, and music,” a statement on her website explains.

Bella married British I.T. consultant Max Parker in 2015. Although neither Kidman nor Cruise attended the wedding, People reported that Cruise helped pay for the celebration, and a source close to Kidman shared she was “very happy for Bella.”

Now 32, Bella continues to showcase her artwork on Instagram. She made headlines in December 2023 after being photographed with Cruise, Connor, and NFL star Derrick Brooks at a Tampa Bay Lightning game — their first public outing together in nearly 15 years.

Kidman and Cruise adopted their son Connor shortly after his birth in Florida on January 17, 1995. While reflecting on her first marriage, Kidman has often credited her time with Cruise for giving her Bella and Connor.

“I got married really fast and really young,” she said in 2012. “But I don't regret that because it got me Bella and Connor and I did have a fantastic marriage for a long period.”

Connor briefly pursued acting, appearing in “Seven Pounds” in 2008 and “Red Dawn” in 2012, before turning his attention to music.

By 2013, he was DJing at clubs across the U.S. Today, however, his biggest passion is deep-sea fishing. “We used to go fishing a lot when I was a little kid,” he told PEOPLE in 2016. “I was blessed to travel the world as a young kid and now I'm traveling the world working.”

A post shared by Connor's Meatshack (@connorsmeatshack)

Now 30, Connor lives a quieter life in Clearwater, Florida, where, according to People, he resides in a Scientology community. “Connor has a pretty simple life in Clearwater,” a source said in 2018. “His life is deep-sea fishing. He has a lot of friends and seems very well-liked.”

Connor also runs a barbecue business called Connor's Meatshack, sharing recipes and grilling photos on Instagram.

"You start to see him break at the end of the finale," says the actor who plays Ben Edwards in the 'Terminal List' origin story series. "That's a beautifully tragic thing because of where we are going to take him."


							By 

	Demetrius Patterson



[This story contains spoilers from the season finale of The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, “The Wolf You Feed.”]


	In the season finale of The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, Jed Haverford (Robert Wisdom) was in the hotseat about the bloody messy operation that went wrong in the penultimate episode, which left Iranian diplomats and soldiers massacred in a private plane on an air strip in Germany.




	The Iranians didn't, however, get to escape with the bearings that would help kick off their nuclear program because the show's protagonist, Ben Edwards (played by Taylor Kitsch), and the surviving espionage members of Haverford's team found out that their leader had double-crossed them.

	With the CIA ready to relieve Haverford of his duties for the mess he created, Raife Hastings (Tom Hopper) sat in a meeting to tell the agency that Haverford was in cahoots with the Iranians and set up his own team members to take the blame and/or be killed to cover up the misdeeds of the team's field leader.


	Meanwhile, Edwards retreated to the Dark Forest in Germany with the actual nuclear bearings, and reached out to his Navy SEAL buddy, James Reece (Chris Pratt), to share his mindset of how war bureaucrats have set up real soldiers to fail in their efforts to keep the free world safe. It is clear in a letter to Reece from Edwards that he has lost faith in the individuals who send young men and women to die for their country, either as soldiers or spies.


	“There was an inevitability to all of it,” Edwards say in the narration of this letting to Reece. “While I wish I had the answers, sometimes there are none. We are not ones who matter. Sometimes all you can do is play your part. I'm trying to make a difference. … War is part of the human condition, and you can only understand if you have lived it. Plain and fucking simple.”

	











	Edwards is on a suicide mission; Kitsch tells The Hollywood Reporter of the ending to Prime Video‘s prequel series and origin story to The Terminal List. “I think that is the call when he calls Reece,” Kitsch says about Edwards thinking he won't make it out of the fight with Iranian soldiers alive. “He thanks Reece for everything, and he is definitely going to take as many people out as he possibly can. It is a viable cause. I mean, he's not an idiot. He is going to fucking know that there is an army coming.”


	He continues, “There is a small scene where he is having a whiskey and a bag, and signing papers over to his wife, like clean cutting that divorce. I think he's retrospectively living out a few beats in his life before he knows it may be taken in the next day or two.”


	In an epic battle scene of one man against hundreds of Iranian soldiers, Edwards fights to exhaustion with the booby-traps, bombs and multiple weapons he has laid out around the property of his country house until he has to retreat into woods where he has more surprises for the enemy soldiers. Edwards gets wounded a few times, but just when viewers think it may be the end for him, his Navy SEAL brothers — led by Reece — sweep in to quickly dispose of the Iranian soldiers closing in on Edwards.


	Reece and his men patch Edwards up and tell him he's now on his own. He should go home. Edwards gives the nuclear bearings to his SEAL brothers, but now the former soldier/new black ops agent has revenge on his mind. Edwards and the surviving agents who were part of Haverford's team spread out to Istanbul, Tehran, and Virginia to avenge their fallen comrades. Edwards says those who failed him and the disloyal agents have to be held accountable.

	











	“It is about Haverford, but I also think overall it goes with that scene in episode one with the CIA, where he wasn't being told about everything that was happening, and his men were in harm's way without knowing the full story,” Kitsch explains.


	Ironically, when Haverford walks into his home in Virginia to find Edwards sitting inside waiting for him,  he is somehow able to escape Edwards' punishment of death. Kitsch says there is a good reason why Haverford lives.


	“It's in the show,” Kitsch says. “He says that Haverford is not going to be a star on the wall [at the CIA headquarters]. There is a scene where they show Haverford literally looking at the wall of the fallen ‘unnamed agents]. I mean, what's worse? I think it's worse keeping him alive and making sure he doesn't get anything; letting him live in it, sit in it and dwell in it.”


	He continues, “It is also a turn for Ben. Violence has always been the answer up to that point. It's a conscious decision, and hopefully you notice a turn for the character. He is thinking through it. It's not just fucking walking in and shooting him in the head, and then walking out of the door. That is lazy writing, and that's what you are expecting. It was one of my favorite scenes in the series.”


	Kitsch, however, says not to expect a reunion or forgiveness between Edwards and his Navy SEAL  brother Hastings anytime soon. As played out in the penultimate episode, the two brothers-in-arms had a huge philosophical disagreement about art of war and what it means to be loyal to the cause.

	











	“In season one of The Terminal List, I have this line where Ben said something like ‘he actually came through,'” Kitsch says. That's a long grudge that Ben holds. So I think their relationship is pretty severed, especially the way we ended it on that boat. I can't see that coming back. Maybe we'll figure something else just to get Hopper back in, but I think that relationship, along with a lot of relationships, are been and done that. It's always been important to Edwards to be in the fight, especially when it's only four of them now. It's something so personal to Ben, and also to Raife.”


	With Dark Wolf serving as a bridge story for seasons one and two of The Terminal List (the latter is currently in production), Kitsch believes Edwards has nowhere to go but to spiral deeply down the rabbit hole of loneliness and darkness in the spy world if they were to do a second season.


	“We have a pretty good damn outline,” Kitsch explains of what could come next in the expanding franchise. “Because Ben is so unpredictable, it's been a fun ride just figuring out the next steps. Without giving too much away, I think you are going to see him bottom out. There's a line on the boat [in episode six] where I say to Hopper that I'd rather be brought home in a box than to be doing what you're doing right now.”


	But the hardest part about filming the first season of Dark Wolf, Kitsch says, is that many of the characters and relationships won't carry over. Instead, viewers will see Edwards go deeper into a world full of lies, intrigue and vengeance alone.

	











	“One thing we're proud of is showing the darkness in service, and I think we are going to dive even more into that,” he says. “You are going to see Ben be lonelier than he has ever been, and you are going to see him go into a world where there is no escape anymore, in more of a psychological way. You start to see him break at the end of the finale when he says ‘I belong here [in black ops].' That's a beautifully tragic thing because of where we are going to take him in the world we are creating for him to go into, and what that will look like.”


	The Terminal List: Dark Wolf is now streaming all episodes on Prime Video.

Adelita Grijalva made history last week, becoming the first Latina woman elected to represent Arizona in the U.S. House of Representatives. She won a special election for the seat previously occupied by her father, Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva, who died in March after serving over two decades in office. 


	Despite a blowout, uncontested victory — and a precedent of swearing in the winners of special elections almost immediately after their elections — Grijalva still has no idea when she might become an official member of the House. 


	House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has yet to set a date for Grijalva's swearing in ceremony, and the delay is raising eyebrows. Grijalva has indicated she will sign a discharge petition that would force a floor vote to release government documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case as soon as she's sworn in. Her signature would put the petition over the 218-vote threshold needed to override Republican leadership's attempts to kill any vote to release the Epstein files. 

	











	To delay her swearing in would further delay the advancement of the petition, and give Republican leadership addition time to apply pressure to the Republican representatives — Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Lauren Boebert (R-Co.), and Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) — who support it. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I can't see another reason,” Grijalva tells Rolling Stone. “It doesn't change the majority, Democrats are still in the minority. That seems to be the only outstanding issue that I can see. It feels a little personal.” 

	











	In a statement to Rolling Stone, a spokesperson for Speaker Johnson's office indicated that “as is standard practice, with the House now having received the appropriate paperwork from the state, the Speaker's Office intends to schedule a swearing in for the Representative-elect when the House returns to session.”


	The House's return to session was delayed by Johnson last week, pushing it to Oct. 7, over two weeks after Grijalva won her election. Precedent establishes that in an uncontested election, there is no procedural rule barring a representative-elect from being sworn in during a pro-forma session. In April, Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine — both Republicans representing Florida — were sworn in by Johnson during a pro-forma session the day after their special elections. In September, Johnson swore in Rep. James Walkinshaw (D-Va.) less than 24 hours after Walkinshaw won his special election.

	“For me, apparently there are new requirements,” Grijalva says. “It's very frustrating on my end.  We're starting up a new office, trying to hire staff, get all set up. Our community has not had a representative be able to vote for them for a very long time.” 


	The representative-elect added that she and her team had not heard directly from Johnson's office. “We haven't heard anything from the Speaker's office,” she says. “I've heard different scenarios. And unfortunately, we first started hearing about any issue through the press, reporters would say, ‘I reached out to the Speaker's office, and this is what I heard back.' So a lot of this is second and third hand information.” 


	House Democrats have also begun to raise objections to the stalling. In a Monday letter to Johnson, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Conn.) wrote that “any delay in swearing in Representative-elect Grijalva unnecessarily deprives her constituents of representation and calls into question if the motive behind the delay is to further avoid the release of the Epstein files.” 


	Clark called on Johnson to reverse his decision to cancel this week's votes, and to immediately swear in Grijalva.

	Despite not having a swearing-in ceremony in the books, Grijalva has traveled to Washington, D.C., and is working out of borrowed conference rooms in other members' offices. “I'm hearing from my constituents, ‘When are you able to work? We elected you by nearly 40 points. There's no dispute on who won the election, so why can't you get to work?” she adds. “I have three kids, a husband, a mom who would all like to be a part of this, so the back and forth and being unsure is really problematic.” 

	











	Grijalva's new constituents appear to be voiceless — at least until she's sworn in — because of the Trump administration's bungled handling of the Epstein case, and their continued efforts to kill any efforts toward transparency. Republican leadership has obliged the administration's efforts to kill the story. Over the summer, Johnson began the House's August recess early in order to prevent votes on the release of the files from advancing. Earlier this month, Johnson publicly suggested that Trump may have only maintained a relationship with Epstein because he was secretly an FBI informant (Johnson later tried to walk back the claim).


	Not everyone in the party is on board. Rep. Massie, in particular, has long been calling for transparency, and over the weekend, Rep. Greene, a longtime Trump loyalist, told The New York Times that she does not “work” for the White House and will now bow to their pressure campaigns to sway her.

	On Sunday, Greene wrote on X that she was “not suicidal and one of the happiest healthiest people you will meet. … With that said, if something happens to me, I ask you all to find out which foreign government or powerful people would take heinous actions to stop the information from coming out,” she added, suggesting a conspiracy to keep the Epstein files hidden from the public.  


	Speaker Johnson's office has tried to avoid linking the delay surrounding Grijalva to the Epstein discharge petition, but it's clear to all that her first act as a sitting member of the House would reignite a firestorm that Republican leadership has been trying to tamp down for months.

Lola Young is taking steps to prioritize her mental health and well-being. On Tuesday, the musician announced that she's canceling future shows and events for the “foreseeable future,” days after collapsing onstage at All Things Go in New York City.


	“I'm going away for a while. It pains me to say I have to cancel everything for the foreseeable future,” Young wrote. “Thank you for all the love and support. I'm sorry to let anyone down who has bought a ticket to see me, it hurts me more than you know.”


	 Young was set to go on a North American tour celebrating her new album I'm Only F**cking Myself starting in November. Those shows will now be canceled. In her post, she promised fans would receive a full refund.


	“I really hope you'll give me a second chance once I've had some time to work on myself and come back stronger,” Young wrote in her post before signing off: “Love you all, Lola x.”

	Over the weekend, Young seemed to faint onstage while performing at All Things Go in New York City. She later canceled her appearance at the Maryland-hosted edition of the music festival, as she received support from other artists on the bill.

	











	Before the medical incident, Young spoke onstage about how she “had a tricky couple of days,” saying, “Sometimes life can really make you feel like you can't continue, but you know what, today I woke up and I made the decision to come here, and I wanted to be cool … and sometimes life can throw you lemons, and you just gotta make lemonade.”

	











	A day prior, Young's manager announced that he'd decided to pull her from Audacy's We Can Survive concert in New Jersey as a “protective measure to keep her safe,” citing the singer's mental health.

	Under Tuesday's post announcing her decision to step away, Young received love from many fans and artists alike. “We aren't going anywhere. You are so loved!” singer Hayley Kiyoko wrote. “Take care of you, all of this will still be here when you get back,” wrote Lukalu. “You are so special, I know we don't know each other, but just take all of the time u need,” said Lauv. “Sending love,” wrote Tinashe.


	Young has described her mental health struggles in the past. “It's very important that I've been open about it because it's given the leeway for other people to be open about it and the drive for other people to reach out and say how much it has helped them,” she told Rolling Stone, citing occasional episodes that have taken place in front of collaborators, and how writing through them has resulted in some of her most raw work to date.

The actress slammed the show runner for not remaining "silent" in the face of anti-trans attacks rising.

	Actress Indya Moore, like many trans people in the U.S., is calling on people in power to stand up for her community's rights. One of the powerful people she's calling out by name is none other than her former boss, Ryan Murphy.


	In an emotional video posted to her Instagram on Sunday (Sept. 28), Moore — who gained international acclaim for her portrayal of Angel Evangelista in FX's Pose — criticized Murphy for failing to stand up for the trans community in the years since the Emmy Award-winning series ended in 2021.

	











	The actress offered her thanks to Murphy and others who “have ever given us jobs” and “allowed us to be able to speak out,” before slamming Murphy for not using his platform to speak up about the ongoing attacks against the trans community by the U.S. government. “The fact that Ryan Murphy has been this silent … like, we really pissed you off that much, Ryan? Who upset you that much, Janet [Mock, writer, director and producer on Pose] really pissed you off that much?”




	Moore continued, saying that she has been “reprimanded” before for speaking up about “mistreatment” she dealt with on the set of Pose, including her claim that producer Tanase Popa threw potato chips at her on set. She then turned her attention back to Murphy, asking how the influential showrunner could “do something like Pose during Donald Trump's [2016-2020] administration, and then it's like poof, you're gone.”


	“It's garbage. It's, like, an embarrassment,” she said. “Ryan Murphy, we need you to do more. You need to address the racism, the violence, and the targeting of people on your productions … you do need to make sure trans people are paid equally.” 


Billboard has reached out to Murphy's representatives for comment.


	Moore's statements about Murphy came amid a 30-minute video, in which the actress emotionally reacted to the Trump administration's targeting of the trans community since the president took office again in January. In the nine months of the twice-impeached president's second term thus far, Trump has taken multiple opportunities to discriminate against trans people, including limiting resources for transgender healthcare, eliminating federal recognition of transgender identities, banning trans people from serving in the military and ceasing funding for the national suicide hotline dedicated to helping queer and trans people.


	In her tearful video, Moore questioned the competing narratives being used by the president and his supporters. “How do you go from ‘trans people are mentally ill, they need help' to ‘trans people are terrorists?' Y'all can't make up your mind about how you want to view us, as weak and a target to bully, or as strong and a threat,” she said. 

	











	Moore thanked those who have stood up for trans people's rights and safety, and urged those watching to keep doing so in the caption of her video, where she also tagged Murphy. “Trans People Need you. We have been copping [sic] for too long,” she wrote. “Lift us up along side everyone else.”

He created artwork for ‘A Fistful of Dollars,' ‘Conan the Barbarian' and more, then made a comeback with ‘Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.'

	Renato Casaro, the Italian designer of movie posters renowned for the hand-crafted art he created for films including A Fistful of Dollars, Conan the Barbarian and the Rambo features, has died. He was 89.


	Casaro died Monday night in a hospital in his native Treviso, Italy, after being admitted days earlier with bronchopneumonia, the Italian news service RAI reported.




	Casaro helped put bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger on the map in Hollywood with his poster for the Dino De Laurentiis-produced Conan the Barbarian (1982), and he also designed posters for the actor's Red Sonja (1985), The Running Man (1987), Total Recall (1990), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and True Lies (1994).

	“Schwarzenegger was the perfect man to paint,” he told The Guardian in 2022. “He had a tough expression. His face was like a sculpture. It was a real pleasure for me — I have always had a weakness for heroes.”


	Sylvester Stallone, another heroic figure in Hollywood, said Casaro “captured his soul” with posters for his films, which included the Rambo features of 1982, 1985 and 1988, plus Over the Top (1987), Lock Up (1989) and Cliffhanger (1993).


	Casaro created posters for lots of spaghetti Westerns early in his career, and one for Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964), starring Clint Eastwood, helped that movie become a worldwide sensation. He then reunited with the Italian filmmaker for My Name Is Nobody (1973) and Once Upon a Time in America (1984).

	











	Casaro said the key to a successful poster is to “capture the essential: that moment, that glance, that attitude, that movement that says everything and condenses the entire story. That's the hard part,” he told The New York Times in 2021. “You can't cheat. You can't promise something that isn't there.”


	Born on Oct. 26, 1935, Casaro became fascinated with billboards as a kid and tried to reproduce paintings by such artists as American Norman Rockwell and countryman Angelo Cesselon. When he was a teenager, he drew posters on the walls of the local Garibaldi Cinema in exchange for tickets.


	Casaro landed a job as an apprentice lithographer at the Zoppelli printing house and worked for a year as an illustrator for the film ad agency Studio Favalli in Rome before opening his own studio at age 21.


	Among his first professional movie posters were for the rerelease of Allan Dwan's Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) and for the 1955 Italian films Romeo & Juliet and Zwei blaue Augen. With the rise of the spaghetti Western, he was drawing about a 100 posters a year.


	In 1965, Casaro burst onto the international scene with his poster for John Huston's epic The Bible in the Beginning … (1966), which ignited a long collaboration with De Laurentiis.


	“It was a colossal film,” he told CBS News in a 2022 interview. “My posters were put on billboards on Sunset Boulevard. After that, my phone never stopped ringing.”

	











	One of his favorite pieces was one for Luc Besson's La Femme Nikita (1990), and he also worked with Bernardo Bertolucci on The Last Emperor (1987) and The Sheltering Sky (1990), with David Lynch on Dune (1984) and Wild at Heart (1990) and with Rob Reiner on The Princess Bride (1987) and Misery (1990).


	His résumé also included artwork for Flash Gordon (1980), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), Blow Out (1981), Octopussy (1983), The NeverEnding Story (1984), Angel Heart (1987), The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Wild Orchid (1989) and Dances With Wolves (1990).


	After a long period in Spain and Germany, he returned to live and work in his hometown about a decade ago. A documentary about his life, The Last Movie Painter, was released in 2020.


	Casaro stopped designing posters in 1998 when studios turned away from hand-drawn artwork to use Photoshop and other digital tools. But then Quentin Tarantino called out of nowhere, looking for posters for a vintage spaghetti Western starring Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) for Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood (2019).


	Tarantino later sent him a signed photo of DiCaprio with one of the posters. “Thanks so much for your art gracing my picture,” he said in an accompanying message. “You've always been my favorite.”

LaKeith Stanfield, Rosa Salazar, Keegan-Michael Key and Tony Shalhoub also star in Amazon Prime's action-thriller based on Donald E. Westlake's ‘Parker' novels.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	There are several questions you might ask yourself while watching Play Dirty: Why is it that streaming services continue to assemble name casts and throw tens of millions at projects that are synthetic versions of movies we've seen too many times to count? Why do those movies always look so flat? Why does Amazon Prime's blustery action-thriller feel like something director and co-writer Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Nice Guys) fished out of a bottom drawer where it had been gathering dust for decades, when work on the project reportedly only began in 2022? And perhaps the most puzzling question — why is Mark Wahlberg a movie star?

	Published under the pseudonym of Richard Stark, Donald E. Westlake's series of 24 hard-boiled novels about the tough-guy career criminal known only as Parker has proved a hard nut to crack in screen adaptations. The most enduring of them is John Boorman's first stab in 1967, casting Lee Marvin in Point Blank. (For contractual reasons, Parker was renamed Walker.) Others who have stepped into the master thief's shoes on screen include Robert Duvall, Jim Brown, Peter Coyote, Mel Gibson and Jason Statham.

The Bottom Line

	
	Play dead.
	



Release date: Wednesday, Oct. 1Cast: Mark Wahlberg, LaKeith Stanfield, Rosa Salazar, Keegan-Michael Key, Chukwudi Iwuji, Nat Wolff, Thomas Jane, Tony Shalhoub, Claire Lovering, Chai HansenDirector: Shane BlackScreenwriters: Shane Black, Charles Mondry, Anthony Bagarozzi, based on the Parker book series by Richard Stark

									Rated R,
								2 hours 5 minutes			






	If you know going in that executive producer Robert Downey Jr. was originally attached when Play Dirty was first set up as a Joel Silver production, it's impossible not to imagine Black's customarily snappy dialogue delivered in the Iron Man actor's smart-ass deadpan. But as in most of his roles since The Departed and The Fighter, Wahlberg shows little charisma, particularly when he's flanked by an actor with the irreverent verve of LaKeith Stanfield, who steals every scene without even breaking a sweat.

	











	That's not to say Wahlberg is the movie's sole shortcoming. Not by a long shot. Scripted by Black, Charles Mondry and Anthony Bagarozzi, the film is an original story drawing on characters and events from the crime novel franchise, rather than one particular book. For almost the entire bloated two-hour run time, Black keeps his foot on the accelerator in the hope that audiences won't notice the haphazard, barely logical plotting.


	It starts with Parker and his crew carrying out what looks to be a standard holdup with wisecracks, making their exit with sacks of cash when an employee (Byron Coll) arrives on the scene with his family, figures out what's going down and tells his startled wife: “This is perfect! I'm going to rob the robbers!”


	Parker doesn't take kindly to the interference, pursuing the culprit on foot and crashing through a horse-racing track, where chaos, wreckage and death ensue before he retrieves the loot. Black and his co-writers soften the cold mercenary side of Parker by giving him something of a moral compass, which prompts him to toss $10,000 to the stranger's wife before fleeing the scene.


	But the unexpected interloper turns out not to be the last of the heist's hiccups when new team recruit Zen (Rosa Salazar) plugs Parker's crew full of bullet holes and makes off with the rest of the cash. One of the slain robbers is Parker's longtime accomplice Philly Webb (Thomas Jane), whose widow, Grace (Gretchen Mol), only half buys it when Parker promises to get her Philly's share and ice his killer.

	











	Already it's clear that the film is right in Black's wheelhouse of switcheroos, double-crosses, fake-outs, swaggering attitude and fumbled moves that somehow turn out to be successful. The director plays up the humor a lot more than Westlake's callously cynical prose, for better or worse. 


	Parker tracks down Zen, who's revealed to be a highly trained soldier from the elite guard of a Latin American country, now operating as a freedom fighter to thwart the corrupt plans of dictator Ignazio De La Paz (Alejandro Edda). The archeological find of a sunken Spanish galleon with a jewel-encrusted carved figurehead known as the Lady of Arintero could erase the country's national debt and wipe out poverty. But De La Paz plans to steal the treasure while it's on display at the U.N. and sell it for a fortune to Brit billionaire Phineas Paul (Chukwudi Iwuju). The latter character ushers in a stiff but amusing Mark Cuban cameo.


	Salazar gets some cool scenes that show the character's prowess as a daredevil driver, a kickass fighter and an ace shooter. But if she had said “my country” one more time I would have lost it and screamed, “Name it, FFS!”


	After gaining Zen's trust — or pretending to — Parker assembles a new crew to rob the robbers. (It's a motif!) That means outsmarting not only De La Paz's goon squad but going up against “The Outfit,” the New York mob headed by Lozini (Tony Shalhoub), who bristles when he hears Parker's name. The two criminals have a history that resulted in an agreement under which Parker would stay out of New York City and Lozini would let him live.

	











	Parker's first call is to Alan Grofield (Stanfield), who uses his criminal gains to finance his true love — Illinois regional experimental theater. That anomaly yields a joke or two about Grofield using his acting skills to get into character on the job, but it's insufficiently developed to add much. Never mind though, Stanfield brings so much playfulness, wit and slouchy-chic sartorial style to the role that I kept wishing this was a Grofield movie, not a Parker movie.


	Other recruits include seasoned art thieves Ed and Brenda Mackey (Keegan-Michael Key and Claire Lovering), whose bantering provides comic relief; and flaky getaway driver Stan (Chai Hansen), who at one point busts out some undulating hip-hop dance moves to Boney M., just because.


	By emphasizing the caper aspect and the goofy comedy of all this over the intricate plotting that is a hallmark of Westlake's novels, Black lowers the stakes of a heist that involves halting a speeding NY subway refuse train and busting into a supposedly impenetrable Brooklyn vault. Instead, the generic ‘90s throwback action movie plays like a string of car-crash pileups and urban destruction with little of interest in terms of the human element.


	There's a half-baked attempt to throw Lozini into crisis mode over his organization becoming so corporate that they forgot how to be efficient criminals, but even an actor with Shalhoub's gifts can't do much with that. The chief contribution of the Outfit thread is Nat Wolff as a bumbling underworld counterpart to Stan, who laughs off Lozini's withering disdain but has less luck escaping Parker's mayhem unscratched.

	











	Despite having skilled hands like composer Alan Silvestri, cinematographer Philippe Rousselot and production designer Owen Paterson on board, Play Dirty has way more noise than energy or style and is never half as much fun as the filmmakers seem to think.


	It's nominally a holiday movie given that it ends with Parker and Grofield strolling through the New Year's Eve debris of Times Square — or whatever combination of physical sets and CG the production team cooked up on the Australian shoot. But that just prompts another question — “Wait, this was a buddy comedy?”

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Mads Mikkelsen (Doctor Strange) and Diane Kruger (Inglorious Basterds) have been set to star in Ami, a sci-fi survival thriller, which is currently in production in Spain.


	Directed by Fernando Szurman and written by John Wesley Norton and Ezequiel Martinez Jr., the film centers on an astronaut (Mads Mikkelsen) who crash-lands on an uncharted planet after a catastrophic accident, with only his Quantum AI companion Ami (Diane Kruger) left to aid in his escape. “As he navigates an alien landscape and a battle for survival, he is forced to confront the fragility of memory, the isolation of space, and the resilience of the human spirit,” reads the synopsis.

	The project is produced by Fishcorb, Capstone Studios, and Conch Republic Films, with Andres Sanchez executive-producing. Capstone Global is handling worldwide sales and will be discussing the project with buyers ahead of next month's American Film Market in LA.

	“Ami is exactly the kind of daring, character-driven genre film that reflects Capstone's commitment to globally resonant storytelling,” said Fall and Trap House producer Christian Mercuri, CEO of Capstone. “It's a rare combination of emotional intimacy and cinematic scale, brought to life by a world-class creative team. With Fernando's distinctive vision and a cast of extraordinary talent, this project exemplifies the elevated, high-concept filmmaking we champion.”

	











	“What excited me about Ami was the opportunity to tell a profoundly human story through a genre that allows for both scope and intimacy,” added first-time feature filmmaker Szurman, a first AD on movies including Borrego and The Mortimers. “I want to push the boundaries of sci-fi storytelling while grounding it in emotional truth. We're not just making a survival film; we're inviting audiences into a deeply personal space odyssey.”


	BAFTA nominee Mikkelsen is well known for movies including Oscar winner Another Round (2020), The Hunt (2013), Casino Royale (2006), Doctor Strange(2016), and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022). 


	Cannes Best actress winner Kruger will next be seen in HBO's drama series The Seduction, a modern reimagining of Dangerous Liaisons, and recently starred in Little Disasters, which debuted on Paramount+ in the UK and Ireland in May 2025 and will premiere in the U.S. later this year.


	Mikkelsen is repped by UTA and Art Management. Kruger is repped by CAA, Untitled Entertainment, UBBA, and Peikoff Mahan Law Office.

Refreshing. A real actress playing an AI CHARACTER.

Her role should have gone to Tilly Norwood !
Wonder why her new agents were not on this from the beginning. Maybe time to already switch agencies in true Hollywood fashion for Tilly.

SAG-AFTRA has released a statement September 30 roundly condemning artificial intelligence talent studio Xicoia's shopping of an AI actor named Tilly Norwood to the industry.

News broke from Deadline at the Zurich Summit on September 27 that Hollywood talent agents have been quietly circling Norwood for representation. For the past five months, Xicoia, launched by Dutch technologist Emily Van der Velden as part of her company Particle 6 Productions, has been soft-launching Norwood on Instagram. 

The studio has been posting headshots, candids, and even motion graphics of the AI performer, who takes the form of a dewy teenage girl who is supposed to live in London. Just in the past week, Xicoia has posted hypothetical, AI-generated screenshots of Norwood in a kind of digital portfolio showing the different film projects she could appear in: There's one of her in a dimly-lit thriller scenario, one of her on a subway (do AI characters need public transportation?), and one of her in a warm, candle-lit period romance setting where she appears to be having an emotional heart-to-heart with an object of her affection, her furrowed brow conveying anguish.

Needless to say, SAG-AFTRA sees this as an existential threat.

 










“SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered. The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics,” the statement from the union began.

“To be clear,” the statement continued, “‘Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers — without permission or compensation. It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn't solve any ‘problem' — it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.”

“Additionally, signatory producers should be aware that they may not use synthetic performers without complying with our contractual obligations, which require notice and bargaining whenever a synthetic performer is going to be used.”

Since the Deadline report, the existence of Norwood has rankled many in Hollywood, including Melissa Barrera, who posted on Instagram, “Hope all actors repped by the agent that does this, drop their a$$. How gross, read the room.”

Actor and model Michael Aurelio tweeted, “Pretty telling that the industries first venture into this was to create a teenage girl they could control.”

 










For her part, Van der Velden responded to the growing backlash by writing on Instagram, “To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work — a piece of art. Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.”

“I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool, a new paintbrush. Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories. I'm an actor myself, and nothing — certainly not an AI character — can take away the craft or joy of human performance.”

While Hollywood is still reeling over Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's split, their closest friends aren't surprised.A source told PEOPLE that Urban's inner circle saw the breakup coming from a mile away, noting there had been telling signs for quite some time.The outlet reported that it “really hasn't been a secret” that the “American Idol” judge and the actress have “been living separately for a while now.”“People close to Keith felt like the split was kind of inevitable,” the source added.

After nearly 20 years of marriage, Kidman and Urban parted ways for good. TMZ was first to break the news of the couple's breakup, citing sources who claimed they have been living apart since the beginning of summer.

The outlet added that the “Babygirl” actress has been “holding the family together through this difficult time.” The source further claimed that the split was one-sided, as Kidman was against the separation and had been trying to work things out.

Keith is said to have moved out of their family home and is staying in his own residence in Nashville. It remains unclear if the ex-couple will get a divorce.

Meanwhile, a source told PEOPLE that Kidman's sister, Antonia, “has been a rock” amid the split.

“The entire Kidman family has come together to support one another,” the insider added. “She didn't want this. She has been fighting to save the marriage.”

Fans were quick to react to Kidman and Urban's shocking split. While many expressed sadness, others couldn't resist pointing fingers.

One saddened fan wrote, “Is there absolutely no chance to repair whatever damage has been done? This news is so so sad & heartbreaking! They seem to be a great couple/family.”

Another chimed in, “I did not see this coming. Always terribly sad when marriages, especially long ones, fall apart.”

Someone added, “This is so heartbreaking to hear. I thought sure Nicole had found true love and happiness with Keith.”

Another commented, “So sad to hear of their split. I thought they were such a beautiful couple. They truly seemed to be in love.”

The two were last seen in public together in June at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup match. They've also just celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary on June 25.

Kidman and Urban wed in 2006 and have two daughters together: Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 14.

Sylvan Esso are back with a new song, “WDID,” and with it, news of their departure from Spotify. Amelia Meath and Nick Sanborn are releasing the single on their own label, Psychic Hotline, and have vowed to cut ties with “a store that, in addition to all its other glaring flaws, directly funds war machines,” as they put it in a statement. Listen to “WDID” below.

The duo's exit from Spotify is the latest in a string of departures set off, in June, by Deerhoof, in a move backed by their label Joyful Noise. Those to follow suit have included Hotline TNT, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and—if their intended removal goes ahead—Massive Attack. Those artists have primarily cited Spotify founder Daniel Ek's investment, through his Prima Materia venture capital firm, in the weapons contractor Helsing. In an apparently unrelated move, the streaming giant announced today that Ek would transition from the role of chief executive officer to executive chair.

Meath and Sanborn said in their statement:

As we prepare to release new music, we have to decide what we want to be a part of and what we don't. To that end, with Sylvan Esso being on our own label for the first time, we have decided to remove our music from Spotify. While no solution is perfect, we simply can't continue to put our life's work in a store that, in addition to all its other glaring flaws, directly funds war machines.

reaching towards the world we all deserve, even though we are not in it yet

Sylvan Esso released their last album, No Rules Sandy, in 2022 via Loma Vista. Psychic Hotline will release “WDID” on 12" vinyl on January 9, backed by the B-side “Keep On.”

Watching Bi Gan‘s “Resurrection” is like being trapped in a dream machine that, in one room, plays “Twin Peaks: The Return” Episode 3 on a loop, and in the other plays a marathon of the entire history of cinema — from silent movies to postmodern vampire thrillers. And that's very much a good thing.

IndieWire exclusively announces Janus Films' December 12 U.S. release date for the latest film from the Chinese director of 2018's “Long Day's Journey Into Night.” That movie culminated in a long take that required you to put on your 3D glasses. “Resurrection,” which stars Shu Qi as the woman who, in a far-off future, enters the consciousness of the only remaining creature who can dream, also boasts a oner for the ages, as a raincoat mafia descends on a vampire rave. The phrase “bravura sequence” gets tossed around in our parts a lot, but “Resurrection” offers a truly special one.

IndieWire also shares the exclusive teaser for the film below ahead of its New York Film Festival premiere on Sunday, October 5. Watch below.

 










Here's the official synopsis for the film, a summary that still only scratches the surface of this, a film David Lynch would be proud of: “Unfolding over five chapters that feature a dazzling array of styles, ‘Resurrection' is a cascade of imagery united by a luminous mythopoetic conceit: in a sci-fi-coded world where people have lost the desire to dream in the hopes of prolonging life, rogue ‘fantasmers' continue to stoke their imaginations and exist within unreality. From this magical premise, the film sends its ever-morphing protagonist (Jackson Yee) through a series of genres, from Méliès-inflected silent fantasy to wartime thriller to con-artist buddy picture to millennial vampire romance — the latter depicted in one of Bi's customary, and ever astonishing, single takes. Even within genre parameters, the director never takes the road well-traveled, offering jolts and marvels around every corner. Resurrection is one of the most audacious and ambitious gifts for cinematic thrill-seekers in many a moon.”

EXCLUSIVE: Vertical has acquired U.S. rights to first-time feature filmmaker Sophie Tabet's action-thriller Stone Cold Fox, starring Kiernan Shipka (Twisters), Kiefer Sutherland (24), Krysten Ritter (Jessica Jones), Mishel Prada (Brilliant Minds), and Karen Fukuhara (The Boys).


	In the '80s-set revenge story, Fox (Shipka) breaks out of an abusive commune in search of her family. But when the queenpin (Ritter) kidnaps her little sister and sends a crooked cop (Sutherland) after her, Fox has no choice but to infiltrate the very place she escaped. Release is slated for later this year.

The star-studded lineup of Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Comedy Festival is still catching heat from peers back in the U.S. After drawing criticism from the likes of Marc Maron and Atsuko Okatsuka, David Cross joined the fray, posting on his website that he was “disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing.” He noted that he “was not offered the gig but it should go without saying that there's not enough money for me to help these depraved, awful people put a ‘fun face' on their crimes against humanity.”

Cross lamented that the lineup includes “some of my HEROES!” He wrote, “Now look, some of you folks don't stand for anything so you don't have any credibility to lose, but my god, Dave [Chappelle] and Louie [C.K.] and Bill [Burr], and Jim [Jeffries]? Clearly you guys don't give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again? All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture' and ‘freedom of speech' and all that shit? Done. You don't get to talk about it ever again. By now we've all seen the contract you had to sign.” 

Okatsuka previously posted the Riyadh contract from her own offer for the festival, which included a long list of “censorship rules” forbidding jokes that criticize Saudi Arabia or its royal family. Tim Dillon was dropped from the festival for joking about the country's “slaves” ahead of the event, but he said he'd been offered $375,000 for one performance and other comedians were offered as much as $1.6 million (via NPR). Pete Davidson, who has caught particular heat due to the Saudi regime's connection to the 9/11 terrorist attack that killed his father, said he was unbothered by the criticism and conspiracies kicked up by the festival. “I get the routing, and I see the number, and I go, ‘I'll go,'” he said during an appearance on Theo Von's podcast.

“I don't understand how being rich can make someone such a whore,” Cross wrote in his post. “Poor people desperate to improve their (or their families lives), sure. Still not acceptable but I can understand the desperation to put food on the table. But this? I mean, it's not like this is some commercial for a wireless service or a betting app. This is truly the definition of ‘blood money'. You might as well do commercials for Lockheed Martin or Zyklon B. Holy shit, I remember the backlash I got for appearing in Alvin and the Chipmunks! You would've thought that I had taken money from a bunch of people responsible for funding Al Qaeda!”

In a press release, Human Rights Watch stated that the Riyadh Comedy Festival was an attempt by Saudi Arabia “to deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations.” The org stated that “to avoid contributing to laundering the Saudi government's reputation,” participating comics “should use the comedy festival to publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.” HRW reached out “to the representatives and management of a group of announced participating comedians to request a meeting about Saudi Arabia's human rights crisis,” but didn't hear back. 

Similarly, Cross concluded his post with a call for readers to donate to the Human Rights Foundation and a message to the comedians participating in the Riyadh Comedy Festival. He wrote, “Unless you open your sets with, ‘This is dedicated to all of the widows and widowers and kids orphaned by this bloodthirsty oppressive regime especially from the zany shenanigans on 9/11. Never Forget Motherfuckers! Alright, so it's great to be here. I'm gonna be killing it tonight! But in the good way! Straight up. No MbS.' then your hypocrisy will never not be noted.”

EXCLUSIVE: Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman produced Civil War epic The Gray House has landed with Prime Video in the U.S. The streamer has snapped up the limited series, which is about a network of female spies who help turn the tide of the war. It will stream on Prime in early 2026.


The Gray House cast includes Mary-Louise Parker (The West Wing), Daisy Head (Harlots), Amethyst Davis (Kindred) and Ben Vereen (Roots). Roland Joffe directed the eight-part drama.


	The drama focuses on the true story of a group of unsung women, a Virginia socialite, her mother, a formerly enslaved sister-in-arms, and the city's most notorious courtesan. They operate deep inside the corridors of Confederate power and transform an underground railroad into an effective underground spy network, risking life and liberty.

	The series comes from Paramount label Republic Pictures, which produces with Costner's Territory Pictures, Freeman's Revelations Entertainment and Leslie Greif's Big Dreams Entertainment.


	Greif, the man behind hit miniseries Hatfields & McCoys, wrote The Gray House with Darrell Fetty and John Sayles. He is also an EP alongside Freeman and his Revelations business partner Lori McCreary, Costner, Rod Lake and Howard Kaplan.

	











Paramount Global Content Distribution handles sales on The Gray House and cut the Prime Video deal.


	The series will have a big-ticket soundtrack. Greif told Deadline last year that the show will feature an original song performed by Willie Nelson as well as numbers from Shania Twain, Killer Mike and Yolanda Adams among others. Jon Bon Jovi also co-wrote one of the songs on the soundtrack.

NY & Broadway Editor


Schmigadoon!, a new musical based on the popular Apple Original series from Universal Television, will head to Broadway for a limited engagement this spring after a successful run at The Kennedy Center. Produced by Lorne Michaels and No Guarantees Productions, the musical will begin previews at the Nederlander Theatre on Saturday, April 4 with an opening night set for Monday, April 20 and will run through Sunday, September 6.


	“Schmigadoon is a love letter to the Golden Age of movie musicals,” said producer Michaels. “It's a little bit nostalgic and a lot of fun. We're very excited to bring it to Broadway.”

	The synopsis: New York doctors Josh and Melissa set out on a couples' backpacking retreat to rekindle the flame, but instead find themselves in Schmigadoon, a magical town that's a Golden Age musical come to life. The townspeople won't stop singing, the bridge out leads nowhere, and the only way to escape is by finding true love—which may or may not be with each other.

	Tickets for the new musical will go on sale to the public at 10:00 AM ET on Tuesday, October 15. Presale information can be found here.

Schmigadoon! is produced by Lorne Michaels, Micah Frank, and Caroline Maroney on behalf of Broadway Video and Christine Schwarzman and Megan O'Keefe on behalf of No Guarantees Productions.

							By 

	Tim Dickinson



	Few Americans have as comprehensive of a perspective on politics and media as Jen Psaki, the former White House press secretary under Joe Biden who is now the host of the The Briefing with Jen Psaki on MSNBC, as well as The Blueprint, a podcast focused on the rebuild of the Democratic party.


Rolling Stone spoke to Psaki the day after a rambling, bitter President Donald Trump aired his grievances on the international stage at the United Nations General Assembly. Shortly after Trump's speech, Jimmy Kimmel added to the president's umbrage by staging a cathartic return to ABC, after a corporate suspension that was shortened by public blowback to Trump's attempts to curb free expression.


	In a wide-ranging discussion, Psaki laid out her thoughts on Karoline Leavitt, the ringmaster of Trump's circus-like White House briefing room; on Kamala Harris and her controversial new memoir; and on why national Democrats need to stop ducking fights and start punching back at bullies. (Metaphorically, of course.)

	











	Psaki and her primetime colleagues — including Chris Hayes and Rachel Maddow — will be hosting a live event for superfans of the cable channel, called “MSNBC Live '25,” in Manhattan on Oct. 11. As part of that event, Psaki will also record the opening episode of her podcast's second season, to debut Oct. 15. This celebration is also something of a sendoff, as MSNBC prepares to spin out from its corporate parent NBC/Universal (a subsidiary of Comcast) and rebrand as the standalone MS NOW in the new year.

	











The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.


Kimmel returned to the air last night. What are we learning about Trump's ambition to control the media — and the power of consumer revolt to push back on that?


	Trump is willing to use any lever of power to suppress opposition or criticism of him. And there are past models of this — the suppression of speech, suppression of comedians, suppression of entertainment — being a glide path to suppressing critics [generally]. We've seen a willingness to do that, and to do it out in the open — including Donald Trump's Truth Social post last night before Kimmel even spoke, with a threat about going back at ABC for more money. [Earlier this year, ABC settled a contrived defamation suit filed by Trump for $15 million.]

	What we're learning at the same time is what John Oliver said on his show: When you give the bully your lunch money, it just makes him hungrier; he comes back for more. Giving in to an aspiring dictator does not make him stop. 


	Jimmy Kimmel was put back on the air thanks to a great deal of activism and a surprising group of people, including [Republican Senators] Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and others, who spoke out against the suppression of freedom of speech. Obviously, the decision was ABC and Disney's to put Kimmel back on the air — it was not Trump deciding that. It was their response to a calculation of outside pressures. It is telling about the power of the public, and the fact that, although the president sits behind that desk, he is not all powerful. 


We're seeing an increasing body of evidence that standing up to Trump can be the strongest tactic. When Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker stood his ground, Trump didn't invade Chicago with the force that was threatened. 


	Trump is a man who has an incredibly fragile ego and thin skin. Look at the incident with the escalator at the United Nations General Assembly — where the escalator broke as he and the First Lady were stepping on. He spoke about it three or four times in his UNGA speech in front of world leaders, because he felt like it was a diss to him, as if somebody had broken the escalator [on purpose]. And then his press secretary said people should be investigated.

	That shows his fragility. And this is true of strongmen, generally, because they don't have the majority of public support. That means standing up to them — as Pritzker has done as [California Governor] Gavin Newsom has done, as [Maryland] Governor Wes Moore has done, as people across the country have done in these massive protests — is incredibly powerful.

	











This episode has underscored the danger of gigantism in media. These huge corporations all have interests before the FCC, and they want to grease the skids. In that context, I want to ask you about MSNOW's spinoff from Comcast. Do you see a path to perhaps greater freedom for you and your colleagues?


	I've been at MSNBC for just over three years now, and I've never been told what I can and cannot say. Nor have I ever been told I can't do a story. I feel very fortunate in that regard. That being said, I'm excited about the spin off. Rachel [Maddow] said this, and it stuck with me: In just a few weeks from now NBC will be our competitor. And I have every confidence that the kind of reporting and journalism and analysis [at MSNOW] is going to be different, but we're going to be standing very much on our own two feet.


From your perspective as a former presidential spokesperson, what do you make of Karoline Leavitt and the Trump White House media setup — particularly adding these strange bloggers and streamer suckups to the mix?


	They're reshaping who's in the White House briefing room — and slowly, but surely, turning it into a version of state-run media actors. There are still hard-hitting, excellent journalists who are in that room. They don't get questions every day, and they're splitting a growing amount of time with people who are raising their hands and asking about Donald Trump's fitness routine — or giving sycophantic speeches before they ask their version of a question.


There's no real choice for the true professionals not to participate, but their presence in the room in the end validates some of what's happening.  


	The room is made up of some of the best journalists from the best news organizations in the country, even the world. That room has always been a place where there is a healthy disagreement and healthy argument between the press secretary and the people in the room. But that is [increasingly] missing. And the challenge is, it's hard to explain that to the public.


You have a recurring segment on your show where you play clips of questions asked in the briefing room, and intercept them to give your own answer. Do you miss dunking on Steve Doocy that much, or what is the angle there?


	First of all, I love that job, the challenge and the privilege of that job, because it forces you to be as good as you can be on your feet. But in this moment, where there is such tremendous disinformation being pushed out from the briefing room, our audience is looking for an accurate depiction of what's happening. This came about because we were watching clips of the briefing one day and I'm talking back at the TV, like, What are you even talking about? That's not what happened. Here's what actually happened. And we decided: Why don't we just do this to give a counter, and a more accurate version?

	











You brought up Trump's performance at the United Nations. He turned that speech into a cross between Festivus — the airing of grievances — and a campaign speech. What do you take away from his decision to present the United States that way on the foremost international stage?


	I've been to a lot of UNGAs. And it reminded me of how the world viewed people like [former Libyan strongman] Muammar Gaddafi back in the day — who would give a rambling, nonsensical speech that had no clear driving narrative, that had a lot of factual errors, and people would chuckle about in the background. Now, Trump is not Gaddafi. But it made me think: World leaders are watching the president of the United States and thinking, This can't possibly be serious. And thinking of what U.N. officials were texting about it…


The group chats must have been spectacular.


It's vital for the United States to be seen as a powerful leader and a powerful voice and a driver of the agenda. And that type of a speech, and the behavior surrounding it, doesn't help us. The question is, when Trump is no longer president, how do you build that back?


That speech underscored that we have two very different modes in our national politics. There was “No Drama Obama” and the buttoned-up Biden administration — with a presentation that communicates serious adults are in charge. The contrast to that is the MAGA mein, which is bumptious and coarse. Making it up as we go along. Tell everyone Tylenol is causing autism even though there's no evidence of that. You come from the poise-and-polish school of politics. But do Democrats need to embrace some of these coarser elements? A spirit of, “Fuck it, we'll do it live.” Or: They're going low. We're going to meet them down in the gutter.


	Democrats should definitely embrace “Fuck it, we'll do it live.” But I don't think that requires meeting them in the gutter. There needs to be a fearlessness by anybody who wants to be in any leadership role. That means punching the bully back. I don't mean physically, obviously. I mean calling out lies, disinformation, and bad behavior. And not to be out there keeping the powder dry for the next year or two.


	And it means speaking like a human. Don't worry about the polling or the talking points. How would you talk to your neighbor about it, or call out things that are not — as my mother, who grew up in Queens, would say — “on the level”?


With Kamala Harris' new memoir out, I've been thinking about this balance between rough edges and smooth polish across the trajectory of the 2024 campaign. She launched with “Kamala is brat” — the Charlie XCX vibe, a bit messy but authentic. And it seemed to have traction and energy. Tim Walz was out there calling MAGA folks “weird.” It was breaking through. And then as the campaign progressed, the campaign dialed back to a blander, more poll-tested polish, and a lot of that organic energy seemed to fizzle. 












	I was on the “Free Tim Walz” train. Walz propelled himself onto the ticket by being a down-to-earth accessible communicator. He was a person you could have a conversation with at the grocery store. And then you didn't see him again. He disappeared from sight.


I assume you've read the memoir?


	Yes. I have spent some time around the vice president. You see her humor and her directness and her feelings in the book — the frustration with being overlooked, of being underestimated. It's very personal. I don't think it was written through the prism of, I am a person who's writing this book to run for president again. I have no idea if she's going to run again.


How is it being received in the greater Biden world?


	People I have spoken with in Biden world feel that there are so many big issues that we're dealing with right now — threats to our freedoms, the threats to speech, the threats to democracy. A lot of people raised: Why write a backward-looking book? I hear that. I also think she has every right to write a book about a historic run for the presidency.


	It is interesting the way she talks about her calls with Trump, and how she almost felt charmed by him. As much as he eviscerated her publicly and through ads, she had to kind of catch herself and remind herself, he's a snake oil salesman.


	Another thing is the afterword. You always have to read the afterword. I'm a nerd, so this is my recommendation. She writes that she has lived her life in public service, and has always thought that you can make change from within. But she raises the question of whether that's still true. It's a fundamental question of our time, right? Are our institutions prepared for the moment we're in? I'd love to know what she means by that, what has made her change her thinking.


Your podcast is The Blueprint, which explores rebuilding the Democratic Party. You have been talking to potential future leaders. What's new for your second season, and who do you think has the juice to meet this moment?


	The first season was a bit of a therapy project. Like so many people, after the election, I was thinking, What the hell just happened? Our first season was a bit-backward looking. What should be done differently? This season is going to be much more forward looking, or that's our intention. 


	We're adding in Lis Smith, who has been a democratic consultant for a long time — worked with a lot of candidates, was one of Pete Buttigieg's big advisers. She's going to be a person I chat with about the moment we're in as a part of every show. Lis never holds back ever and will probably curse so many times on the podcast, I don't know if we're going to have to edit it. Or maybe we just do it. It's fine.

In a scathing open letter, Cross is the latest to criticize his fellow comedians for participating in the Riyadh Comedy Festival: "I am deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing. How can any of us take you seriously again?" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


David Cross has become the latest comedian to criticize his fellow comics for participating in Saudi Arabia‘s Riyadh Comedy Festival.


	Cross wrote a rather scathing open letter denouncing performers at the event, who are reportedly being paid top dollar while agreeing to a set of censorious guidelines regarding what they can and cannot joke about onstage.




	The festival is being billed as “the world's largest comedy festival” and includes more than 50 comedians — including Bill Burr, Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Jimmy Carr, Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings and Andrew Schulz.

	But the Arrested Development and Mr. Show star did not hold back in his assessment of the situation.

	“I am disgusted, and deeply disappointed in this whole gross thing,” wrote Cross on his website. “That people I admire, with unarguable talent, would condone this totalitarian fiefdom for … what, a fourth house? A boat? More sneakers?


	“We can never again take seriously anything these comedians complain about (unless it's complaining that we don't support enough torture and mass executions of journalists and LGBTQ peace activists here in the states, or that we don't terrorize enough Americans by flying planes into our buildings),” Cross continued. “I mean that's it; you have a funny bit about how you don't like Yankee Candles or airport lounges? Okay great, but you're cool with murder and/or the public caning of women who were raped, and by having the audacity to be raped, were guilty of ‘engaging in adultery'? Got any bits on that?”

	











	Cross added, “These are some of my HEROES! Now look, some of you folks don't stand for anything so you don't have any credibility to lose, but my god, Dave and Louie and Bill, and Jim? Clearly you guys don't give a shit about what the rest of us think, but how can any of us take any of you seriously ever again? All of your bitching about ‘cancel culture' and ‘freedom of speech' and all that shit? Done. You don't get to talk about it ever again. By now we've all seen the contract you had to sign. You're performing for literally, the most oppressive regime on earth … This is truly the definition of ‘blood money' … your hypocrisy will never not be noted.'”


	Comedian Atsuko Okatsuka — who turned down the festival's offer — posted the event's contract online, which includes this bit: “ARTIST shall not prepare or perform any material that may be considered to degrade, defame or bring into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, embarrassment, or ridicule: A) The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including its leadership, public figures, culture or people; B) The Saudi royal family, legal system, or government, and; C) Any religion, religious tradition, religious figure or religious practice.”


	Other comedians who have criticized the festival's performers include WTF podcaster Marc Maron, who said, “I mean, how do you even promote that? You know, like, ‘From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don't miss it!' I mean, the same guy that's gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone saw [journalist] Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a fucking suitcase. But don't let that stop the yucks, it's gonna be a good time!”

	











	Comic Shane Gillis also criticized the festival on his Secret Podcast after being offered “significant bag” to attend. “I took a principled stand. You don't 9/11 your friends.”


	Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York ruled that a lawsuit by the families of 9/11 victims could move forward against Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit accuses the kingdom of potential involvement in the 2001 terror attacks.


	Davidson's own firefighter father perished during 9/11, yet he is participating in the festival anyway. According to USA Today, during an appearance on Theo Von's podcast, Davidson explained that he was swayed by the paycheck. 


	“I've been getting a little bit of flak just because my dad died (in) 9/11,” Davidson said. “So they're like, ‘How could you possibly go there?' … I get the [flight] routing, and then I see the number, and I go, ‘I'll go.'”


	One comic, Tim Dillon, said he was fired from the comedy festival for his comments before it began last Friday for a previous joke he made about the country using forced labor (Dillon says his manager told him: “They heard what you said about them having slaves. They didn't like that.”) He also noted that his paycheck would've been $375,000 — which gives you some idea of how much far more famous headliner comedians are pulling down.

The latest top awards title to screen at the 63rd New York Film Festival is Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” starring George Clooney as an actor approaching the end of his tether. The Netflix film premiered last month at Venice, with co-stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern. The latest movie from the “Marriage Story” and “The Squid and the Whale” director opens in theaters from Netflix on November 14 before streaming December 5.

We caught up with Dern on the red carpet, talking about how David Lynch music collaborator Dean Hurley finally brought “Twin Peaks: The Return” to the big screen over the summer. New York City's Metrograph Theater was the first to show the full version of the series the way Lynch intended. “I think he would love it,” Dern told IndieWire of what she thinks the auteur would think of the feat.

“I think it's so profoundly cinematic,” she continued. “Filmmakers, including Noah, including so many who have movies here, have talked, obviously, about David being their muse, [as well as] David being so profoundly important and ‘The Return' being so important. To hear the specifics of why ‘The Return's' bravery shaped movies of the last four or five years for specific filmmakers has been so inspiring.” In the series, she played Diane Evans, longtime secretary and confidante of FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper.

 










Though the Oscar and Emmy winner couldn't say much about the upcoming confirmed Season 3 of “Big Little Lies,” she did tease that the cast is her “favorite people and one of my favorite characters ever, so I can't think of a better time.” 

We also briefly chatted with Clooney, who reflected on the work he's done with Baumbach. This is technically the second time they have worked together, as the director co-wrote “Fantastic Mr. Fox” with Wes Anderson, and Clooney played the title character. “First of all, he's a good writer,” he told IndieWire. “I didn't know how good. I've never been on a set with him when he was directing. The very first scene is a 12-page one and I thought, “Well, this is a really ambitious, tricky film he's trying to make.' I was very excited by the work he wanted to do.”

Clooney also recalled the story, which he's shared before, of auditioning for “Bram Stoker's Dracula” with Francis Ford Coppola. “I thought I was really good. Coppola called my agent and asked if I was drunk.”

In David Ehrlich's review of “Jay Kelly,” he writes that it “is a bubbly champagne drama that tries to wring a few tears from the unbearable lightness of being rich and famous, but the fact that it looks like a Lavazza commercial and bemoans the isolation of flying private is ultimately in service to a more relatable story about the trade-offs that all of us are forced to make in this life — the one-way roads we take on the long and circular journey towards becoming ourselves.”

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Filming has quietly wrapped in Wales, UK, on Gareth Evans‘ (The Raid franchise) under-the-radar new feature A Colt Is My Passport, the Amazon MGM Studios/Orion Pictures reimagining of Nikkatsu's 1960s Yakuza hitman thriller.


	We can reveal today that The Gorge and Gangs Of London star Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù will take on the lead role, with supporting casting including Oscar nominee Tim Roth (Pulp Fiction), Jack Reynor (Midsommar), Lucy Boynton (Bohemian Rhapsody), Victor Alli, (Bridgerton) Ewan Mitchell (The Last Kingdom), Burn Gorman (Beetlejuice Beetlejuice) and Noah Taylor (Edge Of Tomorrow).

	The update of Takashi Nomura's hardboiled noir will be set in 1978 Detroit and tell the story of Colt, a Vietnam veteran turned contract killer, who goes on the run after assassinating a gangland boss.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Written by Chris Webb, who was part of the stunt team on Evans' Havoc and The Apostle, the film is produced by Ed Talfan (Havoc) for Severn Screen and Evans for One More One Productions. The film has also received support from the Welsh Government via Creative Wales.


	Filming took place at Great Point Studios in Cardiff and at locations across South Wales. Executive producers on the film include Shinjiro Nishimura for Nikkatsu and C2's Dave Caplan.


	In-demand Dìrísù will next be seen in Akinola Davies Jr.'s My Father's Shadow, which received the Caméra d'Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival. He will lead Netflix's All the Sinners Bleed which he is currently lensing, while previous roles include Netflix's Black Rabbit, season 3 of AppleTV+'s Slow Horses, and Remi Weekes' His House, which earned him a BAFTA nomination.

	











	Evans, who is also an exec producer and writer on Dìrísù-starrer Gangs Of London, said: “From the moment I first saw Takashi Nomura's wildly influential A Colt Is My Passport, I fell in love with its bold fusion of genres. Merging film noir and spaghetti western tropes together in an irresistible way I knew immediately I wanted to take on the challenge of making this my next feature. More a reimagining than a remake, Chris Webb's remarkable, noir-drenched script has taken the original film's core themes and built upon them gifting the story's iconic characters more emotional weight while retaining its deep rooted genre influences.”


	He continued: “The incredible cast led by Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù, Jack Reynor, Lucy Boynton, Victor Alli, Burn Gorman and Tim Roth have been an absolute dream to work with. Their dedication towards realising the vision of the film has been nothing short of inspiring, making the last 12 weeks of production a deeply rewarding and reinvigorating experience. I am beyond grateful for the trust and faith Orion have shown in us and I am so excited to share this wildly ambitious film with audiences worldwide.”


	Evans is repped by Range Media Partners, Entertainment 360 and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Chris Webb is repped by Range Media Partners. Dìrísù is repped by Markham Froggatt & Irwin and WME.


	Jack Reynor is repped by WME and Range Media Partners. Tim Roth is repped by Markham Froggatt & Irwin. Lucy Boynton is repped by United Agents and CAA. Victor Alli is repped by Conway Van Gelder Grant. Noah Taylor is repped by Lou Coulson Associates. Ewan Mitchell is repped by Independent Talent Group and CAA. Burn Gorman is repped by B-Side, Verve and Entertainment 360.

Gangs of London was one of the biggest letdowns from script to screen.  Hoping this gets the train back on the track

Hopefully this time round there is no Playstation 2 quality car chases?

Big fan of Evans work, but man HAVOC was a disappointment on every level….especially when you know what Evans can do with a modest budgetr where did it aall go wrong

Please let this be a return to form

A film set in Detroit filmed in Wales with all UK actors. Cool cool.

If you're not already a fan of bestselling romance novelist Emily Henry, consider changing that — and fast — as many (read: nearly all) of the prolific author's books are soon slated to get big screen adaptations. First out of the gate? “People We Meet on Vacation,” which will hit Netflix early next year.

Per the film's official synopsis, it follows “the free-spirited Poppy and routine-loving Alex, who have been unlikely best friends for a decade, living in different cities but spending every summer vacation together. The careful balance of their friendship is put to the test when they begin to question what has been obvious to everyone else — could they actually be the perfect romantic match?” In the film, free-wheeling Poppy is played by “Lady Jane” breakout Emily Bader, with “Plainclothes” star Tom Blyth joining her as the uptight Alex.

Brett Haley directs this one, with a script by Yulin Kuang and Amos Vernon & Nunzio Randazzo. Kuang is also on board to write and direct an adaptation of Henry's “Beach Read.” Henry's blend of swoony love and spicy romance with compelling characters has rocketed her to the top of the bestseller lists, and fans are eager to see how that might translate to film success. Other Henry joints also bound for the screen? “Funny Story,” “Book Lovers,” and “Happy Place.” See! Prolific!

A crude, formulaic, and timelessly existential collection of paperback crime novels that were published under the pseudonym of Richard Stark, Donald E. Westlake's “Parker” franchise is the only series of books that has ever been adapted into Jean-Luc Godard and Jason Statham movies (“Made in USA” and “Parker,” respectively), both of which feel equally true to the ruthless concision of their source material. Ditto John Boorman's violently elliptical “Point Blank,” John Flynn's sociopathically affectless “The Outfit” (a Quentin Tarantino favorite), and Brian Helgeland's senselessly butchered “Payback.” 

 








Related Stories SAG-AFTRA Weighs in on AI Firestorm: ‘To Be Clear, “Tilly Norwood” Is Not an Actor' Bi Gan's ‘Resurrection,' One of the Year's Wildest Movies, Sets December Release and Teaser — Watch 

Needless to say, Westlake's hardboiled anti-hero is as durable as they come, his conscience blank enough to be the perfect canvas for anyone hoping to make a heist movie without a heart; anyone hoping to revel in the take what you can steal nihilism of a world where everyone is a criminal, and being a good thief is more righteous than being an easy target.

 










Shane Black is much too humane a storyteller to seize on the page-turning soullessness of the Stark books (“Lethal Weapon” might as well be “It's a Wonderful Life” when compared to the stony timbre of the “Parker” series), but few people in the history of modern Hollywood have better understood the Christmas spirit of cops and robbers who don't give a fuck about anything beyond the final score of whatever game they're playing. Few people have mined as much entertainment from the contrast between high stakes and low morals — from how the life-and-death concerns of a big heist or an elaborate conspiracy might ultimately just reinforce the sense that nothing matters, and nobody gets out alive. 

Black has turned the headshot into a one-liner, the one-liner into a shrug, and the shrug into a profound statement on why a character like Parker has resonated across more than a half-century of American crime. So while his seemingly inevitable take on the character is much sweeter and more fun than Westlake would have ever hoped to see, the signature humor that Black pumps into “Play Dirty” — the laughs he gets from blasting extras in the head, hurling goons off Manhattan rooftops, and pushing a shit-eating celebrity cameo in a hilariously unexpected direction — manage to reflect their own degree of the devil-may-care ethos that have made the Parker novels so enduringly cathartic. 

 










A CGI-soaked, straight-to-streaming throwback to the multiplex crowd-pleasers that once made Black the highest-paid screenwriter on the planet, “Play Dirty” may be too diluted to milk all that much from its “movies used to be like this” nostalgia, but it's hard to argue with the spiritual '90s-ness of a crime comedy that features a crucial supporting performance from Gretchen Mol. 

That spirit manages to survive a patently modern star turn from Mark Wahlberg, whose incapacity for nuance and self-reflection is well-served by a role that has little interest in either. Wahlberg is an obvious downgrade from executive producer Robert Downey Jr., who was originally set for the part, but his “fuck anyone who tries to big-time me” Boston affect suits the character just fine, and he deserves some credit for being one of the few actors who can convincingly lead a funny car chase, shoot a semi-innocent bystander in the head, and then hand his widow a $10,000 stack of cash all without having to change the expression on his face.

And that's precisely what happens in the first 10 minutes of “Play Dirty” (which isn't inspired by a specific Stark novel, but rather distilled from the essence of the entire series), as a bank heist goes south when a rent-a-cop decides to get involved… even though his wife is riding shotgun and their daughter is sitting in the backseat. The getaway chase — a vintage Black setpiece, despite how crummy it looks — steers directly into the middle of a horserace at the local track, complete with a hilarious cutaway of a weathered gambler throwing away his bet ticket and computer-generated equines flying in every direction as Wahlberg zigzags through the mayhem with his all-purpose squint. 

 










Our heroes make a clean-ish getaway, but the hot new member of the crew has an agenda of her own, and manages to waste everyone but Parker in her bid to steal the loot for herself. Zen (Rosa Salazar, terrific as the kind of two-timing femme fatale you like more than any of the other main characters) needs seed money for a heist she's planning at the U.N., where she hopes to steal her country's greatest treasure away from the dictator who's putting it on display, and then use the profits to fund a revolution (again, “Play Dirty” is begrudgingly about things in a way that the “Parker” novels seldom were). By the time Parker catches up with Zen, she's already invested all of the cash in the job, which means that Parker will have to team up with her if he has any hope of getting it back. Adding fuel to the fire: The dictator is trying to steal the treasure for himself in order to play the victim, and the crew he's hired for the score — a group of corporatized goons known as The Outfit — just so happen to be Parker's mortal enemies. 

Personality goes a lot further than plot here, and so who's who and why they're shooting at each other is really only worth discussing as a loose framework for how and why this movie is able to mash together so many fun characters. None of the characters in Black, Anthony Bagarozzi, and Charles Mondry's script hold a candle to the ones that made the likes of “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” and “The Nice Guys” so much more than the sum of their genre riffs (“Play Dirty” is spread too thin to give its cast the runway they need to create something truly original), but everyone here is having fun and is on the same page. 

 










LaKeith Stanfield is an easy standout as Parker's best friend Grofield, a passionate actor who moonlights as a criminal to fund his dead-end theater company — some of the movie's heartiest chuckles come from the joy Grofield takes in getting to ham things up as part of the heist. Keegan-Michael Key and Claire Lovering have less to do as the crew's resident masters of disguise, but they're both able to match the confidence that Black imbues in this kind of material, and their role in the film's centerpiece subway derailment has a lot of fun messing with expectations. Tony Shalhoub is on auto-pilot as the exasperated leader of The Outfit, but he and his incompetent underling (a mercilessly abused Nat Wolff) share good schtick without stepping on Salazar's toes as Parker's biggest threat and fiercest comic rival. Even without sharing so much as a single kiss, they kill people together with such mutual enthusiasm that you can see them ending up happily ever after. 

Is this that kind of movie? It's possible, despite the stoniness of the source material. Per Black tradition, “Play Dirty” is full of twinkle and Christmas cheer, and while its various setpieces are all effectively comic without straining for laughs, the film's warmest moments tend to be the interstitial acts of violence, where Parker and Zen can trade barbs in between executing a few highly emotive henchman (Black's fondest staple). This is a “Parker” reboot for the whole family, provided that everyone in the family has been completely desensitized to rampant violence — and who among us hasn't? 

 










More to the point, it's a “Parker” reboot with an eye toward franchise potential, which is something about it that would've made Westlake happy (he only allowed productions to use that name if they agreed to produce a whole series of films based on his books). And while this isn't quite the stuff of vintage Black, it's close enough that I wouldn't mind seeing him crank another one out every two years for the next decade. 

“Play Dirty” will be available to stream on Prime Video starting Wednesday, October 1.

	The emotional climax of Paul McCartney's tour opener in Palm Springs: right at the start, when he sang “Help!” It was his full show, after a short warm-up dress rehearsal last week in a small Santa Barbara venue. But he set the stakes high with “Help!,” John Lennon's personal cry of desperation — he hasn't sung the full song since the Beatles' final tour. Paul sang the John part, as his guitarists sang the vocal counterpoint that Paul wrote 60 years ago. For the acoustic breakdown, Paul sang alone, with his voice cracking just every so slightly on “So much younger than todaaaaay.” It was a knockout moment in a night full of them.


	“It's the second night of the tour, so we're young and fresh and restless,” he told the crowd before leaping into a euphoric “Drive My Car.” But as always, he's a man on the run, driven to keep topping himself on the road, playing a marathon show with two or three dozen of the universe's greatest hits. Paul made the whole night more than just the start of his U.S. fall run—he made it a statement of purpose, and a challenge to the audience to keep up with him, in a celebration of how far he's traveled over the years.

	











	The audience was more than up to the task — the Ariscure Arena was packed with 11,000 fans. Part of the challenge at a McCartney show is to have more fun than he's having — but it's not clear whether it can be done, since his superhuman enthusiasm is terrifying to behold at 83. Paul has never been the kind of fool who plays it cool, but that sense of emotional urgency is what always sets McCartney apart, and it makes him the greatest of rock & roll live performers — that ability to take a familiar song and make it seethe with now-now-now energy. And tonight, he was feeling that down to his bootlace. Let him roll it? As if anything could stop him.

	











	“We're going to do some old songs and some new songs and some in-between songs,” he announced early on. “This song is not new. I'll give you a clue.” Then he ripped right into “Got To Get You Into My Life,” electrifying thousands of another-kind-of minds. He reveled in the audience screams — a sound he's been basking in nonstop since his teens, yet a sound that just makes him openly crave more.“This is so great,” he said. “I'm going to take a minute here just to drink it all in for myself.”

	As always, McCartney defiantly refuses to coast — he plays nearly three hours without a pause, hopping from instrument to instrument because he can't wait to start the next song. The last time I saw him was in a tiny rock club, New York's Bowery Ballroom; the time before that was in a stadium on the eve of his 80th birthday. But wherever he is, he's out to fill the room, re-earning his legend from scratch every night.


	The Palm Springs area is famous for its older population — to get the Acrisure Arena, just take Frank Sinatra Drive via Ginger Rogers Road, crossing the Sonny Bono Memorial Expressway. But tonight, the “desert world” didn't even begin to settle down. Like his friend Bob Dylan, who he resembles in so many curious ways these days, he's spending his eighties on a Never-Ending Tour. It's the “Got Back” tour, the name he's been using for his show since returning from the pandemic. You could say he keeps defying his age, but that raises the question of who else of any age can puts on a show like this man. 


	What does it mean to hear Paul McCartney sing  “Help!” in 2025? Until now, the closest he'd come was on his 1990 tour, when it was a brief snippet in a John tribute medley. But its totally different to go all the way into the song all these years later—the Number One hit in the U.S. exactly 60 years ago, and yes, Paul is the type to relish these details.

	It's a song always associated with John, his oldest, craziest, saddest, cruelest, most troublesome mate, a song always deeply coded in their friendship. “Help!” was the most personal confession John had ever dared — yet it's a song he could only sing with Paul right there beside him, helping him tell the story, nudging him line by line. You hear the Beatles' voices in real time together, telling a tale that none of them would have the courage to sing alone. John was just a kid of 24 when he wrote it, looking back on his youthful innocence, revealing the vulnerable side he fought to keep hidden. But Paul and George follow him every step, sometimes singing John's own lines back to him before he even gets there.

	











	As so often these days, Paul is getting back to finish some John business — completing the lost demo “Now and Then,” creating a virtual live duet for “I've Got a Feeling,” baring their private conflicts in the entire Get Back project. “Help!” also has the line “now and then” jumping out of it, which hits harder after Paul's decades-long obsession with preserving John's “Now and Then.” Why is Paul driven to do things like this? What makes him go back to this pained, unfixable, unforgettable friendship that still gives him no peace? He probably doesn't get it—no more than the rest of the world does. But it's devastatingly moving to hear him do it in “Help!”


	He kept the energy level high with his  1980 hit “Coming Up,” enhanced by the Hot City Horns working it into Henry Mancini's “Peter Gunn Theme.” It's also a song with a John connection — the Paul song he randomly heard on the radio in his limo, started enjoying, then suddenly recognized, shouting, “Fuck a pig, it's Paul!” 


	“This next song is kind of relatively new,” he said before “Come On To Me,” from 2018's Egypt Station. “When I say they're ‘new,' they're probably like about ten years old. That's new-ish.” For a second, fans might have let visions of “Queenie Eye” or “Dominoes” dance in their heads, given the abundance of great songs he's dropped in the past dozen years.


	He sang a tender “My Valentine,” his 2012 ballad for his wife Nancy Shevell, adding, “This one is for you, Nance.” He belted “Maybe I'm Amazed” as a soulful vocal powerhouse, with a video montage of Linda McCartney's photos from the Scottish farm where he wrote it, in their early days together. “How time flies,” he said. “That baby in my jacket? She's a grown-up now with four kids of her own — that's my daughter Mary.” He added that tonight was the birthday of another Mary—his mother. “Mind you, she would have been 116,”  he said. “Marys all the way.” It was impossible not to think of Mary McCartney later in the show, when he sang “Let It Be.”


	He keeps the pace brisk — just his long-running band of fellow travelers, who've been together twice as long as the Beatles by now: guitarist Rusty Anderson, guitarist Brian Ray, keyboardist Paul “Wix” Wickens, and on drums, the mighty Abe Laboriel Jr. (Only three drummers can do justice to “Hey Jude”: Abe, Ringo, and the late Roger Hawkins of Muscle Shoals.) 

	











	“Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da” sounds timelier than ever these days — an ode to a West Indian immigrant family in London, recorded during a summer when right-wing British political Enoch Powell was whipping up anti-immigrant hysteria. He ripped through bangers like “Jet,” “Get Back,” and “Band on the Run.” In the 1970s, “Let Me Roll It” might have sounded like a ode to the pleasures of rolling joints, making out, playing guitar—and maybe also throwing a scare into Lennon. But now it sounds like a mission statement, especially when he sings “I want to tell you, and now's the time” — a line that slipped past everyone in his thirties, but hits harder than ever in his eighties.


	“Something” was a heartfelt tribute to George Harrison, played on a ukulele that his old friend gave him. Paul added, “A shout-out to someone special who's in the audience tonight — George's wife Olivia,” which brought everyone to their feet.” 


	He did his acoustic interlude with “Blackbird,” his civil rights tribute, and “Here Today,” his Lennon elegy. “We never told each other, ‘I love you, man,” he confessed as he began “Here Today,” hitting his falsetto for the impassioned final notes. It led into “Now and Then,” the final Beatles song from 2023, an unfinished John demo that he was obsessed with finishing. Some folks foolishly slept on “Now and Then” just because McCartney called it “A.I.” in a careless moment, leading people to wrongly think it was some kind of deepfake. But it's Paul keeping faith with his friend on the most intimate level — a song that nobody else heard much potential in, but a song that Paul felt driven to finish, simply refusing to let it go until it became the Beatles song he always knew it deserved to be. As in “Help,” he sang his old mate's words, words he must have often heard as sung to him. He added, “Thank you John for writing that beautiful song.”


	For me, “Help!” was the first Beatles song I ever heard as a kid, watching their daffy 1965 title flick on TV. It was a shocking sound — it sounded like a grown man admitting his weakness, reaching out for help, but with his friends there for moral support. He guides John into the song's scariest line: “Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.” Few things were scarier to either John or Paul than the three words “changed my mind” — it's something they had in common. It was a perfect way for a little kid to stumble into the decades-long bond these two friends shared—and Paul is working hard every night to keep that bond painfully alive.

	











	“Hey Jude” came on like a benediction transforming the audience into a massive tantric na-na-na-na swarm. (A fan a few rows in front of me held her sign saying “Hi I'm Jude” — but then aren't we all?) When he divides the sing-along into male and female showcases, there's no pretense at all he's interested in listening to the men sing — he does it just to get to the female voices, pleading, “I love that sound—come on, girls, one more time.”


	“This next one is special to me, and you'll see why,” he said for the encore, introducing “I've Got a Feeling,” his video and audio duet with John. A favorite moment: the footage makes sense to get a close-up capturing Lennon's“fuck yeah” in the final minute. Paul added, “Always glad to do that one and sing with John again.” As always, he bristled when he finally had to say goodnight — we should all be so lucky in our lives to hate anything the way Paul McCartney hates abandoning an audience. But he sent everyone home deliriously happy with the Abbey Road “Golden Slumbers” medley, with all three axemen facing off as in the original's Paul/George/John guitar battle.


	One of the night's highlights came at the very end, after the band took their final bows, waved, and left the stage. Paul was almost offstage before he suddenly darted back to the microphone. There was something else he wanted to say. “See you next time,” he told the crowd. It was a real “did I tell you I need you?” moment. 


	In the past couple of months, I've seen astonishing shows from performers in their 80s: Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Willie Nelson. These are the relentless lifers who have it in their blood—the ones who can't NOT do it. Unlike Bob or Neil, but like Willie, Paul doesn't throw many curveballs into the set. (As he told Rolling Stone in 2014, “It's not like I'm Phish, you know.”) But like all of them, he doesn't shy away from the cracks and creaks in his voice — these artists don't seek to turn back time (are you kidding?) or to deny it, but to change along with it. Why does he push himself so brutally, night after night, when absolutely everybody in the crowd would be overjoyed with so much less? It's a mystery nobody can comprehend, yet it's amazing to behold — and maybe Paul is amazed, along with the rest of us.


	Set List:


	“Help!”“Coming Up”“Got to Get You Into My Life”“Letting Go”“Drive My Car”“Come On to Me”“Let Me Roll It”“Getting Better”“Let ‘Em In”“My Valentine”“Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five”“Maybe I'm Amazed”“I've Just Seen A Face”“In Spite of All The Danger”“Love Me Do”“Dance Tonight”“Blackbird”“Here Today”“Now and Then”“Lady Madonna”“Jet”“Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite”“Something”“Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da”“Band on the Run”“Get Back”“Let It Be”“Live and Let Die”“Hey Jude”

Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström will take over in the new year. "I'll remain deeply involved in shaping Spotify's future," says Ek.

Industry News Editor


	Spotify has announced a major leadership shift set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, with founder and CEO Daniel Ek transitioning to the role of executive chairman, while current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström set to become co-CEOs. 


	Both will report to Ek and are expected to join Spotify's board of directors, pending shareholder approval.


	This move formalizes a leadership structure that has been in practice since 2023, Spotify said in its announcement Tuesday (Sept. 30), with Söderström and Norström already leading strategic and operational efforts. As executive chairman, Ek will focus on long-term strategy, capital allocation, and regulatory matters, adopting a European-style chairman role that remains actively involved in company direction.


	Ek emphasized his confidence in the new leadership, noting in the announcement that both Söderström and Norström have been instrumental in Spotify's growth since its early days. “This change simply matches titles to how we already operate,” Ek said. “I'll remain deeply involved in shaping Spotify's future.”


	Woody Marshall, lead independent director of Spotify's board, expressed strong support for the transition, citing the duo's 15+ years of experience and their role in driving Spotify's success. He also praised Ek's continued involvement, which ensures founder-led strategic guidance.


	In a joint statement, the incoming co-CEOs said they are excited to lead Spotify into its next chapter. “We bring different experiences and perspectives to the CEO role, but share a strong bias to action,” they said. “With Daniel's ongoing support, we're ready to build the most valuable experience in audio streaming.”


	Spotify will host a live Q&A session today to discuss the transition. The company earlier this morning announced a new multi-year licensing deal with Merlin.


	Ek also shared a personal message with employees, acquired by Billboard, reflecting on Spotify's journey from a small startup in Stockholm to a global platform with nearly 700 million users. He described his new role as his “next mission,” allowing him to focus on broader strategic initiatives while remaining closely connected to the company.


Read Ek's Letter to Employees:


Team,


In the Spotify of today, all eyes (and ears) are on us. There's not much we do that goes unnoticed. But that wasn't always the case. In a small makeshift office on Riddargatan in Stockholm, a few of us set out to solve what felt like an impossible idea: to make every song available instantly, legally, in a product people love.


Fast forward almost 20 years, and that “impossible idea” has become a platform used by nearly three-quarters of a billion people around the globe. We've helped reshape an industry that is not only growing again but reaching new heights.


I don't often pause to reflect—looking ahead has always been my instinct. But I'm incredibly proud of what we've created together: a beloved user experience, a thriving business, and a team that continues to raise the bar. A huge amount of credit goes to Alex and Gustav, who have led with skill, vision, and conviction. They've proven themselves again and again, and I believe they're ready for what's next.


So, with full confidence in Gustav and Alex, on January 1, 2026, I will move to Executive Chairman, and they will become our co-CEOs. They will also join our Board of Directors, pending shareholder approval. 


I've always thought about roles as missions. At Spotify, I've had about nine missions while keeping the same title. In the early days, I assembled furniture and negotiated our first deals. I ran finance, led product, then sales, then marketing. I've held roles across most teams here. This is simply my next mission. My title changes—but my commitment and belief in what we're building does not.


For most of you, very little will change. Spotify has a strong leadership team and a solid plan we're executing against. What changes is my time and focus. As Executive Chairman, I'll spend more time on the long arc: strategy, capital allocation, regulatory efforts, and the calls that will shape the next decade. Gustav and Alex will continue to report to me, and we'll work closely with our Board. This reflects a European Chairman setup—more hands-on than the traditional U.S. model.


Why now? Because Alex and Gustav have clearly demonstrated they're ready to lead. And because you all have stepped up, I can confidently step back from the day-to-day. Together, we've shown the world that Spotify is not only a great product but also a great business—delivering our first full year of profitability in company history.


To be clear, I'm not leaving. I'll remain deeply involved in the big, defining decisions about our future, partnering with Gustav and Alex as they lead the way forward.


A personal note: I'm often asked, “How do we build more Spotifys out of Europe?” That's why I announced my intention to help create more supercompanies—those tackling the biggest challenges of our time. I'll share more about that soon. But today is about Spotify.


Thank you for two extraordinary decades. Thank you for believing in impossible ideas—and for allowing me the greatest privilege of a lifetime.


Let's keep going—harder, better, faster, stronger.


Daniel

Mariah Carey stopped by The Tonight Show to perform her recent track “Play This Song” with Anderson .Paak and house band the Roots. The singer, clad in a gold gown, took center stage to showcase the song with the help of Paak, who played the grand piano alongside her. 


	“Play This Song” comes off Carey's long-awaited 16th album, Here for It All. The album, out now, features 11 songs, including collaborations with Paak and the Clark Sisters. It marks the pop singer's follow-up album to 2018's Caution. In the seven years since releasing Caution, Carey hasn't shared much new solo music, though she has dropped anniversary reissues of several classic albums, the 2020 compilation The Rarities, and plenty of Christmas music. She's also guested on remixes of songs by Ariana Grande and Latto.


	Carey sat down with The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon to discuss the album and her family. She also responded to the viral BBC interview in which she was asked about Katy Perry going to space. The interviewer asked Carey if she wanted to also go to space and she responded, “I think I've done enough.”

	“Well, I mean, we're going to space now?” Carey replied. “What are we doing?”

	Elsewhere in the interview, Carey reflected on an unreleased album she made in the '90s. “I was just rebelling because I was working on Daydream and I was doing, like, ‘Always Be My Baby' and ‘Fantasy' and those kinds of songs and I loved doing that,” she recalled. If the band was still available at the end of the night she would ask them to play grunge rock music “just so I can get it out of my head.” 

	











	She allowed Fallon to play a snippet of one of the tracks, noting that she doesn't know which record label owns the music. “It never was released,” she said. “I kind of regret not putting it out.”

The former RIIZE member recalls highlights from traveling the U.S. and finally meeting the fans who have supported him through hard times.

XngHan is nervously fidgeting with small rubber bands.

The singer and former member of K-pop boy group RIIZE arranges the ripped-up pieces of one into a smiley face: two straight eyes, a nose and dopey grin. Then, giving it an elastic halo, he points out the display to his manager like a kid seeking approval from a parent, laughing, before snapping back into business mode. For the better part of the past hour, the team has been sleepily standing by in an L.A. dance studio while students in the adjoining space pick up the choreography from his recently released solo debut, “Waste No Time” — an experience he's going to cap by making a surprise cameo.

This U.S. trip, which consists of three “fan sign” events in New York, Dallas and Los Angeles, is about as far out of the soft-spoken 21-year-old's comfort zone as it gets. After chatting one-on-one and signing albums during the meet-ups, he models for “photo time,” where fans seated inside the hotel ballroom yell out a string of hand-heart and cat-ear pose requests. (“It's a pretty awkward time for him, but it's pretty entertaining for us,” one of his reps quips.) Yet the overall tone is one of celebration, the lightness of coming out the other end of something.

“Seeing them in person is what made me happy,” XngHan (born Hong Seunghan) tells Billboard a couple of days later in early September. “I'm really shy, so I'd always [thought I] preferred talking to our fans online.” Back home, he's used to playing the shrinking violet, he explains, “But here, I noticed our fans were even shyer than me. It really seemed like they wanted to say something, but they were so nervous that they weren't able to say what they wanted to say.”

For good reason, emotions ran high. When XngHan was put on indefinite hiatus in 2o23, with his future as a K-pop idol basically becoming a giant question mark, fans in the West were particularly vocal supporters for his reinstatement, remaining relentlessly by his side. Even now, around the corner from the fan sign, the pink wall of SM Entertainment's old Koreatown office has been plastered with uplifting messages directed at XngHan. (By the end of the month, a rainbow of sticky notes also went up near the company's main HQ in Seoul; he left an individual reply to each and every one.)

“I received a lot of energy from the fans,” he reflects on the trip's last day. “They were very sincere, so I thought that I would want to meet them again soon.” Below, the singer recounts highlights from the milestone fan sign tour he'd like to “leave a record of” and shares exclusive polaroids. Watch more moments here.

While the singer is now a soloist, he performs collectively as part of XngHan and Xoul with dancers Jang Yul and Gu Kyohong. They may not have accompanied him to the U.S., but the trio had a chance to travel together to SM Town Live in Tokyo earlier this year. His favorite part of hitting the road with them? “They eat really well,” he laughs. In the pair's absence, XngHan has been doing the same, sampling the usual suspects in each city: In-N-Out, southern barbecue, pizza (pictured above). When in a new location, “I usually like challenging myself to eat the foods that are there,” he says, though he regrets not making it to BCD, a Korean tofu house in L.A. that serves spicy soup.

Travelling with a small crew this go-around, XngHan got to be more spontaneous. In New York, he went with the flow, sipping whisky in a West Village jazz bar and snapping photos of pop art at the Whitney. “But I have to say that it was the time I spent in L.A. that really left an impact on me,” he says. “Not only getting to see how people style themselves, but also getting a glimpse of life through their eyes. That free-spirited attitude.” These vibes weren't only limited to the people he met. “There was a bunny in Dallas, just doing its own thing,” he recalls. “The tiniest, cutest bunny, but it looked so free, you know? Just munching on grass and hopping around.”

XngHan isn't really one for crying; while he's watched The Notebook at least 12 times, he claims to end each viewing with dry eyes. “I'm more so the one who consoles others,” he explains, a disposition that came in handy at the fan signs. “There was someone who told me that I had brought her a lot of comfort when she was going through a tough time in her life,” the singer says. “It really stuck with me because it was the first time [a fan had cried] in-person.” Because his signature mirrors a four-leaf clover, he feels like he's sending off each person with a good luck charm of their own: “In a way, it's me saying, ‘Have a great day that makes you smile!'”

When XngHan became a trainee at SM in seventh grade, “I thought I was going to learn all the K-pop dances,” he says. “But instead they taught me hip-hop choreography.” The dance novice started doing his own “research” on YouTube, which brought him to G-Dragon, the Super Bowl 50 halftime show with Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, and dance videos from Ian Eastwood, who XngHan linked up with while in Los Angeles. Later that same day, when he watched the class of dancers take on his single's choreography, “It gave me a sense of euphoria,” he says. “I wanted to capture it all in that moment, leave a record of it somewhere to treasure and look back on.”

President Donald Trump will receive another payday from a media conglomerate that four years ago attempted to stop the president from inciting violence. YouTube will pay President Trump $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit related to the suspension of Trump's account after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, according to court documents filed today. $22 million of that sum will go toward a trust for the National Mall, which is handling the construction of Trump's $200 million White House ballroom. The rest will go toward other plaintiffs in the case, including American Conservative Union and Naomi Wolf, the former feminist scholar turned Steve Bannon's perpetual podcast guest. Per The Hollywood Reporter, the settlement “shall not constitute an admission of liability or fault on the part” of YouTube, which is essential to the Alphabet-owned video platform that attracts 122 million active users every day and will soon be filled with the type of content that led to our current downward spiral.

The news comes as YouTube prepares to reinstate the accounts of numerous creators who spread misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. YouTube's capitulation aligns with the rest of the tech world, which has abandoned content moderation in recent years, allowing its platforms to fill up with hate speech, AI slop, and misinformation. After being acquired by Elon Musk, hate speech exploded on X, where Musk made drastic cuts to its trust and safety team, allowing the sixth most popular website on Earth to become 4chan. Earlier this year, Meta did the same, loosening restrictions that prevented the type of hate- and slur-filled comments that drive engagement. In less than a year, Meta had to change other rules, such as those regarding chatbots flirting with children and spreading medical misinformation. Previously, it had allowed such behavior.

YouTube is far from the only media organization to settle what many consider frivolous First Amendment cases. After Trump sued Disney and Paramount's news organizations, both ABC and CBS paid Trump upwards of $15 million each to settle winnable cases. Meanwhile, social media apps, such as X and Meta, reinstated the president's accounts, hoping he'd return to the flailing social media sites. The settlements and reinstatements have emboldened the 79-year-old techie president, who spent the weekend on his social media site, Truth Social, Truthing AI-generated videos about CBD treatments and the medbed. Born in conspiracy circles over the last few years, this fantastical machine, the medbed, cures all diseases simply by having the patient lie down in it. Mike Rothschild, a journalist focused on conspiracy theories, wrote on Bluesky that this theory has led “many MAGA believers” to refuse medical treatment because they “believe one day Trump or Q or NESARA will release medbed tech that will restore their health in minutes.”

Michael Rapino outraged many by alleging concert tickets are less expensive than they should be — but it's a claim he and other execs have been making for years.


													By
												

	Dave Brooks



	Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino sparked a furor among concert fans last week when he told a CNBC host that concert tickets were underpriced — a sentiment that drew swift condemnation from both casual listeners and dedicated fans frustrated by the cost of seeing live music. While Rapino's comments caught many off guard, they echoed a line of thinking at the company that predates the pandemic and has only grown louder in recent years.


	Despite persistent complaints that concerts are becoming too expensive, Rapino and other Live Nation executives — including president Joe Berchtold and global promoter Arthur Fogel — have long argued the opposite: that ticket prices for many superstar acts are still too low compared with consumer demand.


	Speaking at CNBC's Game Plan conference in Los Angeles, Rapino framed live music as undervalued compared to other forms of entertainment.


	“Music has been underappreciated,” Rapino said. “In sports, I joke it's like a badge of honor to spend 70 grand for a Knicks courtside [seat]. They beat me up if we charge $800 for Beyoncé.” He added, “We have a lot of runway left. So when you read about ticket prices going up, the average concert price is still $72. Try going to a Lakers game for that, and there's 80 of them. The concert is underpriced and has been for a long time.”


	The remarks were quickly clipped, shared across social media, and met with widespread backlash. Grammy-winning songwriter, artist and producer Jack Antonoff responded, “This breaks my heart and is a really sick way of looking at it.” Fans online blasted Rapino as out of touch, pointing to steadily rising costs that have made live music less accessible.


	According to Billboard Boxscore, ticket prices for the top 100 tours rose more than 30% in 2024, averaging $130 per ticket — a 9% jump in a single year. Stadium shows in particular have surged, with average prices rising from $125.10 in 2023 to $140.42 in 2025.


	It's unclear how Rapino arrived at the $72 figure he cited, though it was likely calculated across all shows, including clubs and theaters, while Billboard's data zeroes in on the top-grossing tours. But the contrast highlights a disconnect between how industry leaders frame pricing and what fans experience at the box office.


	Still, Rapino's position is not new. On investor calls as far back as 2021, he has argued that the real proof of underpricing comes from the booming resale market, where tickets routinely trade at multiples of their face value. Berchtold has pointed to more than a billion dollars in annual “price arbitrage” on Live Nation tickets — money spent on StubHub or Ticketmaster's resale platform rather than going directly to artists and promoters.


	That gap between primary and secondary markets remains central to the debate. Rapino and others contend that fans are already proving their willingness to pay more when they turn to resellers, suggesting higher face values could ultimately bring more revenue back to artists. Critics counter that such logic risks pricing out everyday fans and cementing live music as a luxury experience.


	For now, Rapino's latest comments have reignited one of the industry's most heated conversations: how to keep tickets affordable for fans without the tickets getting significantly marked up on resale sites — and who ultimately gets to decide the true price of a concert ticket. For many fans, though, the idea that tickets are “underpriced” rings hollow. With touring costs, service fees and secondary markups already pushing concerts out of reach, Rapino's comments feel less like an industry insight and more like a reminder that live music is becoming a luxury few can afford.

High roller R.J. Cipriani, who tipped off the FBI about drug lord Owen Hanson, contends the show leaves the inaccurate impression that he may have been complicit in money-laundering: "I don't want people thinking the wrong thing."


							By 

	Gary Baum


Senior Writer


	A larger-than-life gambler turned FBI informant is taking issue with Cocaine Quarterback, Amazon Prime's colorful new docuseries about Owen Hanson, the USC football player who became a notorious narcotics kingpin. R.J. Cipriani tells The Hollywood Reporter that he was hoodwinked into participation after initially passing on the project and that he was ultimately portrayed in a false light.


	Amazon and the show's production company, Unrealistic Ideas, declined to comment.




Cocaine Quarterback — an archly told three-part crime tale which premiered Sept. 25 from producer Mark Wahlberg — centers the yarn-spinning of its imprisoned antihero, whose criminal enterprise acted as a drug-trafficking and money-laundering middleman for a Mexican cartel in both America and Australia. Cipriani would prove to be his undoing.

	The high roller had a publicized reputation for gifting some of his winnings to the needy. (He'd given himself the moniker Robin Hood 702, in reference to the Las Vegas area code.) By Cipriani's account, an ex-girlfriend contacted him about a staking agreement, in which a deep-pocketed backer in Australia would provide funds and some of the potential profits would go to his charitable cause. The first staking was a success, the second a failure — with Cipriani losing $2.5 million at a casino in Sydney. As he recalls now, “I started playing and hit a bad streak.”

	In Cocaine Quarterback, Hanson exults, “I found a money laundering magician.” Cipriani says he only later realized he'd been tricked into working as a cleaner for a drug lord, who was also then romantically involved with his ex-girlfriend. (In the show, the fact of a common paramour isn't discussed.)


	The docuseries chronicles the ratcheting tension between Hanson and Cipriani over the $2.5 million loss. By his own account, Hanson engaged in an escalating intimidation campaign to collect, first having videos of cartel beheadings mailed to Cipriani, and then later paying for someone to desecrate Cipriani's mother's grave.


	“I said, ‘I have to go to the Feds,'” Cipriani recalls. His lawyer made sure he signed a proffer agreement before speaking, which allows a witness to provide information while limiting how it might be used against him.


	Cipriani is enraged that Cocaine Quarterback leaves in doubt whether he might have knowingly participated in the criminality and perhaps become a whistleblower not just to thwart Hanson's aggression but also to immunize himself. “My goal was to get back at him,” he insists. “I never thought I was culpable in any way.”


	Cipriani was interviewed for the docuseries. He says he initially passed after being denied an executive producer credit. But years afterward, when the filmmakers told him that the project would delve into the suicide of a man who Hanson had implicated in his sprawling enterprise (21 people ultimately pleaded guilty), Cipriani contends he offered to appear specifically to vouch for the dead man. After he spoke to the agreed-on line of inquiry, “we kept bantering when I didn't even think I was still being filmed. So [what aired] was a very disingenuous interview.” The subject of the suicide isn't in the final cut.

	











	Cipriani's ill-fated entanglement with Hanson turned out to be the opening act of his story as a federal informant. He later was responsible for exposing a wide-ranging corruption scandal at casino conglomerate Resorts World Las Vegas.


	Lately, Cipriani says he has been quietly developing a scripted take on his own journey. It's called Jackpot, after the codename the FBI gave him. He has other in-the-works Hollywood projects, too. Which is why he's particularly aggrieved that, as he sees it, the Amazon Prime docuseries has dealt him such a poor hand.


	“I don't want people thinking the wrong thing,” he explains. “I'm a guy who goes after bad guys and I can't have it out there that I helped this guy launder money.”

Jared Padalecki portrayed beloved younger brother Sam Winchester on Supernatural for 15 seasons and just as many years, and these 10 performances are his best overall on the show. Padalecki's true breakout role was on Gilmore Girls, in which he ironically played a character named Dean, although he had begun acting several years earlier.

Padalecki has also starred in numerous shows in the last few years, but there's little question that Padalecki's best-known role to date is Sam Winchester, for which he also had many of his greatest acting moments of all time. In particular, these 10 Supernatural episodes represent Jared Padalecki's best performances as Sam Winchester—and number one is undeniable. 

Although Supernatural season 6, episode 6, "You Can't Handle the Truth" may not frequently be listed as one of Supernatural's best episodes, in terms of Padalecki's acting, it's a brilliant episode. This season followed on the heels of what was Supernatural's original ending, the season 5 finale, which meant the stakes were high.

Season 6 focused in part on Sam's return from Lucifer's cage with some odd behaviors, which the show eventually revealed was because Sam didn't have his soul; it remained trapped in the cage. It takes time for that information to come out, though, and by "You Can't Handle the Truth," Dean still didn't know his brother was missing his soul.

This led to brilliant scenes in which Padalecki as Sam had to switch from pretending to care about Dean to being devoid of emotion. It was surely no easy feat to play an entirely different version of Sam (and one that was so contrary to how Sam had been for five seasons), yet Padalecki pulls it off beautifully. 

Like "You Can't Handle the Truth," season 12, episode 1, "Keep Calm and Carry On" may not frequently be cited as one of Supernatural's strongest episodes, but it was undoubtedly a very tough episode for Padalecki. While Dean is dealing with the shocking return of his mother, Mary Winchester, Sam has been taken by the British Men of Letters.

While captured, Sam endures horrible torture, including having his feet burned and having ice cold water dumped over him continuously. Torture scenes are always going to be physically and emotionally demanding for an actor, and Padalecki was facing some seriously challenging scenes.

Yet, this stands out as one of Padalecki's best performances of all time, especially because he not only managed to believably play being tortured but also because, through it all, he maintained Sam's personality and captured how this nuanced character would have reacted to these awful circumstances. 

Season 2, episode 17, "Heart," is surprisingly one of the most emotional episodes of Supernatural's early seasons, despite the fact that it wasn't necessarily integral to the overall plot of the show. In this episode, Dean and Sam meet Madison, a young woman who sadly doesn't know she's become a werewolf.

Before this discovery is made (including by Sam and Dean), Sam and Madison strike up a romance, and she is seemingly the first woman Sam fully opened his heart to following the tragic death of his girlfriend, Jessica, in the Supernatural pilot. Unfortunately, this romance also ends in heartbreak.

Madison begs Sam to kill her, and he shoots her off-screen. This is one of the few times we see Dean flinch in Supernatural, which conveys how emotionally painful it was for Sam to have to kill Madison. Padalecki fully captures how devastating this was for Sam, and his tears before he kills her feel incredibly real.

As a tonal shift from the first three episodes mentioned on this list, season 5, episode 12, "Swap Meat," sees Sam in a hilarious body swap situation, in which a teenager is inhabiting Sam's body, and Sam is inhabiting the teen's. This is a particularly impressive feat for Padalecki because of his multiple roles in the episode.

Although there are times when the teenager, Gary, is played by Colton James, throughout the episode it is also Padalecki who is depicting both the teenager in Sam's body and Sam as the teen. This leads to some truly hilarious moments, including Sam needing to act like the troubled teenage son of two concerned parents.

At no point does the episode feel goofy or overstated in terms of Padalecki's performance, though. On the contrary, Padalecki captures both characters brilliantly in the episode, in a way that makes it easy to forget it's not really Gary/Colton James in Sam's body at multiple points. 

It shouldn't come as any surprise that season 5, episode 8, "Changing Channels," is also on this list, as it is easily one of Supernatural's most beloved episodes. In "Changing Channels," Sam and Dean are sent into various TV shows, including a game show called "Nutcracker," which involves Sam experiencing a rather unfortunate injury.

Yet again, this episode could come off as just being goofy, but both Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles manage to make the stakes feel significant and real. Padalecki in particular has some brilliant scenes in this episode, including when Sam is forced to be in a commercial in which he has to state that he has genital herpes.

Sam's discomfort and annoyance at the circumstances are abundantly clear throughout "Changing Channels," as is his desperation to escape these shows and figure out what is happening to him and to Dean. For that reason, despite this being one of Supernatural's more comedic and even sillier episodes, it's one of Padalecki's best performances. 

Like "Changing Channels," season 3, episode 11, "Mystery Spot," (another Trickster episode) is one of Supernatural's best, and it leans heavily on Padalecki for the acting. In this episode, Sam is subjected to the same day over and over again, which always cuts off and begins again with Dean's death.

The distress of being trapped in the same day and watching his brother die in myriad horrible ways more than one hundred times is palpable in Padalecki's performance, which manages to make a plot that has appeared in other shows and movies (like Groundhog Day) feel new again.

There are also some genuinely funny moments, such as Sam knowing exactly what Dean is going to say and saying it at the same time as him because it has happened so many times before, that Padalecki executes just as brilliantly as the emotionally heavy scenes.

A frankly underrated episode of Supernatural in terms of Jared Padalecki's performance is season 2, episode 14, "Born Under a Bad Sign." In this episode, Sam has been possessed by the Demon Meg and goes to tie up and interrogate Sam and Dean's friend, Jo Harvelle.

Like with Gary in "Swap Meat," it's easy to forget that it's Jared Padalecki acting in this episode because it really feels like Meg in Sam's body. Throughout the episode, Sam/Meg is downright creepy, and Padalecki perfectly pulls off Sam being possessed and acting completely differently.

In fact, one of the best parts of the entire episode is when Sam throws his head back and lets out a truly terrifying demonic laugh, which is arguably one of Padalecki's best moments throughout all 15 seasons of the show.

Sam Winchester goes through some harrowing emotional and physical moments in Supernatural, and one of the most brutal is in season 4, episode 21, "When the Levee Breaks." In this episode, Sam is essentially going through withdrawal from no longer drinking demon blood, which replicates some real-life withdrawal symptoms.

It's clear throughout the episode that Sam is in agonizing pain, and he also begins hallucinating horrible things, including that the demon who tortured Dean in Hell, Alastair, has come to torture him as well. What makes this particularly heartbreaking is that Sam, believing this torture to be real, is calling out to Dean and Bobby for help.

Because they are waiting for Sam's withdrawal to end, though, neither Dean nor Bobby goes to Sam, leaving him feeling terrified and abandoned. Padalecki depicts all of these emotions perfectly, and he likewise captures just how violent and painful these withdrawal symptoms are for Sam. 

Although there's plenty of love for Supernatural's 15 seasons, there are many who argue that the season 5 finale would have been a better ending to the show. Whether that's true or not, it's clear that season 5, episode 22, "Swan Song," is one of Supernatural's very best, and that's true of Padalecki's acting in the episode as well.

Among the most impressive moments is when Padalecki has to portray Lucifer in Sam's body speaking to Sam in a mirror. It would be all too easy for this scene to come off as a bit goofy, but that's far from the case. Instead, Padalecki manages to make both characters feel distinct from one another and believably switch between both.

Likewise, the emotional stakes could not be higher at the end of the episode, and Padalecki manages to beautifully capture the moment Sam breaks through Lucifer's control and decides to jump into Lucifer's cage, saving everyone except for, sadly, himself. 

Finally, season 6, episode 15, "The French Mistake" is widely regarded as the greatest of Supernatural's masterpiece episodes, and that extends to Padalecki's acting. "The French Mistake" sees Sam and Dean transported to an alternate reality, in which they are Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who play Sam and Dean.

That is, in this episode, Jared Padalecki is playing Sam Winchester, who is playing Jared Padalecki, who is playing Sam Winchester. Incredibly, Padalecki (and Ackles as well) manages to completely pull this off, depicting Sam as a terrible actor and thoroughly confused by what has transpired.

Padalecki also acts opposite his real-life wife, Genevieve Padalecki, which only adds to how hilarious and brilliant this episode is. Although "The French Mistake" was taking a major risk with such an unusual plot, it completely paid off, and it's easily the best of Jared Padalecki's performances as Sam Winchester in Supernatural.

Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats.

Dan Mullen dropped a viral video of a massive white light in the sky.

UNLV football coach Dan Mullen has the internet buzzing with jokes after sharing a video of something in the sky.

As OutKick readers know, the UFO topic is a hot one. People can't get enough when it comes to videos and photos of unexplained things in the sky.

You know what else people love? College football. Get ready for the rare crossover event setting social media on fire.

The former Florida coach and current UNLV leader posted a video Sunday night of a very large white light racing through the air over Las Vegas.

You can check out the footage below, and come to your own conclusions.

Many were quick to point out it was likely a SpaceX-related launch, which is extremely common to see in that region.

Others decided to start cracking jokes, and I have to admit that the responses were pretty funny.

Well, I'm glad to see lots of people online still have a solid sense of humor. That's always great to see. There's also plenty of people who are already tying Dan Mullen to the Arkansas job after Sam Pittman was kicked to the curb.

Who would have expected a possible UFO (it's not one to be clear) to be the avenue people used to push the rumor even more?

Welcome to the world of the internet, UFOs and college football. Add in a Las Vegas angle, and it's like we stuck our favorite topics in a blender together.

These haunted towns in the U.S. all have a paranormal past that they just can't seem to shake. 

Written by 

'Tis the season for all things spooky! Whether you're intrigued by the paranormal or hoping to have your own encounter, there are plenty of haunted places in the U.S. that are perfect for spooky season. Some of these towns fully embrace their ghost stories and feature them prominently on their tourism boards with a sense of paranormal pride. Others take a more reserved approach, perhaps due to the ornery nature of whatever lurks around.

If you're interested in attempting a connection with the other side, visit one of these haunted towns in the U.S. this spooky season.

Salem might just be the best town for spooky season. You can't mention Salem and not think of the 1692 witch trials; it's certainly their “claim to fame.” During the fall (especially around Halloween), Salem becomes a mega-popular tourist attraction, with hundreds of travelers visiting to learn the lore. The Salem Witch Trials Memorial, located just off of Charter Street, is the iconic memorial to the 20 victims of the witch trials.

New Orleans and the paranormal go together like red beans and rice. The Vieux Carré has an infamous history filled with ghosts, ghouls, and even a Voodoo Queen or two. Wander around the 78 square blocks of the French Quarter long enough, and you'll undoubtedly stumble into a building or two with a paranormal past. Care for a few spirits with your spirits? Swing by Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar and you might just catch a glimpse of the ghost of Jean Lafitte, America's most infamous pirate. This historic bar is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to spooky stories—take a ghost tour and learn all about the spooky side of New Orleans. 

The French Quarter isn't the only haunted place in New Orleans. The city's cemeteries also have a paranormal history. You can visit most cemeteries on your own, but there's one in particular that you'll need a licensed guide to enter—St. Louis Cemetery No. 1. Established in 1789, it's the oldest cemetery in New Orleans. It's worth your while to take a ghost tour through the tombs and learn the chilling stories yourself.

Savannah is a city overflowing with history, mystery, and intrigue. One of Savannah's best-known ghost stories is the tragedy of Alice Riley, the first woman hanged in Georgia. Another is Little Gracie Watson, a child born in 1883 who passed away from pneumonia in 1889. She is buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, and legend has it that the little girl's ghost lingers within the cemetery. Even if you're not looking for her ghost, the Bonaventure Cemetery is worth a visit. Its beautiful Spanish moss-draped live oak trees and beautiful Gothic statues were the inspiration for several literary and cinematic pieces, including John Berendt's 1994 best-selling book, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. 

Many cities and towns with a heavy Civil War history have some paranormal claim, and Gettysburg is no exception. The site of one of the most famous Civil War battles is renowned for its ghost stories, paranormal activity, and inexplicable occurrences. Many visitors to Gettysburg report seeing the apparitions of Civil War soldiers and even hearing the faint sounds of battle. One of the most famous ghost stories of Gettysburg is the Lady in White, a widow dressed in a flowing white dress who roams the battlefield under the moonlight searching for her husband.

There are plenty of Gettysburg ghost stories to keep you up at night. Even outside of the battleground, the town of Gettysburg seems to be overflowing with paranormal activity.

Located high in the mountains of Colorado, St. Elmo was founded in 1880 and flourished by 1890. At its peak, the town had five hotels, dancing halls, saloons, a newspaper, and 2,000 residents. Surrounded by some of the most successful gold and silver mines in the area and being a stop on the Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad, St. Elmo was poised for continued growth. Regretfully, the fate of mining towns is usually the same—when the mines dry up, people leave. 

Today. St. Elmo is considered to be one of the best-preserved ghost towns in the country (although a handful of people still live there). The sounds of a bustling town have been replaced with the sounds of chipmunks scurrying around (if you know, you know), yet the buildings remain a visible reminder of what once was. 

Though the ghost town is spooky enough, there is one prominent ghost story: Annabelle. Annabelle grew up in the town and even stayed behind as one of the last two remaining residents once the mines dried up (her brother was the other resident). Cut off from the outside world, Annabelle began to make some questionable decisions. She stopped bathing, stopped taking care of the buildings, and stopped cleaning… she just stopped caring.

She would wander around the town with a rifle at her side, filthy from her lack of hygiene, claiming she was protecting the town. She earned the nickname “Dirty Annie,” and both she and her brother were taken to a mental institution, but were released.  Annabelle passed away in a nursing home in 1960, though many have claimed to have seen her ghostly figure wander through the buildings of St. Elmo.  Perhaps she is protecting the town in the afterlife? 

Is anyone surprised that a town where Stephen King lived (pictured above) would have a ghost story or two? The city's connection to the famous author has undoubtedly contributed to Bangor's reputation for the paranormal. A few of the most haunted places in Bangor include the Bangor House Hotel, The Hill House, West Market Square, and The Lucerne Inn. You can even take a tour of many of the places that inspired King's stories and actual film locations. Even if you don't have a paranormal encounter, there are plenty of things to do in Bangor to keep you entertained.

Though you may have never heard of East Bethany before, you may have heard about the Rolling Hills Asylum that was built here. Originally called the Genesee County Poor Farm, this facility provided a home for orphans, widowed woman and their children, the disabled, mentally ill, and also minor criminals. Residents were called inmates, and had “chores” including everything from building coffins to raising farm animals. The facility operated from 1827 until 1974, though for its last 10 years, it transitioned into the Genesee County Nursing home.

Sharon Coyle purchased it in 2009. It operates as a museum and hosts many paranormal events and ghost tours. During spooky season, it is easily one of the most popular places in New York, and events sell out quickly. Visit the Rollings Hill Asylum website to learn more.

The best urban legend in South Carolina evokes a fear that many of us share: being buried alive.

A Mississippi town brings 'In the Heat of the Night' to life. With history and heart, it feels like stepping back in time.

Step into a Southern town with charm and secrets. Moss-draped streets and eerie vibes make it feel straight out of a vampire story.

Troy, Alabama feels like stepping back in time, where centuries-old homes and historic streets tell stories of the past. This small Southern town preserves its heritage while inviting visitors to experience history firsthand.

New Jersey officials and the state's top public transit authority are asking a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the parents of a teenager who died in 2015 after being struck by a passenger train.

The teen's death was ruled a suicide but has been questioned by the family for years.

The parents of Tiffany Valiante, who was struck by an NJ Transit train headed from Philadelphia to Atlantic City, sued the state and the commuter agency in July. They argued the teen's death was not fully investigated to rule out foul play.

Since her death in July 2015, her parents have continued to say their daughter may have been murdered. She died along a rail line in a rural area of South Jersey after attending a graduation party. 

In the latest lawsuit, the couple has claimed for the first time that the teen's death may have been a hate crime because she came out as a lesbian before her death.

The Valiantes filed their suit under the New Jersey Crime Victims' Bill of Rights, their attorney, Paul D'Amato, said at a news conference in July. The lawsuit names the State of New Jersey, NJ Transit, its police department and the state's Chief Medical Examiner's Office as defendants.

Two motions filed Thursday — by the state Attorney General's Office and lawyers for NJ Transit — are the first legal responses to the lawsuit. A judge is expected to rule on both dismissal motions in early November, court records show.

D'Amato did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday about the motions to dismiss the case.

New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Jacob Stockton argued in court papers that the teen's parents had already litigated their daughter's death investigation in a 2019 lawsuit. The attorney general's office did not immediately respond to an NJ Advance Media request for comment.

State officials also argued in court papers that the Atlantic County couple's suit does not fall under the Crime Victims' Bill of Rights, as the parents allege, but rather the New Jersey Civil Rights Act. The statute of limitations to sue under that act has expired, the attorney general's office said in court papers.

“Tiffany's parents now bring suit alleging that the ME's Office and New Jersey Transit Police failed to properly investigate her death and that there is evidence indicating that her death was not a suicide,” Stockton wrote in his motion. “However, they filed an essentially identical civil suit with this Court in 2019, which had been dismissed with prejudice in 2021.”

Attorneys for NJ Transit made similar arguments in their court filing, adding that the family's claims under the state's victims' bill of rights have “no private right of action.”

July's lawsuit was also the first time newly surfaced text messages from the teen's phone were used as evidence. Philadelphia-based Cornerstone Discovery reported recovering about 100,000 pieces of data.

Tiffany Valiante, a volleyball star at Oakcrest High School in Mays Landing, was nearing the start of college when she died. Authorities said after a party, she discarded her phone at the end of her driveway, hiking more than four miles at night to the train tracks. Her parents saw no signs of distress suggesting the student-athlete would take her own life, they've said.

Tiffany Valiante's death was featured in an episode of the Netflix series “Unsolved Mysteries.”

The family has filed several lawsuits since the teen's death, including cases to obtain copies of investigative reports from NJ Transit Police and to have her official cause of death reclassified as undetermined.

TRAVERSE CITY — A Traverse City musician's work will be featured in an upcoming nationwide film release.

According to a Sept. 30 news release, Good Boy, a paranormal horror film with music composed by award-winning teacher and musician Sam Boase-Miller, is set to open in theaters Oct. 3. 

The movie is being distributed by Independent Film Company and Shudder.

The film, told from the perspective of Indy, a dog who can see supernatural forces, was shot over three years at a country home outside New York City. Director Ben Leonberg said his goal was to create a haunted house story from an entirely new viewpoint.

“When we set out to make Good Boy, I wanted to create a haunted house movie from an entirely new perspective,” Leonberg said. “That meant inventing a new method of filmmaking: one that allowed us to capture a singular canine performance without the benefit of a hero who can speak.”

The film premiered March 8 at the 2025 South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, where it sold out multiple screenings.

Boase-Miller, who graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy and is now the coordinator of the audio technology department at Northwestern Michigan College, composed the score using both cello and experimental instruments. Among them is the “Celloscillator,” an eight-string spinning zither he designed and built with his stepfather, Conrad Kaufman.

“Being able to watch the film with the creative team and an audience of hundreds reacting to it in real time made me fall in love with cinema all over again,” Boase-Miller said after the SXSW premiere.

A special screening with a live question-and-answer session with Boase-Miller is scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 2 at AMC Cherry Blossom 14 in Traverse City.

Jensen Ackles has gone from playing a Winchester brother to a Shaw brother!

The weeks are counting down until Tracker returns for Season 3 in the 2025 TV schedule, with a much smaller cast of series regulars this time around. On the plus side, Jensen Ackles is once again joining Justin Hartley as his on-screen brother, and he'll actually be around for more episodes than I expected. As the show hypes the upcoming return on social media, I'm not even a little bit surprised to see that Supernatural fans wasted no time in finding connections to Ackles' previous show.

Tracker will return with a two-part season premiere event spread across two weeks, with Jensen Ackles playing Russell Shaw in both. After news broke that he'd reunite with Justin Hartley for Season 3 after wrapping on Prime Video's Countdown, I'd assumed it would be another one-off like his appearances in each of the first two seasons. Instead, it appears that Colter will have his brother on hand in a big way to start out Season 3.

Whether that's because Russell is around to help or Russell is in need of help remains to be seen, but I'm on board with two episodes of Ackles opposite Hartley. (Both episodes with the Shaw brothers so far are available streaming with a Paramount+ subscription now.)

The first half of the premiere is called “The Process,” with CBS' logline revealing that Russell will join Colter to try and track down the missing wife and child of one of Reenie's clients in the wake of what he'd learned about his father's death at the end of Season 2. Whatever happens in “The Process” presumably won't go entirely according to plan, with the Shaw brothers racing to put an end to an underground operation in Part 2 of the premiere, called “Leverage.”

Tracker hasn't shied away from nodding to Jensen Ackles' fifteen seasons of Supernatural, with a bunch of Supernatural Easter eggs in just his first episode. Considering that Ackles celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Supernatural pilot almost exactly a month before the CBS show's Season 3 premiere, the timing couldn't be better for his time as Dean Winchester to be alluded to. Take a look at the video that had fans talking:

Admittedly, there's no moment in the preview that's as obvious as Russell climbing into an Impala or sleeping in a cheap motel room a la the Winchester brothers, but that didn't stop Supernatural fans from hitting the comment section to weigh in on the rock-paper-scissors moment.

A running joke from back in Jensen Ackles' CW days was that Dean almost always lost rock-paper-scissors because he almost always used scissors. Here are just some of the examples of Supernatural fans applying that lesson to Tracker in the Instagram comments (edited for clarity):

Tracker returns to CBS with the Season 3 premiere on Sunday, October 19 at 8 p.m. ET, followed by the second half of the story involving both Shaw brothers on October 26. You can revisit the first two seasons streaming on Paramount+ now, and if you're not in the mood to check out some Supernatural seasons, you can find all fifteen streaming with a Netflix subscription now.

            For the second time this year, FBI Director Kash Patel has stepped forward to correct claims about a MAGA conspiracy theory he once played a key role in promoting.
    


            For the second time this year, he could be fighting a losing battle.
    


            Months ago, it was Patel's sudden move to downplay the Jeffrey Epstein files. As a right-wing commentator, he had played up a massive supposed conspiracy that suggested the government was hiding others who were involved in Epstein's crimes, saying at one point, “Put on your big boy pants, and let us know who the pedophiles are.”
    


            But in May, as FBI director, he suddenly said the evidence showed there was nothing explosive in the files, angering the MAGA movement.
    


            We got something of a repeat this weekend after conservative media and President Donald Trump seized on leaked information that said 274 FBI agents were dispatched amid the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.
    


            They promptly butchered the information, though. They suggested it was evidence that the agents were “embedded” in the crowd beforehand – and even that the agents were the kinds of government provocateurs inciting rioters that MAGA has long baselessly theorized about.
    


            Trump quickly cast it in the most scandalous terms.
    


            “It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed … 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax,” Trump said on Truth Social on Saturday. He added that the agents were “probably acting as Agitators and Insurrectionists, but certainly not as ‘Law Enforcement Officials.'”
    


            But the information said nothing of the sort. A document obtained by the right-wing site Just The News instead said the 274 agents included those who had “responded” to the riot at the Capitol and to nearby threats like pipe bombs. (CNN has not confirmed the veracity of the document and has previously reported that no undercover FBI agents were at the Capitol on January 6, according to a DOJ watchdog, but that 26 paid FBI informants were in Washington, DC, that day.)
    


            And remarkably, Patel himself stepped forward to offer a corrective to the president. He emphasized that the agents were called in afterward.
    


            “Agents were sent into a crowd control mission after the riot was declared by Metro Police …” Patel told Fox News Digital on Saturday.
    


            He later promoted the story on X, again emphasizing these agents were responding to the attack – not being there “prior to” it.
    


            He said that “274 FBI agents were thrown into crowd control on Jan 6.”
    


            It was a pretty remarkable moment. Here was a president building up this document as proof of his long-running claims about a massive government false flag. He was joined by many of the most conspiratorial voices in the MAGA movement.
    


            But almost immediately, his own appointed FBI director – a loyalist if there ever was one – stepped forward and completely undermined it.
    


            Patel made a point to argue that there was still something amiss with the FBI sending agents to respond to the attack. (He repeatedly said that went against FBI “standards.”) But the real point is that he was saying, contra Trump and others, that these agents were not “secretly placed” in the crowds beforehand to act as agitators.
    


            And it's all the more remarkable given Patel's own history with this particular conspiracy theory.
    


            In his 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” Patel claimed there were “strange agitators” at the Capitol on January 6. He said they had “stirred up the crowd to breach the Capitol beforehand.” He cited “instigators being ignored by the FBI.”
    


            “All the signs of a cover-up are on full display …” Patel said.
    


            He  went even further on his podcast in November 2022, claiming the FBI had been “planning Jan. 6 for a year.” In September of that year, he suggested the FBI had entrapped rioters and that the FBI targeted January 6 “because they wanted a political target, a political prosecution, not one based on law and fact.”
    


            Patel often focused on the theory that the FBI planted confidential human sources in the crowd rather than FBI agents. But at one point, he took issue with an FBI official who didn't directly respond when asked if federal agents were involved with January 6.
    


            “If the answer was no, she would have said so,” Patel said.
    


            (In fact, the witness said she resisted answering in order not to divulge FBI “sources and methods.”)
    


            As with the Epstein files, it's extremely telling that a man so steeped in these conspiracy theories would see fit to correct them when he's actually got the evidence at his fingertips. These theories are often built on innuendo, speculation and misinformation. And here is a case in point.
    


            But as with the Epstein files, it's clear even Patel  can only do so much.
    


            Despite the FBI director's corrective on Saturday night, some MAGA voices have gone right along claiming the new evidence is a bombshell.
    


            Appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson still spoke as if FBI could have been involved in spurring the attack.
    


            “Apparently, there were 274 FBI agents in the crowd on January 6,” the Louisiana Republican said.
    


            Even as CNN's Jake Tapper noted that Patel had said the agents came after the riot started and said it wasn't evidence of a “false flag,” Johnson was undeterred.
    


            “How do you know that? There's a lot of questions,” Johnson said, adding: “Did they spur on the crowd? Did they open the gates to allow them in? I don't know. These are questions, but they should be answered.”
    


            Prominent conservative leader Matt Schlapp went on Newsmax and cited “300 undercover FBI agents in the January 6 crowd.”
    


            GOP Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri claimed Monday on X that the new evidence showed the “FBI had over 270 plainclothes agents embedded in the J6 crowd.”
    


            And even Trump in an interview with NBC News on Sunday suggested there was still something amiss with the 274 agents.
    


            “Don't forget, we just found out about all of these FBI agents being there,” the president  said.
    


            He  didn't repeat his claim that the agents were there beforehand or that they might have instigated the riot. But Trump – who faced a second impeachment over his own role in January 6 — is clearly not done casting this as somehow suspicious.
    


            If nothing else, Patel's move to correct this misinformation will provide a counterpoint to anybody – including Trump – who brings this up in the future.
    


            But the whole thing also shows how the conspiracy theories he once trafficked can be hard to kill.
