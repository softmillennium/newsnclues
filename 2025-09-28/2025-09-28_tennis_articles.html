                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to hold off Leylah Fernandez's valiant comeback attempt in the China Open third round. Coco Gauff's title defense at the China Open remains alive -- but only after fending off a formidable challenge from Leylah Fernandez. Gauff had not dropped a set to Fernandez in two previous professional encounters, both on hard courts, and one junior meeting. Those matches had been characterized by the Canadian's inability to maintain the offensive level needed to hit through Gauff for an entire set. That changed on Diamond Court, where Fernandez produced nearly three hours of high-quality, front-foot tennis. At times, she gave Gauff a taste of her own medicine with remarkable defense. After a knife-edge start to the third set which saw five consecutive service breaks, she pulled away -- and then, despite Fernandez pegging her back and threatening to pull off a remarkable comeback, Gauff held her nerve in the final two games of the match. 15 seed came from a set and 3-1 down to defeat qualifier Priscilla Hon 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. Fernandez had her moments of brilliance, but Gauff was able to lock in during the longer exchanges and the most important points. She broke Fernandez for 3-2 lead after turning defense into attack over a 20-stroke rally, finishing with a sharply angled smash. Though a pair of double faults allowed Fernandez to level at 4-4, Gauff responded immediately, reclaiming the lead with another spell of brilliant defense that drew a netted drive volley. Fernandez kept coming, though, and took advantage of Gauff's first serve percentage dropping from 75% to 53% in the second set. Gauff broke through with the first hold of serve for 4-2, sealing it with the best point of the match -- another astonishing feat of defense that saw her thread an angled forehand pass past Fernandez. But serving for the match at 5-2, Gauff sent a forehand long on match point -- sparking another thrilling resurgence from Fernandez. As Gauff's double fault tally rose to nine and her play grew passive, the 2021 US Open finalist seemed to have all the momentum to snatch her first ever win in their rivalry. But at 5-5, a familiar dynamic came into play again. Serving for the match for a third time, Gauff made no mistake, with a bold serve-and-volley play sealing her third match point. "I thought she was being aggressive, striking the ball pretty well. She wasn't really giving me much free points either. I think in that 3-2 game on those break points, I should have put the ball deeper and maybe tried to get her to open up the court. "The conditions were so slow, which I feel like she does well with that because she likes to take the ball so early. So I felt like my heaviness wasn't doing a lot with her as the balls got older. Coco Gauff needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to hold off Leylah Fernandez's valiant comeback attempt in the China Open third round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz maintained his seamless debut campaign at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships on Sunday, where he eased past Brandon Nakashima to reach the last four. With his Tour-leading 65th match win of the season, the 22-year-old Alcaraz equalled his personal-best tally in a single season (set in 2023). A forehand from another planet 🚀@carlosalcaraz | @japanopentennis | #kinoshitajotennis pic.twitter.com/wcPkNSnL0d “It's special because it's the first time I am playing here in Japan and here in Tokyo, so to reach the semi-finals in my first appearance is something great.” Even after some of the sublime shotmaking Alcaraz produced in a classy opening-set performance, the Spaniard arguably saved his best for last inside Ariake Coliseum. Having let slip three match points on return at 5-3 in the second set, he reeled off four consecutive winners in the next game to wrap his win with a flourish. “I always say that closing a match is difficult. “Losing that game, I thought it was going to be really difficult, but I just tried to maintain my focus and play some great points in the last game. Watch: Alcaraz's Four Consecutive Winners To Wrap Tokyo QF Win: Now 50-3 since April, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz will take on Casper Ruud for a spot in the championship match. The fourth-seeded Norwegian earlier raced to a 6-3, 6-2 victory against Aleksandar Vukic. “Probably [it's the best period of my career]. “I'm just trying to set up goals before matches, before tournaments, and trying to follow those goals. I think that helps me a lot to play great tennis and maintain the focus during the match.” Alcaraz leads Ruud 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with one of those victories coming in the 2022 US Open final. Yet the Norwegian triumphed in straight sets in the pair's most recent meeting, at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals, and he produced a commanding quarter-final win of his own in Tokyo, where he needed just 58 minutes to sink qualifier Vukic. 86 Brooksby notched a 6-3, 6-3 upset of third seed Holger Rune to seal his semi-final spot. With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against Rune, the 24-year-old Brooksby improved to 9-1 in ATP Tour quarter-finals.

Meanwhile, Rune had 15 more unforced errors (35) than winners (20).The two were playing each other for the first time. "I thought I had a pretty good plan on him coming out here," Brooksby said.
