                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump warned Sunday of widespread layoffs if the federal government shuts down this week, telling NBC News that "we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis." "[I'd] rather not do that," he told NBC News in an exclusive interview. The White House is doubling down on warnings that thousands of government jobs could be on the line if the government shuts down at midnight on Tuesday. The Trump administration last week told federal agencies to begin preparing for mass firings if Congress does not agree to a deal to avert a shutdown. If the White House follows through on its threat, it would mark a break from precedent, as federal employees are typically furloughed in such cases. When there was a full government shutdown in 2013, for instance, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The warning of potential mass firings — which was made via a memo released by the Office of Management and Budget — marked a significant escalation of pressure on congressional lawmakers to head off a shutdown. Still, with less than three days until the government funding deadline, lawmakers remain far apart on negotiations, increasing the chances of a shutdown. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service before apparently setting the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring several others before police shot him, authorities said Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a 40-year-old man rammed a pickup truck through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Police believe he "deliberately" set the building on fire. Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out. First responders were then sifting through the wreckage. Police initially said that nine people were injured. When Renye later announced that one additional person had died from a gunshot wound at a hospital, he did not say whether that person had been included in the number of injured. Police said they did not yet have a motive for the fire or shooting. Investigators are searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church. President Donald Trump said he was briefed on the shooting. In a social media post, he applauded the FBI, which local authorities said is sending 100 agents to the area, for responding. "PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!" It is in Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint. "Although we are two separate governmental units, we are a very cohesive community," said city of Grand Blanc Mayor John Creasey. "This sort of thing is painful for our entire community. I'm struggling to digest all that has happened, and my heart goes out to all of the affected families." Timothy Jones, 48, said his family is part of another Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation, or ward, about 15 minutes away, but that his children were at the Grand Blanc Township ward the night before the shooting for a youth fall festival. He and his family moved to Flint two years ago in large part because of how strong the faith's community is in the area. As people in his congregation got word of the shooting from texts and phone calls during their own Sunday service, the church went into lockdown and police came as a precaution, he said. Sundays are "supposed to be a time of peace and a time of reflection and worship," Jones said. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart was breaking for the community. "Violence anywhere especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable," she said. The next president is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol. "The church is in communication with local law enforcement as the investigation continues and as we receive updates on the condition of those affected," Doug Anderson, a spokesperson for Utah-based faith said in a statement. Some striking nurses at nearby Henry Ford Hospital left the picket line and ran the short distance to the church to help first responders, Teamsters Local 332 President Dan Glass said.

Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a four-door pickup with two American flags in the truck bed through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Investigators believe he "deliberately" set the building on fire, Renye said. Officers responded to a 911 call and were at the church within 30 seconds, Renye said. They killed the shooter about seven minutes later. Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out. Renye identified the suspect as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from neighboring Burton. Renye said one of the wounded people was in critical condition and seven others were stable. Investigators were searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said he is optimistic about the future of TikTok in the U.S. "I feel very confident that we have successfully separated this company from TikTok global and actually made it so that we can control people's data security," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "We can ensure that the algorithm is not being used as a propaganda tool by a foreign government." The popular social media platform has long faced concerns about its data collection practices and parent company ByteDance's relationship with the Chinese government. After months of uncertainty following former President Joe Biden's signing of a national security law effectively banning TikTok from U.S. app stores, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday approving a proposal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the country. Under the terms of Trump's executive order, a new joint-venture company would oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. Among the company's investors would be tech giant Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund. ByteDance investors, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna, and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok U.S. entity. According to the deal, the federal government would not take an equity stake — or a so-called golden share — in TikTok's U.S. operations. "This is not something where the Chinese or any Chinese entity has a large stake of the table." So far, ByteDance has not acknowledged Trump's executive order, nor has it confirmed that the transaction is actually taking place. There has also been no indication that the Chinese government has made any changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to occur.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As congressional Democrats push to tie extending Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies to the government funding fight, Republican leaders say they're willing to debate the issue — but not until after a shutdown is averted. His comments were echoed by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who called the ACA, also known as Obamacare, a program "in desperate need of reform." "We acknowledge that there's gonna have to be — hopefully there'll be some steps taken that can address the concerns that Democrats have," he said on NBC News' "Meet the Press." "But you can't do this by Tuesday." Their comments threw cold water on Democrats' main sticking point just days before the government is poised to shut down. If the ACA tax credits expire at the end of the year, premiums could soar for millions of Americans, a reality that could prove to be a political vulnerability for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. With the budget funding deadline looming, President Donald Trump is poised to meet on Monday with the top four congressional leaders — Johnson, Thune, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. It remains unclear whether the 11th-hour meeting will yield a deal that averts a shutdown on Tuesday at midnight. "[Trump] wants to talk with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and just try to convince them to follow common sense and do what's right by the American people," Speaker Johnson said Sunday. Schumer, for his part, said that the prospect of a government shutdown "depends on the Republicans." We need a serious negotiation," Schumer said on NBC News' "Meet the Press." Democrats have repeatedly insisted that any government funding proposal include an extension of the Obamacare tax credits. They remained firm with their demands on Sunday. "We actually need to enact legislation to ensure that the Affordable Care Act tax credits are extended," Jeffries said, warning that "notices" are set to begin going out for the millions of Americans who rely on the subsidies. Republicans, however, argue that there is still time to hammer out a deal on the subsidies. Republicans in the Senate need eight Democrats to vote with them to pass their continuing resolution through the upper chamber, Thune said, a prospect that, at this point, seems difficult.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Struggling to stay on top of your money is not a unique problem. But neurodivergent people — such as those with autism or ADHD — can face a unique set of challenges when managing their finances, says Andrea Ewalefo, founder of Modern Lady Vibes, a financial coaching business specializing in neurodivergent women of color. One of these challenges is something called executive dysfunction. "Time blindness is another one, you get caught up in certain experiences. For neurodivergent folks, "we struggle with not only getting the systems set up, but sticking to them, or getting emotionally invested in them." Ewalefo knows that no two people have the exact same concerns when it comes to money, and tries to meet clients where they are. Her advice for nearly all of them: "Don't beat yourself up." And whenever possible, try to automate and delegate the financial tasks that drain you the most, so you can focus more on achieving your money goals. For some neurodivergent people, the "spoon theory," can serve as a useful metaphor for a daily store of energy that's depleted by doing tasks. "Brushing your teeth — things that neurotypical people just wake up and do — we have to consciously think about, and it uses our energy, our spoons," Ewalefo says. "This morning brushing my teeth might take ten spoons. For many of Ewalefo's clients, the first step to getting on track financially is about taking money-related spoons off the table. "If we can remove as much decision fatigue as possible, particularly within our financial planning, then that can help preserve our energy to do other things," she says. Ewalefo recommends setting your bill due dates to align with the days you get paid. "Since it's happening right when you get that paycheck, once your bills are paid, everything left is just free spending money," she says. "Now have the freedom to enjoy your impulse buying without worrying about the fact that, oh no, I just spent my car payment." What's more, setting rote financial tasks on autopilot can allow you to dedicate more of your mental energy to the money goals you really care about. To make progress on those, she says, you'll also have to pay yourself from each check — and that can be put on autopilot, too. "And all of that money has been set aside and put where it needs to go, so whatever is left in your account can literally just be spent on whatever you want."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I had spent more than a decade dreaming, trying, and failing to make Spain home. Since then, I've built a life in Spain and created She Hit Refresh, where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad. Along the way, I've experienced moments when my life in Europe felt like a movie. But these moments aren't everyday life, and not everything about moving abroad is just as you imagine it to be. Here are the six myths I hear most often about relocating. Many countries can feel more affordable than the U.S., but living abroad is probably not as cheap as you think. Costs are rising around the world, especially housing prices. House prices in the EU went up 57.9% between 2010 and the first quarter of 2025, while rents increased by 27.8%. My advice: Run the numbers based on today's reality, not outdated blog posts. And remember, what feels affordable to you on a U.S. salary may still be unaffordable for locals. And while anti-tourism sentiment exists in crowded cities, it's not really about Americans, or even expats at all. But smaller towns across Europe want new residents due to depopulation. If you're serious about integrating, consider looking beyond hotspots like Lisbon, Barcelona, or Amsterdam. Regardless, in my own experience, when you learn the language, contribute, and connect, you'll usually be welcomed with open arms. Of course you'll miss family and friends, but community abroad often forms faster than you'd expect. Other Americans and English-speaking foreigners are eager to connect. Between meetups, language exchanges, and expat events, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to meet people. I'm an extrovert, and it still took me around 2.5 years to feel like I had a strong community in Madrid. Learning the language is essential, and it takes time. Most people are still beginners after a year. Living abroad can absolutely improve your quality of life — whether it's a slower pace, a relatively lower cost of living, or easier travel, there's a lot to love. You'll still deal with bureaucracy, taxes, and logistics like finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, and making appointments with doctors. And sometimes the grocery store will just be closed on a Sunday when you need it most. I learned then that the highs and lows of life still happen abroad, and the lows are tougher when you're far from home. Cindy Sheahan, for example, moved to Porto, Portugal, but then decided Italy was a better fit and relocated there a year later. Giving yourself permission to pivot can help you avoid getting stuck in research paralysis, trying to make the "perfect" choice before you even start. At the time, I only knew of students and retirees moving abroad, not people in the middle of their careers. But at 45, I can say without hesitation that it was the best decision I've ever made. And once I got here, I met so many people my age and older who had done the same. People make the leap at every age — 30s, 40s, 50s, even 70s. In fact, moving in your 30s or later has advantages, since people tend to arrive with more financial stability, better self-awareness, and the wisdom to navigate challenges with perspective.

An American's Ultimate Visa Guide to Living in Europe" and host of the She Hit Refresh podcast. As the daughter of Colombian and Iranian immigrants, Cepee grew up in Houston, Texas, before becoming an immigrant herself in Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the summer of 2024, a group of women in the Minneapolis area learned that a male friend used their Facebook photos mixed with artificial intelligence to create sexualized images and videos. As a CNBC investigation shows, the rise of "nudify" apps and sites has made it easier than ever for people to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes. Experts said these services are all over the Internet, with many being promoted via Facebook ads, available for download on the Apple and Google app stores and easily accessed using simple web searches. "That's the reality of where the technology is right now, and that means that any person can really be victimized," said Haley McNamara, senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. CNBC's reporting shines a light on the legal quagmire surrounding AI, and how a group of friends became key figures in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated porn. "He did not break any laws that we're aware of," said Molly Kelley, one of the Minnesota victims and a law student. Now, Kelley and the women are advocating for a local bill in their state, proposed by Democratic state Senator Erin Maye Quade, intended to block nudify services in Minnesota. Maye Quade said the bill is reminiscent of laws that prohibit peeping into windows to snap explicit photos without consent. "We just haven't grappled with the emergence of AI technology in the same way," Maye Quade said in an interview with CNBC, referring to the speed of AI development. Jessica Guistolise, one of the Minnesota victims, said she continues to suffer from panic and anxiety stemming from the incident last year. "I heard that camera click, and I was quite literally in the darkest corners of the internet," Guistolise said. Mary Anne Franks, professor at the George Washington University Law School, compared the experience to the feelings victims describe when talking about so-called revenge porn, or the posting of a person's sexual photos and videos online, often by a former romantic partner. "It makes you feel like you don't own your own body, that you'll never be able to take back your own identity," said Franks, who is also president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to combating online abuse and discrimination. Less than a decade ago, a person would need to be an AI expert to make explicit deepfakes. Thanks to nudifier services, all that's required is an internet connection and a Facebook photo. Researchers said new AI models have helped usher in a wave of nudify services. The models are often bundled within easy-to-use apps, so that people lacking technical skills can create the content. And while nudify services can contain disclaimers about obtaining consent, it's unclear whether there is any enforcement mechanism. Additionally, many nudify sites market themselves simply as so-called face-swapping tools. "There are apps that present as playful and they are actually primarily meant as pornographic in purpose," said Alexios Mantzarlis, an AI security expert at Cornell Tech. The site that was used to create the content is called DeepSwap, and there's not much information about it online. In a press release published in July, DeepSwap used a Hong Kong dateline and included a quote from Penyne Wu, who was identified in the release as CEO and co-founder. CNBC was unable to find information online about Wu, and sent multiple emails to the address provided for Banks, but received no response. DeepSwap's website currently lists "MINDSPARK AI LIMITED" as its company name, provides an address in Dublin, and states that its terms of service are "governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland." However, in July, the same DeepSwap page had no mention of Mindspark, and references to Ireland instead said Hong Kong. Maye Quade's bill, which is still being considered, would fine tech companies that offer nudify services $500,000 for every nonconsensual, explicit deepfake that they generate in the state of Minnesota.Some experts are concerned, however, that the Trump administration's plans to bolster the AI sector will undercut states' efforts. In late July, Trump signed executive orders as part of the White House's AI Action Plan, underscoring AI development as a "national security imperative." "I'm concerned that we will continue to be left behind and sacrificed at the altar of trying to have some geopolitical race for powerful AI," Kelley said.WATCH: The alarming rise of AI 'nudify' apps that create explicit images of real people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, several companies are well-positioned to deliver strong returns to investors from rapid technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. To pick attractive stocks with strong prospects, investors can track top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on in-depth research and analysis of a company's financials and growth drivers. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start with semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has strengthened its dominant position through continued innovation and strategic deals, such as the recently announced $5 billion investment in Intel and massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Following a conversation with Nvidia's CFO on the OpenAI deal, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a buy rating on NVDA, saying the chip company is the "AI ecosystem of choice, not just with its CUDA software stack, but also with its connectivity solution, NVLink, which we think is poised to become a de facto standard." The top-rated analyst increased his price target on Nvidia to $225 from $214 and said that Nvidia remains a top pick for Evercore. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204. Highlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout. Lipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Next is database management software company MongoDB (MDB). The company recently held a MongoDB.local event in New York City, hosting an Investor Session focused on profitable growth and providing a 3- to 5-year financial framework. Following the event, Needham analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB and increased his price target to $365 from $325. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an "outperform" rating and a price target of $355. Cikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB. The 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies. Cikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is "incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning," driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models. Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) is this week's third pick. The cloud-native platform offers security solutions for critical areas of enterprise risk — endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data. Following CrowdStrike's recently held Fal.Con 2025 event, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a 12-month price target of $510, saying the commentary from management, partners and customers reinforced his bullish long-term thesis. CrowdStrike remains one of RBC's top cybersecurity ideas, he added. The 5-star analyst mainly noted lucrative prospects in agentic security for CrowdStrike and the evolution of its agentic security operations center (SOC). He added that management views the agentic revolution as a huge opportunity (potentially over a 100x), with the rise of more identities and complexity creating new security needs. Management sees a total addressable market (TAM) of $300 billion in 2030, up from $140 billion in 2026, with key tailwinds resulting from market consolidation, the evolving threat landscape and technological advancements. Helped by these tailwinds, Hedberg believes CrowdStrike is well-positioned for continued market consolidation as it secures an AI-led transformation. Hedberg noted that CrowdStrike is about halfway through its $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal for fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike expects Agentic Everywhere to be the key driver for the newly introduced $20 billion ARR target for fiscal 2036. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration needs to strike multiple deals with U.S. miners to secure the nation's supply chain against China, said Mark Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels, a miner focused on uranium and rare earth minerals. But it was a necessary step that the White House should now follow with more deals to diversify the U.S. supply chain and reduce the risk that would come with backing a single national champion, the CEO said. "One company doesn't fix it," Chalmers said of the MP Materials deal. "You have to have multiple deals to ensure that you don't just have the company risk, because all companies aren't going to deliver." The White House is "not ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn't mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal," a Trump administration official told CNBC. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said. "We've seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market — and something needed to give," Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC. Energy Fuels' stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. Critical mineral miner NioCorp Developments is also up almost 200%, Ramaco Resources has gained 140%, and USA Rare Earth is up more than 70%. MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said. Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said. "The government cannot bet on one horse — it just doesn't make sense," Chalmers said. "We spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy," he said. Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications. Lithium Americas stock surged more than 90% this week on news of the potential government stake. Albemarle, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest lithium producers in the world. "What you want to do is move the market such that private industry can invest behind it," Masters told CNBC in July, pointing to Apple's offtake agreement with MP just days after the Defense Department deal. Price support from the federal government "sends a true market signal that these investments are long term, that they are here to stay," the National Mining Association's Nolan said. Under the MP deal, the Pentagon set a price floor of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, a key input in rare-earth magnets. The deal signals that "there is a way to break free of China's artificially suppressed pricing," he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Computer science went from a future-proof career to an industry in upheaval in a shockingly small amount of time. "For people like your son, by the way, who four years ago were promised, go study computer science, it's going to be a great career. It is future-proof — that changed in four years," UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid said during a recent episode of Nova's "Particles of Thought" podcast. It's too easy to just blame AI, though, Farid said. "Something is happening in the industry," he said. "I think it's a confluence of many things. Farid and the host, astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi, discussed how Oluseyi's son, a senior studying computer science, is struggling to find a job. "Our students typically had five internship offers throughout their first four years of college," Farid said. "They would graduate with exceedingly high salaries, multiple offers. The rise of vibecoding and AI's ability to create software by itself has only exacerbated these concerns. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor has said that students learn concepts in computer science that go beyond mere coding languages. Farid, one of the world's experts on deepfake videos, said he is often asked for advice. "What I used to tell people is you want a broad education," Farid said. Now, I think I'm telling people to be good at a lot of different things because we don't know what the future holds." Like many in the AI space, Farid said that those who use breakthrough technologies will outlast those who don't. "I don't think AI is going to put lawyers out of business, but I think lawyers who use AI will put those who don't use AI out of business," he said. "And I think you can say that about every profession."</p>
