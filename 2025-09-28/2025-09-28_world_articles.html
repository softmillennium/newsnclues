                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• At least two people were killed and eight others were wounded today in a shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, police said. Police believe they may still find victims in the burned-out building. • Officers exchanged fire with the gunman and killed him, according to police. • Grand Blanc is a suburb of Flint, Michigan, and is about an hour's drive north of Detroit. Authorities are currently working to determine whether additional victims may be inside after this morning's deadly attack. Earlier, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said they believe the suspect “deliberately” set fire to the church. The police chief said investigators are “still trying to determine exactly when and where that fire ended up coming from and how it got started.” He added that police believe more people were “near the fire and they were unable to get out of the church.” CNN's Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this post. It took police less than a minute to respond to this morning's shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, according to police. Within 10 minutes, the suspected shooter was dead. “That call came out at 10:25 a.m. and 32 seconds,” Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said in a news conference. “We had officers on scene at 10:25 and 57 seconds.” Authorities said they will hold their next news conference at 8 p.m. Two people were killed and multiple were wounded after 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford opened fire on congregants at the church, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye confirmed. Authorities believe Sanford intentionally started a fire at the church as well, he said. One of the 8 victims injured in Sunday's attack is in critical condition, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye identified the suspect in today's fatal attack at The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford. Authorities are holding a news conference about the deadly shooting and fire that occurred at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan. We'll have more posts with the latest information soon. Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, where a gunman attacked congregants at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is located outside Flint and is about an hour from Detroit by car. At least two people have died and multiple people are wounded after a 40-year-old man rammed his car into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, this morning before opening fire on worshippers and setting the building ablaze, authorities said. Here's what else we know so far about the shooting and fire: The gunman: Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye identified the suspect as a 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan. Two officers were involved in a shootout and killed the suspect, he said, and police believe there is only one person involved. Children are among those hurt, a source familiar with the incident told CNN. “He then exited his vehicle firing several rounds at individuals within the church,” Renye said. The police chief said investigators are “still trying to determine exactly when and where that fire ended up coming from and how it got started.” He added they believe more people were “near the fire and they were unable to get out of the church.” The fire has since been extinguished. The investigation:  Authorities will execute a search warrant at the suspect's residence and go through cell phone records to “find out if there was a motive,” Renye said. The police chief said he will provide another update at 5 p.m. This post has been updated with the latest status on victims. Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye provided a phone number and location for those looking to reunify with family members following this morning's deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In a video posted to Facebook, Renye said those looking to reunify with family members can call this number:  248-705-7352. “That number will lead to you the Red Cross who is on scene over there at Trillium” where there are several people who were at the church when the incident took place and “they will be able to tell you where your family member is at,” the police chief said. Resources will also be available to the wider Grand Blanc community at the township's police department, he said. ET, counselors at the department will be on staff and available to talk to the community, Renye said. Another victim has died from a gunshot wound sustained during the Sunday shooting, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said in a video posted on Facebook. That brings the total death toll to at least two, after police previously said at least one person was killed. Extra law enforcement officers are being deployed to places of worship across Los Angeles and New York City following a deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, according to officials. Both the Los Angeles Police Department and the New York City Police Department are increasing patrols out of an abundance of caution, officials say. Just over a month ago, on August 27, a shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and wounding 14 others, as well as three elderly parishioners, as they prayed. As we continue to gather more reporting on the attack on a church in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, we are also awaiting an update from officials. Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said another media briefing would be held at 5 p.m. We'll bring you live updates on that news conference when it takes place. Authorities will execute a search warrant at the suspect's residence and go through cell phone records to “find out if there was a motive,” Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. The suspect, who Renye said was killed by police in a shootout at the church, has been identified as a 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan. “As you can imagine, there's a lot of witnesses that were within the church and that is a lot of witness information statements that we have to obtain,” he said. As of Sunday afternoon, there have been at least 324 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people – not counting the shooter – are shot. Sunday's attack at the church in Michigan followed another mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier: Overnight, a gunman opened fire on a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring at least eight others. Sunday's deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, is the latest attack on a house of worship in the United States. Minneapolis shooting: Just over a month ago, on August 27, a shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and wounding 14 others, as well as three elderly parishioners, as they prayed. Arson at Florida synagogue: On September 19, days before Rosh Hashanah, a 31-year-old man allegedly set fire to a synagogue in southwest Florida. The suspect was charged with arson and criminal mischief to a church, synagogue, mosque or religious article – both felonies. “We offer thanks to the emergency responders who are assisting victims and families.” Sunday service lasts for two hours as worshippers sing songs, pray and listen to sermons, according to the church's website, which says they are attended by adults and children from 18 months old and up.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After days of clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration jail in his home state of Illinois, Democratic US senator Dick Durbin on Sunday renewed demands to meet with Trump administration immigration officials. Durbin wrote on X that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) must be “accountable for its actions” amid the administration's “cruel immigration crackdown”. The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois. For the preceding few days, federal officials have arrested protesters at the Broadview facility as Ice operations have escalated in Illinois. Durbin, along with Illinois representative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, have been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions. According to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested. Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. Ice on Friday postponed that meeting “to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. In one video posted online on Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility. On Sunday afternoon, a CBS Chicago reporter posted on Instagram that an Ice official “took a direct shot” at her car, saying that the official deployed gas into her open window. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. “The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzker posted on X. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.” Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHS launched an operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. Despite DHS saying an officer was “seriously injured” by the immigrant before the shooting, video later released seemed to contradict DHS's claims. A recent court filing by immigrants rights groups has also claimed that US citizens have been rounded up during the immigration enforcement operations in the area. DHS says it launched Midway Blitz to target immigrants in the state, alleging that Pritzker and his “sanctuary policies” – a term meant to describe limitations on local police's cooperating with federal immigration agents – welcomed undocumented immigrants. The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden's presidency. Top DHS officials, in fact, instructed Ice to arrest at least 3,000 people daily throughout the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Saturday shared an apparently artificially created video of himself promoting a cure-all bed with origins in conspiratorial corners of the internet. The video, which has since been deleted, was intended to resemble a Fox News segment on the show hosted by the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, featured an AI version of Trump promising access to new medical technology. This segment has never aired on the network. “Every American will soon receive their own medbed card,” said the false rendering of Trump. The “medbed” conspiracy theory has spread during recent years in QAnon circles online. It is a modern manifestation of an older tradition of belief in quack doctors and miracle cures and is rooted in deep distrust of government and medical institutions. During America's UFO-spotting craze beginning in the early post-World War Two II period, conspiracy theories emerged that the US government had reverse-engineered technology from alien craft it had secretly retrieved to create advanced healing technologies. The QAnon conspiracy theory movement emerged in 2017, and some in those circles have long believed Trump would make available this supposed secret miracle-curing technology. “These facilities are safe, modern and designed to restore every citizen to full health and strength,” the false Trump said. “This is the beginning of a new era in American healthcare.” These vendors often make dubious and unproven promises about items they sell, like healing matts – bed-topper devices that are supposedly infused with magnetic and infrared technology.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian HIMARS rockets reportedly stuck a thermal power plant near the Russian city of Belgorod on Sept. 28, Russian Telegram media channels reported. Power outages were reported across Belgorod Oblast following the attack that struck one of the substations, Russian media reported. High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), with a range of around 70 kilometers, allow Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Sept. 17 that Ukraine will receive Patriot HIMARS missiles as part of a U.S. weapons aid package financed by NATO allies. Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the strike. The attack comes as Kyiv has intensified attacks against Russian oil, gas, and energy infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine. Situated across the border from Kharkiv Oblast, Belgorod serves as a regular target of Ukrainian strikes. Kyiv's strikes on Russia's oil sector have severely disrupted fuel supplies and logistics for Moscow's armed forces, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Sept. 25. According to the Financial Times, 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries have been struck by Ukrainian drones since August 2025. The disruptions have limited Russia's refining capacity by over 1 million barrels per day, the research group Energy Aspects told FT, dropping exports to below pre-war levels. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" of oil tankers are being used to "launch and control" Russian drones over European cities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 28, citing intelligence reports. U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28 that the U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles, as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by President Donald Trump. HUR claimed that an explosion rocked a guarded military base on the airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and at least four operators who were allegedly inside the vehicle. The new sightings come after several media outlets reported unidentified drones being detected in the airspace of Denmark, Lithuania, and Finland on Sept. 27. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers U.S. President Donald Trump's shift in rhetoric after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, including his support for NATO allies shooting down Russian jets entering the alliance's airspace. At least 38 people in the city have been injured, including three children. Lavrov claimed that the upcoming meeting with Rubio is intended to eliminate what he claimed were "irritants" in Washington-Moscow relations. All eyes in the EU, Ukraine, and Russia are on Chisinau today as Moldova began parliamentary elections that could leave the landlocked country U-turning from its path to join the bloc one day and build closer ties with Moscow. Moldovans head to the polls on Sept. 28 for a pivotal parliamentary vote that could potentially derail Chisinau from its path to accession in the European Union.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28 that the U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles, as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by President Donald Trump. "I know we're having conversations this very minute about the issue," Vance continued. Ukraine has repeatedly appealed to Washington for long-range strike capabilities throughout the war, but the United States has so far declined to provide such weapons. Zelensky told Trump that the advanced weapons system could help pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into negotiations for a peace deal, according to multiple sources cited by the Telegraph. Vance on Sept. 28 acknowledge frustration within the White House amid Moscow's reluctance to attend leader-level peace talks. Following his meeting with Zelensky on Sept. 23 in New York, Trump wrote on Truth Social that "Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form." "The Russians are not gaining a lot. This war is terrible for their economy, and they have to ask themselves how many more people are they going to have to lose and how many more people are they going to have to kill for very little military advantage," the U.S. vice president added in his interview. In recent weeks, Trump has overseen a new NATO-financed program to supply U.S. weapons to Ukraine under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, with initial aid packages including Patriot air defenses and HIMARS rocket systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president reverses course days after scrapping meeting to discuss crisis with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown, the House speaker and the US president's fellow Republican Mike Johnson said on Sunday. Johnson, appearing on CNN, said he spoke with Trump at length on Saturday, and that the two Democrats had agreed to join him and John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, for an Oval Office discussion Monday. Schumer, talking to NBC's Meet the Press, said he was “hopeful we can get something real done” – but was uncertain of the mood they would find Trump in when they sat down for the 2pm ET discourse. We hope that they sit down and have a serious negotiation with us.” The network's chief national correspondent, Robert Costa, told Face the Nation he spoke with Trump by phone Sunday morning and that a government shutdown “looks likely at this point based on my conversation … He says both sides are at a stalemate.” Costa said: “Inside the White House, sources are saying president Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse.” Republican and Democratic leaders have been pointing fingers of blame at each other for days as Tuesday's deadline for a funding agreement approaches. “If we don't extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, more than 20 million Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, deductibles, in an environment where the cost of living in America is already too high,” Jeffries told CNN on Sunday. “We've made clear that we're ready, willing and able to sit down with anyone, at any time and at any place, in order to make sure that we can actually fund the government, avoid a painful Republican caused shutdown, and address the healthcare crisis that Republicans have caused that's [affecting] everyday Americans.” But Trump and Republicans have repeatedly accused their political opponents of exploiting the issue to force a shutdown while there was still plenty of time to fix healthcare before the subsidies expire on 31 December. We didn't add a single partisan priority or policy rider at all. We're operating completely in good faith to get more time.” But US senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has previously urged his party leadership to be stronger in standing up to the Trump administration, said the problem was Republicans handing “a complete blank check” to the president to spend money on his own political interests, and not those of the nation. “Until now the president has said he'd rather shut down the government than prevent those healthcare costs from spiking,” he told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Breaking through the noise of the self-help industry, neuroscientist Rachel Barr‘s new book How to Make Your Brain Your Best Friend, roots its advice in science (the bibliography section alone is more than 40 pages). Holding a master's degree in molecular neuroscience, Barr wrote the book while completing her PhD in the electrophysiology of memory and sleep. She has been demystifying the connections between the brain and mental health on TikTok and Instagram, with viral videos such as Why the Brain needs Screen Breaks and Five Tips to Improve Memory from a Neuroscientist that offer helpful, research-based habits for a happier day-to-day life. She takes a more personal touch in her book, sharing stories about her battles with loneliness and the loss of her mother to suicide, which help emphasize why a better understanding of the brain is meaningful to the author. Recently The Globe and Mail spoke with the Quebec-based neuroscientist about how, with more knowledge about our brain's patterns and habits, we can start making informed decisions on our recurring choices. Can you talk about your neuroscience background and how that's also a through-line for the book? And I felt the need to reorient that conversation. Not only to drag it back from the clutches of capitalism but also to put that knowledge and understanding back into the mix. So it's important that mental health conversations – personal growth conversations, sorting out a happy life – have to be constructed upon a foundation of what does the brain need? Where does brain science and typical mental health advice differ the most? One of the key tensions, I think, is this persistent idea in wellness and person. We're asking our brains to do far more than they evolved to do, in an informational environment that's louder and more demanding than ever before in human history. Many of the symptoms we're now collectively struggling with – chronic fatigue, burnout, anxiety – are entirely consistent with an overtaxed system, not an under-optimized one. So when the advice we get is to push harder, wake earlier, tolerate more discomfort, this often pulls us further from what we need. What moves the needle is reducing the actual load and restoring the conditions brains evolved to function under: adequate sleep, connection, protected periods of single-tasked focus, delight, creative play, real rest. Five tips to fight distractions and stay focused Capital extraction comes in different forms, broadly labour, attention and consumer spends. Most wellness content has to live inside an attention economy that rewards novelty, certainty and ongoing extraction. This book has a lot of personal anecdotes and scientific facts. The book has a philosophical edge as well. For some people, mental ill health is lifelong. I wanted to give readers reasons for living. Not just how to care for the brain in a basic biological sense, but also how to provide it with reasons to live, whether you're dealing with mental ill health or not. I'm not sure I really realized that at the time, but it's clear to me now that it was written for my mom. Things I wish I had been able to convince her of, that life is worth living and how to take care of her mind. I was reluctant to finish writing and send it off into the world, because that conversation is now over. But I'm trying to help people muddle through and take care of their brain and in such a way that they never reach that level of despair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has drawn attention to Telegram founder Pavel Durov's allegation that France had attempted to interfere in last year's Moldovan presidential elections. The US-based billionaire shared an X post by his fellow tech entrepreneur claiming French intelligence had requested that his platform censor certain channels ahead of last year's vote. Durov published his statement on Sunday as Moldovans were again heading to the polls to take part in the parliamentary vote. In his statement, the Telegram founder claimed that the intelligence agency had approached him last year, seeking his aid in censoring a number of channels ahead of the vote. Although some of the channels flagged by the spies did violate Telegram's rules and were removed, others were legitimate but expressed views unpopular with the French and Moldovan authorities, according to Durov. Durov was arrested at a Paris airport in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who holds a staunch pro-EU position, was re-elected in 2024 amid allegations of electoral irregularities, with opposition groups claiming that key votes came from the country's diaspora in the EU. Earlier, Durov made similar claims about French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally asking him to censor conservatives in Romania ahead of the presidential election rerun in May. Paris has vehemently denied the accusations. Musk voiced his support for the fellow tech entrepreneur at the time as well, by responding to his May remarks with a brief post: “Hear, hear!” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Writing on X on Sunday, Durov said the approach came about a year ago, while he was under judicial supervision in France following his arrest at a Paris airport. He claimed that intelligence services contacted him through an intermediary and asked Telegram to remove a number of Moldovan channels before a presidential vote. According to St Petersburg native Durov, Telegram did delete some flagged channels that clearly violated its own policies. But he said the intermediary later relayed a more troubling message: French intelligence had offered to “say good things” to the judge in charge of his case in exchange for wider cooperation. “This was unacceptable on several levels,” Durov wrote, adding that if the agency did contact the judge, it would amount to interference in the judicial process — and if it didn't, it meant exploiting his legal jeopardy to influence political developments abroad. Durov said that shortly afterward, Telegram received a second list of “problematic” Moldovan channels. Unlike the first batch, he insisted, nearly all of these accounts were legitimate and fully compliant with Telegram's rules. Their only common trait, he said, was that they voiced political positions disliked by the Moldovan and French governments. President Maia Sandu's pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) is facing off against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which campaigns for Moldova's constitutional neutrality and accuses the government of suppressing dissent. In recent weeks, election officials barred two opposition parties over alleged foreign funding, adding to a list that already included the banned Victory Bloc and the dissolved SOR Party. Commenting on Durov's claims, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the revelations confirmed what Moscow had long alleged. “The West operates without conscience on all fronts,” she said. He was later released on €5 million bail but placed under judicial supervision. He said the French attempt to link that case to Moldovan politics was “a pattern we have also observed elsewhere, including in Romania.” “Telegram is committed to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moldovan President Maia Sandu has not ruled out that the results of the current parliamentary elections may be annulled due to accusations of interference in the electoral process. "We know there was a great deal of interference, but the decisions on sanctions are taken by the competent authorities. We saw certain measures adopted by the Central Election Commission even this week," Sandu said after visiting a polling station, responding to a journalist's question about the risk of annulment due to alleged Russian meddling. The final decision on Greater Moldova still requires court approval. Earlier, Russian Ambassador to Chisinau Oleg Ozerov described the current election campaign in Moldova as the dirtiest he has ever encountered. Ozerov also stressed that the authorities' refusal to allow a number of foreign observers, including those from Russia, casts doubt on the fairness of the vote. Public opinion polls suggest that the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) could lose its majority in parliament. "Our Party" is also likely to enter parliament. Voting will conclude at 9 p.m. local time [6 p.m. GMT]. The elections will be considered valid if one-third of registered voters, more than 3.2 million people, participate.</p>

Tanzanian merchants cannot hope to match the low prices of the Chinese shops, Ms. Nyondo says in her small store in Dar es Salaam. “They import directly in bulk, while we rely on middlemen. But this small business is the only way we survive.” The mounting anger of Ms. Nyondo and thousands of other Tanzanian traders finally led to government action this year: a new regulation to ban foreigners from 15 economic sectors, mainly small businesses. It's part of a larger anti-Chinese backlash across the continent. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, local media have exposed environmental disasters caused by Chinese mining companies, including poisoned rivers and razed hillsides, provoking public outrage. In Ghana, authorities have arrested dozens of Chinese migrants, accusing them of illegal mining, a phenomenon that has led to deforestation, soil degradation and toxic river pollution. Several countries have taken the same step as Tanzania: promising stronger enforcement and regulations to crack down on Chinese activities. In Zimbabwe, where China has long been welcomed, the government has recently become more willing to criticize, with one official accusing the Chinese of bribery, illicit financial activities, evading the banking system and even desecrating graves. “We are noticing that some Chinese companies are digging up our ancestors' graves to extract granite or gold,” said Tafadzwa Muguti, secretary for presidential affairs in Zimbabwe's cabinet office, in a speech to a Chinese business forum. That is a deep sign of disrespect in any culture.” China unveils zero-tariff deal for Africa, capitalizing on Trump chaos By some estimates, anywhere from 700,000 to one million Chinese nationals are living in Africa today. Some are workers for Chinese companies, but many are traders, merchants or mining entrepreneurs who found China's business sectors too crowded and competitive – so they migrated to Africa instead. Another Chinese trader, Zhang Xinghao, sells brightly coloured plastic shoes from a stall in the market. “I came because friends told me business is good here,” she said. Many of the Chinese nationals living in Africa today are traders, merchants or mining entrepreneurs seeking a less competitive market.Imani Nsamila/The Globe and Mail Many Tanzanians are grateful for the Chinese businesses, seeing them as sources of employment and cheap prices. And some Chinese have quickly integrated by learning the local Swahili language. “They call me kaka [brother] just like anyone else.” Every square inch of space is claimed: wooden stalls crammed with second-hand jeans, fruit piled high in plastic containers, boxes of Chinese electronics spilling into the street. “Some of the Chinese are even hawking shoes or frying potato chips – jobs that should be done by Tanzanians,” said Severine Mushi, chairman of the traders group. “Let them work in large-scale manufacturing projects, where they can bring technology transfer. But don't let them open shops selling the same socks and cooking oil as our people. China's lithium plants generate jobs in Zimbabwe, but expansion is pushing some locals out of their homes Some Tanzanian traders allege that Chinese merchants use bribery for quick access to licences and permits. Elsewhere in the city, thousands of Chinese migrants have moved into an upscale suburb, Mikocheni, where they run everything from garages and car-wash stations to herbal clinics and restaurants. Tanzanian trader Salum Juma points to a stack of plastic chairs that have stood unsold for weeks. “Before the Chinese came, I could move a whole batch like this in two days,” he said. A shop called Chinese Citistore is popular among bargain-hunters. Almost everything – cosmetics, costume jewelry and beauty kits − is priced at 3,000 shillings (about $1.70). “It's unbelievably cheap,” said Mariam Lubogo, a university student shopping for eyeliner and earrings. Tanzanian traders are waiting for a new regulation to take effect banning foreign nationals from 15 types of business activities.Imani Nsamila/The Globe and Mail Under a new Tanzanian regulation, approved in July, foreign nationals are prohibited from 15 types of business activities, including cellphone and electronics repair, mobile money transfers, beauty salons, small-scale mining, tour guiding, real estate brokering, home and office cleaning, crop buying and parcel delivery. Violators can be jailed, fined or lose their work visas and residence permits. “We were excited when this rule finally came out, but now I'm disappointed,” said Mariam Hussein, a 43-year-old mother of three who sells domestic utensils. Every day, we see the Chinese quietly at it again. While some Chinese traders are betting that the anti-foreigner regulations will be diluted after the election, others are planning their exit. “This law is unfair to people like us who are trying to make a small profit by selling the goods that Tanzanians need,” said Zhang Xinghao, the plastic-shoe seller. “Shutting down our shops would be really hard and painful.

Ms Docherty was charged and released on bail under conditions that ban her from entering an area surrounding the hospital. The US State Department denounced Ms Docherty's latest arrest as “egregious”, warning that “common sense and basic civility are under attack” in Britain. “The United States will always speak out against these violations of fundamental rights.” I held my sign with love and compassion, inviting anyone who wants to chat, to do so – and stood peacefully, not approaching anyone. And yet, this is the second time I have been arrested for doing just that.” “We take the health and safety of those who come into our custody seriously and ask people about vulnerabilities to provide the facilities they need.” The Safe Access Zones Act was passed by MSPs last year and came into force in September. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland's public prosecution service, eventually dropped the case against Ms Docherty last month amid global outcry against her prosecution. The State Department responded by applauding Scottish prosecutors' “sensible decision”. The move to arrest Ms Docherty for a second time comes after months of scrutiny from the Trump administration, which has increasingly been prepared to intervene in British domestic affairs on the issue of freedom of speech. Concerns around freedom of expression have taken on renewed significance in the US following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Republicans framing his killing as an assault on Christian values. Lorcan Price, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom International, which sponsored Ms Docherty's case, said: “It's deeply concerning that Scottish policing resources are being ploughed into arresting and prosecuting a peaceful grandmother offering to speak to people in public, rather than focusing on the problems caused by real crime in Glasgow.</p>

NEW YORK, September 28. /TASS/. US businessman Elon Musk said that he had rejected in the past an invitation from financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to visit his island.

"Anyone pushing this false narrative deserves complete contempt. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I refused," he wrote on the X. Musk responded in this way to reports appeared in mass media that his name is present in Epstein case files.

Epstein was detained by New York State law enforcement on July 6, 2019. The prosecutor's office said that there was evidence that in 2002-2005 he organized visits to his Manhattan home by dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14 years old. Epstein's friends and acquaintances included a large number of current and retired officials not only from the United States, but also from many other countries (including former heads of state), major entrepreneurs and show stars. The criminal prosecution of the financier in the United States was terminated after his suicide in a prison cell on August 10, 2019.</p>
