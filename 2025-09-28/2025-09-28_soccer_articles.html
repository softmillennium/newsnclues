                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>El Cl√°sico Capitalino between Club America and Pumas was the marquee fixture of the weekend in Liga MX Apertura action, and Alejandro Zendejas turned it into his personal playground. The USMNT star bagged a sensational brace as Am√©rica dismantled Pumas 4‚Äì1 at the Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC (US Only). To make it the goal even more impressive, it was legendary Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas who Zendejas chipped. 10 would go on to score from the penalty spot 10 minutes later to complete his brace and secure Am√©rica's derby win. Zendejas's moment of magic left everyone in awe, including his teammates, who even compared his finish to one of Lionel Messi's most memorable goals. Zendejas's goal and overall performance was incessantly talked about following the match. Club Am√©rica vice captain √Ålvaro Fidalgo, who was seen completely amazed by the goal, took to social media to say it was one of the greatest goals he has ever witnessed in person. But perhaps the biggest piece of praise came from Uruguay international Sebasti√°n C√°ceres. ‚ÄúThat second goal, he chipped it, I told him, ‚Äòyou scored almost the same goal as the one Messi scored against Betis.' Zendejas's strike eerily resembled the goal Messi scored for Barcelona against Real Betis to complete his hat-trick at the Estadio Benito Villamar√≠n in 2019. When Leo Messi conquered the Estadio Benito Villamar√≠n üêê#LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/qB0CvdZZDy The 27-year-old Zendejas was a pillar for Am√©rica in their historic run to conquer three consecutive Liga MX titles. Zendejas has five goals and three assists through 11 games of the Apertura 2025 season. If he keeps up this level for the remainder of 2025‚Äì26, then the Tijuana born U.S. international should have a chance of making Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Pulisic and Milan now look ahead to another massive league match, as they prepare to face Juventus on Oct. 5, in a game that will feature, arguably, the two best players from North America in Pulisic and New York-born Canadian international Jonathan David. After that, Pulisic will likely turn his attention to the USMNT as head coach Mauricio Pochettino's group prepares for friendlies against Ecuador on Oct. 10 and Australia on Oct. 14, continuing to build momentum for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Pulisic was once again the headliner in this weekend's slate of Americans Abroad, as the AC Milan star added a goal and an assist to his recent tally. Make no mistake about it: the U.S. men's national team star has been the league's best player to start this 2025-26 season. He wasn't the only one with an assist this weekend, which turned out to be a fairly productive one for the USMNT stars in Europe. Gladbach's Joe Scally put on a show in the weekend's most chaotic game. Patrick Agyemang added another helper to his tally, too. And then there was Brenden Aaronson, who set up a goal, too, to silence some of the critics over in Leeds. With USMNT camp looming, several Americans stepped up as the European season really gets into full swing heading into October.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ex-Chelsea midfielder Craig Burley has launched a scathing attack on his former club and their supporters following Saturday's loss to Brighton & Hove Albion. Defender Trevoh Chalobah was dismissed in the second half, helping Brighton to complete a comeback and earn all three points. Sanchez did say sorry after the match, but Chelsea fans will still be angry with both him and Chalobah. Chelsea went into this season with a lot of momentum after winning the Club World Cup in July. However, Burley does not think it means much and has criticised Chelsea and their supporters for how they reacted to getting their hands on the trophy. Speaking on ESPN FC, the 1997 FA Cup winner said: ‚ÄúThis is a Chelsea side ‚Äî and Chelsea supporters ‚Äî who got carried away with this powderpuff Club World Cup nonsense, absolute nonsense. This here is what will define their manager, the Premier League. Had Chelsea got off to a good start in the Premier League, Burley could have easily been saying that the club's Club World Cup success has been a springboard for them. Jason Cundy has also torn into Chelsea following their second loss of the Premier League season. Bayern Munich director of sport Max Eberl has been much more positive about Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph. ‚ÄúI think Chelsea deserved to win the final, with their incredible energy,‚Äù Eberl said. It is nice to hear, but the Blues cannot live off that forever.</p>

Club America and USMNT midfielder Alejandro "Alex" Zendejas was disrespectful to a CONCACAF legend on Saturday night when he lobbed Keylor Navas to complete a brace in a 4-1 win over UNAM Pumas.

America led Pumas 2-1 in the 74th minute when Zendejas drove the middle and laid the ball wide to Allan Saint-Maximin on the left, drifting back into space to receive a return pass from the former Newcastle United wizard.

Zendejas, 27, has been red-hot and is clearly feeling it, as the Juarez-born American international spotted Navas in a tough spot and chipped a shot inside back post, He'd later convert an 83rd-minute penalty to complete his brace.

The United States men's national team has some audacious attackers and Zendejas is a man in-form as Mauricio Pochettino eyes his World Cup roster for next summer.

Zendejas has a goal or an assist in his last five Liga MX matches dating back to August 30, piling up four goals and two assists in that run.

Somebody notable is going to be left out of Pochettino's attackers for the 2026 World Cup, and Zendejas is complicating an already tricky call.

Zendejas joins Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Diego Luna, Brenden Aaronson, and Giovanni Reyna as playmakers hoping to get time for the USMNT in the home soil World Cup.

Zendejas scored on his second cap for the Yanks back in 2023 but waited 15 months between his seventh and eighth caps, then another 10 months between caps 11 and 12.

His 13th saw him score against Japan last month, as his sizzling form wasn't cooled off between club and country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The beautiful game's ultimate spectacle, the FIFA World Cup, is poised for its most dramatic transformation yet. Recent discussions between football's most powerful figures suggest a future where the tournament expands to an unprecedented 64 teams. This potential leap has not gone unnoticed by one of the sport's most respected voices, former World Cup-winning manager Joachim L√∂w, who has expressed serious reservations about the direction the game is taking. Fans want to see, above all, high-level football. L√∂w, who masterminded Germany's 2014 triumph, believes that the soul of tournaments like the World Cup and the European Championships lies in the high-stakes, elite-level clashes that capture the world's attention. He argues that this very essence is being diluted. With the upcoming 2026 World Cup in North America already set to grow from 32 to 48 participants, L√∂w contends that this initial expansion alone compromises the tournament's quality by reducing the frequency of those marquee matchups. The push for growth, however, shows no signs of slowing. In a significant meeting in New York, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and CONMEBOL chief Alejandro Dom√≠nguez explored the radical proposal of escalating to a 64-team format for the 2030 edition. Should this plan receive the green light, the footballing calendar would be dominated by a mammoth event featuring 128 matches‚Äîa staggering figure that doubles the number of games played in any World Cup from 1998 right through to the recent 2022 tournament in Qatar.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump has suggested moving the 2026 World Cup out of US cities that could be deemed unsafe, but there's a catch. In 2022, 11 US cities were awarded the right to host the men's FIFA World Cup next year, but just two months before the tournament draw is set to take place, President Trump has made a threat against cities he calls 'too dangerous'. Trump had first guaranteed that the World Cup would be ‚Äòvery secure,' but then went on to say he would even strip host cities of matches at the first fight of being unsafe. When a reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco - cities that are to host six games each - and asked Trump what he would do if those cities ‚Äòdid not cooperate' with him, he said: ‚ÄúWell, that's an interesting question, but we're going to make sure they're safe. Other cities that are to host games include Inglewood, Atlanta, Boston, Arlington (Texas), Houston, Kansas City, Miami, East Rutherford, and Philadelphia. The 2026 World Cup will also be shared by three countries for the very first time, with games also taking place in Mexico and Canada. Trump said of his stance on safety next year: ‚ÄúIf any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup, or for the [2028] Olympics ‚Ä¶ but for the World Cup in particular, because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it. However, social media fans have been left scratching their heads at his comments. Mostly, because Trump doesn't even have the authority to relocate World Cup matches, as those are overseen by FIFA. Also, because a lot of other cities that have increased crime were not mentioned in his comments. One person wrote on X: ‚ÄúAren't the crimes happening in Utah and Texas?‚Äù as another said: ‚ÄúHe means Blue cities. Someone else commented: ‚ÄúHe's not allowed to move matches! In preparation, the cities are likely to spend a fortune on the area to prepare for the event- and with time running out, making a big change like this could be tricky. ‚ÄúNo one is taking this seriously,‚Äù she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Beavers has replaced Diego Kochen on Marko Mitrovic's roster, U.S. Soccer announced Saturday. Kochen has been recalled by his parent club Barcelona following the injury to goalkeeper Joan Garcia. The Miami-born Kochen was slated to be Mitrovic's No. 1 goalkeeper for the competition, but is now set to Barcelona's No. Garcia was Szczƒôsny's backup but his injury forced Barcelona to make a decision. Kochen joined Barcelona in 2019 and has been alternating between the first and second teams over the past two seasons. He has yet to make a competitive appearance for the first team, but did sign a contract extension earlier this year. A former Real Salt Lake academy player, Beavers has previously represented multiple U.S. youth national teams. This age group is deep in talented GK's. Eyestone is in this age group as well. Will be interesting to see who becomes the #1 for our Olympic team in 2028. Dont forget Chris Brady and Slonina are still young too. The disappointing parts are one he isn't going to play for Barcelona he's just going to be the backup and two he's the best keeper we have with his feet. It would have been a chance to see proof of concept with skilled field players and a GK with passing and dribbling working together.</p>
