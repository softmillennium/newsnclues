                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for fresh crypto opportunities often begins with presales, where lower entry points and exclusive rewards create strong appeal. In 2025, several projects are gaining traction not only because of hype but also because of real adoption and technical direction. It has raised over $410 million, signed up 312,000+ holders, and continues adding more than 1,000 new participants daily. Hardware is already in use, with over 20,000 X-Series miners shipped to 130+ countries. Its Awakening Testnet, now active, delivers live stress testing and features such as account abstraction, UTXO removal, Stratum miner integration, and early EIP-4337 groundwork. This dual system, pairing mobile mining with high-performance hardware, creates a structure that is already active, not just planned. The Batch 30 price has been cut to $0.0013 for a limited time, offering major ROI potential. SUBBD Token is targeting the creator economy with AI and Web3 tools. Its presale has already raised about $1.1 million, with tokens priced at $0.056475. Utilities include AI-powered content generation, avatars, voice cloning, and monetization models for subscriptions. Staking is available at a 20% APY during presale, while after launch the token will support rewards, access, and payments within the platform. Price forecasts suggest growth toward $0.4463 by the end of 2025, with longer-term projections above $2 if adoption continues. The project has also undergone audits by Coinsult and SolidProof, strengthening its credibility. For those exploring creator-focused ecosystems in the best crypto ICO of 2025 discussions, SUBBD offers direct exposure to a fast-growing sector. PEPENODE has built momentum by blending meme-driven culture with a mine-to-earn model. Users can create and upgrade virtual mining rigs (nodes) to earn rewards in PEPE and Fartcoin, while 70% of tokens spent on upgrades are burned, creating a deflationary system. Early participants are seeing staking rewards above 1,000% APY, boosting presale interest. The project has raised between $1.2M and $1.3M, with tokens priced at $0.0010617. Analysts speculate on possible 100x returns if adoption scales, though such forecasts remain uncertain. The presale stages will raise pricing gradually, with a Token Generation Event planned for Q4 2025. MAXI also has plans to introduce futures trading with leverage as high as 1000×, an ambitious move for a meme project. Forecasts vary, with some expecting $0.003294 by the end of 2025, while others project between $0.00035 and $0.00053. Regardless, MAXI's blend of meme energy and real features makes it a notable entry in the best crypto ICO of 2025. Presales remain one of the most important stages for discovering future leaders. BlockDAG, PEPENODE, SUBBD Token, and Maxi Doge are four projects making strong progress, each with different strengths. BlockDAG leads with its hardware delivery, app adoption, and live testnet, providing proof instead of promises. PEPENODE adds gamification, SUBBD focuses on creator monetization, and MAXI blends meme appeal with staking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New crypto legislation would benefit from tapping into what makes this trailblazing industry so appealing by embracing regulation as technology itself. Cryptocurrencies — digital currencies that leverage blockchain technology to enable secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions — are decentralized. Their trustless nature, where no central authority is needed to verify transactions, is essential to crypto's adoption, with a market cap of $3.78 trillion. Until now, the industry has thrived without central oversight or burdensome government regulation. Crypto's huge success is the culmination of no-holds-barred free market competition. Blockchain technology is being utilized by 81 of the top 100 public companies. The global market for smart contracts, self-executing contracts built on blockchain technology, was valued at $684.3 million in 2022 and is expected to grow to $73.7 billion by 2030. The transaction volume of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset like a fiat currency, has exceeded the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard. These bills posit a regulatory framework that aligns state and federal stablecoin oversight. The current legislative approach misses an opportunity to tap into the potential of self-regulation, where private legal bodies compete to test and refine regulatory approaches. Through experimentation, as the crypto industry demonstrated with money, ledgers, and contracts, regulation can become a powerful technology. Private regulation and competing regulatory regimes are not just theoretical concepts cooked up at some egghead convention, they have a long history of success across various sectors. Private regulation has been key in areas like environmental protection, human rights, privacy, employee and customer safety, and animal welfare, with companies setting strict standards to attract customers. The NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges, as self-regulatory organizations, establish their own rules for listing and trading, going beyond government oversight to shape their respective regulatory environments. Industry standards, such as those from the International Organization of Standardization for quality and environmental management, reflect another form of private regulation, with companies voluntarily adopting them to improve operations and meet market needs. Other notable private regulatory systems include Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA, the American Arbitration Association, and the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. These examples highlight the potential of private regulation to serve as a complement to, and in some cases, a substitute for, government oversight. If the crypto industry were allowed to embrace this model, regulatory technology could evolve, with private actors developing and testing regulatory frameworks that fit the unique needs of decentralized networks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading activity has become cautious, with participants reassessing risk exposure amid broader market turbulence. Analysts are tracking the movement of sentiment as regulatory clarity or uncertainty could impact short-term volatility and longer-term investment strategies. In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to make a name for itself. The Ethereum-based token is garnering traction as analysts forecast that it could benefit from increased transparency regarding SEC rules while market trust evolves. It aims to provide clearer guidelines for the issuance, custody, and trading of cryptocurrencies while ensuring investor protection. Deregulatory measures include streamlining fundraising channels, lessening operational burdens, and re-evaluating the Consolidated Audit Trail system to balance cost against security oversight considerations. Investors consider that greater regulatory clarity could help ease uncertainty, boosting adoption and liquidity across digital assets. Ethereum has been under pressure short term after recent highs. RSI has declined towards 40, indicating a weakening bullish strength without reaching extreme oversold levels. Traders are paying close attention to key support levels around $4,200 and $4,000. Exchange netflows show consistent ETH outflows, indicating coins moved to self-custody or staking. Nonetheless, this decreases selling pressure and offers medium- to long-term bullish support. Despite short-term technical weakness, Ethereum's broader fundamentals remain strong, supported by institutional interest and ongoing network improvements. Analysts have pointed out that if support holds, ETH could make a higher low and retest previous resistances. Conversely, failure to hold these zones may intensify selling pressure, raising the chances of deeper retracements. Solana has fallen by 10% recently but bounced back to yield a higher low. Long-term horizontal resistance is near $250, which has proven difficult for the price to break since 2021. Further upside targets include Fibonacci retracement levels between 0.064 and 0.071 ETH. Analysts believe Solana can outperform Ethereum throughout the remainder of 2025 with continued momentum. Volume patterns show strong accumulation around recent lows, which supports upside potential. Traders are closely observing resistance and liquidity zones to determine the direction of Solana's upcoming rally. In 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain the top smart contract environments, but their courses are unique. Solana is known for speed, processing thousands of transactions per second with low latency. However, its network enjoys unmatched developer activity, mature DeFi protocols, and a strong institutional following. Analysts have noted that Solana could move to the lead for upside potential, particularly if it finally breaks past persistent resistance levels. A significant share of tokens is set aside for community growth and exchange liquidity. This approach is aimed at creating stable trading conditions once the token lists, giving investors confidence that volatility will be managed from day one. COIN FINANCE has introduced a limited-time 50% bonus for buyers using the promo code PATRIOTS100X. The bonus has already sparked strong demand, with investors treating it as a chance to maximize exposure before wider listings. As Solana and Ethereum wrestle with market turbulence following the SEC update, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project many are watching for fresh growth potential. Regulatory clarity may boost investor confidence and support compliant projects. Ethereum faces short-term consolidation, with Layer-2 solutions and upcoming upgrades supporting medium- to long-term growth. Solana's speed and low fees position it for potential breakout momentum in the coming months. Amid this landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a notable Ethereum-based token.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world of Digital Asset Treasury (DATs) has entered a new era, after Strive (ASST) announced an all-stock deal to acquire Semler Scientific (SMLR) this week. The banker, who opted to remain anonymous, outlined three scenarios for how DATS may evolve. For Strive, the acquisition consolidates balance sheets, adds BTC scale, and pushes forward a key company metric: Bitcoin per share. “Strive's merger announcement is accretive in bitcoin per share, meeting our short-term goal,” CEO Matt Cole wrote on X. Metaplanet is also exploring the use of perpetual preferred stock, a financing strategy that Strategy (MSTR) has already employed, allowing it to buy bitcoin without diluting shareholders through at-the-market (ATM) common stock offerings. Third, is merging with legitimate businesses instead of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), according to the banker. SPACs are shell firms designed to take companies public quickly, but the “de-SPAC” process can be messy, requiring shareholder votes, regulatory filings, and often suffering from investor redemptions. Making things more complex, to bridge funding gaps, many SPACs rely on PIPEs (private investments in public equity), which bring dilution, discounts and uncertainty. For DATs, merging directly with a company that already has operations and governance avoids these pitfalls. The bottom line is that DATs are at a point where they need to evolve and get creative with their growth strategies. In fact, other companies are already catching on to this trend. Recently, FRNT Financial (TSXV: FRNT), a digital asset investment bank, said it has entered into a consulting agreement with an undisclosed DAT with $100 million worth of digital assets in its balance sheet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This powerful synergy is giving rise to a new generation of presale cryptos that promise not just speculative gains, but tangible utility and groundbreaking features. Among the projects capturing significant attention for their innovative AI-based functionalities and potential for high returns on investment (ROI), Lyno AI, Ozak AI, and Layer Brett are standing out as frontrunners, signaling a shift towards more intelligent and integrated blockchain solutions. As of late September 2025, these projects are not merely riding the AI hype train; they are building robust ecosystems designed to solve real-world problems and enhance the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Their presales have garnered substantial investor interest, reflecting a growing market appetite for projects that blend cutting-edge AI capabilities with core blockchain principles. Lyno AI positions itself as a formidable player in the DeFi sector, specifically revolutionizing cross-chain arbitrage. This sophisticated system allows Lyno AI to swiftly identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities within milliseconds, a domain traditionally monopolized by institutional giants. Furthermore, the platform provides real-time AI-powered trading insights, offers staking rewards, incorporates governance features for token holders, and implements a deflationary buy-and-burn mechanism for its $LYNO token. The project's commitment to security is underscored by audited smart contracts by Cyberscope, bolstering investor confidence during its presale phase which has already seen significant traction and funds raised. Central to its ecosystem are AI-powered prediction agents designed to analyze vast data streams, detect real-time market opportunities, and empower users with more accurate trading decisions. Ozak AI is not just about theoretical concepts; it aims to deliver decentralized applications (dApps) with practical use cases. The $OZ token is integral to this utility-driven ecosystem, powering governance, rewards, and access to AI tools, ensuring its demand extends beyond mere speculation. The presale has attracted substantial investment, including from significant "whale" investors, signaling strong belief in its long-term potential. While many meme coins lack inherent utility, Layer Brett introduces technical purpose, staking mechanics, and interoperability features. Leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology, it aims to provide low-cost, high-speed transactions, targeting up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with gas fees as low as $0.0001, directly addressing Ethereum's persistent scalability and cost issues. The project fosters community engagement through gamified staking rewards and NFT integrations, offering high APYs to early adopters. With plans for cross-chain interoperability, transparent tokenomics (a capped supply of 10 billion $LBRETT tokens), and community-driven governance, Layer Brett is often hailed as a "Dogecoin Killer" due to its superior technical infrastructure and utility. The rise of projects like Lyno AI, Ozak AI, and Layer Brett signifies a profound paradigm shift within the cryptocurrency industry, moving beyond speculative tokens towards a future dominated by utility-driven, technologically advanced solutions. This trend reflects a maturing market where innovation, practical application, and sustainable ecosystems are increasingly valued over mere hype. The integration of AI capabilities, such as advanced analytics, predictive modeling, and automation, directly addresses many of the existing challenges in blockchain, including scalability, efficiency, and user experience. If these projects achieve their ambitious goals, they could set new benchmarks for what is expected from presale projects, compelling existing players to innovate or risk obsolescence. Strategic partnerships, as seen with Ozak AI, will become even more crucial for leveraging external expertise and expanding ecosystem reach. Furthermore, the hybrid model championed by Layer Brett could inspire a new category of "utility meme coins," forcing traditional meme coin projects to re-evaluate their value propositions. As AI-driven financial tools become more sophisticated, regulators worldwide are grappling with how to oversee these technologies. The decentralized nature of these crypto projects, combined with their AI capabilities, could present new challenges for existing regulatory frameworks concerning market manipulation, data privacy, and investor protection. Clarity from regulatory bodies in regions like the U.S. and EU will be vital for the long-term growth and mainstream adoption of such projects. Comparisons to past successful presales, particularly those that delivered groundbreaking technology, indicate that projects with strong fundamentals and clear roadmaps tend to outperform in the long run. This phase is typically marked by significant price volatility as early investors may take profits, while new market participants enter. Community engagement and marketing efforts will be crucial in maintaining momentum post-presale. Looking at the long-term, these projects will need to execute rigorously on their development roadmaps. Strategic pivots or adaptations may be required as market conditions evolve, and new technological advancements emerge. Market opportunities are abundant, particularly in the burgeoning AI and DeFi sectors. These projects can capitalize on the increasing demand for intelligent financial tools, efficient blockchain infrastructure, and community-driven ecosystems. However, significant challenges also lie ahead, including intense competition from existing and new projects, potential scalability issues as user bases grow, the ever-present threat of security vulnerabilities, and the evolving regulatory landscape which could impose restrictions or require compliance adjustments. Maintaining strong community engagement and developer support will be paramount for sustained growth. Potential scenarios and outcomes range from these projects becoming household names in the crypto space, driving significant innovation and investor returns, to facing significant hurdles that impede their growth. Conversely, failure to execute, unexpected technical challenges, or adverse regulatory changes could limit their potential. These projects represent a significant shift towards integrating sophisticated artificial intelligence with robust blockchain technology, promising a future of more intelligent, efficient, and utility-driven decentralized finance. The key takeaways from this event are clear: the market is increasingly valuing projects with tangible utility, innovative AI-based features, and strong community foundations. Their presale successes underscore a growing investor appetite for projects that offer more than just speculative potential, hinting at a more mature and discerning crypto market. Final thoughts on significance and lasting impact point to these projects potentially paving the way for a new era of intelligent decentralization. Their success could inspire countless other innovators to explore the powerful synergy between AI and blockchain, leading to a richer and more functional Web3. What investors should watch for in coming months includes major exchange listings, significant partnership announcements, the launch of key platform features, and any regulatory developments that could impact the broader AI and crypto sectors.</p>

Related: Telegram founder Pavel Durov says case going nowhere, slams French gov In May 2025, Durov pointed to a previous incident in which French intelligence services pressured Telegram into censoring Romanian election content, which he also declined to do. You can't 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. France is inching toward societal collapse due to state censorship and the failed policies of the current government, he warned in June. He also stated that Telegram will exit jurisdictions, including France, before compromising user privacy by handing over encryption keys or building a backdoor into the messaging platform for state surveillance. Durov's repeated warnings about state-led attacks against online free speech and privacy came to a head in 2025, when an EU proposal to monitor all chat messages, including encrypted user communications, gained support from 19 member nations of the EU.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fundstrat's Tom Lee has praised Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood for her early conviction in Bitcoin, calling her foresight one of the most important endorsements the asset has received from traditional finance. He argued that Wood's long-standing commitment to Bitcoin helped validate it as more than a speculative play and paved the way for institutional adoption. “She had foresight on Bitcoin when others ignored it,” Lee said, stressing that her confidence gave legitimacy to a still-controversial asset class. Her recent comments about “warming up” to ETH, combined with new investments in ETH-focused infrastructure such as BitMine, suggest a broader view of the crypto ecosystem. While Wood continues to frame Bitcoin as the ultimate rules-based monetary system and highlight its security record, she appears increasingly open to Ethereum's role in powering decentralized finance and blockchain applications. He argued that Wood's ability to frame Bitcoin as digital money, while at the same time acknowledging Ethereum's utility as an innovation platform, could help push traditional investors toward a more balanced perspective. “And I think she'll continue to grow more supportive of Ethereum as its ecosystem matures.” According to a detailed weekly report by Wu Blockchain, the past few days have been packed with ecosystem developments across major blockchain projects. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has reshuffled his altcoin portfolio, citing underperformance in some large-cap holdings and growing momentum in smaller-cap tokens. According to CoinMarketCap's momentum tracker, a few tokens are breaking away from the broader market slowdown. Seasoned investor Tom Lee predicts a strong performance for the U.S. stock market in the coming year, driven by favorable conditions and renewed investor confidence. Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, recently outlined his bullish stance on Ethereum, linking it directly to the rapid growth of the stablecoin sector. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat and a respected voice in crypto market forecasting, recently shared his perspective on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's latest initiative, “Project Crypto.” Ethereum's growing role in the digital economy was the centerpiece of a recent broadcast featuring Fundstrat's Tom Lee, who argued that ETH may one day rival or even surpass Bitcoin in market value. In a recent interview with Mario Nawfal, Tom Lee, Chairman of Bitmine, argued that stablecoins act as a microcosm of modern debt management. Wall Street strategist Tom Lee is moving into the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) space with a bold new project. The TON blockchain has witnessed remarkable growth, driven by an uptick in daily active users and increased market engagement. January brought renewed sentiment that sent many altcoins to their peak. Just a month later, the sentiment flipped completely and OG altcoins like Toncoin have dwindled. This month, Toncoin (TON) will roll out a series of high-profile airdrops. Toncoin (TON) has unveiled an exclusive partnership with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to offer users a path to the coveted 10-year UAE Golden Visa—through crypto staking. Toncoin (TON), a layer-1 blockchain project, has secured over $400 million in funding from venture capital firms, according to its development team.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The UN has released a white paper praising the effects of blockchain technology in its pension fund system. Now, the United Nations is taking steps to integrate the technology more deeply into its operations after testing it within its pension system. The United Nations stated that blockchain technology is a key tool for its digital transformation and inclusive governance strategy after a successful trial in its pension fund system. For decades, the pension fund has operated using a manual, paper-based process that required beneficiaries to prove their identity and confirm they are still alive. With more than 70,000 beneficiaries in 190 countries, the system was slow, costly, and vulnerable to fraud. The reliance on physical documents often led to errors, delays, and even suspensions. It also led to around 1,400 pension payments being paused each year because of verification problems. The initiative was launched first in 2020, and then there was a larger rollout in 2021 when the pension fund moved to a digital certification system built on blockchain. Staff spent hours receiving, opening, scanning, and archiving documents, and all these steps introduced opportunities for mistakes or delays. Beneficiaries could confirm their status digitally, while the fund gained greater confidence with fewer weak points in the system to be exploited. They referred to how blockchain allowed beneficiaries to securely verify their identity and status without mailing or submitting physical paperwork, cutting down on processing times and making the system more resilient, while also eliminating repetitive checks and the risk of duplicate data entry. The United Nation is now exploring ways to adapt the Digital Certificate of Entitlement model, which is the blockchain-based identity verification system, across its agencies and potentially share it with other international groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analytics platform Swissblock says one metric indicates that a local bottom is in for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. In a new post on X, Swissblock says the crypto market is in a reset phase based on its Aggregated Impulse metric, which measures exponential price structure across the top 350 assets. According to the analytics firm, the metric has been a reliable bottom signal for BTC and altcoins since 2024. “The last seven times this signal triggered since 2024, it marked a major bottom. Historically, bottoms form in the 15–25% zone. Looking closer at Bitcoin, Swissblock sees consistent demand for BTC from multiple investor cohorts, while noting that sellers are losing ammunition. “Bitcoin's range is nearing resolution. • ETFs (exchange-traded funds) + treasuries persistent buyers. Bitcoin Vector: Impulse score compressing at the upper band? Altcoin Vector: Breadth improving, ETH + majors rotating higher. Key trigger: A reset through negative aggregated impulse would flush weak hands and reload the signal? clearing the path for continuation. Once supply clears, Q4 setup favors a decisive breakout in both Bitcoin and altcoins.” Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Big market players and ETH whale entities see this correction as an opportunity to accumulate more. Crypto market experts also believe that the ETH bottom formation could be near, and so a reversal to the upside could follow soon. Popular crypto analyst Lark Davis recently noted that Ethereum price has fallen 20% over the past two weeks, pushing its Relative Strength Index (RSI) into the most oversold territory since April. The last time ETH reached such levels, it went on to rally 134% within two months. Davis noted that this is a key support level that ETH price must hold to maintain a bullish outlook. Furthermore, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that September has been a historically weak month for ETH and the crypto market. “The markets always have a correction in September / October. Historically, Q4 and Q1 are a great period for altcoins. September is a terrible month, and that's what we've seen with $ETH, it's down nearly 10%. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that large Ethereum whales have accumulated 431,018 ETH, valued at approximately $1.73 billion, over the past three days. The inflows were distributed across 16 wallets from major platforms, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX, and OKX. This signals continued accumulation by whales despite recent market volatility. Read original story Ethereum Price Drop Triggers Active ETH Whale Buying, Reversal Soon?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the Bahamas' Sand Dollar to Jamaica's Jam-Dex, and Nigeria's eNaira to India's e-Rupee, countries of the Global South are experimenting with new forms of digital money. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are no longer theoretical. From the Bahamas' Sand Dollar to Jamaica's Jam-Dex, and Nigeria's eNaira to India's e-Rupee, countries of the Global South are experimenting with new forms of digital money. Among them, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pilot has attracted particular attention. By March 2025, more than 6 million users and 420,000 merchants had tried the e-Rupee, with circulation rising 334% in a year to $122 million—making it the second-largest CBDC pilot globally (Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker, 2025). Yet, beneath the numbers lies a paradox: while India is a pioneer in CBDC policy, mass adoption in retail has lagged behind its wildly successful Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which already processes billions of transactions monthly (BIS, 2024). For the Global South, where financial exclusion and patchy digital infrastructure remain pressing challenges, India's journey is less about competing with existing systems and more about finding unique value propositions. By volume, smaller denominations dominated early use, but by 2025 the ₹500 unit is expected to account for more than a third of all pieces in circulation. This reflects how the e-rupee has moved beyond small-value transactions to become a common instrument for larger, everyday payments. India's Subhadra Yojana welfare program in Odisha used programmable e-Rupee wallets to transfer benefits directly to 88,000 women, ensuring funds were spent as intended (Economic Times, 2024). With 65% of rural Indians still relying on cash due to weak connectivity (PwC India, 2024), RBI is testing offline CBDC solutions. This matters for other Global South nations, where digital divides appear similar. CBDCs must first demonstrate their ability to replace cash before competing with advanced instant payment systems. As RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das put it, “The biggest potential for CBDC going forward will be cross-border money transfer” (Economic Times, 2023). These comments show India's CBDC vision is both ambitious and pragmatic, balancing long-term cross-border goals with immediate domestic needs. This underlines a universal truth: trust is the currency of CBDCs. Legal frameworks on privacy and data governance must be built before scaling; otherwise, adoption risks stagnation. Experiences from other Global South nations reinforce this point. Indonesia offers another cautionary tale: in 2025, public trust was shaken when the Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (PPATK), Indonesia's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing agency and the key watchdog of financial transactions often seen as the spearhead of state surveillance, froze thousands of dormant bank accounts, citing links to terrorism financing and online gambling. The move triggered widespread anxiety and even small-scale bank runs, reinforcing suspicion toward centralized oversight. This perception matters for future CBDC adoption: if PPATK's role is not clearly delimited and transparently communicated, citizens may see CBDCs as another layer of state surveillance, rather than an instrument of inclusion. Beyond surveillance concerns, another key challenge is shifting public perception so that CBDCs are not conflated with cryptocurrencies, which in many contexts of the South are associated with speculation, gambling, and high risk. That outreach cannot rely on conventional top-down communication alone; it must involve informal leaders, community networks, and culturally resonant campaigns. Examples from other contexts strengthen this point: in Kenya, mobile money literacy campaigns relied on church groups and women's savings collectives; in Brazil, digital inclusion initiatives leveraged football clubs and community radio to reach the unbanked. Pilots should begin with small but highly visible interventions—such as targeted subsidy disbursements or government aid—that build confidence from the bottom up. Building trust at the ground level is as important as building secure code at the top, and only by combining both can CBDCs achieve meaningful adoption. With over 700 islands, the country faced extremely high costs and logistical difficulties in distributing physical cash, especially in the aftermath of hurricanes that crippled banking infrastructure. Adoption challenges remain, but the initiative is recognized as a milestone and learning model for others. While this spurred some early interest, sustained adoption has been weak. Public misunderstanding, limited merchant acceptance, and a persistent preference for cash or existing digital payment options have slowed traction. The Jamaican case underlines that incentives alone cannot ensure lasting adoption without deeper trust, usability, and ecosystem readiness. One practical entry point for CBDC adoption in the Global South is starting with social assistance programs. By channeling government subsidies or welfare transfers through CBDC wallets, authorities can demonstrate tangible benefits to citizens and build trust through immediate, visible impact. Just as India's pilots have shown, this approach tackles leakage and ensures aid reaches its intended recipients. With the feature of “programmability,” CBDCs can be designed so that aid funds are restricted to specific uses (for example, buying fertilizer or food), drastically reducing leakage and misuse. Because digital and internet infrastructure remains uneven across much of the South, CBDC design must also allow transactions to be executed and recorded reliably even under poor connectivity conditions—or fully offline when necessary. From India's experience, five key lessons emerge for developing nations considering CBDCs: Of these, roughly three-quarters are countries in the Global South, highlighting how developing economies see CBDCs as a tool to expand inclusion and reduce dependence on cash. Ultimately, the story of CBDCs in the South is not just about money; it is about dignity, confidence, and building financial systems that people genuinely believe serve them rather than watch over them. To achieve this, a pentahelix approach is crucial: academia can research to adapt CBDC design to local needs and ensure user experience is accessible for rural communities; media can act as hubs for literacy and public awareness; fintech firms can innovate products and services on top of CBDC infrastructure; civil society can serve as watchdogs to safeguard privacy; and government can provide legitimacy and regulatory clarity. The IMF's REDI framework (Regulation, Education, Design, Incentives) emphasizes that CBDC adoption requires not only strong regulatory guardrails but also grassroots education, careful design tailored to local contexts, and well-structured incentives to sustain use. Chatham House, through its Inclusive Governance Initiative, emphasizes that legitimacy in digital finance hinges on incorporating civil society and non-state actors into the design process from the outset, thereby fostering trust and ownership. Likewise, the BIS 2023 survey on CBDCs found that more than half of central banks in emerging and developing economies are prioritizing offline access and interoperability as core features for retail CBDCs. These global perspectives align closely with the realities of the Global South, and without inclusive governance, local adaptation, and trust-building, CBDCs risk becoming technical projects with little to no real impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce - affectionately known as "Crypto Mom" - has launched her own NFT collection called The Dog's Breakfast. This unique initiative criticizes the chaotic regulatory environment and opens a pathway for a more constructive relationship between regulators and the crypto community. Peirce's initiative represents a shift in the approach regulators take toward crypto. This approach could foster a collaborative atmosphere between regulators and innovators, potentially leading to better outcomes for both. Characters in her collection might represent flawed legal guidance or the resistance faced by crypto innovators, highlighting the need for clearer, principles-based regulations. However, this playful take on the issues at hand risks trivializing serious subjects, from jurisdictional uncertainty to the rapid pace of innovation that complicates regulatory responses. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has pointed out that the regulatory landscape for crypto is not singular, but spread across multiple authorities with differing mandates. Peirce's NFT project, while a creative engagement, carries potential risks. The U.S. Treasury Department's "Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Non-Fungible Tokens" reports that while illicit finance is rare, fraud and scams are rampant and millions are lost to theft. Moreover, regulators engaging in cultural projects may muddy their public perception. If they appear to endorse or be part of a market with legal ambiguities, it could undermine trust in their neutrality. Peirce's NFT initiative could have significant implications for the worldwide regulatory landscape, especially for fintech startups in Asia and SMEs in Europe. By advocating for a balanced and clear approach to crypto regulation, her collection could inspire similar models internationally. This could particularly help fintech startups navigating complex compliance environments, as clearer regulations can reduce uncertainty and stimulate innovation. In Asia, where regulatory obstacles are rising, Peirce's approach may motivate regulators to adopt frameworks that support innovation while protecting investors. Likewise, in Europe, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework seeks to provide clearer guidelines for crypto-assets, and Peirce's endorsement of balanced regulation could underline the necessity of regulatory clarity. As an increasing number of companies explore cryptocurrency payments, the potential for financial inclusion expands. Crypto payroll could reach unbanked and underbanked populations, providing access to financial services that traditional banks often overlook. The interest in crypto payroll is particularly driven by Gen Z, who actively seek jobs that offer cryptocurrency as a payment option. This trend reflects a wider cultural shift towards digital assets and underscores the need for regulatory clarity to facilitate these innovations. As companies begin to pay salaries in crypto, compliance with trade regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and consumer protection will be crucial. In summary, Hester Peirce's The Dog's Breakfast NFT collection serves as both a critique of the current regulatory landscape and a cultural symbol of its evolution.
