ByZachary Folk,

Forbes Staff.

President Donald Trump shared and then deleted a seemingly AI-generated video in which he was seen promising Americans access to “medbeds,” a fictional technology popular with some far-right conspiracy theorists who believe they secretly exist and hold miracle cures for every illness.

The video, which was posted Saturday evening on his Truth Social account, featured an apparently AI generated video of the president promising “medbed cards” for Americans, which would grant access to hospitals “designed to restore every citizen to full health and strength.”

It is unclear why the president's account posted the video, which was taken down hours later, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes.

The video, which appears to show an AI-generated Lara Trump conducting an interview on Fox News, never aired, the network confirmed to multiple outlets.

Proponents of the “medbed” conspiracy theory believe the government is hiding advanced healing technology to treat a variety of illnesses or diseases—a claim that has appealed to people suffering from chronic pain, The New York Times reported.

The medbed conspiracy theory grew in recent years among splinter groups from the wider Qanon conspiracy theory, which promised Trump during his first term in office was working behind the scenes to prosecute accused child traffickers in the government and bring down the so-called deep state. In the years since, several splinter groups have fixated on medbeds. One group, led by now-deceased Qanon influencer Michael “Negative 48” Protzman, believed the technology was being used to keep former President John F. Kennedy alive, the Daily Beast reported in 2022. Protzman, whose faction was sometimes described as a cult, died in 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cooper, grow bigger, stranger, and more fascinating as the years pass. On November 24, 1971, an anonymous man hijacked a plane, secured $200,000 in ransom, parachuted into the night sky—and then disappeared forever. And why has no trace of him ever been found?﻿ On the afternoon of November 24, a man who looked like an ordinary businessman bought a one-way ticket at Portland International Airport. He paid cash and signed the name “Dan Cooper.” He boarded Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 bound for Seattle. He ordered a bourbon and soda, smoked a cigarette (common in 1971), and blended in like any other traveler. Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed flight attendant Florence Schaffner a folded note. To prove he wasn't bluffing, Cooper opened his briefcase slightly, showing what looked like red sticks of dynamite wired to a battery. For two tense hours, Flight 305 circled Seattle while agents gathered the ransom and parachutes. Cooper's instructions were precise: the aircraft should park away from the main terminal, with runway lights dimmed. Cooper released all 36 passengers but kept the flight crew as hostages.﻿ After refueling, Cooper ordered the plane to head toward Mexico City. Maintain a slow speed of about 200 knots The plane landed safely in Reno, Nevada. For weeks, soldiers, helicopters, and ground teams searched the dense forests, rivers, and mountains where Cooper might have landed. Over the years, a few clues surfaced: But why was only a fraction of the money there? How did it get so far from the drop zone? Never found: Cooper's parachute, briefcase, or body. Richard Floyd McCoy (1972 hijacker): He hijacked another 727 in a nearly identical way but was later caught. Some believed he was Cooper, but differences in appearance and evidence ruled him out. Kenneth Christiansen (flight attendant): A former airline employee with parachuting experience. A book accused him of being Cooper, but the FBI found no solid proof. Despite endless tips, none of the suspects were ever confirmed. Supporters of this theory argue that Cooper was highly skilled, possibly ex-military. He may have landed safely, buried the money, and lived the rest of his life under a new identity. Skeptics point out the stormy weather, rough terrain, and darkness. Cooper wore only a business suit and loafers—not survival gear. They believe he perished, and his body was never recovered. Some suspect Cooper had inside knowledge of the Boeing 727's stair system, suggesting he could have been a disgruntled airline worker or technician. For many, Cooper represents more than a criminal. He became a modern outlaw figure—polite, calm, and fearless. Unlike most hijackers, he didn't hurt anyone. References in TV shows like Loki, Prison Break, and Unsolved Mysteries A place in American folklore as the “gentleman hijacker” He remains the only person to successfully hijack a plane in the U.S. and escape without a trace. More than half a century later, the world still wonders: Who was D.B.

Two Boeing 747 jumbo jets—giants of the skies—collided on a fog-covered runway, killing 583 people. Defense cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has long been a cornerstone of their bilateral relationship. The recent developments in their defense partnership—ranging from joint military exercises to strategic agreements on arms production, intelligence sharing, and security cooperation—have reignited global debates about its impact on regional politics. This evolving alliance carries deep implications for countries like Israel and India, both of which see Pakistan as a security concern and view Saudi Arabia as a potential player in shaping Middle Eastern geopolitics. At the same time, this defense deal holds promising opportunities for strengthening Muslim unity, advancing Pakistan's defense industry, and revitalizing its struggling economy. The year 1803 brought a new turn in American history. This land covered almost half of the United States, but no one knew much about it. It was at this point that President Thomas Jefferson selected two brave explorers and adventurers to write a new chapter in the history of the fledgling nation. These two men were Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. Their goal was to map the unknown West, establish contact with the native tribes, and find out if there was a waterway that led to the Pacific Ocean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ghost Adventures is returning just in time for Halloween. The new season will follow Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley, and Jay Wasley on new paranormal adventures. Dark forces dominate an all-new season of GHOST ADVENTURES, premiering Wednesday, October 15 with an exclusive early debut on discovery+, as paranormal investigators Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley and Jay Wasley unearth menacing ghostly activity in their most chilling lockdowns yet. Venturing into the shadows of abandoned buildings, a former military base and even a haunted amusement park, the intrepid team face off against malicious spirits and eerie supernatural phenomena as they pursue answers to terrifying hauntings. In the upcoming season, they'll investigate sinister forces overtaking a shuttered hospital, explore strange manifestations haunting a beloved San Diego amusement park, grapple with deeply disturbing activity invading an abandoned medical complex, delve into reports of alien sightings and portals atop a Wyoming mountain, and more. Episodes will air on Discovery Channel beginning Wednesday, October 29 at 11pm ET/PT. “This season we were inundated by an overwhelming amount of dark energy,” said Bagans. “No question, these are some of the most intense, jarring and disturbing investigations we have ever experienced. Every location is a paranormal powder keg, and many of them are breeding grounds for evil. We've encountered a lot in our years of doing this, but this is unlike anything we have seen or captured before.” In the gripping two-hour season premiere, Bagans and the team travel to Casper, Wyoming, a supernatural hotspot, to investigate reports of UFO sightings, alien abductions and eerie hauntings shrouding the area's ominous mountain and abandoned military base. Exploring otherworldly sightings and a history of witches on the land, their investigation leads to a haunted forest where rituals may have opened a portal to another dimension.

Speaker Mike Johnson happily reeled off not one but two major conspiracy theories as he defended Donald Trump's targeting of his political enemies. Kevin McCarthy's replacement spoke with host Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday and debated the president's public call outs for enemies to be indicted. Johnson was quick to turn to two popular MAGA theories as arguments against Trump's actions counting as a weaponization of the Department of Justice. The speaker countered these overreach allegations by claiming both that a former FBI director had called for Trump's murder, and that the agency might be to blame for the Jan. 6 riots.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After it ended, it received a prequel series that is finding new life on the streaming charts after being canceled far too soon. Per Flix Patrol, The Winchesters has broken through to the top 10 list of the most popular streaming programs available on HBO Max via Amazon channels. 8 the following day, overtaking competition like Assassin's Creed and Walker Independence. Developed by Robbie Thompson as a prequel to Eric Kripke's long-running hit series Supernatural, The Winchesters premiered in 2022 to the delight of fans everywhere. Its release came two years after Supernatural wrapped Season 15 in 2020. The series starred Meg Donnelly and Drake Rodger as Mary Campbell and John Winchester, a young woman who serves as the leader of the "Monster Club" and a young Marine who hails from a long line of monster hunters. The series' core cast was rounded out by Nida Khurshid, Jojo Fleites, Demetria McKinney, Bianca Kajlich, Tom Welling, Andrea Londo, and Ryan McCartan. The Winchesters also saw Supernatural star Jensen Ackles return to serve as the series' largely unseen narrator as Dean Winchester. This, coupled with ownership changes at The CW and the subsequent shifts in personnel, meant that The Winchesters simply never stood a real chance of landing a Season 2 order. Back in 2023, Jensen Ackles opened up about what the initial plan for The Winchesters would have entailed, should the series have been renewed for further seasons. Ackles noted that showrunner Robbie Thompson had charted a five-season plan for the prequel series, stating at the time, "I just think that there's a way to keep this alive and it would be a shame to let that go." Ackles went on to say of the Supernatural fans who supported the series, "They are fired up. I love that they are so passionate about this world and this universe and these characters that they are willing to go to the mat for a show like this.

The Liberty Theatre in Astoria, in partnership with Ghostoria, presents a night of investigations into the paranormal.

The event will be 9 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. Oct. 4. Participation is restricted to people 14 and older. Teens 14 to 17 must be accompanied by their parent or legal guardian. Tickets are $35, available at https://libertyastoria.org. 

Ticket holders are welcome to bring their own small, handheld ghost-hunting devices, such as electromagnetic field (EMF) detectors, spirit boxes, or digital voice recorders, to enhance their experience and potentially capture paranormal activity during the investigation.

Those attending should enter at the McTavish Room entrance on 17th Street.

Portions of the investigation will take place in areas that are not accessible to individuals with mobility impairments because of stairs, uneven surfaces and confined spaces.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A respected congressman has claimed that advanced alien beings could be hiding out in 'five or six' underwater UFO bases right off the US coast. Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee overseeing UFO reports, drew massive attention on social media after saying that he believed there were alien 'entities' currently living in deep-water areas on Earth. The September 17 clip posted on X has already been viewed more than 1.9 million times. During the sidewalk interview with a UFO researcher and documentary filmmaker who goes by the pseudonym Red Panda Koala, Burchett suggested that advanced alien beings or civilizations may have been hiding in Earth's oceans for generations. He added that there have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft around five or six specific deep-sea areas, which he found significant given how little is known about the ocean compared to the moon's surface. The congressman also noted that US Navy personnel have reported chasing these underwater craft that move at extraordinary speeds and far surpass the abilities of current US military technology. Despite these claims, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these underwater craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of alien bases. He added that he's also spoken to credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, who confirm the existence of underwater bases and advanced craft. Dr Salla highlighted that the US Navy operates a top-secret underwater facility he likened to Area 51 called AUTEC, which stands for the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, right in this region of the Atlantic. 'So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water. So, there have been a lot of UFO sightings in that area,' he revealed. The submarine, capable of space travel, took him to an underwater city under a dome, resembling Dubai, with a large white pyramid. 'We have naval personnel telling me we have these sightings, these underwater craft they're chasing that go hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we got is something that does maybe a little under forty miles an hour,' Burchett said in the interview posted on X. 'So I got a lot of questions about that stuff.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local resident and photographer Jesse Gallagher snapped the strange collection of unearthly bodies over several months using his iPhone. And they certainly form an eerie motely crew of strange shapes and sizes, several deviating a lot from traditional depictions of a UFO. 'When zooming in, the orbs are either white or multi-coloured and can be seen pulsating,' Mr Gallagher told the Daily Mail. 'One recording has the moon as a backdrop which provides some interesting perspective. 'I have seen other videos of similar objects around the world.' Mr Gallagher said his footage was captured around midnight in Headingley between August 2021 and November 2023. Another entity in an even deeper shade of blue seems to form a very rough sphere or orb and be emitting a faint beams of light. Clues from its appearance suggest it could be a discarded piece of machinery or a fragment of disused spacecraft. But, in such an instance, rules of physics surely dictate that it would hit the ground. Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher, said the images show some kind of 'distant light source that is out of focus'. But Mr Mantle stopped short of calling them 'UFOs' – a term that may or may not describe an object thought to have an extraterrestrial origin. John Tunnah took about 10 or 12 photographs from his vantage point near the hills, but the object only appeared in one of them. The object is remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape. Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence, offered a number of explanations for Mr Tunnah's photo. UFOs became a major subject of interest after World War II and were thought by some researchers to be intelligent extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. Instead, the Pentagon uses UAP – 'unidentified aerial phenomenon' – although in most places this has low usage and is yet to enter common parlance. Clear and startling images of what appears to be a UFO were captured over Los Angeles, sparking fresh debate about what's flying over America's biggest cities. A pair of Los Angeles residents were on their balcony when they spotted a black, V-shaped craft covered in lights moving slowly over the city on August 28. The pair was able to capture both pictures and clear videos with a cellphone camera, zooming in to see nine white lights along the UFO's hull. UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee told the Daily Mail he believes the craft was not an alien spaceship, instead offering some alternate theories.</p>
