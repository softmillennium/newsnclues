                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A gunman opened fire inside a Mormon church in Michigan during Sunday services before apparently setting the building ablaze, killing at least one person and injuring nine before police shot him, authorities said. The shooting occurred at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Detroit, local police said in a social media post.

GRAND BLANC TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service and set the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring eight others before police shot him, authorities said. Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a four-door pickup with two American flags in the truck bed through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Investigators believe he “deliberately” set the building on fire, Renye said. Officers responded to a 911 call and were at the church within 30 seconds and killed the shooter about seven minutes later, Renye said. A vehicle that was rammed into the building is surrounded by smoke as a firefighter works on the scene at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Mich., Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025. Renye identified the suspect as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from neighboring Burton. Renye said one of the wounded people was in critical condition Sunday evening and seven others were stable. Investigators were searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church. President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he was briefed on the shooting and applauded the FBI for its response. Local authorities said the FBI was sending 100 agents to Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!” Trump wrote. Brad Schneemann, whose home is about 400 yards (365 meters) from the church, told The Associated Press that he and his daughter heard “two rounds of four to five shots” around 10:30 a.m. “Then, we really didn't hear anything for a while” before they left their home to see what was going on. Timothy Jones, 48, said his family is part of another Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation, or ward, about 15 minutes away, but that his children were at the Grand Blanc Township ward Saturday night for a youth fall festival. He and his family moved to Flint two years ago in large part because of how strong the faith's community is in the area, he said. As people in his congregation got word of the shooting from texts and phone calls during their Sunday service, his ward went into lockdown and police came as a precaution, he said. Sundays are “supposed to be a time of peace and a time of reflection and worship,” Jones said. The next president is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol. “Human lives matter more than our labor dispute,” Glass said. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart was breaking for the community. “Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Portland Mayor Keith Wilson speaks at a news conference in Portland, Ore., on Saturday, Sept. 27, 2025, after Republican President Donald Trump said he would send troops to the city. Protestors gather for a march in Memphis, Tenn., Saturday, Sept. 27, 2025, to protest against the deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis. Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent of the U.S. Border Patrol's El Centro Sector, patrols downtown Chicago with other federal agents Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025. MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Armed federal agents patrolled Chicago's downtown streets on Sunday, a new escalation of an immigration enforcement crackdown there that followed President Donald Trump's announcement that he will send troops to Portland in the latest examples of creeping federal law enforcement presence in U.S. cities. Bill Lee has said federal authorities, including immigration and drug enforcement agents, are expected to arrive in Memphis starting this week. That comes amid a surge of immigration enforcement that began early this month, including repeated conflict at an ICE building in Broadview, west of Chicago, where federal authorities  on Friday and Saturday fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters. Trump said on social media Saturday that he was directing the Department of Defense to “provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland.” Trump said the decision was necessary to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. His announcement was met with pushback from Oregon's Democratic governor. On Sunday, federal agents marched along Michigan Avenue, the Chicago River and upscale neighborhoods, attracting attention from shoppers and families dining at sidewalk cafes. JB Pritzker blasted the sudden physical show of force. “While Chicagoans and visitors are enjoying another gorgeous Sunday, they are being intimidated by masked federal agents flaunting automatic weapons for no apparent reason,” Johnson said in a statement. “This is not making anybody safer — it's a show of intimidation, instilling fear in our communities and hurting our businesses,” Pritzker said in a statement. Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol agent central to the Los Angeles immigration crackdown, was among the agents who walked several miles near downtown. Bovino told The Associated Press that agents had made “several arrests” but declined to give specifics on whether the patrols downtown were aimed at specific people. “We've always got a target that's anyone who is here illegally,” Bovino said. Over the weekend, tension rose outside an ICE building in suburban Broadview about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago. On Friday, agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward a crowd of over 100 protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. Pepper bullets and tear gas canisters went into the crowd, most of them standing away from the fence and not blocking traffic. Protesters and local reporters described similar scenes on Saturday night. Broadview's mayor criticized ICE for actions that she said have endangered local police, firefighters, residents near the facility and protesters. In previous weeks, protesters had also tried to block agents' vehicles from moving in or out of a yard next to the building. Activists and family members of detainees have raised concerns in recent days that the facility meant to process arrestees is a de facto detention center plagued by inhumane conditions. Tina Kotek responded to Trump's comments that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary” to handle “domestic terrorists” by saying he is abusing his authority by ordering troops into a city that she said is doing “just fine” on its own. Other government, police and business leaders said soldiers are not needed and Trump is presenting a false picture of the city. There is no threat to national security,” Kotek told reporters. The governor said she “tried to understand his reasoning” during their conversation and his response was just, “Let's keep talking.” A Pentagon spokesperson said the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available. A spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard said any requests for Guard support would need to be coordinated through the governor's office. Late Saturday, a small crowd of protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside an ICE facility. Some demonstrators also say they have been injured. Trump said earlier this month that he was creating a task force of federal law enforcement agencies to combat crime in Memphis. The city has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that the majority-Black city is seeing decreases this year in some crime categories. Lee, the governor, has publicly said he would not expect more than 150 National Guard members to be sent to Memphis, though he's said the numbers aren't solidified. The city said Friday there won't be tanks. The Guard troops won't be making arrests and won't be armed unless local authorities request that, Lee said Friday. Lee also said 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers will be in the region. On Saturday, dozens of people marched to a plaza in front of City Hall to protest the law enforcement surge. Speakers at a news conference said that, instead of federal troops and agents, Memphis needs more funding for education, crime prevention, youth services and hospitals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump gestures as he arrives at the White House, Friday, Sept. 26, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will speak at a hastily called meeting of top military leaders on Tuesday, according to a White House official. Hundreds of generals and admirals — senior commanders of the one-star rank or higher and their top advisers — have been summoned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from all over the world to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, with little notice. The White House official was not authorized to discuss the president's plans before a public announcement about his attendance and spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump told NBC News in an interview Sunday that they would be “talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.” Trump didn't seem to know about it when first asked by reporters during an Oval Office appearance. “I'll be there if they want me, but why is it such a big deal?” Trump said. For example, he delivered campaign-style remarks to uniformed personnel at Fort Bragg in North Carolina in June, attacking his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. The Republican president is also expanding his use of the military in American cities, arguing that it's necessary to fight crime in places where Democratic leaders are failing to ensure public safety. The National Guard continues to patrol in the District of Columbia, and a smaller deployment is expected in Memphis, Tennessee. Over the objections of local and state officials, Trump previously sent the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, where there were protests against immigration raids. The Pentagon's top spokesman has previously confirmed that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.” Across the military, there are 800 generals and admirals of all ranks. Many command thousands of service members and are stationed across the world in more than a dozen countries and time zones.</p>

Smoke rises from an Israeli airstrike on the Macca Tower, a high-rise building in Gaza City, Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025, following a prior warning issued by the Israeli army. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — On the eve of meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel is working on a new ceasefire plan with the White House, but details are still being sorted out. Netanyahu has come under heavy international pressure to end the war, especially during the ongoing offensive in Gaza City. In Monday's White House meeting, Trump is expected to share a new proposal for ending the conflict. Arab officials briefed on the plan say the 21-point proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war, is destroyed. But he repeated an offer to allow Hamas operatives to leave Gaza as part of a deal ending the conflict. But the U.S. leader has shown signs of impatience lately, particularly after Israel struck the headquarters of Hamas' political leadership in Doha, Qatar, earlier this month. Ceasefire talks have stalled since, despite growing international and domestic protests. The European Union is considering sanctions and there are growing moves for a sports and cultural boycott against Israel. A defiant Netanyahu told fellow world leaders Friday at the U.N. General Assembly that his nation “must finish the job” against Hamas in Gaza, where 48 hostages are still held captive, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive. Trump's ceasefire proposal would include the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan. A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Hamas has said it is ready to “study any proposals positively and responsibly.” Local hospitals in central Gaza said at least 10 people were killed when at least two strikes hit homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp. Gaza's Health Ministry said in its daily report the death toll has climbed to 66,005, with a further 168,162 wounded since the war started. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run administration, does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its toll, but has said women and children make up around half the dead. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts. “They were nonstop,” Sayed Baker, a Palestinian who shelters close to a Shifa hospital, said of the explosions. On Sunday, the military said it had struck a high-rise building in Gaza City after warning residents to evacuate. The Israeli military said the building housed “military infrastructure belonging to Hamas.” It is the latest in a series of demolitions in recent weeks as Israel expands its offensive. Israel's offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displacing around 90% of the population amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine. On Sunday, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier died of wounds sustained in an attack at a road junction near Nablus in the West Bank, and security forces shot dead the alleged attacker, the army said. Violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want for a future state.

Richard Sterban of the Oak Ridge Boys shared a devastating health update with his fans. The 82-year-old musician took to his band's website on Thursday, Sept. 25, to announce that he has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. "In March of this year, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer," Sterban said. He continued: "I want to thank everyone, especially the fans, for your concern, and I would appreciate your continued prayers. Most days I'm feeling very good, and I hope to be back out on the road in several months." Richard Sterban shared he has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Sterban has been a member of The Oak Ridge boys for over 50 years, having joined the quartet in 1972. He last appeared on stage with the band during their performance at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May, with Aaron McCune and Tim Duncan filling in for him lately during the band's tour. "I want to thank everyone, especially the fans, for your concern, and I would appreciate your continued prayers. Most days I'm feeling very good, and I hope to be back out on the road in several months." His announcement comes one year after late band member, Joe Bonsall, died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) complications. Bonsall had announced in January 2024 that he would no longer be touring because his diagnosis had gotten "to a point that walking is impossible." "It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all," he wrote at the time. "I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying," he added. The Oak Ridge Boys was founded in 1943 and has had many members. The popular country and gospel music band was originally founded in 1943, and was originally known as The Oak Ridge Quartet. Allen spoke to Fox News in January 2021 about his relationship with Golden, Bonsall and Sterban, saying "I think the four of us have grown closer than we've ever been in our whole career." But when you're younger and when things are exploding all around you and your career is exploding in the public, then little grievances that we might have one toward the other, they all explode, too," Allen said. Allen told Fox News the quartet was very close after touring together for over 40 years. He continued: "We've been through that period of time and we lived through it and we realized that the things that we love about each other and the things that we've accomplished with each other are so much more important than the little things that might pull us apart."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump reacted to the mass shooting that occurred Sunday at a church in Michigan, calling it a “targeted attack.” “I have been briefed on the horrendous shooting that took place at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Grand Blanc, Michigan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!” Trump added. As of Sunday afternoon, one victim had died as a result of being shot, and ten others were wounded. Authorities said they expect there to be more victims found as a result of the fire. While centered on Jesus Christ, the LDS faith includes more scripture than most Christian denominations, as the Book of Mormon, in particular, gives them their nickname. Vice President JD Vance also responded to the shooting. “Say a prayer for the victims and first responders.” Say a prayer for the victims and first responders. Over 46,000 Michiganders are counted in the religion. Officials haven't released the name of the suspect, who is now deceased, but have described him as a 40-year-old male. He drove into the church after worship services had begun.</p>

Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst discusses the release of American citizen Amir Amiri, who was held by Taliban since 2024. The U.S. secured the release of an American citizen being detained in Afghanistan following months of negotiations on Sunday, Fox News has learned. The U.S. and Qatar jointly negotiated for the release of Amir Amiry, U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler told Fox News on Sunday. Leaving an American was the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life and I promised him that we would come back for him," Boehler told Fox. "Amir Amiry became a citizen by putting his life at risk fighting for our country and our troops. U.S. citizen Amir Amiri, left, was released from Afghanistan after negotiations with Qatari officials on Sunday, September 28 2025. "Throughout Mr. Amiry's detention, Qatari diplomats remained in close communication with US officials and carried out regular health checks to ensure his wellbeing," a source familiar with Amiri's detention told Fox News. U.S. citizen Amir Amiri, third from the left, was released from detention in Afghanistan on Sunday, September 28, 2025. Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated Amiry's release, thanking Qatar in an X post Sunday afternoon. "Today we welcome home Amir Amiry, an American who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan. I want to thank Qatar for helping secure his freedom," Rubio said. "@POTUS has made it clear we will not stop until every American unjustly detained abroad is back home." Amiry's release comes roughly a week after the Taliban released an elderly British couple after eight months in captivity. Barbie Reynolds, 76, and husband Peter Reynolds, 80, arrived in Qatar on Friday following months of negotiations between Qatar, the Taliban and Britain. The couple had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, where they ran an education charity. A Qatari official welcomes the released British couple, Barbie and Peter Reynolds, as they step off the plane upon their arrival in Doha, Qatar, Friday, Sept. 19, 2025. "God is good, as they say in Afghanistan," she added at the Kabul airport.

Oregon moved up to No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday, Mississippi earned its highest ranking since 2015, Alabama jumped back into the top 10 and Virginia was in the Top 25 for the first time in six years in the wake of a volatile weekend in which four top-10 teams lost. Ohio State won at Washington and remains No. 1 for the fifth straight week. The Buckeyes received 46 first-place votes, six fewer than a week ago, and their 37-point lead over Oregon is the closest margin between the top two teams since the preseason poll in mid-August. Oregon's two-overtime win at Penn State earned the Ducks 16 first-place votes, 15 more than last week, and gave them their highest ranking since they were No. 1 for two months last year. Miami, which had an open date, slipped one spot to No. 4 Rebels got a nine-rung promotion for beating LSU and have their highest ranking since they were No. Texas A&M, Penn State, Indiana, Texas and Alabama round out the top 10. Alabama, which had been out of the top 10 since losing its opener against Florida State by two touchdowns, has won three straight after beating Georgia for the 10th time in 11 meetings and ending the Bulldogs' 33-game home win streak. 12 Georgia has its lowest ranking since it was No. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. The losses by Penn State, LSU and Georgia marked the first time since 2016 that three top-five teams lost the same week in the regular season. Florida State's loss at Virginia was the latest development in an up-and-down season for the Seminoles. They went from unranked to No. 14 for beating ‘Bama, were in the top 10 for three weeks and plunged 10 spots to No. 24 Virginia, not listed on any ballots in the previous poll, was rewarded for beating its highest-ranked opponent since then-No. The Cavaliers are 4-1 for a second straight season for the first time since 2003-04. 25 Arizona State's come-from-behind victory over TCU returned the Sun Devils to the Top 25 after a three-week absence. Southern California (21) and TCU (24) dropped out. — Week 5 marked the second time this season that four top-10 teams lost. It also happened in Week 1, but three of the four top-10 teams had to lose that week because there were three top-10 matchups. — Mississippi's nine-spot rise into the top five was the biggest by any team since the Rebels jumped 12 spots to No. — Indiana has been the fastest riser over the past month, moving up 15 rungs since Week 1. Over that span, Oklahoma and Texas A&M have each risen 13 spots. Miami at Florida State: It will be the 27th time the Hurricanes and Seminoles face off as ranked teams. Miami is 15-11 in those games but Florida State has won the last five such contests, the last of which came in 2016. Vanderbilt at Alabama: Crimson Tide will be looking for payback. Vanderbilt's 40-35 win as a 23-point underdog last season marked the Commodores' first over a No. 1 team and was widely regarded as the 2024 upset of the year.

Director Todd Lyons show 'My View with Lara Trump' around their joint intelligence and operations center in New York City. DHS says it has launched an investigation after discovering "what appears to be" an explosive device outside the Chicago ICE facility. "11 violent rioters were arrested last night in Chicago outside the ICE detention facility: These are two guns that were taken off rioters in Chicago right against the fence at our ICE detention facility," DHS wrote. "An investigation is underway into what appears to be some sort of explosive device found last night near the ICE Chicago detention facility," the statement continued. DHS released images of firearms confiscated from anti-ICE protesters in Chicago on Sunday, September 28. Federal law enforcement agents deployed pepper balls and tear gas Friday during a standoff with anti-ICE protesters outside of Chicago. The confrontation came just two days after a shooter opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas. The gunman in that incident killed one detainee and injured two others before taking his own life, authorities said. At least 50 protesters were seen midday Friday at an ICE processing center in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. An ICE spokesperson told Fox News that two were arrested, one of whom was carrying a firearm. The demonstrators were also seen trying to block vehicles from leaving. Last week, violent clashes between protesters and ICE agents at the facility led to 16 arrests. In the demonstration, "rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, adding that rioters also assaulted law enforcement officials. Federal law enforcement were captured on video firing pepper balls at anti-ICE protesters in Broadview, Ill., on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. The site is currently being used as the main processing center for Operation Midway Blitz, a massive immigration enforcement action focused on Illinois.

Former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker joins 'Fox News Live' to react to a shooting and fire at a Mormon Church in Michigan. A gunman was "down" after shooting multiple people at a Michigan church that was also engulfed in flames on Sunday, authorities said.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was receiving briefings about the "horrific shooting" and fire at the church. "Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling," Bondi said in a post on X. "Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy." Bondi said that agents with the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were heading to the scene. Medical responders were seen rolling several gurneys toward the church while law enforcement officials in tactical gear were also on the scene.

Des Moines Public Schools board chair Jackie Norris called for "radical empathy" after the ICE arrest of superintendent Ian Roberts. Iowa Democrats are rallying behind a school superintendent who was arrested by ICE on allegations that he is in the country illegally this week, and they are led by a school board chair who once held a key role in the Obama White House. After ICE arrested Ian Roberts, the superintendent for Des Moines Public Schools (DMPS) last week, school board chair Jackie Norris called for people to have "radical empathy" as Roberts' case plays out. Norris previously served as White House chief of staff for then-first lady Michelle Obama. Norris supported Roberts in a statement on Friday in which she said that officials "do not have all the facts." "There is much we do not know," Norris said. "However, what we do know is that Dr. Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined over two years ago." Authorities said a handgun was found in a vehicle used by Ian Roberts to flee from pursuing ICE agents. Norris said Roberts joined the school district in July 2023 after having served in various school districts across the U.S. for "over 20 years." Meanwhile, Republicans in the Iowa legislature are calling for a wider probe to ensure proper hiring practices are being followed across the state. "I will not hesitate to introduce and pass legislation to mandate enhanced hiring protocols, increase transparency in district operations, and protect the resources allocated to our schools through the appropriations process," State Rep. Austin Harris said. "Iowa's families deserve nothing less than a safe, lawful, and effective education system for their children." DMPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. ICE alleges that Roberts is in the country illegally from Guyana. They say he is not legally permitted to work in the United States and had a final order of removal from a judge issued in May 2024. Roberts was arrested after allegedly driving away from law enforcement. He later abandoned his car in the woods, and Iowa State Patrol ended up finding him, according to a press release. "This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement," ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement. "This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats," Olson continued. "How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district." Ian Roberts, head of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested by immigration authorities on Friday after a brief chase, Roberts was living in the United States illegally, authorities said. The district said Roberts had previously done an I-9 to prove legal status, but that it was conducted by a third-party group and that it did not know about an order of removal, according to The Associated Press. Roberts came to the United States with a student visa in 1999 and had charges for weapon possession in 2020, according to ICE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tropical Storm Imelda formed over the Bahamas Sunday afternoon and is expected to intensify into a hurricane, and while its forecast is less ominous for the Southeast coast, the storm will still be felt there. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the central and northwestern Bahamas where the tropical storm is currently wringing out heavy rain. Rainfall totals could range from 4 to 12 inches in the Bahamas and eastern Cuba, more than enough to trigger flash flooding. After moving north and parallel to Florida's Atlantic coast through Monday, the storm is now expected to make an abrupt turn east and away from the coast while intensifying into a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday. Imelda has joined Hurricane Humberto in the Atlantic. The powerful Category 4 hurricane rapidly intensified into a rare Category 5 storm Saturday over the warm, energy-filled water of the open ocean and has a role to play in Imelda's future. Imelda's slower than expected northward movement means Humberto will win out in a tropical tug-of-war between it and a weather pattern over the Southeast US. On Tuesday, Humberto will tug Imelda away from the coast and the weather pattern trying to draw it closer to land. It seems unlikely that this steering pattern will shift again, but those on the Southeast coast shouldn't fully let their guard down just yet. Onshore winds will also kick up high surf that could cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. The rainfall forecast has trended down since Saturday. Totals of 2 to 6 inches are now forecast in the coastal Carolinas through Wednesday morning. Imelda's wind field will grow and allow strong, gusty winds to howl along the Southeast coast early-to-midweek. Officials in the Southeast geared up to deal with the storm even though things were looking more encouraging Sunday. Henry McMaster issued a state of emergency Friday, activating statewide response plans and mobilizing agencies to prepare for significant wind, flooding rain and storm surge across the state. The City of Charleston declared a local state of emergency Saturday, and began distributing sandbags and clearing storm drains, according to a statement. Meanwhile, over the open Atlantic, Hurricane Humberto rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm Saturday while tracking over warm water and a less hostile environment in the central Atlantic. Humberto weakened slightly to a high-end Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning. It's expected to remain a powerful Category 4 storm into early in the work week. It is not a direct threat to the US, and will likely steer far to the west of Bermuda. That said, Bermuda could still see bands of rain and gusty winds Tuesday into Wednesday. Imelda could come near Bermuda by late week as well. CNN's Elise Hammond, Andrew Freedman and Briana Waxman contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: Befrienders Worldwide has contact information for crisis centers around the world. One beautiful spring day in New York last year, I found myself in a 10th floor medical clinic, hooked up to a saline IV drip. I was there for my very first ketamine IV infusion, a treatment meant to help me with anxiety, depression and PTSD. A kind nurse sat by my side and explained that I could use a button to call her if I was uncomfortable in any way or wanted help. I wanted to feel warm and cozy, and I had brought everything else I needed: an eye mask, a journal to reflect on the ketamine therapy experience, my headphones for music and a suitably jolly playlist on my phone. Appearing a few minutes later, she carefully laid the blanket over me, tucked me in reassuringly and positioned the recliner so I was comfortably somewhere between seated and lying down. Once she inserted the ketamine into the IV drip, it took longer than I thought to take effect. For around 20 minutes I lay in the darkness, feeling no different. “Maybe she didn't really give me anything. Maybe all of this is a weird con.” Then, I felt my tongue start to go numb. First synthesized in the 1960s, ketamine was originally developed as an anesthetic for which it is still used. Ketamine is not a psychedelic like psilocybin, MDMA or LSD — these drugs are hallucinogens or psychoactive substances that can “temporarily alter a person's mood, thoughts, and perceptions,” according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, which can have some hallucinogenic effects at low doses, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. This makes the dissociative anesthetic feel pretty close to a psychedelic experience, but they are distinctly different classes of drugs. The Western world is experiencing something of a psychedelic renaissance, with an increasing amount of interest in drugs that decades ago were considered rebellious and dangerous to some groups but fun to others who used it while clubbing and attending raves. And yes, there are people who prescribe and use it irresponsibly, as is the case with many drugs. But there is a growing body of evidence showing that psychedelics can help people who are struggling with their mental health: MDMA has shown promise as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. A clinical trial showed that synthetic psilocybin — the active compound in magic mushrooms — rapidly eased severe depression in people with treatment-resistant depression. Last year, advocates attempted to get MDMA approved for therapeutic use in the United States, a move that was rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration. As for ketamine, it's a Schedule III controlled substance in the US (defined as drugs with a low to moderate potential for psychological and physical dependence) but approved as a general anesthetic, as it is in the United Kingdom and across many countries in Europe, including Germany and Poland. Patients have reported that ketamine helps with chronic pain, and studies have shown it to be incredibly effective at reducing symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. That's why it's being used off-label around the world to treat people with a variety of mental health issues. A nasal spray version of ketamine, called esketamine — brand name Spravato — was developed by Johnson & Johnson and approved in the US by the FDA for treatment-resistant depression, or TRD, in 2019. Earlier this year it became the first approved stand-alone treatment for TRD. For all its promise, ketamine also has high risk. The drug rose in prominence in 2023 when “Friends” actor Matthew Perry died of the acute effects of ketamine. It is still bought, sold and used recreationally around the world despite its status as a controlled substance, and the damage can be devastating when used improperly, leading to painful bladder inflammation and damage, as well as kidney and liver damage. While I was aware of Perry's death when I looked into ketamine therapy for myself, I also knew that the actor had struggled with addiction and taken it outside of a clinic. In my case, it wasn't caused by a single formative experience but prolonged exposure to a previous toxic work environment. Though I was years out of the situation, the experience still had a hold on me, like a dark cloud hovering just out of view. At my best, I seemed fine, but certain situations would make me anxious. For years, I'd lived in an internal world of anxiety and rumination that prevented me from fully living my life, in big ways and small. The muscles in my shoulders and neck were as hard as rocks, and I could never relax. Weekends gave me no respite: I'd get migraines on a Friday or Saturday, spend the whole day trying to recover and be completely wiped out the next day, unable to do anything. By the time I recovered, if at all, it was back to work. I'd tried different antidepressants on and off for years. Some therapy styles, for instance, made me feel like I was being criticized for my responses to things rather than feeling empowered to make positive changes. Some drugs left me an emotionless zombie with no capacity for joy. I couldn't stand feeling empty and numb. I couldn't be there to see him or gauge whether it really was a concern. I thought about how quickly I might be able to fly home, how much money it would cost, whether my job would support me taking leave. It was an incredibly intense period of my life, feeling under pressure from all angles. I had heard through a friend that ketamine was being used legally but off-label for treatment-resistant depression in the US and wondered if it could help me, too. I set about researching its applications for PTSD and anxiety, reading everything I could get my hands on. After several weeks, I decided to try it. At worst, it was a waste of money but something I could at least say I'd tried. I looked online and found a clinic in New York that would do infusions. Vagus nerve stimulation may relieve treatment-resistant depression, study finds After looking at dozens of positive reviews and recommendations online, I scheduled a consultation with the founder — a doctor with decades of experience using ketamine in medical settings. It is possible to get a prescription for lozenges to use at home, but I wanted to be treated in a medical setting being watched and cared for by professionals. The doctor listened sympathetically, and I asked if I would be a good candidate for the treatment. While he couldn't guarantee it would help me, he told me I fitted the profile of those who found most benefit: Women in their mid-30s who had experienced anxiety and depression tended to respond well. “This is crazy,” he told me as we ended the call. It felt like he was the only person who truly understood how I was feeling, even though we had just met. For six days over two weeks, I would settle in that cozy recliner at the clinic, where the staff were incredible, treating me with care and compassion. A nurse would take my blood pressure, gently put a blanket over me and give me an eye mask when I forgot mine at home. The team would assess how I felt since the last infusion and decide whether to increase my dosage. I'd be set up with the IV, and someone would check in on me every 20 minutes — not that I was aware of it, as I had my music and eye mask on. Afterward, the staff would give me a carton of apple juice. My first infusion was 50 milligrams for 90 minutes, and over time increased to 95 milligrams over 75 minutes, with the addition of magnesium to alleviate anxiety. During those two weeks, the clinic became my second home. I conceived of the sessions as almost like having a vacation inside my head, in a safe and caring space. I did nothing except lie very still for an hour or two, and I diligently problem-solved everything that was bothering me. During my research, I had found a Reddit community and other forums where people exchanged recommendations for playlists to use during treatments. The advice from the clinic was to listen to “whatever makes you happy,” so I opted for Spotify-created playlists with names like “Sunshine Mix” and “Happy Mix.” For me, “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers, “Happy” by Pharell Williams, and “Adventure of a Lifetime” by Coldplay became as vital to the experience as the drug itself. In one, I was a heart-shaped rocket slowly ascending into space. Even now, I can't listen to it without remembering my experiences in those clinic rooms. In another, I saw my future self, married with a child, living in a trendy part of Brooklyn. The one time I tried a different playlist — my own, which I hadn't fully vetted prior to treatment — I ended up observing a shimmering army of multicolored skeleton soldiers marching to war. A recurring theme in my sessions was the sense that I was flying backward and upward, out of the clinic, out of Manhattan, out of New York, up into space, quietly observing the planet and the people on it. It gave me a great sense of peace to simply observe human existence from so far away. A couple of sessions in, I realized that the tension in my neck and shoulders was gone, and situations that would have upset me or caused frustration didn't bother me anymore. Nothing had materially changed in my life, but my response to challenges changed to one of quiet acceptance: In the nicest possible way, I stopped caring so much about everything, all the time. I had a newfound sense of peace and calmness that I couldn't remember experiencing for a very long time. I had no migraines during the fortnight of treatments. Just 1,000 more steps a day could reduce your risk of depression, study suggests Then think of a tree with strong, thick roots and big branches. In therapy-speak, my “window of tolerance” expanded because of the drug; now, things don't throw me off as much as they used to. Ketamine therapy in a clinic is not easily accessible since it's so expensive. While some insurance companies cover the cost of a treatment like Spravato, my insurance didn't cover ketamine therapy in the clinic. I paid $525 out of pocket for each session. I wouldn't say ketamine has cured me — I still experience anxiety and worry about the future — but it gave me a glimpse of what my therapist explained was “peak experience.” Coined by psychotherapist Abraham Maslow, a peak experience is an altered state of consciousness in which individuals experience profound euphoria and fulfillment. For me, ketamine gave me the experiential knowledge that I have everything I need to feel good, calm and secure. I attended booster sessions for a couple of months after that first two-week session, and I expect to need boosters every so often when I start feeling like the effects are wearing off. Two days after my first infusion, I went for a run. I tidied my apartment after weeks of letting the mess pile up. Things went wrong at work, and I brushed them off with an indifference that shocked me. I found that the world isn't all sadness, anxiety and worry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Zohran Mamdani was asleep on another continent, his top campaign aides wrangled over how he should sound in his statement about an off-duty police officer who had just been shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan along with three other people. Not at the expense of their values, others responded. Their candidate had already been navigating how to explain years of speeches, statements and social media posts calling for defunding the police or abolishing them entirely. At one point, as the hours ticked by while Mamdani's small inner circle debated what to say and whether to call the candidate and wake him up, some aides panicked that they weren't taking the situation seriously enough. A few outside the inner circle even started spit-balling ideas like having someone enlist former Mayor Bill de Blasio to call Mamdani. Officer Didarul Islam's death laid bare what Mamdani could be facing if he wins the November election and takes over the nation's largest metropolitan police force after intensely and extensively criticizing the police for years. But the discussions during what his advisers consider a crucial leadership moment demonstrate how present the thinking behind his longstanding anti-police positioning still is. Elizabeth Glazer, who served as a criminal justice adviser to de Blasio and current Mamdani opponent Andrew Cuomo when he was governor before starting the group Vital City, told CNN that trying to understand where Mamdani stands is like “Kremlinology watching the reviewing stand and seeing where people are.” Jeff Dinowitz, an assemblyman from the Bronx who has served with Mamdani and chairs the Codes Committee, which oversees police, said he is willing to have an open mind about why the candidate's positions are so different now that he's running for mayor. Asked if he would count Mamdani in that group, Dinowitz said, “There's no way to know.” Campaign aides declined to have Mamdani or others discuss how his positions on policing changed, or to answer specific questions about whether he still believes in what he said previously. “I will govern on my clear campaign agenda — one New Yorkers have voted for in historic numbers. “What I've repeatedly heard from rank-and-file officers is that we're making it too hard for them to perform their primary responsibility: addressing violent crime. They're overworked and often tasked with responsibilities beyond policing. I'm preparing to face this reality head on, invest in a whole-of-government approach to public safety, and prove that safety and justice are not mutually exclusive.” Five years ago, Mamdani was on a Zoom discussion forum organized by the Democratic Socialists of America's New York chapter, wearing headphones and a light red T-shirt. As organizers cycled photos of social justice protests on the screen, he dismissed body cameras as proven to have been ineffectual in stopping a Minneapolis police officer from killing George Floyd. He shrugged off “half-assed reforms in response to a system that is built on punishment of Black people.” Mamdani went on to call for a “wholesale replacement” of the political class of New York City, and for New York State to “not accept anything less than what we are demanding,” explaining of police, “we really do not need reform, we need replacement. In noting that he got an opponent to return campaign donations from one of the city's police unions, Mamdani said that the standard should be refusing all such donations because “cop money, law enforcement money, this is money that is coming from unions whose power is built on the murder of Black people across this city and across this country.” During his first run for assembly in 2020, he said, “police do not create safety for many, many people across this city in this state. Police actually create and amplify violence.” He said of how prisons “are set up in our society, I would argue that they do not work. Mamdani now says he no longer believes in defunding the police. Mamdani's campaign did not answer a CNN question about whether he had formally apologized or if his comment to the Times was itself the apology. Mamdani had his first conversations about running for mayor in the spring of 2024. He scrubbed his campaign and official websites of positions that had previously been listed there. By May 2024, he had replaced the campaign website from those runs with its DSA red-rose icon with just a photo of himself smiling and holding a cup of tea. Later that year he set its content fully to private. “We can't reform our way out of a racist police system that's working exactly as designed - as a means of control over black & brown New Yorkers. Mamdani's ultimate post on X about Officer Didarul Islam was mostly biographical, about the pregnant wife and children the officer left behind and how he told his mother that he joined the force to leave behind a proud legacy. “He has done that, and more,” the much worked-over tweet read. In part out of genuine concern and in part out of seeing an opportunity to distract from the fact that he was still not back, several aides spread word that Mamdani might be waylaid at the airport at the direction of someone in the Trump administration looking to harass him, two people familiar with the conversations tell CNN. The aides' concerns were real enough that they had been in touch with both the New York attorney general's and governor's offices in advance to prepare, and had worked out a code for Mamdani to quickly text them if he was being detained. Dinowitz, the assemblyman who served with Mamdani, has not made an endorsement in the race but he thinks there might be a gap between Mamdani's mayoral platform and what he truly believes. “When people say negative things,” Dinowitz added, “I think most reasonable people would want to see more than just your word that you've changed.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's proposal to use tariff revenue to bail out farmers experiencing harm from his administration's trade policies is putting Democrats in the crosshairs of a sticky policy fight: support relief for working-class voters or continue battling the Trump administration's economic agenda that they say is harmful to those Americans. “President Trump is desperately trying to find a way out of the mess he's made with his trade war against the world,” Craig said. “Trump's tariffs hurt farmers, but they also hurt small businesses, manufacturers and working families by making everything cost more.… stop pushing our largest trading partners into the arms of our competitors, stop the chaos in farm country.” Several House Agriculture Democrats echoed Craig's sentiments in statements to the Washington Examiner. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-MD) said Trump's tariffs have made life worse for farmers  “already facing incredible uncertainty under this administration's trade policies.” “The President's proposal sets a dangerous precedent, both for Congress' power of the purse, and for our farmers who deserve real accountability, not temporary fixes tied to unpredictable and unsettled trade decisions,” McClain Delaney said. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), another committee Democrat, argued that future legislation should focus on preventive measures rather than fixing the consequences of the administration's “reckless tariffs.” “Talk of bailouts is proof the administration knows its reckless tariffs are driving up input costs and crushing farmers and rural America in the process,” Vasquez said. “Farmers want stable prices, access to markets, and predictability — we need policy changes that could prevent farmer bankruptcies from happening in the first place.” Reinsch told the Washington Examiner that he doesn't blame farmland Democrats for sharing Craig's sentiments. He added that he believed a separate vote on using tariff revenue for farmer aid relief, which does require congressional approval, would get Democratic support. Trump's remarks come as a government shutdown looms on Oct. 1. As of Friday, Democrats and Republicans are still unable to agree on a short-term spending deal that would punt the funding deadline and allow appropriators to work on the remaining appropriations bills. Whether farm aid could be used as a bargaining chip in this CR fight or in the battle leading up to the Nov. 21 deadline remains to be seen. Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, told the Washington Examiner that “we would not get ahead of the President on any support for pending legislation.” “President Trump and [Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins] are always in touch with the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President's November victory,” Kelly said. “President Trump is delivering on his promise to cool inflation, which will lower input costs, and negotiate fairer trade deals that are opening new markets for America's agriculture industry.” House GOP leadership has largely insulated the president against any votes against his tariff policies, with a recent vote on a procedural rule successfully blocking any effort to terminate the tariffs until the end of January. Providing farm relief to offset his policies is not a new move for Trump. During his first term, relief was sent out to farmers through a series of aid packages between 2018 and 2020 that totaled more than $23 billion. So his solution, rather than undoing the policies, is to basically pay them off, which is exactly what he did in the first term.” Republicans, including House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson (R-PA), have praised Trump's comments and plans to direct portions of the tariff revenue to farmers. Thompson and Rollins have floated a farm aid package or redirecting tariff revenue to farmers in some capacity for months. “Years of Biden's broken promises, from failing to enforce the Phase 1 agreement to letting inflation run wild while foreign governments use our farmers as pawns, have devastated American agriculture,” Thompson said in a statement. 1, or the “big, beautiful bill,” signed into law in July, is set to provide $56 billion to increase agriculture programs over the next decade. When asked for comment, his office pointed the Washington Examiner to an interview with Punchbowl News, in which he criticized Democrats who would oppose the proposal. We can start with farmers and go from there.” Then came Trump's decision to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which purchased roughly $2 billion in products from farmers every year, causing significant ramifications for farmers dependent on that income. But Democrats shouldn't expect farmers to shift blue suddenly, Reinsch said. “If you talk to farmers, they'll take the money partly because a growing number of them are underwater,” Reinsch said, citing reports that farmers are projecting they may lose $100 to $200 an acre. “If somebody comes in and offers them money, that's fine, but if you ask them what they want, what they'll really say is, ‘What we want is to be able to sell our products. And what [Trump's] doing is limiting the markets rather than creating them,” Reinsch said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sherald cited censorship, which she later claimed in an op-ed had “taken hold” of the federally funded Smithsonian, cautioning that “history shows us” what happens when governments demand loyalty from cultural institutions. Aiming to eradicate “improper ideology” from its walls, per an executive order in March, the administration has taken aim at displays involving race and gender; called for the National Portrait Gallery's director to be fired (she subsequently resigned); and launched a review of exhibitions to ensure they follow the president's directive to “celebrate American exceptionalism,” demanding that the Smithsonian hand over gallery labels, information on future exhibitions and internal communications on artwork selection. On August 15, three days after President Donald Trump announced his administration's review, the group issued a statement warning of growing “threats of censorship against US museums,” describing “increasing external pressures to modify, remove, or limit exhibitions and programs.” Days later, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to call museums nationwide “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE,'” adding that — following his systematic targeting of universities — his attorneys would focus on museums next. Like universities, many American art institutions benefit from federal funding, and the Trump administration has gutted agencies that support them (and museums more broadly), with grants worth tens of millions of dollars denied or rescinded as a result. Despite a growing sense of unease, museum leaders across the country have largely remained silent. CNN sought comment from more than a dozen museum directors and other arts leaders, and those who responded spoke to a hush over the field as institutions avoid attention and, in some cases, self-censor exhibitions or programs that could provoke federal ire. Smithsonian wrestles with independence as White House review picks up “You have some really prime examples of disappointing museum leadership — museums that are deciding that being stealthy and risk-averse, and canceling (shows) or censoring artists, is the right tack,” said Alyssa Nitchun, executive director of New York's Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, the only major US museum dedicated to LGBTQ art. “And Leslie-Lohman is very much taking the opposite tack.” According to a White House official, the administration's oversight of museum content is limited to federally funded institutions and ascertaining whether taxpayer money has been “improperly used to promote ideological and partisan viewpoints.” However, the White House did not respond when asked to clarify if “federally funded” only means institutions that receive the majority of their funding from federal sources, such as the Smithsonian, or any museum that receives federal dollars. (According to a recent AAM survey, 63% of US museums said they receive federal grants, awards or contracts.) In late August, arts professionals rallied together to release a statement declaring that cultural institutions “must maintain autonomy” from political pressures or “risk becoming instruments of propaganda.” While it has thus far been signed by nearly 250 arts organizations and hundreds of individuals, major museums are conspicuous by their absence, with signatures predominately coming from arts centers, associations and regional councils. She noted her “regret” that larger museums did not sign the statement, but pointed to its wide geographical reach. “In every state and in every city, you have a signer,” she said, adding: “The fact that the entire country is behind this statement is huge and tremendous.” Asian painters were ‘othered' in Paris a century ago. According to AAM, one third of museums have had federal grants or contracts canceled — though several lawsuits are ongoing, and one museum in Pennsylvania recently dismissed its legal action after the federal goverment restored its $750,000 grant. “Every director that I know has basically zeroed out that budget line for next year and for the coming years, because we don't anticipate anything coming.” By 2024, only half of museums had recovered their pre-Covid attendance levels, according to AAM. An even more financially catastrophic blow to a museum would be losing its tax-exempt status — something with which the president has threatened other nonprofits, such as Harvard University. This is one reason why many museums are staying quiet, multiple sources told CNN. When asked, a White House official said taxpayer-funded  institutions that “persist in advancing partisan or ideological agendas” may “risk losing” their status. That power is not currently within presidential authority, though Republican lawmakers have recently tried to expand the Treasury's power to suspend tax exemption. “I think that threat is real — and it would be devastating,” said Stulen, noting that many smaller organizations likely could not weather the financial burden. Sixty percent of SAM's operating budget comes from gifts, Stulen said. Further muddying the waters, the administration has declared many DEI programs “illegal,” targeting them in both government and private sectors without clarifying how it defines DEI or its scope. (The White House official told CNN that the administration considers “illegal DEI” to be discriminatory, exclusionary and in violation of civil rights law, but did not explain further.) The National Endowment for Humanities, another federal agency that funds museum programs, has singled out grants related to DEI as grounds for termination. With the tides seemingly swelling toward social justice over the past decade, museums enthusiastically staged exhibitions spotlighting Black, Indigenous, AAPI and queer artists; promoted curators of color to prominent roles; and acknowledged colonial systems by repatriating looted art and publishing Indigenous land acknowledgements. There is, she said, a growing disconnect between wealthy board members, who guide a museum's spending decisions and oversee its directors, and the values their museums promote. “A lot of institutions and organizations are looking at how they got into this stew of having a board of directors whose main purpose is to give a lot of money and how that qualifies them to make values-based decisions for an institution that purports to be values-based,” she said. The administration's current crusade against DEI is, she added, coded. That includes not just histories of Whiteness, but histories of every race and ethnicity represented in the United States,” she said in a phone call. In addition to targeting diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which are often internal initiatives at an organization, the White House has also singled out Smithsonian exhibitions, programs, artworks and texts — many of them related to race, identity, sexuality and disability — that it finds objectionable. Various official decisions have meanwhile prompted claims of erasure, from the Pentagon stripping the name of history-making gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk from a US Navy ship to information about Harriet Tubman being removed from a federal website, then restored following backlash. Earlier this month, the infamous 1863 photo of a formerly enslaved man's scarred back became a flashpoint when the Washington Post reported that officials had ordered its removal, along with other signs and exhibits related to slavery, at an unidentified national park, though the US Interior Department later denied the reports to CNN. On the Trump administration's language around diversity, Sadao asked: “What is it signaling? Despite being a cultural flashpoint, Americans broadly support public funding for art. A 2023 survey commissioned by Americans for the Arts (AFTA) found that backing for the arts “transcends political divisions,” with four in five Democrats and three in five Republicans and Independents surveyed favoring government funding for arts and culture organizations. But while many Americans may not yet feel the direct impact of museum sector turbulence, Sadao warned that “fewer people are going to feel welcome or just even be able to access art.” “It's poignant to be showing these works at this moment in time when the culture wars are alive and well.” Huge archive of drag culture takes on new urgency in today's political climate SAM, meanwhile, is currently hosting the largest ever US exhibition of the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei — a show about political power structures and resistance that, Stulen noted, is timely.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservatives aren't learning the right lesson from Charlie Kirk's assassination. That's my conclusion after watching Kirk's funeral service on Sunday. If there was a common thread among the many speakers, it was that conservatives must do as Charlie did, and redouble our commitment to open, honest, and respectful debate. It's even more essential that conservatives redouble our commitment to reclaiming the commanding heights of American culture. Because the Left has corrupted our culture to such an extent that it cost Charlie Kirk his life. Don't get me wrong: Conservatives should absolutely engage in debate. Our ideas are inherently better than the Left's. All they have is faith in the power of government — and it's diametrically opposed to individual freedom and family life. But we don't have a fair debate — not even close. The legacy media is uniformly controlled by leftists. Higher education is proof that while the Soviet Union fell, communism won. And going back decades — even under Republican administrations — the vast apparatus of the federal government has steadily advanced a far-left line. At every level of society, leftists have indoctrinated people to believe that power is the only thing that matters. So it's no surprise that, in pursuit of total power, liberals are increasingly stooping to violence. We saw it in the assassination attempts against President Donald Trump last year. Now we've seen it in the successful killing of Charlie Kirk. And we've even seen it in the leftist reaction to that awful, evil, immoral act. In the days since Kirk's murder, liberals have fallen over themselves to denounce not only his killing, but also his views. In Congress, nearly 100 Democrats — including party bigwigs such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — refused to vote for a resolution honoring him. By attacking Kirk even in death, the Left is tacitly encouraging those who target conservatives with violence. No open, honest, respectful debate can truly challenge this far-left dominance of our culture. Only one thing can: defeating their institutions while building new ones of our own. This is the truth that conservatives must learn — now more than ever. Trump is shredding leftist control in parts of D.C., while a growing number of conservatives are investing in institutions such as movie studios, new universities and education models, and media outlets and social media. But as exciting as Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was, the truth is that conservatives need orders of magnitude more action and investment. It's not enough to drive Stephen Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel off the air; they must be replaced with conservatives or, failing that, faced with conservative competition that blows them out of the water. Put simply, we need the dominant cultural institutions in America. Charlie Kirk's murder should give us an unprecedented sense of urgency. The Left is increasingly violent — and it will keep getting worse so long as leftists control the cultural levers. But the best thing we can do to honor Charlie Kirk is rebuild the America he believed in. John Tillman is CEO of the American Culture Project.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. But while the market's climb may be inflating their accounts, they are more exposed than ever to a potential market slump. Direct and indirect stock holdings, including in mutual funds or retirement plans, accounted for an all-time high of 45% of households' financial assets in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve data. The record-high stock ownership raises red flags about whether a market downturn could hit Americans' personal finances — especially in an economy with an increasingly fragile labor market and stubborn inflation. The milestone is a product of multiple factors: stocks have hit record highs, boosting the value of holdings; more Americans are directly participating in the stock market; and retirement plans like 401(k)s that invest in the stock market have risen in popularity in recent decades. Record-high stocks are generally good — that lets more people benefit from Corporate America's gains, especially long-term investors. Because so many people now own and have so much of their money in stocks, the market has more influence on the economy, for good or ill, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. Notably, Americans' stock ownership has surpassed that of the late 1990s, just before dot-com bubble burst, said John Higgins, chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics. “That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins said in a note to clients. “Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next,” Higgins added. “But the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.” The S&P 500 has rallied 33% since hitting a low point on April 8. The benchmark index is up 13% since January 1 and has notched 28 record highs this year. Big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have surged, lifting major indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by companies' market value. The Magnificent Seven tech stocks — including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500's gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. AI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out It's not just American households that are holding record levels of stocks. Foreign investors' share of US stocks also hit a record high in the second quarter, according to Fed data. History shows that when levels of stock ownership are at record highs, the risk of a downturn and the potential for below-average returns increases, according to Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research. “Investors shouldn't expect the same magnitude of returns that we've seen during the last decade to repeat,” Anderson said. That's in part because the job market, where most Americans make the bulk of their money, is stagnating, while the stock market, which is how wealthy people tend to make their money, is surging. “Those who have a high degree of wealth in the stock market feel like they're doing extraordinarily well,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. “Those who don't, who are largely tied to employment as their primary asset, feel much more constrained in today's society.” That is creating distortions in economic data, too, helping to paint a rosier overall picture than the one many Americans are feeling in their lives. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans “The stock market becomes a bigger economic driver when you've got that much exposure,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
