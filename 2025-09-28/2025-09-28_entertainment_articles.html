That a movie like “Anemone” could only have been made by the forces of nepotism that govern it — it's directed by Ronan Day-Lewis, and co-written by his father and the film‘s star Daniel Day-Lewis — is not something to ignore, but this dark, dense, deep two-hander about the Troubles in Ireland turns out to be quite better than you'd expect from that notion. Daniel Day-Lewis stars as a former British soldier who defected from the Irish Republican Army after a particularly traumatizing incident involving a dead civilian, with his brother, played by Sean Bean, taking over his life in the process: his wife (Samantha Morton) and son (Samuel Bottomley), who in the present day has become a traumatized beater.

Ones that aren't only linked to its star, who comes back out from the acting retirement hole to deliver a performance that is typically great, with a monologue about taking an actual shit on a priest that formerly abused him (and spared his brother, Sean Bean) that goes up in the Daniel Day-Lewis hall of fame. We are ever meant to question the narrative reliability here. While “Anemone” stutters in its final gasp of breath, with a closing segment that too tidily binds up its prickly narrative branches, the movie does manage to suck you into a whirlpool of pain and suffering that becomes oddly addictive. “Anemone” isn't destined for box office gold, despite its star's seasoned imprimatur, the movie too cold to the touch and reliant on Irish-British history that forces you to listen closely to plot details expounded in drawn-out speeches. It's shot by cinematographer Ben Fordesman with the style and grayed-out flourish of a supernatural horror movie, even as Ray Stoker's (Daniel Day-Lewis) traumas are completely grounded in the real world. He's contending with “a crack in the ice that wouldn't heal over” after fleeing, some years ago, to the woods to live out the rest of his days after being deemed a war criminal by his compatriots. His brother Jem (Sean Bean) took on duties of caring for Ray's abandoned wife and child in the process, and now that grown-up son Brian (Bottomley) has himself been conscripted into the military, and was recently sent home for attacking a fellow serviceman for daring to speak his father's name. Ray lives in filth in a hovel outpost in the middle-of-nowhere woods of North England, filthy enough that it's noticed by Jem, who's been jettisoned to recover him in order to speak some sense into Brian after his latest brush with pain, that he can barely wipe his own ass. “Ever hear about the Troubles?” Nessa (Morton) bluntly asks her son after he brings a box of Ray's former war correspondences down from the attic. “Anemone” does not proceed to give us a history lesson about the particulars of the thorny battles between Catholics and Protestants, royalists and independents. In fact, if you're not caught up on your 20th-century European history, “Anemone” might not mean a whole hell of a lot to you, though Ronan Day-Lewis harks back to a bombing that emotionally scarred Ray with spareness and reserve. There are also shots of Daniel Day-Lewis contemplating his own despair against the flickering flames of a bonfire that will bring “There Will Be Blood” and Daniel Plainview to mind, a man who has built up his hatred little by little over the years, and now has only venom to spew. There is a hallucinatory late sequence in which Ray encounters a translucent dream creature that may or may not resemble his son; then, there is a hailstorm whose ensemble-linking gravitas recalls just a bit too closely that final frog-raining scene in “Magnolia,” a deus ex machina event tacked on to tie the whole thing together, but less pungent here. It's a movie about lost souls, and how abuse begets further abuse and violence, even as Ray, the self-styled fugitive, has abandoned his life to try and prevent his son from absorbing his worst aspects. This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn't placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It's disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can't put them back together again. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.

In a video circulated widely by CBS 6 News, one fan attempts to climb onto the stage, at which point they appear to be pepper-sprayed by a sheriff's deputy. Turnstile bassist Franz Lyons can also be seen covering his eyes and running towards the back of the stage. On Friday, September 26, Richmond Sheriff Antionette Irving told CBS 6 that the alleged pepper spray incident is currently under investigation. When reached by Pitchfork, the Richmond City Sheriff's Office offered no further comment. Turnstile are currently touring North America in support of Never Enough, with support from Speed, Jane Remover, Amyl and the Sniffers, Mannequin Pussy, and Blood Orange.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As AI talent studio Xicoia unveils its first digitally generated “actor” Tilly Norwood to Hollywood, the avatar's real-life peers have some opinions. Following Deadline's report that several talent agencies are interested in signing Norwood, Melissa Barrera, Kiersey Clemons and more actors have suggested a boycott of such agencies after Xicoia founder Eline Van der Velden teased during a Zurich Summit panel that high-profile projects will be utilizing the technology in the near future. “Hope all actors repped by the agent that does this, drop their a$$,” wrote Barrera on her Instagram Story with Deadline's report. “Not an actress actually,” commented Nicholas Alexander Chavez. “Hey @sagaftra any thoughts here?” wrote Jenna Leigh Green, following the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes that partially centered around acceptable AI uses. “And what about the hundreds of living young women whose faces were composited together to make her? You couldn't hire any of them?” she wrote. Despite the dystopian vibes of the innovation that is Tilly, some voiced their disapproval with a bit of levity. Trace Lysette added in her own comment, “She cut me in line at lunch one day and didn't even say excuse me. Part of AI production studio Particle6, Deadline exclusively announced Van der Velden's launch of Xicoia this week at the Zurich Film Festival conference, designed to create, manage and monetize a new generation of hyperreal digital stars. “We were in a lot of boardrooms around February time, and everyone was like, ‘No, this is nothing. It's not going to happen,'” said Van der Velden during Saturday's panel, moderated by Deadline's Diana Lodderhose. “Then, by May, people were like, ‘We need to do something with you guys.' When we first launched Tilly, people were like, ‘What's that?' And now we're going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months.” Xicoia is focused on creating AI talent for use in everything from film and TV productions to podcasts, TikTok, YouTube, brand campaigns and video games – as well as interactions with fans. Operating on a hybrid model of human creative oversight and autonomous AI responsiveness, they'll come equipped with complete backstories, distinct voices, evolving narrative arcs and fully realized personalities, as well as the ability to engage in unscripted conversations, perform monologues, respond to trends in real time and adapt tone and references to suit platform-specific audiences.

There's a healthy tradition of comedians invading morning television. From Mark Proksch showing off his yo-yo skills as his alter ego, K-Strauss, to Gianmarco Soresi shouting out his “cousin,” Luigi Mangione, live on the air, the unexpected burst of darkness tends to catch morning news anchors off guard. With his brief but hilarious interview on Fox 5 San Diego, we can add Connor O'Malley to the list.

Popping in to promote his “Comedic Humor Tour” with the wake-up crew in San Diego, O'Malley brought his parody of lonely, disaffected, and deeply redpilled men to people just having their first cup of morning joe. O'Malley, known for his spoofs of the male loneliness problem and the terminally online, didn't shy away from his interests. He tells a perfectly game Raoul Martinez that his show is a “medical” one about curing pornography addiction and that he's working with the government to fight antifa. The comedian also doesn't shy away from Hollywood gossip, saying that Seth Meyers fired O'Malley from his job at Late Night for political reasons (O'Malley is a “Branch Davidian”), but that his old boss is “definitely a nice guy.” Whoever booked O'Malley deserves a raise.

I just don't think these things are either or. It's my deepest wish that people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with.” Emma Watson Says She Still "Treasures" J.K. Rowling Despite Their Trans Dispute 'Harry Potter' Star Says She Was Barred From Fan Convention Due to OnlyFans Page In response, the iconic author said she would not forgive Watson nor her Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe for going against her views. Watson played Hermione Granger throughout the blockbuster film franchise from 2001 to 2011.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I'm sorry to those who will be disappointed by this," the singer wrote. Lola Young is taking time to rest and recover after collapsing onstage during a recent performance in New York City. The announcement came just one day after Young collapsed mid-song during her Saturday night (Sept. 27) set at All Things Go at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York. She added, “I hope you'll all give me another chance in the future. Following her post, fellow artists and fans flooded the comments with messages of support. !” while Aurora added, “I am so happy to see these comments … I'm so glad you're doing what's right for YOU, it's very easy to forget when you feel so much responsibility … much love and hugs to the end of the world.” Young's onstage collapse occurred Saturday during a live performance of her 2023 single “Conceited.” Midway through the song, she appeared to pause to communicate with her keyboardist but collapsed before reaching them. She remained on the ground for roughly 30 to 45 seconds before being carried off. Later that day, Young reassured fans through an Instagram Story. “For anyone who saw my set at all things go today, I am doing okay now,” she wrote. The incident followed another last-minute cancellation two days earlier (Sept. 26), when Young was pulled from Audacy's We Can Survive concert at New Jersey's Prudential Center. Her manager, Nick Shymansky, shared an update at the time, citing a “sensitive matter.” “Lola is very open about her mental health and there are very occasionally days where myself and my team have to take protective measures to keep her safe,” Shymansky wrote on Instagram.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the sequel to society's digital rise and fall is currently in the works with Aaron Sorkin and Sony, don't expect Andrew Garfield to reprise his role in The Social Network Part II. “Eduardo is in Singapore having a good time.” Indeed, Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Singapore in 2009, which he insisted “was based solely on my interest in working and living” in the Asian country, amid speculation he made the move to avoid a massive tax bill. “I am obligated to and will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the United States government. I have paid and will continue to pay any taxes due on everything I earned while a U.S. citizen. Set in 2003, The Social Network dramatized the events surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) founding of Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits it sparker, including one from his former Harvard friend Eduardo Saverin (Garfield). Following the original movie's three Oscar wins and five nominations, Sorkin revealed last year that he has an idea for the sequel. “Look, yeah, I'll be writing about this. I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said at WME's White House Correspondents Dinner pre-party. Jeremy Strong will take over the role of Zuckerberg, with Mikey Madison as whistleblower Frances Haugen and Jeremy Allen White as Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horowitz, who broke a series of articles known as ‘The Facebook Files'.

In The Ballad of a Small Player, Edward Berger's adaptation of Lawrence Osborne's 2014 novel, Colin Farrell plays Lord Doyle, an Irish con man and high roller in Macau whose luck, he fears, may be about to run out. Growing up in Dublin, Farrell had no plans to act. Wagner Moura on 'The Secret Agent' and Confronting Authoritarianism, From Bolsonaro to Trump: Zurich His dream of a professional soccer career ended when, “I started drinking and smoking and all that stuff.” Acting came via his sister Catherine, who went to theater school. “It was the first time in my life when I heard that she was going to, quote, unquote, study acting. I didn't think it was something you could apply yourself to within a formal structure.” Farrell landed a role in the popular BBC series Ballykissangel and got his first film role in Tim Roth's directorial debut The War Zone (1999) — alongside his The Ballad of a Small Player co-star Tilda Swinton. But it was Joel Schumacher who changed everything, casting the still-unknown Irishman in Tigerland (2000) as a young soldier going through boot camp before heading over to Vietnam. “Joel kind of changed my life,” Farrell said. He took a chance on an Irish kid.” “I got to work with Al Pacino in my third year of acting on film. The thing I understand now, at 49, is that there's no earning the degree of good fortune that came my way.” “At a certain point, big Hollywood stopped calling. It might have been the first job I did sober,” he recalled. Farrell has also managed to slip back into blockbuster territory, most memorably as the Penguin in Matt Reeves' The Batman. Being cast, he said, was a dream come true for “that child in Dublin who used to draw Batman signals on his jeans.” But he admitted, on first read, he didn't get Reeves' take on the cartoon villain. I thought he was a bit silly, a bit of a putz.” It wasn't until Reeves showed him the mockup of how Farrell would look, unrecognizable, in his Penguin makeup, that the penny dropped. It just gave me so much information,” Farrell said. “I can do five hours a day riffing as the Penguin, and even my sense of humor changes. Farrell will be back as the Penguin in Reeves' The Batman: Part II, even though he says, “I've got an even smaller role in this one. But it's deeper, scarier, the stakes are bigger. Working on The Ballad of a Small Player also pushed Farrell into new territory. A fan of Edward Berger's since his 2018 Showtime series Patrick Melrose, Farrell had been talking to the German director about Small Player “since before [Berger's Oscar-winning movies] All Quiet on the Western Front and Conclave.” It's incredibly loud, the colors are brash and bombastic. As for his character, Lord Doyle, Farrell described him as “somebody who's on the precipice of insanity…he's living in an incredibly aggressive kind of spiritual or emotional vacuum, with no connection to anyone. Like all addicts, regardless of what the addiction is, who inevitably end up in an emotional or spiritual vacuum.” Reflecting on what has been an extraordinary career with its share of awards — the Golden Icon honor follows a decade of awards heat, from a Golden Globe win and best actor nomination for The Banshees of Inisherin to a best actor Emmy nomination for The Penguin, Farrell said he's wary of the seductions that come with accolades. The point isn't winning, he argued; it's staying connected. “Winning an award is a little bit of separation. The real juice is just being part of the community, when you and another group of actors are told: You did OK.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

It followed Bill and Barb Putman, their four children, and their extended family, all of whom lived together under one roof in Michigan. Fans rushed to pay their respects following this sad news. A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman) “I come to you with a heavy heart asking for your prayers. They have gone home to be with the Lord. Please keep Uncle Blake, Lulu, Alena, Noah, and Gia in your prayers as they remain in the hospital, we are asking for complete healing and strength for each of them,” the post said. “My entire family — Papa, Neenee, Billy, Jen, Brandon, Kacie, Blake, Megan, Jamie, Blair, myself (Isabelle), Abby, Emma, Addison, Bella, Mercy, Gabby, Noah, Mya, Nova, Lulu, Alena, Gia, Jonah, Eli, Solomon, Uriah, Samson, Luke, and Anna — all proclaim that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. “Thank you for every prayer, message, and act of love. Your support means more than words can express. Please continue to lift us up, that our hearts remain fixed on the truth that Jesus conquered death so we could have eternal life.” “My heart is broken for your entire family. You all will continue to be in my prayers during this time. Sending love to your family,” one person wrote. “I'm incredibly shaken to hear of this great tragedy. Sending so much love and prayers for the rest of you in these coming days. Thankful for the hope that you have to be reunited some day,” another person commented.

One Battle is also seen as a major awards contender and is likely to generate press and word-of-mouth for many months. The film's second weekend performance will be a better indicator in terms of its staying power. The movie earned $4.6 million in North America from 412 IMAX screens, or roughly 20 percent of the film's total domestic ticket sales. One Battle stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a washed-up and burnt-out revolutionary who is called back into action when his daughter (Chase Infiniti) is kidnapped by his former nemesis (Sean Penn). Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor round out the cast. The Hollywood Reporter's review of the film from Richard Lawson reads, “One Battle After Another is a furious film, a richly engaging and persuasive polemic from a filmmaker who has never shied from provocation but who has not before spoken so directly to his audience.” One Battle is director Anderson's biggest opening weekend in a career that spans Boogie Nights to Licorice Pizza. Anderson's There Will Be Blood is his highest-earning title to date, with $40 million in North American ticket sales. As for Warners, the studio has been on a hot streak as of late, beginning with Minecraft ($957 million, globally), followed by Ryan Coogler's Sinners ($366 million, globally), and New Line offering Weapons ($264 million, globally). Gabby's Dollhouse, a combination of live-action and CG animation, is based on the wildly popular streaming animated children's series of the same name that debuted in 2021 and has since premiered eleven seasons (the twelfth season is due out in November on Netflix). Internationally, the film opened in 37 territories, including Australia and Mexico. Elsewhere, Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures' Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, which had a record-setting U.S. opening of $70 million, came in at No. The film's domestic total sits at $118.1 million after three weeks in theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardi B took the Global Citizen Festival stage by storm on Saturday night, rocking a baby bump and new songs alongside her earlier hits at Central Park in New York. Accompanied by a bevy of dancers dressed in camo shorts and white T-shirts and her DJ, their commander of the night turned up the heat with her performance, and while initially wearing a short camo jacket. “Now that you guys have seen my outfit, mother is hot, hold on,” she said after performing “Outside.” She then tossed the coat to one lucky fan in the audience. before launching into “ErrTime,” commanding the stage as she grooved across it and twerked. For “Bodak Yellow,” she hit a side-stage catwalk that brought her closer to the crowd as the audience sang along to every word. She closed with a twerk-filled, electric “I Like It.” Global Citizen organizers announced that Cardi was added to the lineup mere days before the event was to take place after the Weeknd pulled out for “personal reasons.” Rosé was also tapped to perform earlier this week. Ozzy Osbourne Seemed 'Normal' The Day Before His Death, Andrew Watt Says Cardi released her sophomore album, Am I the Drama?, earlier this month. Dubbed the Little Miss Drama Tour, it kicks off on Feb. 11 in Palm Desert, California at Acrisure Arena. Shakira, Tyla, Mariah the Scientist, and Ayra Starr also performed at this year's Global Citizen Festival edition. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Bryan was only a few songs into his show at Ann Arbor's Michigan Stadium on Saturday when he shouted, “Thank you so much for the best night of my life.” And later, during “Dawns,” he marveled, “This might be the craziest thing I've ever done.” What could be so crazy about a show at Michigan Stadium? Football fans in Ann Arbor are used to setting attendance records. Final attendance figures are not yet available, but organizers announced before the show that more than 112,000 tickets had been sold, which would eclipse the 110,905 mark set by George Strait at Texas A&M's Kyle Field last year. For a guy like Bryan, who was still in the Navy four years ago and was playing small clubs as late as 2022, crazy indeed. Just as crazy: Throughout its 98-year history, the Big House had never hosted a concert (unless you count a small show organized in 1987 by legendary football coach Bo Schembechler's wife, Millie Schembechler, to warn a crowd of 5,000 high-schoolers of the dangers of substance abuse). It might be an impossible task to work every bit of a 112,0000-strong crowd, but Bryan was up for the challenge. From there, Bryan effortlessly moved between quiet, self-reflective acoustic songs (“God Speed,” “28”) and country-rock anthems (“Quittin' Time,” “Revival”). Bryan, setting up on a field where Michigan legends like Tom Brady, Charles Woodson and Tshimanga Biakabutuka once played, let a boisterous band of at least 15 as they tore through nearly 30 songs. He employed a four-pointed stage (Zach's “omnidirectional stage,” as fellow performer John Mayer quipped) at midfield that allowed Bryan to play to each side of the stadium throughout the set. Volatile Midwestern fall weather was no issue, as it was a warm and cloudless night, and the scene outside the stadium looked not unlike a Michigan football Saturday, as fans tailgated along South Main Street and in the surrounding neighborhoods. Despite the success of his tour, Bryan has hit some rough patches recently. That led to a pair of diss tracks from LaPaglia's boss, Barstool founder and podcast cohost (and Michigan football superfan) Dave Portnoy, aimed at Bryan; Bryan's response was to burn a Bartsool flag before hitting it with a golf club. More recently, Bryan's feud with fellow country singer Gavin Adcock came to a head when Bryan was captured on video scaling a fence to confront Adcock at Oklahoma's Born & Raised Festival earlier this month. Ryan Bingham Drops New Song 'The Lucky Ones,' Will Play It at Zach Bryan Stadium Show ‘I Didn't Take the Zach Bryan Bait': Gavin Adcock Details Backstage Altercation Zach Bryan Scales Fence to Confront Gavin Adcock at Oklahoma Festival Mayer has been a part of Dead & Company for a decade now, and the band spent parts of the past two years in residence at the Sphere in Las Vegas before celebrating the Dead's 60th anniversary with a series of shows in Golden Gate Park last month. Mayer steered away from the megahits of his youth in favor of a career sampler that included a soulful rendition of 2006's “Gravity” and the breezy “Who Says,” during which Mayer substituted “Ann Arbor” for “Austin” in the chorus. From his more recent catalog, the delicate and disillusioned “I Guess I just Feel Like” from Sob Rock showed how much Mayer has matured since he launched onto the scene with 2001's Room for Squares. Mayer's time with Dead & Company has left a mark on his guitar playing. While he's always been a virtuoso, these days Mayer seems less interested in blues-rock shredding and showing off as he does in finding out where Jerry Garcia's more fluid and laid-back improvisational style might take him. When Bryan missed a line, a look of embarrassment shot across his face as he turned to Mayer and said, “I told John I wouldn't mess this up, and here we are.” Mayer didn't seem to mind, though, and he didn't miss a beat as he perfectly channeled a Garcia guitar solo. Mayer wasn't Bryan's only guest: He also brought out the War and Treaty to sing “Hey Driver,” a duet from Bryan's 2023 self-titled album. 'Get On to the Next Fight, Don't Give Up': P.T. Keenan O'Meara and Joshua Slone each played solo sets to start the evening. Saturday's show marked the end of Bryan's summer stadium and festival tour, which saw him play before crowds of 65,000 on consecutive nights at London's Hyde Park and 80,000 at Notre Dame Stadium as well as shows in Dublin, New York, and San Francisco. Impressive venues to be sure, but the Big House will stay on his mind: He punctuated a rendition of his hit “I Remember Everything” with a heartfelt, “I'll remember this forever, Michigan.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Still the team behind the Luca Guadagnino-directed campus thriller, which explores the fallout when promising PhD candidate Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses Andrew Garfield‘s professor character Hank of sexual misconduct and how this affects Maggie's mentor Alma (Julia Roberts), who's also close friends and colleagues with Hank, did answer some questions following After The Hunt‘s New York Film Festival premiere Friday night. When asked how much they wanted to know about what was left unresolved for the audience, Garfield, Edebiri and Michael Stuhlbarg all seemed to welcome the film's ambiguity. … I think there is a kind of a reckoning that this person, who believes himself to be a kind of humanist and a kind of great professor … and a guy that's trying to open and unlock all of his students and someone who's daring and trying to get people closer to the edges of their own hearts and the centers of their own hearts, that he's faced with something that he hadn't previously recognized in himself.” Stuhlbarg, who plays Alma's psychiatrist husband Frederick, added that the word “ambiguity” felt “very appropriate for this experience.” “It's like watching a slow motion train wreck,” he said of the film's story. And that was kind of the experience, ambiguous, of playing it is that, you know, there's many layers to this gorgeous text and to these extraordinary performers, and you kind of throw yourself into it to pull out what you think is going to be useful, and then you throw yourself into it and things happen. And Edebiri, in particular, praised the rehearsal period at Roberts' house as giving them license to explore different interpretations. “We were just getting to excavate this text together, and I feel like there were just early conversations that we were having with each other, and also that I was having with Luca, where I feel like it was like we were getting permission, in a way, to, like, fill in the blanks where we needed to fill them in, and then where there needed to be space and ambiguity, or in moments with each other, to maybe find things that are more primal, we just got license to do that,” she said. “Being able to have that license to, I don't know, sometimes, like, fool each other, fool ourselves, I think was really freeing.” And while Roberts wouldn't reveal what she thought truly happened or if she even wanted to know that to play Alma, she did have an answer for what she thinks the film, which has been described as a #MeToo story and one about the world of academia, is truly about and it's found in the film's abundance of music. “I think that he always felt that this beautiful story that [screenwriter] Nora [Garrett] wrote us was about love and forgiveness and trying to understand who we really are deep inside of ourselves and why we posture and do the things that we do.” Specifically, Garrett says, she saw the philosophy professor as “a woman who has such outward success but such inward self-denialism and if there was something that could cause that inward self-denialism to crumble a little bit or fracture a little bit, how that would change her life and how she would live her life.” And as for the “unreadable” elements of Alma, as THR‘s review of After the Hunt noted, Garrett said, “She has a lot of internal machinations and because she's not looking fully at herself she's also going to project something which confuses what you might believe to be her internal drive.” Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody and Allan Mandelbaum produced the film through Imagine's first-look deal with Amazon MGM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lewis Hamilton asked fans for their love and support after his dog Roscoe was placed in a coma. The F1 Driver posted on his Instagram, revealing the news along with sharing numerous photos of him by his dog's side. “Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts,” Hamilton wrote. Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped. “We don't know whether he will wake from this. Hamilton was set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu replaced him. Many comments were left under Hamilton's post, showing love and support. “i'm so sorry lewis.. sending love and prayers ❤️‍🩹,” singer Demi Lovato commented. My Penelope passed away 3 years ago, and even today, before I fall asleep, I still shed tears for her ❤️‍🩹,” DJ Deborah De Luca said. Lewis Hamilton's dog has his own Instagram account. “I'm a vegan bulldog that loves to travel, play ball and get attention from all the girls, especially when they rub my bum. Here are the Formula 1 driver standings for this season:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has become increasingly clear, over the last few years of internet life, that no basic survival skill can trump the ability to smell horseshit in all its many and various forms. It is, after all, everywhere these days: Flooding social media, seeping into occasional Hollywood projects, and most especially spouting, in colorful and creative arcs, from the mouths of people working to make money off of the gold rush fad occurring around generative artificial intelligence. The pair were being interviewed by Deadline about their current spate of products, when Van Der Velden made a really weird statement: That her company Xicoia's new “virtual actress,” a collection of AI video and voice that the firm calls “Tilly Norwood,” would soon be signed by a Hollywood agency. Van Der Velden, who describes Xicoia as a “virtual talent studio,” didn't give any specifics about who'd step up to perform this alleged act of big-money deal-making, but was happy to use the untested assertion as part of a narrative she and Puhm were pushing, suggesting that filmmakers are softening, sometimes secretly, on the use of AI in making movies and TV. Hollywood talent agencies like a faddish publicity stunt as much as the next people, and the raw PR value of “First agency to sign an AI ‘actor'!” could easily lure people into embarrassing territory. (A couple of weeks ago, a little-known record label called Hallwood Media got itself some headlines by signing an AI user named Telisha “Nikki” Jones, who's used genAI tools to create music and visuals for a fake musician called “Xania Monet.”) But it's just as clear that the narrative that Van Der Velden and Puhm are selling—buoyed along with headlines like Deadline‘s guileless “Talent agents circle AI actress Tilly Norwood”—are so strident precisely because the whole system only works if people buy into the horseshit. For what it's worth, you can evaluate “Tilly's” “performance” for yourself: Van Der Velden has been soft-launching the model in various little avenues of social media, including an Instagram “comedy sketch” that—and we can only speak for ourselves—produces such a hideous uncanny valley effect in its attempt to replicate the way human bodies and mouths move that it gave us a full-on case of the screaming fantods. It never pays to underestimate people who think they can find money by digging into copious mounds of horseshit because, as we've said, it seems to be our last remaining renewable resource. Even so—you don't necessarily want to shake their hands in the aftermath, yeah?
