            • At least two people were killed and eight others were wounded today in a shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, police said.
    


            • Authorities say a gunman rammed a vehicle through the front of the church during a large service, began shooting and then intentionally set a fire that grew into a large blaze. Police believe they may still find victims in the burned-out building.
    


            • Officers exchanged fire with the gunman and killed him, according to police. Investigators have identified the man as Thomas Jacob Sanford, a 40-year-old from the nearby city of Burton.
    


            • Grand Blanc is a suburb of Flint, Michigan, and is about an hour's drive north of Detroit.
    


            Evidence technicians are inside the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, and are processing the scene after the large fire following today's shooting was extinguished, a law enforcement source told CNN.
    


            Authorities are currently working to determine whether additional victims may be inside after this morning's deadly attack.
    


            Earlier, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said they believe the suspect “deliberately” set fire to the church. The police chief said investigators are “still trying to determine exactly when and where that fire ended up coming from and how it got started.”
    


            He added that police believe more people were “near the fire and they were unable to get out of the church.”
    


CNN's Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this post. 



            It took police less than a minute to respond to this morning's shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, according to police. Within 10 minutes, the suspected shooter was dead.
    


            “That call came out at 10:25 a.m. and 32 seconds,” Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said in a news conference. “We had officers on scene at 10:25 and 57 seconds.”
    


            The suspect “was neutralized at 10:33,” in the church parking lot, Renye added.
    


            Authorities said they will hold their next news conference at 8 p.m. ET to provide updates on the investigation into the fatal attack at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan.
    


            Two people were killed and multiple were wounded after 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford opened fire on congregants at the church, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye confirmed. Authorities believe Sanford intentionally started a fire at the church as well, he said.
    


            One of the 8 victims injured in Sunday's attack is in critical condition, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said at a Sunday afternoon news conference.
    


            Seven other victims shot in the attack are in stable condition, he said.
    


            Police had previously said a total of 8 people were shot and injured and two were killed. The shooter is also dead.
    


            Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye identified the suspect in today's fatal attack at The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints as 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford.
    


            Authorities are holding a news conference about the deadly shooting and fire that occurred at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan.
    


            We'll have more posts with the latest information soon.
    


            Sunday's attack occurred at a chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a religious faith with millions of followers that was founded in New York in the 19th century.
    


            Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, where a gunman attacked congregants at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is located outside Flint and is about an hour from Detroit by car.
    


            At least two people have died and multiple people are wounded after a 40-year-old man rammed his car into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, this morning before opening fire on worshippers and setting the building ablaze, authorities said.
    


            The gunman is dead and the motive remains unknown as authorities investigate the incident.
    


Here's what else we know so far about the shooting and fire:



The gunman: Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye identified the suspect as a 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan. Renye said the suspect used an assault rifle during the attack. Two officers were involved in a shootout and killed the suspect, he said, and police believe there is only one person involved. “We believe we have the guy who did this,” Renye said.
    


The victims: At least two people are confirmed dead and there are eight gunshot victims, including some who are in critical condition. The wounded have been transported to local hospitals, the police chief said. Children are among those hurt, a source familiar with the incident told CNN. Authorities said they believe they will find more victims after they secure the scene of the fire.
    


The shooting: The gunman drove his car into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and opened fire on congregants during a large service. “He then exited his vehicle firing several rounds at individuals within the church,” Renye said.
    


The fire: Authorities believe the suspect “deliberately” set fire to the church. The police chief said investigators are “still trying to determine exactly when and where that fire ended up coming from and how it got started.” He added they believe more people were “near the fire and they were unable to get out of the church.” The fire has since been extinguished.
    


The investigation:  Authorities will execute a search warrant at the suspect's residence and go through cell phone records to “find out if there was a motive,” Renye said. He said the FBI has allocated “100 agents to the area” to help get statements from witnesses. Separately, a source told CNN a bomb squad was assessing a suspicious item found on church property.
    


            The police chief said he will provide another update at 5 p.m. ET.
    


This post has been updated with the latest status on victims.  



            Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye provided a phone number and location for those looking to reunify with family members following this morning's deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
    


            In a video posted to Facebook, Renye said those looking to reunify with family members can call this number:  248-705-7352.
    


            “That number will lead to you the Red Cross who is on scene over there at Trillium” where there are several people who were at the church when the incident took place and “they will be able to tell you where your family member is at,” the police chief said.
    


            Resources will also be available to the wider Grand Blanc community at the township's police department, he said. Starting tomorrow and throughout the week, from 8 a.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET, counselors at the department will be on staff and available to talk to the community, Renye said.
    


            Another victim has died from a gunshot wound sustained during the Sunday shooting, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said in a video posted on Facebook.
    


            That brings the total death toll to at least two, after police previously said at least one person was killed. At least 8 other people were injured. The shooter is also dead.
    


            Extra law enforcement officers are being deployed to places of worship across Los Angeles and New York City following a deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, according to officials.
    


            Increasing police patrols at religious locations is a common practice in major cities after a significant attack on a place of worship occurs.
    


            Both the Los Angeles Police Department and the New York City Police Department are increasing patrols out of an abundance of caution, officials say.
    


            Today's shooting is the latest attack on a house of worship in the United States. Just over a month ago, on August 27, a shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and wounding 14 others, as well as three elderly parishioners, as they prayed.
    


            As we continue to gather more reporting on the attack on a church in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, we are also awaiting an update from officials.
    


            Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said another media briefing would be held at 5 p.m. ET.
    


            We'll bring you live updates on that news conference when it takes place.
    


            Today's shooting and fire came as members mourned the death of Russell M. Nelson, the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
    


            Nelson, who was 101 when he died last night, was the oldest-ever president of the church. He became the leader of the LDS Church in 2018.
    


            Authorities will execute a search warrant at the suspect's residence and go through cell phone records to “find out if there was a motive,” Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.
    


            The suspect, who Renye said was killed by police in a shootout at the church, has been identified as a 40-year-old man from Burton, Michigan.
    


            Renye said the FBI has allocated “100 agents to the area” to help get statements from witnesses.
    


            “As you can imagine, there's a lot of witnesses that were within the church and that is a lot of witness information statements that we have to obtain,” he said.
    


            The chief said hundreds of people were attending the service at the time of the attack.
    


            As of Sunday afternoon, there have been at least 324 mass shootings this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people – not counting the shooter – are shot.
    


            Sunday's attack at the church in Michigan followed another mass shooting less than 24 hours earlier: Overnight, a gunman opened fire on a waterfront bar in Southport, North Carolina, killing three people and injuring at least eight others.
    


            Sunday's deadly shooting at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, is the latest attack on a house of worship in the United States.
    


Minneapolis shooting: Just over a month ago, on August 27, a shooter fired through the windows of a church in Minneapolis, killing two children and wounding 14 others, as well as three elderly parishioners, as they prayed. The shooter, 23-year-old Robin Westman, graduated from the school in 2017 and died of a self-inflicted wound at the scene.
    


Arson at Florida synagogue: On September 19, days before Rosh Hashanah, a 31-year-old man allegedly set fire to a synagogue in southwest Florida. The suspect was charged with arson and criminal mischief to a church, synagogue, mosque or religious article – both felonies.
    


            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints confirmed Sunday's shooting in a news release, saying “multiple individuals were injured” in a “tragic act of violence.”
    


            “The Church is in communication with local law enforcement as the investigation continues and as we receive updates on the condition of those affected,” the statement from church spokesperson Doug Andersen reads. “We offer thanks to the emergency responders who are assisting victims and families.”
    


            The statement adds, “Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection.”
    


            “We pray for peace and healing for all involved.”
    


            Hundreds of worshippers were attending Sunday service at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, at the time of the attack, according to police Chief William Renye.
    


            Sunday service lasts for two hours as worshippers sing songs, pray and listen to sermons, according to the church's website, which says they are attended by adults and children from 18 months old and up.
    


            The suspect used an assault rifle during the shooting, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.

Dick Durbin renews push to talk to Trump officials as operations and protests escalate at Broadview facility

After days of clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration jail in his home state of Illinois, Democratic US senator Dick Durbin on Sunday renewed demands to meet with Trump administration immigration officials.

Durbin wrote on X that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) must be “accountable for its actions” amid the administration's “cruel immigration crackdown”. The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois.

For the preceding few days, federal officials have arrested protesters at the Broadview facility as Ice operations have escalated in Illinois.

Durbin, along with Illinois representative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, have been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions.

According to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested.

Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. But Ice in Chicago told Durbin and Ramirez they were “unable to support a visit”, according to the letter, and instead offered a meeting to the Democratic delegation. Ice on Friday postponed that meeting “to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The Democratic pressure on Ice comes as protesters have clashed with officials at the Broadview site in recent days. On Saturday night, officials deployed pepper spray and rubber bullets and arrested a number of protesters outside the controversial immigration jail.

In one video posted online on Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility.

On Sunday afternoon, a CBS Chicago reporter posted on Instagram that an Ice official “took a direct shot” at her car, saying that the official deployed gas into her open window. “Been puking for two hours,” the reporter said, adding that there were no protesters at the time and that she was just driving by the facility to check out the scene.

Another local reporter in Chicago posted on X that the village of Broadview has opened a criminal investigation into that matter.

The Trump administration has called the protesters “rioters”, accusing them of inciting violence. On Saturday afternoon, Ice posted on X: “Rioters will not deter Ice from its law enforcement mission. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. Full stop.” In another post on Sunday morning, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said 11 people were arrested outside the Ice facility – and that officials had confiscated two guns during the arrests.

In response, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, decried the force used by federal officials at the site. He also called on protesters and bystanders to “document what you see with your phones and cameras”.

“The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzker posted on X. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”

Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHS launched an operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. The operation led to an increase in the number of federal officials in the area targeting immigrants.

Already, the operation has led to a number of scandals for Ice and the Trump administration. Earlier in September, Ice shot and killed an immigrant they were trying to arrest in the Chicago area. Despite DHS saying an officer was “seriously injured” by the immigrant before the shooting, video later released seemed to contradict DHS's claims.

A recent court filing by immigrants rights groups has also claimed that US citizens have been rounded up during the immigration enforcement operations in the area.

DHS says it launched Midway Blitz to target immigrants in the state, alleging that Pritzker and his “sanctuary policies” – a term meant to describe limitations on local police's cooperating with federal immigration agents – welcomed undocumented immigrants.

The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden's presidency.

Top DHS officials, in fact, instructed Ice to arrest at least 3,000 people daily throughout the US. As the Guardian reported on Friday, due to the Trump administration's intense escalation, immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in Ice detention.

Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are digging their heels in ahead of a critical meeting with President Donald Trump to avoid a potential government shutdown this week, each pinning the blame for any negotiations that fail tomorrow on the opposing party.

Trump agreed to meet with Senate and House leaders of both parties on Monday to hopefully broker a deal to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded until a long-term spending bill can be passed.

            President Donald Trump on Saturday shared an apparently artificially created video of himself promoting a cure-all bed with origins in conspiratorial corners of the internet.
    


            The video, which has since been deleted, was intended to resemble a Fox News segment on the show hosted by the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump, featured an AI version of Trump promising access to new medical technology. This segment has never aired on the network.
    


            “Every American will soon receive their own medbed card,” said the false rendering of Trump. “With it, you'll have guaranteed access to our new hospitals led by the top doctors in the nation, equipped with the most advanced technology in the world.”
    


            The “medbed” conspiracy theory has spread during recent years in QAnon circles online. It is a modern manifestation of an older tradition of belief in quack doctors and miracle cures and is rooted in deep distrust of government and medical institutions.
    


            During America's UFO-spotting craze beginning in the early post-World War Two II period, conspiracy theories emerged that the US government had reverse-engineered technology from alien craft it had secretly retrieved to create advanced healing technologies.
    


            The conspiracy theory that the government kept this healing technology secret, and only provided cures to select elites, played into a more widely held, and still debated belief that the government was withholding information about UFOs from the public.
    


            The QAnon conspiracy theory movement emerged in 2017, and some in those circles have long believed Trump would make available this supposed secret miracle-curing technology.
    


            In the artificial video Trump posted and then deleted, he touts the benefits of the supposed therapy.
    


            “These facilities are safe, modern and designed to restore every citizen to full health and strength,” the false Trump said. “This is the beginning of a new era in American healthcare.”
    


            More rudimentary versions of medbed technology are promoted and sold in New Age and holistic circles online. These vendors often make dubious and unproven promises about items they sell, like healing matts – bed-topper devices that are supposedly infused with magnetic and infrared technology. CNN has at times observed these vendors setting up at events attended by QAnon followers.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Ukrainian HIMARS rockets reportedly stuck a thermal power plant near the Russian city of Belgorod on Sept. 28, Russian Telegram media channels reported.

Power outages were reported across Belgorod Oblast following the attack that struck one of the substations, Russian media reported.

Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed a strike on critical infrastructure as well as "significant power outages."

No information on the extent of the damage was available.

High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), with a range of around 70 kilometers, allow Ukraine to target Russian forces on the other side of the front line far more accurately than they had previously.

President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed on Sept. 17 that Ukraine will receive Patriot HIMARS missiles as part of a U.S. weapons aid package financed by NATO allies.

The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify details or weapons used in the attack. Ukraine's military has not yet commented on the strike.

The attack comes as Kyiv has intensified attacks against Russian oil, gas, and energy infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Situated across the border from Kharkiv Oblast, Belgorod serves as a regular target of Ukrainian strikes. 

Kyiv's strikes on Russia's oil sector have severely disrupted fuel supplies and logistics for Moscow's armed forces, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Sept. 25.

According to the Financial Times, 16 of Russia's 38 oil refineries have been struck by Ukrainian drones since August 2025. The disruptions have limited Russia's refining capacity by over 1 million barrels per day, the research group Energy Aspects told FT, dropping exports to below pre-war levels.

Basmat has a Master's degree in Political Management from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Governance from Toronto Metropolitan University. 

Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" of oil tankers are being used to "launch and control" Russian drones over European cities, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sept. 28, citing intelligence reports.



Power outages were reported across Belgorod Oblast following the attack that struck one of the substations, Russian media reported.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28 that the U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles, as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by President Donald Trump.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski told Polish outlet RMF24 that "a missile element or a small-caliber rocket" fell on the roof of the embassy, piercing through the ceiling. The debris landed in the kitchen of the embassy with Wronski adding that the damage was "not large," with no casualties reported.

HUR claimed that an explosion rocked a guarded military base on the airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and at least four operators who were allegedly inside the vehicle. 



Bomb threats were also reported at polling stations for the Moldovan diaspora in Belgium, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the U.S., Moldova's Foreign Ministry said on Sept. 28, in what officials described as "the Russian Federation's assault on the electoral process in the Republic of Moldova."


The new sightings come after several media outlets reported unidentified drones being detected in the airspace of Denmark, Lithuania, and Finland on Sept. 27.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers U.S. President Donald Trump's shift in rhetoric after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, including his support for NATO allies shooting down Russian jets entering the alliance's airspace.

In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile struck a high-rise building. At least 38 people in the city have been injured, including three children. In Kyiv, four victims have been hospitalized. 

Lavrov claimed that the upcoming meeting with Rubio is intended to eliminate what he claimed were "irritants" in Washington-Moscow relations. 

All eyes in the EU, Ukraine, and Russia are on Chisinau today as Moldova began parliamentary elections that could leave the landlocked country U-turning from its path to join the bloc one day and build closer ties with Moscow.

The number includes 1,110 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Moldovans head to the polls on Sept. 28 for a pivotal parliamentary vote that could potentially derail Chisinau from its path to accession in the European Union.

            Republican leaders in both chambers are holding the line and saying they are not ceding to Democratic demands in order to pass funding for the government, heightening the imminent threat of a shutdown this week. It comes as congressional leaders prepare to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.
    


            Republicans have maintained that Congress should pass a “clean” funding bill and not give in to Democratic demands to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. They have squarely laid the blame for any shutdown on Democrats, who are withholding votes to fund the government in the Senate in an attempt to get Republicans to the negotiating table.
    


            “It's totally up to the Democrats. This is – the ball is in their court. There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now – we could pick it up today and pass it – that has been passed by the House, that will be signed in law by the president to keep the government open,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Sunday on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            House Majority Leader Steve Scalise echoed Thune's remarks on ABC's “This Week.”
    


            “So right now, it's over in the Senate, and it's on (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer and Democrats in the Senate to keep the government from shutting down. And I hope they'll come to their senses and do that early next week,” Scalise said.
    


            Although Republicans control Capitol Hill and the White House, they need at least seven Democrats in the Senate to join them to pass a spending package under the chamber's rules. But Democratic leaders have continued to draw a hard line, saying those votes won't come without a deal to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies.
    


            House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he hopes to avoid a shutdown but argued that outcome depends on Republicans.
    


            “Our position has been very clear: cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save healthcare,” Jeffries said on ABC's “This Week.”
    


            The positions laid out by both parties set the stage for a tense meeting at the White House on Monday. The meeting will bring together House Speaker Mike Johnson, Thune, Jeffries and Schumer.
    


            Johnson would not say wether Trump is willing to negotiate with Democratic leadership during Monday's meeting.
    


            “I'm not going to get in front of the President and tell you what he will do, but I talked with him, you know, a couple of times, even yesterday and I'm telling you where his head is. He wants to bring in the leaders, to come in and act like leaders and do the right thing for the American people,” Johnson told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.
    


            Senate Democrats are expected to hold a conference call Sunday afternoon for the caucus to discuss strategy ahead of Tuesday's government shutdown deadline, according to a Democratic source.
    


            A potential shutdown would affect hundreds and thousands of federal workers and significantly impact several federal agencies like the IRS and the US National Park Service.
    


            Speaking on CNN's “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju,” Rep. Seth Moulton, a Democrat, said,“It's important for Democrats to use their leverage this time.”
    


            “(Trump's) been playing golf all weekend rather than having these negotiations (…) This is Donald Trump's decision whether the government shuts down,” Moulton said.

Live Updates


            • Shutdown standoff: A possible government shutdown is days away, with President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers locked in a funding standoff with Democrats. Here's what to expect if Congress doesn't strike a deal before Wednesday.
    


            • Trump's stance: Sources say the president will meet with top congressional leaders from both parties tomorrow. He canceled an earlier sit-down with Democrats and has called their demands, which center primarily on health care policy, “totally unreasonable.”
    


            • Meanwhile: The president says he'll send troops to Portland to guard ICE facilities as he continues his law enforcement and immigration crackdowns. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit the White House tomorrow as Trump voices optimism on a potential deal to end the war in Gaza.
    


            Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso criticized Democrats on Sunday, describing their disputes over a government spending bill as a “ransom.”
    


            “In spite of a meeting coming up at the White House, and in spite of the damage it's going to do to the country, Chuck Schumer is trying to save his own hide. He's given us a trillion-dollar ransom note, where he wants for the government just to stay open for the next four weeks,” Barrasso told Fox News.
    


            Barrasso said the solution to prevent a government shutdown is for Democrats to help pass a continuing resolution.
    


            “We need to continue for the next seven weeks doing the budgets and make sure that we move forward as a country,” Barrasso said.
    


            “It costs a lot of money to shut down the government, and it costs even more money to open the government again,” he continued.
    


            Barrasso went on to say Senate Minority Leader Schumer is “bowing” to more left-wing members of his party. And when asked whether Americans might shift blame of potential mass firings and a shutdown on the Republican party, Barrasso said it's clear this would be a “Schumer shutdown.”
    


            “Right now, the Democrats are really in free fall. This is going to hurt them more than Republicans,” said Barrasso. “The key issue is we need to keep the government open and functioning. It's the right thing to do for our country, and we've done it 13 times when Joe Biden was in the White House.”
    


            Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine criticized President Donald Trump on Sunday for what he says is a lack of negotiating across the aisle, ahead of a looming government shutdown.
    


            “The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening he should just be meeting to negotiate,” Kaine said on CBS's “Face The Nation.”
    


            “We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the president would sit down with congressional leaders in both parties and would find a path forward,” Kaine continued.
    


            Trump is set to meet with congressional leaders on Monday, where Kaine hopes the president will listen to concerns brought by Democrats.
    


            Like his Democratic colleagues, Kaine is pushing for an agreement on healthcare funding — including an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies.
    


            “We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix,” Kaine said. “I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the eyes dotted and T's crossed in order to do a short-term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, ‘You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix.'”
    


            He added that any deal Congress reaches must be respected by the president and not overruled via executive action.
    


            Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul expressed a disdain Sunday for both his party's and the Democratic Party's approaches to the looming government shutdown.
    


            “The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion, so I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt,” Paul said on CBS' “Face the Nation,” “The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So really, both plans are laden with deficit spending.”
    


            Paul had introduced the Government Shutdown Prevention Act in January, which would entail a gradual decrease in then-current government funding by the start of the new fiscal year every 90 days until new funding is agreed upon rather than an umbrella shutdown of government agencies and services, although it failed to pass the Senate.
    


            The comments come as President Donald Trump is expected to meet top Congressional leaders at the White House on Monday with the goal of devising a potential compromise to avert a government shutdown on Wednesday.
    


            We reported earlier that President Donald Trump will meet with top congressional leaders from both parties tomorrow.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson addressed that sit-down a short time ago on CNN, declining to say whether he and Trump will negotiate terms with Democratic leadership.
    


            “I'm not going to get in front of the president and tell you what he will do, but I, I talked with him, you know, a couple of times, even yesterday, and I'm telling you where his head is. He wants to bring in the leaders, to come in and act like leaders and do the right thing for the American people,” the speaker told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    


            Johnson said Trump's priority is preventing disruption to military pay.
    


            He accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats of leveraging the funding standoff for partisan gain and to show that they are “fighting” against Trump. He added that debates over Affordable Care Act subsidies, the key Democratic sticking point in negotiations, should wait until year's end when they are set to expire.
    


Some context: The meeting with Johnson, Trump, Schumer, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries comes after Trump canceled a previously scheduled meeting with the Democrats.
    


            The president has not publicly expressed interest in working on a compromise, calling Democratic demands “unserious and ridiculous.”
    


            If you're following our coverage this morning, you may be sensing a common theme: Democrats and Republicans alike are publicly digging in their heels.
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says he is not budging on the demands Democrats are making in exchange for their votes to fund the government.
    


                    “Our position has been very clear: cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save health care,” Jeffries said today on ABC's “This Week.”
                





            Democrats have taken a hard line on demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies in exchange for the votes to avert a shutdown.
    


            Jeffries said today that he hopes to avoid a shutdown, but it would depend on Republicans, given their unified control of Washington.
    


            “Well, it's my hope that we'll avoid one. At the end of the day, Republicans do control the House, the Senate and the presidency,” he said.
    


            Despite that, the GOP still needs at least seven Democrats in the Senate to join them to pass a spending package under the chamber's rules.
    


Tomorrow's meeting: Jeffries will attend a White House meeting with his fellow congressional leaders from each party on Monday, after Trump canceled an earlier sit-down with top Democrats.
    


            “Speaker Mike Johnson reached out to me yesterday, indicated that there had been a conversation between Republican leaders and the president, and as a result, the meeting is back on,” Jeffries said.
    


            The minority leader indicated he's willing to find common ground, but health care will be a major part of any agreement.
    


            Republican leaders in both chambers are not ceding to Democratic demands to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in order to pass funding for the government, making the threat of a shutdown imminent.
    


            The GOP leaders lay the blame for any shutdown on Democrats, who are withholding votes in the Senate in an attempt to get Republicans to the negotiating table.
    


Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on NBC's “Meet the Press”: “It's totally up to the Democrats. The ball is in their court. There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now. We could pick it up today and pass it.”
    


            Republicans have dismissed concerns about the enhanced ACA subsidies, saying they do not expire until the end of the year. But Democrats have stressed the need to address the issue before open enrollment starts November 1.
    


            “We can have that conversation, but before we do: release the hostage, set the American people free, keep the government open and then let's have a conversation about those premium tax credits. I'm certainly open to that. I think we all are,” Thune said.
    


House Majority Leader Steve Scalise echoed Thune on ABC's “This Week”: “So right now, it's over in the Senate, and it's on Chuck Schumer and Democrats in the Senate to keep the government from shutting down. And I hope they'll come to their senses and do that early next week.”
    


            Both Thune and Scalise maintained Congress should pass a “clean” funding bill and then negotiate health care policy and other issues through the appropriations process.
    


            More from Vice President JD Vance, this time on the possibility of a government shutdown beyond September 30 if lawmakers fail to strike a deal.
    


            Appearing on today's “Fox News Sunday”, Vance said Democrats will be to blame for a shutdown if they don't accept a continuing resolution to extend funding through November 21.
    


                    “We don't want to shut down the government,” Vance said, in a pre-taped appearance. “But if Democrats refuse to just pass this ‘clean' continuing resolution, that's exactly what's going to happen, and I think the Democrats going to bear the responsibility for it.”
                





            Vance added that “it's really up to the Democrats under our system. You need 60 Senate Democrats to vote for the clean continued resolution that the President and House Republicans have put forward.”
    


For context: Although Republicans control Capitol Hill and the White House, they need at least seven Democrats in the Senate to join them to pass a spending package under the chamber's rules.
    


            The vice president also equated Democrats push for enhanced Obamacare subsidies with advocating for health care coverage for undocumented immigrants.
    


What Democrats are saying: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is demanding any funding bill contain an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, along with several other items, to get his party's support. GOP leaders want an extension of funding for seven weeks, with additional money for security for the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
    


            We're also hearing more from the administration this morning about the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime adversary of President Donald Trump, who has been charged with giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.
    


            Vice President JD Vance rejected the idea that Comey was indicted for political reasons and said more indictments are certain to come during Trump's presidency.
    


            “There's certainly going to be more indictments coming over the next three and a half years of the Trump administration,” Vance told “Fox News Sunday” in a pre-taped interview that aired today. “We're always going to let the law drive this stuff and the facts of the case, and not political motivations, which frankly, makes us so much different from the Biden administration.”
    


Some background: The indictment marked an extraordinary escalation in Trump's effort to prosecute his political enemies. The charges stem from testimony Comey gave before the Senate about leaks to the press when he was FBI director atop sensitive 2016 investigations.
    


Go deeper: CNN took a closer look at the Trump administration's claims about indictments during the Biden administration. Read that analysis below:

            As we've been reporting, a federal government shutdown will happen if lawmakers fail to strike a deal on funding the government beyond September 30.
    


            We've been hearing this morning from Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who's said he opposes a shutdown and that he has confidence in Democratic leadership in Congress to “hold the line” on their push to extend Obamacare premiums, the beefed-up subsidies enacted during the Biden administration.
    


            The extension has become a central factor in the debate over funding the federal government for the coming fiscal year.
    


                    “We presented an alternative that would keep the federal government going. We shouldn't close down the government,” he told CNN's Jake Tapper today.
                





            “I do have confidence that the two leaders on the Democratic side are going to hold the line on these issues as well as not giving the president a blank check,” he said.
    


            “Look, my view is, you know, there are lots of issues Democrats should be focused on but on this one, we are united.”
    


            President Donald Trump's effort to end the war in Gaza is a key foreign policy priority we'll be tracking today, particularly in light of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's White House visit tomorrow.
    


            Trump just addressed the issue again on social media, writing this morning that there is “a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.”
    


            The administration is working to close a 21-point Gaza peace plan that would include the release of all hostages held by Hamas.
    


            “ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!” Trump wrote.
    


Vance weighs in: Vice President JD Vance has echoed Trump's optimism, telling “Fox News Sunday” he is “very hopeful.”
    


            “I think the president has gotten us to a point where we're at the 1-yard line, and all of us are very hopeful we can sort of punch through the end zone and accomplish a major, major thing for peace in the region,” Vance said in a pre-taped interview that aired today.
    


            The vice president said he feels more optimistic than he has “at any point in the last few months,” though he cautioned the talks could always be derailed at the last minute.
    


            The administration has previously expressed optimism about a peace deal before seeing those hopes dashed amid disagreements with Hamas.
    


            Meanwhile, in what appears to be a major foreign policy development, the Trump administration has presented a 21-point plan to end the war in Gaza.
    


            President Donald Trump has talked up the prospects of a ceasefire in recent days, as we've reported.
    


            The reaction to his plan in Israel has been mixed.
    


Far-right opposition: Israel's far-right minister of national security called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reject the plan.
    


            “Mr. Prime Minister, you do not have a mandate to end the war without a complete defeat of Hamas,” Itamar Ben Gvir wrote on X yesterday.
    


            Ben Gvir and far-right minister Bezalel Smotrich consistently opposed hostage deals and ceasefire arrangements throughout the Gaza war, pressing instead for continued and intensified military pressure and full occupation of the territory. The two have threatened to topple Netanyahu's government if the war ends.
    


Other lawmakers have expressed openness: Foreign Minister Gideon Saar expressed support for Netanyahu and plans to end the war, saying on X that he trusts Netanyahu “to represent Israel's interests.”
    


            Netanyahu's ultra-orthodox coalition partners, like Chairman of Degel HaTorah, MK Moshe Gafni, also have come out in support of a hostage deal resulting in a ceasefire.
    


            And Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid — who has repeatedly stated he would grant a “security net” to Netanyahu in favor of a hostage deal that would prevent the government from collapsing — said to disregard the far-right ministers' comments, writing on X, “There is no reason to be alarmed by the empty threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich.”
    


            The federal government shutdown deadline is rapidly approaching, and we'll be keeping an eye on two key meetings during our coverage.
    


First up: Senate Democrats will hold a conference call at 4 p.m. ET today as the caucus discusses strategy, according to a party source.
    


Tomorrow: The top four congressional leaders will meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, multiple sources told CNN.
    


            The eleventh-hour meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer comes after Trump canceled a meeting earlier this week with the Democrats, Jeffries and Schumer.
    


Remember: A shutdown will take effect Wednesday if Congress can't strike a deal by the end of Tuesday night.
    


            President Donald Trump said yesterday that he will send troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities he claimed are “under siege.”
    


            The White House did not provide additional comment when reached by CNN for clarification on which troops would be sent to the city, or on what the president meant when he said on social media that forces would be authorized to use “full force.”
    


            DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin claimed in a statement that the action is being taken after “weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities” and attacks against law enforcement.
    


Some context: An ICE facility about 2 miles south of downtown Portland has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer. Most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, but some have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days over the summer.
    


            State and local leaders have pushed back on Trump's characterization of the situation and said federal intervention is unnecessary. Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon said the president was trying to “induce a reaction” at the protests and urged demonstrators not to “take the bait.”
    


Big picture: This move is the latest example of Trump's willingness to use the military in extraordinary ways as part of a push he claims will reduce crime in American cities.
    


            He deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and to Washington, DC, last month. He has also threatened to send troops to several other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Chicago.
    


            Welcome to our coverage of President Donald Trump's administration and the growing potential for a federal government shutdown, which will happen if lawmakers don't agree on funding the government beyond September 30.
    


You'll see a lot of shutdown talk in today's coverage, so let's cover some basics:



What is it? Congress must provide funding for many federal departments and functions every fiscal year, which begins October 1. If lawmakers fail to pass a spending package for the full year — or at least extend funding for a shorter period — many agencies and activities must shutter until Congress appropriates more money.
    


            Lawmakers have yet to pass through both chambers any of the 12 appropriations bills that make up the federal discretionary spending budget. So the coming shutdown would be considered a full shutdown.
    


When is the deadline? The shutdown will begin when the calendar turns over to October 1, at midnight Tuesday into Wednesday, if Congress doesn't act before that.
    


What programs and payments will stop? Every government shutdown differs somewhat, but typically functions that are critical to the protection of lives and property are deemed essential and remain open. Agencies file what are known as contingency plans that detail what operations will continue and how many employees will remain on the job.
    


What kind of impacts would we see? Hundreds of thousands of federal workers bear the brunt of shutdowns. Some are furloughed, while others are considered essential and have to continue working — but, in many cases, without pay until the impasse is over.
    


            It can also have serious impacts on the economy. A five-week shutdown in 2018-2019 resulted in a $3 billion loss in economic growth that would not be recovered, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28 that the U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles, as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by President Donald Trump.

"You asked this question about Tomahawks. It's something the president is going to make the final determination on. What the president is going to do is what's in the best interest for the United States of America," Vance told Fox News in an interview.

"I know we're having conversations this very minute about the issue," Vance continued. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky asked Trump to supply Kyiv with Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles during a meeting with the U.S. president on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the Telegraph reported on Sept. 26.

Ukraine has repeatedly appealed to Washington for long-range strike capabilities throughout the war, but the United States has so far declined to provide such weapons.

Zelensky told Trump that the advanced weapons system could help pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into negotiations for a peace deal, according to multiple sources cited by the Telegraph. The Ukrainian leader later said Trump was open to the request, which, if granted, would give Ukraine the ability to strike targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow.

Vance on Sept. 28 acknowledge frustration within the White House amid Moscow's reluctance to attend leader-level peace talks.

"What we've seen over the last couple of weeks, the Russians have refused to sit down with any bilateral meetings with the Ukrainians. They've refused to sit down with any trilateral meetings where the president or some other member of the administration could sit down with the Russians and the Ukrainians."

The comments come amid signs of a shift in Trump's approach to the war. Following his meeting with Zelensky on Sept. 23 in New York, Trump wrote on Truth Social that "Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form."

"The Russians are not gaining a lot. This war is terrible for their economy, and they have to ask themselves how many more people are they going to have to lose and how many more people are they going to have to kill for very little military advantage," the U.S. vice president added in his interview.

"We hope the Russians actually wake up to reality on the ground," Vance concluded.

In recent weeks, Trump has overseen a new NATO-financed program to supply U.S. weapons to Ukraine under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, with initial aid packages including Patriot air defenses and HIMARS rocket systems.

US president reverses course days after scrapping meeting to discuss crisis with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer

Donald Trump has reversed course and is purportedly planning to host a bipartisan gathering of the top four US congressional leaders at the White House on Monday afternoon in a last-ditch effort to avoid a looming government shutdown, the House speaker and the US president's fellow Republican Mike Johnson said on Sunday.

Trump's climbdown comes days after he scrapped a planned meeting to discuss the crisis with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the respective Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate.

The president accused the pair of making “unserious and ridiculous demands” in return for Democratic votes to support a Republican funding agreement to keep the government open beyond Tuesday night – but left the door open for a meeting “if they get serious about the future of our nation”.

Johnson, appearing on CNN, said he spoke with Trump at length on Saturday, and that the two Democrats had agreed to join him and John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, for an Oval Office discussion Monday.

He did not say if Trump would be negotiating directly with the Democrats – but portrayed Trump as keen to “try to convince them to follow common sense and do what's right by the American people”.

Schumer, talking to NBC's Meet the Press, said he was “hopeful we can get something real done” – but was uncertain of the mood they would find Trump in when they sat down for the 2pm ET discourse.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won't get anything done,” Schumer said.

“We don't want a shutdown. We hope that they sit down and have a serious negotiation with us.”

According to CBS News on Sunday, meanwhile, Trump is not hopeful the meeting will lead to an agreement.

The network's chief national correspondent, Robert Costa, told Face the Nation he spoke with Trump by phone Sunday morning and that a government shutdown “looks likely at this point based on my conversation … He says both sides are at a stalemate.”

Costa said: “Inside the White House, sources are saying president Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse.”

If no deal is reached, chunks of the federal government are set to shut down as early as Wednesday morning, with the White House telling agencies to prepare to furlough or fire scores of workers.

Republican and Democratic leaders have been pointing fingers of blame at each other for days as Tuesday's deadline for a funding agreement approaches.

The narrow House Republican majority passed a short-term spending bill known as a continuing resolution earlier in September that would keep the government funded for seven weeks – but it faces opposition in the Senate, where it needs the support of at least eight Democrats to pass.

Democrats have made the extension of expiring healthcare protections a condition of their support, warning that planned Republican spending cuts would affect millions of people.

“If we don't extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, more than 20 million Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, deductibles, in an environment where the cost of living in America is already too high,” Jeffries told CNN on Sunday.

“We've made clear that we're ready, willing and able to sit down with anyone, at any time and at any place, in order to make sure that we can actually fund the government, avoid a painful Republican caused shutdown, and address the healthcare crisis that Republicans have caused that's [affecting] everyday Americans.”

But Trump and Republicans have repeatedly accused their political opponents of exploiting the issue to force a shutdown while there was still plenty of time to fix healthcare before the subsidies expire on 31 December.

“The Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, not right now, while we're simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates,” Johnson said.

“There is nothing partisan about this continuing resolution, nothing. We didn't add a single partisan priority or policy rider at all. We're operating completely in good faith to get more time.”

Thune, on Meet the Press, also attempted to blame Democrats for the potential shutdown and said “the ball is in their court” as to the next development.

“There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now, we could pick it up today and pass it, that has been passed by the House that will be signed into law by the president to keep the government open,” he said.

“What the Democrats have done is take the federal government as a hostage, and by extension the American people, to try [to] get a whole laundry list of things that they want.”

But US senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has previously urged his party leadership to be stronger in standing up to the Trump administration, said the problem was Republicans handing “a complete blank check” to the president to spend money on his own political interests, and not those of the nation.

“Until now the president has said he'd rather shut down the government than prevent those healthcare costs from spiking,” he told CNN.

“Democrats are united right now on this question. I'm glad we're finally talking. We'll see what happens.”

Editor's note: Read more of our reporting on Russia's large-scale overnight attack on Ukraine here.

Russia's large-scale overnight attack on Kyiv on Sept. 28 struck the Polish Embassy in the capital, a spokesperson for Poland's foreign ministry said.

Spokesperson Pawel Wronski told Polish outlet RMF24 that "a missile element or a small-caliber rocket" fell on the roof of the embassy, piercing through the ceiling. The debris landed in the kitchen of the embassy with Wronski adding that the damage was "not large," with no casualties reported.

Russia launched almost 500 drones and over 40 missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky, killing at least four people and injuring over 70 primarily in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia. At least 36 people were injured in Kyiv and the surrounding region, with all four casualties recorded within the capital.

The incident comes amid growing tension between NATO countries and Russia stemming from Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 

Over the past month, Russian drones have violated Polish, Romanian, and possibly Danish airspace.

On Sept. 19, Estonia accused Russia of violating its airspace with three MiG-31 fighter jets, which remained in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes, triggering NATP's Article 4. While on Sept. 26, Hungarian fighter jets intercepted five Russian aircraft over the Baltic Sea.

Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to the mass attack as it has repeatedly done so to protect its own airspace. During a mass attack on Sept. 10, Poland shot down multiple Russian drones that crossed the border and breached Polish airspace.

Foreign embassies have previously been damaged in large-scale attacks on the capital. The embassies of Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, and Montenegro were all damaged in December 2024 when a missile struck a building housing the embassies.

Ukraine is planning both a "Mega Deal" — a major agreement on the purchase of American weapons — and a "Drone Deal," to sell Ukrainian unmanned systems to the U.S., Zelensky said.

Moscow immediately demanded a "repeat round of voting" after failing to garner the support needed to return to the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) 36-member council.

A new book uses neuroscience to impart advice on building a better relationship with your brain.gorodenkoff/Getty Images

Breaking through the noise of the self-help industry, neuroscientist Rachel Barr‘s new book How to Make Your Brain Your Best Friend, roots its advice in science (the bibliography section alone is more than 40 pages). 

Holding a master's degree in molecular neuroscience, Barr wrote the book while completing her PhD in the electrophysiology of memory and sleep. She has been demystifying the connections between the brain and mental health on TikTok and Instagram, with viral videos such as Why the Brain needs Screen Breaks and Five Tips to Improve Memory from a Neuroscientist that offer helpful, research-based habits for a happier day-to-day life.

She takes a more personal touch in her book, sharing stories about her battles with loneliness and the loss of her mother to suicide, which help emphasize why a better understanding of the brain is meaningful to the author. 

Recently The Globe and Mail spoke with the Quebec-based neuroscientist about how, with more knowledge about our brain's patterns and habits, we can start making informed decisions on our recurring choices. 

Can you talk about your neuroscience background and how that's also a through-line for the book?

I noticed a lot of the conversations that we have about mental health, about personal growth and about building a happy life are at odds with what I know about the brain. And I felt the need to reorient that conversation. Not only to drag it back from the clutches of capitalism but also to put that knowledge and understanding back into the mix. The brain is the organ that we're tasked with caring for. So it's important that mental health conversations – personal growth conversations, sorting out a happy life – have to be constructed upon a foundation of what does the brain need? What does the brain thrive on?

Where does brain science and typical mental health advice differ the most? 

One of the key tensions, I think, is this persistent idea in wellness and person. But cognitive effort is resource-limited, attention is finite. We're asking our brains to do far more than they evolved to do, in an informational environment that's louder and more demanding than ever before in human history. Many of the symptoms we're now collectively struggling with – chronic fatigue, burnout, anxiety – are entirely consistent with an overtaxed system, not an under-optimized one. So when the advice we get is to push harder, wake earlier, tolerate more discomfort, this often pulls us further from what we need. What moves the needle is reducing the actual load and restoring the conditions brains evolved to function under: adequate sleep, connection, protected periods of single-tasked focus, delight, creative play, real rest. 

Worried your attention span has shrunk? Five tips to fight distractions and stay focused

Why we can't focus

You mentioned that a lot of the conversations about building a happy life are rooted in capitalism. Can you clarify what you mean? 

Capital extraction comes in different forms, broadly labour, attention and consumer spends. Most wellness content has to live inside an attention economy that rewards novelty, certainty and ongoing extraction. The easiest way to grow is to sell an ever-refreshing stream of hacks or to make promises that are simple, viral and, usually, not quite true. The harder, truer guidance is slower, caveated and typically stays the same.

This book has a lot of personal anecdotes and scientific facts. How do you find the balance between the two for your readers?

I'm offering up a topic that's usually very sterile in a way that feels a bit warmed up and gives it a human touch. The book has a philosophical edge as well. It's not all, like, cold plunge, going for a run and protocols for healthy living. For some people, mental ill health is lifelong. I wanted to give readers reasons for living. Not just how to care for the brain in a basic biological sense, but also how to provide it with reasons to live, whether you're dealing with mental ill health or not.

When you were writing the book, did you have a particular reader in mind and a takeaway you wanted them to leave with?

I'm not sure I really realized that at the time, but it's clear to me now that it was written for my mom. If somebody dies of cancer…it's terrible and awful, but it feels like an act of nature. When somebody dies from mental health, it feels like it should have been preventable. And in the aftermath of my mom's passing, I'm just left with all this stuff that I wish I had said. Things I wish I had been able to convince her of, that life is worth living and how to take care of her mind. When I was writing the book, I felt like we were in conversation. I was reluctant to finish writing and send it off into the world, because that conversation is now over. 

It was kind of a love letter to her and to every other brain that reads it. I can't cure poor mental health. But I'm trying to help people muddle through and take care of their brain and in such a way that they never reach that level of despair.

            Tropical Depression Nine is expected to intensify into Tropical Storm Imelda Sunday, and while its forecast is less ominous for the Southeast coast, the storm will still be felt there.
    


            Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the central and northwestern Bahamas where the tropical depression is currently wringing out heavy rain. Rainfall totals could range from 4 to 12 inches in the Bahamas and eastern Cuba, more than enough to trigger flash flooding.
    


            The eventual path of Tropical Storm Imelda has been trending away from a direct landfall along the Southeast coast over the last 24 to 36 hours. After moving north and parallel to Florida's Atlantic coast through Monday, the storm is now expected to make an abrupt turn east and away from the coast while intensifying into a hurricane Tuesday into Wednesday.
    


            Imelda will join Hurricane Humberto in the Atlantic. The powerful Category 4 hurricane rapidly intensified into a rare Category 5 storm Saturday over the warm, energy-filled water of the open ocean and has a role to play in Imelda's future.
    


            The slower than expected northward movement of what is now Tropical Depression Nine means Humberto will win out in a tropical tug-of-war between it and a weather pattern over the Southeast US. On Tuesday, Humberto will tug Imelda away from the coast and the weather pattern trying to draw it closer to land.
    


            But those on the Southeast coast shouldn't let their guard down yet, as the steering pattern could still shift.
    


            “While it is too early to feel extremely confident, almost all of the reliable (forecast model) ensembles now keep the system offshore of the southeastern United States, though some impacts are still anticipated,” the hurricane center said early Sunday.
    


            The first effects from the storm could reach the Southeast as early as Monday, with coastal areas of eastern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas expected to experience brunt of the storm's impacts.
    


            Flooding rain is still a concern, especially in the coastal Carolinas, even with the center of the storm forecast to remain offshore of the Southeast US. Onshore winds will also kick up high surf that could cause coastal flooding and beach erosion.
    


            The rainfall forecast has trended down since Saturday. Totals of 1 to 5 inches are now forecast in the coastal Carolinas through Wednesday morning.
    


            Imelda's wind field will grow and allow strong, gusty winds to howl along the Southeast coast early-to-midweek.
    


            Officials in the Southeast geared up to deal with the storm even though things were looking more encouraging Sunday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a state of emergency Friday, activating statewide response plans and mobilizing agencies to prepare for significant wind, flooding rain and storm surge across the state.
    


            The City of Charleston declared a local state of emergency Saturday, and began distributing sandbags and clearing storm drains, according to a statement.
    


            Meanwhile, over the open Atlantic, Hurricane Humberto rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm Saturday while tracking over warm water and a less hostile environment in the central Atlantic.
    


            Humberto weakened slightly to a high-end Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning. It's expected to remain a powerful Category 4 storm into early in the work week.
    


            It is not a direct threat to the US, and will likely steer far to the west of Bermuda. That said, Bermuda could still see bands of rain and gusty winds Tuesday into Wednesday. Imelda could come near the archipelago by late week.
    


            Anyone from the Bahamas to the Southeast coast and Bermuda should continue to keep a close eye on the forecast as the rain, wind and coastal flood threats become clearer. This homegrown storm will leave a very narrow window to prepare.

Elon Musk has drawn attention to Telegram founder Pavel Durov's allegation that France had attempted to interfere in last year's Moldovan presidential elections.

The US-based billionaire shared an X post by his fellow tech entrepreneur claiming French intelligence had requested that his platform censor certain channels ahead of last year's vote.

“Wow,” the SpaceX and Tesla CEO commented in his re-post of the message. Durov published his statement on Sunday as Moldovans were again heading to the polls to take part in the parliamentary vote.

In his statement, the Telegram founder claimed that the intelligence agency had approached him last year, seeking his aid in censoring a number of channels ahead of the vote. In exchange, it offered the businessman, who holds French citizenship, some assistance in a criminal case pending against him in France.

Although some of the channels flagged by the spies did violate Telegram's rules and were removed, others were legitimate but expressed views unpopular with the French and Moldovan authorities, according to Durov.

The tech entrepreneur also called the actions of the French spies “unacceptable,” arguing that their offer constituted interference into the judicial process and the exploitation of his own legal situation in France.

Durov was arrested at a Paris airport in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was eventually released on €5 million ($5.4 million) bail and placed under judicial supervision.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who holds a staunch pro-EU position, was re-elected in 2024 amid allegations of electoral irregularities, with opposition groups claiming that key votes came from the country's diaspora in the EU.

Earlier, Durov made similar claims about French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner personally asking him to censor conservatives in Romania ahead of the presidential election rerun in May. The businessman said he rejected the request. Paris has vehemently denied the accusations.

Musk voiced his support for the fellow tech entrepreneur at the time as well, by responding to his May remarks with a brief post: “Hear, hear!”

Party prepared to risk government shutdown and will not support GOP bill unless cuts to healthcare are reversed

It has been nine brutal months for congressional Democrats.

Relegated by voters to the minority in last year's election, they have been powerless to stop Republicans from acting on Donald Trump's demands to fund an immigration crackdown, strip money for foreign aid and public media, and downsize Medicaid, which provides healthcare to poor and disabled Americans.

That is set to change next week. Funding for the government expires on Tuesday, but Democrats have refused the GOP's demands to support legislation keeping it open unless the majority agrees to reverse the Medicaid cuts, restore funding to public media and extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans.

The ultimatum sets up a standoff next week that could result in the federal government shutting down for the first time in six years – a prospect that the White House has vowed to make uniquely painful, by announcing plans to lay off employees of any federal agency it deems non-essential.

The party remain undaunted, believing they have found rare leverage over the administration by making a stand on the issue of healthcare, which proved effective at rallying voters to their side during Trump's first term and could do so again ahead of next year's pivotal midterm elections.

“Democrats are not going to go along to get along. Our position is clear: cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save healthcare,” House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters at the Capitol on Friday.

Republicans are insisting that Democrats agree to support a bill – approved by the House of Representatives on a near party-line vote last week – that will keep the government funded through 21 November, without making any major changes to policies, besides authorizing more security funds in response to Charlie Kirk's assassination.

They have accused Democrats of hypocrisy, saying that such a measure, known as a clean continuing resolution (CR), has been acceptable to them in the past.

“Now that Republicans are offering a clean CR, it's somehow a no-go,” Senate majority leader John Thune said last week. “Why is it always a special case with Democrats? The truth is, the only thing special about this case is that Democrats can't stand the fact that the American people elected Donald Trump. So we all have to live with their endless temper tantrum – which apparently may now include shutting down the government.”

Lawmakers will be in a crunch beginning Monday, when they return to Washington after a week-long break in which little progress appears to have been made. House Republican leaders have cancelled plans for the chamber to resume work in a bid to pressure Democratic senators to support the CR, but House Democrats have announced plans to be in the capital anyway.

Jeffries and the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, attempted to meet Trump this week, but the president ultimately turned them down, saying: “No meeting with their congressional leaders could possibly be productive.” On Saturday, the top Democrats announced Trump had again agreed to a meeting.

Democrats across the ideological spectrum have shown no sign of caving to the GOP's demands, in part because the relationship between the two parties has become increasingly tattered since Trump returned to the White House.

A key factor in that was the rescissions package Republicans approved in July that slashed foreign aid programs and public media – which Congress had previously approved on a bipartisan basis. Cutting that funding “did a lot of harm to the trust that you need to negotiate in good faith”, said Brad Schneider, chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition, the largest ideological caucus in the House.

“The Republicans have done nothing to give the country confidence that what's agreed to in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans is what the executive branch is actually going to do,” he said.

The party believes they have found the right issues at the right time to throw down the gauntlet. The tax-and-spending bill Republicans passed earlier this year is estimated to cost 10 million people their health insurance through changes to Medicaid and the ACA.

Subsidies for health insurance under the ACA, which Democrats created under Biden, run out at the end of the year, and if not extended will cause costs to rise for more than 20 million enrollees.

“Premiums are spiking. Nobody can afford health care in the richest country in the world,” said Pramila Jayapal, a Washington congresswoman and former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “They actually need Democratic votes in the Senate, not in the House necessarily, but in the Senate. And I think we've got to be willing to say, if you want Democratic votes, then you've got to do some things that we want. Otherwise, why would we give you our votes?”

Any spending legislation will need at least some Democratic support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the upper chamber. Last March, Schumer angered some in the party's base by urging his lawmakers to support a Republican funding bill, arguing that a shutdown would be “devastating” in the midst of the department of government's efficiency's campaign of thinning the federal workforce.

This time around, he appears on board with holding firm.

“The bottom line is the … overwhelming majority of Democrats, both House and Senate, are united on the fact that healthcare is a mess and we have to fix it,” Schumer said in an interview on PBS. “It's sort of a universal feeling that what they're doing is totally, totally derelict. And if there is a shutdown, it's going to be a Trump shutdown on their shoulders.”

It's welcome news for the activist groups who rally voters. Indivisible's national advocacy director Andrew O'Neill has credited Senate Democrats with “fighting smart” by sticking to their healthcare demands, and MoveOn spokesperson Joel Payne said his members “are encouraged that Democrats are so far holding the line”.

“Because of the depressed nature of the Democratic coalition right now, they need to be doing everything that they can do to inspire confidence and to inspire engagement from their base, for a lot of reasons,” he told the Guardian.

Re-energizing voters ahead of next year's midterm elections, where Democrats believe they have a good chance of seizing back the House and winnowing the Republican majority in the Senate, is one of those reasons. Another is to communicate that they understand the extent to which Trump has changed the GOP from what it was prior to his rise.

“To the extent that Democrats want to hold the confidence of their base, I think they need to also signal that they see that evolution as well,” Payne said.

Writing on X on Sunday, Durov said the approach came about a year ago, while he was under judicial supervision in France following his arrest at a Paris airport. He claimed that intelligence services contacted him through an intermediary and asked Telegram to remove a number of Moldovan channels before a presidential vote.

According to St Petersburg native Durov, Telegram did delete some flagged channels that clearly violated its own policies. But he said the intermediary later relayed a more troubling message: French intelligence had offered to “say good things” to the judge in charge of his case in exchange for wider cooperation.

“This was unacceptable on several levels,” Durov wrote, adding that if the agency did contact the judge, it would amount to interference in the judicial process — and if it didn't, it meant exploiting his legal jeopardy to influence political developments abroad.

Durov said that shortly afterward, Telegram received a second list of “problematic” Moldovan channels. Unlike the first batch, he insisted, nearly all of these accounts were legitimate and fully compliant with Telegram's rules.

Their only common trait, he said, was that they voiced political positions disliked by the Moldovan and French governments. “We refused to act on this request,” he wrote.

The allegations come as Moldovans head to the polls in a high-stakes parliamentary election. President Maia Sandu's pro-EU Action and Solidarity Party (PAS) is facing off against the Patriotic Electoral Bloc (BEP), which campaigns for Moldova's constitutional neutrality and accuses the government of suppressing dissent.

In recent weeks, election officials barred two opposition parties over alleged foreign funding, adding to a list that already included the banned Victory Bloc and the dissolved SOR Party.

Opposition groups accuse Sandu of tilting the playing field by restricting polling stations in Russia, where hundreds of thousands of Moldovans live, while opening hundreds across the EU — many in small towns. They also point to the closure of dozens of media outlets critical of the government.

Commenting on Durov's claims, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the revelations confirmed what Moscow had long alleged. “The West operates without conscience on all fronts,” she said.

Durov, who also holds French citizenship in addition to his primary Russian, was arrested in August 2024 and charged with complicity in crimes linked to Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million bail but placed under judicial supervision. He said the French attempt to link that case to Moldovan politics was “a pattern we have also observed elsewhere, including in Romania.”

Durov insisted Telegram would not comply with political censorship. “Telegram is committed to freedom of speech and will not remove content for political reasons. I will continue to expose every attempt to pressure Telegram into censoring our platform,” he wrote.

Authorities said that three people were killed and at least eight others injured after an attacker opened fire at a North Carolina marina on Saturday night, in what they described as a “highly premeditated” and “targeted” attack.

Class action lawsuit alleges company failed to warn about risks of using contraceptive injection Depo-Provera

The drugmaker Pfizer faces a US lawsuit brought on behalf of women who developed brain tumours, which they say are linked to their use of the company's contraceptive injection Depo-Provera.

The class action lawsuit alleges that the US pharmaceutical company failed to warn women and doctors about an increased risk of developing an intracranial meningioma if Depo-Provera, a quarterly injection, is used for more than a year.

A court hearing will take place in Pensacola, Florida, on Monday.

Since May, the number of lawsuits filed by women in the US against Pfizer has tripled to more than 1,300, which have been consolidated in the multi-district litigation, according to the law firm Levin Papantonio, which is bringing the action.

The potential claim value could be several billion dollars, with the number of lawsuits expected to rise to between 5,000 and 10,000 from women in the US.

A study published in the British Medical Journal in March 2024 found that prolonged use of certain progestogen medications was linked to a greater risk of intracranial meningioma, which are tumours that form in tissues around the brain. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, sold as Depo-Provera, was linked to a 5.6-fold higher risk.

Meningioma is the most common type of benign brain tumour. They grow slowly and are not usually cancerous but can cause vision or hearing loss, headaches and seizures, and often need surgical removal. The surgery carries risks such as potential damage to brain structures near the tumours.

Other studies also found an elevated risk associated with the Pfizer drug.

The hearing on Monday will address oral arguments from Levin Papantonio on behalf of affected women, and Pfizer concerning the issue of pre-emption. It will focus on five pilot cases to test whether the company can rely on a pre-emption defence – common in drug litigation – to avoid liability.

Pfizer argues that it tried to have a tumour warning attached to the drug's label but this was rejected by the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The company said in its court filings: “This is a clear pre-emption case because FDA expressly barred Pfizer from adding a warning about meningioma risk, which plaintiffs say state law required.”

The plaintiffs argue that Pfizer's pre-emption defence fails because its request to the FDA was too broad, grouping Depo-Provera with other lower-dose hormonal contraceptives, and this led to the regulator's decision not to approve a tumour warning on the drug's label in the US.

It is thought about 247 million women worldwide take hormonal contraceptives. In the US, nearly a quarter of sexually active women have used Depo-Provera in their lifetime.

Marketed in the UK since the 1980s, Depo-Provera is used by 15% of women in the country, also for endometriosis. The warning label was updated last year.

Pfizer has said it is “aware of this potential risk associated with long-term use of progestogens” and has also updated label warnings in Canada and Europe.

Virginia Buchanan, a partner at Levin Papantonio and court-appointed co-chair of the plaintiffs' executive committee, said: “Pfizer is attempting to avoid accountability by invoking a pre-emption defence, yet there are serious questions about whether it ever provided the FDA with the full picture.

“Pre-emption was never meant to serve as a shield for drug companies that fail to warn patients adequately. Pfizer has consistently failed to take reasonable steps to alert patients and their physicians to this very real danger.”

The US law firm Berger Montague is investigating whether Pfizer's board breached its fiduciary duties in its marketing and sale of Depo-Provera, for a potential shareholder legal action.

Attempts to disrupt Moldova's parliamentary election, viewed as pivotal for the country's political future, were reported by local authorities on Sept. 28.

Bomb threats were also reported at polling stations for the Moldovan diaspora in Belgium, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the U.S., Moldova's Foreign Ministry said on Sept. 28, in what officials described as "the Russian Federation's assault on the electoral process in the Republic of Moldova."

"State institutions were prepared for this scenario, we have established clear procedures, and we are cooperating with our partners in other countries to ensure the electoral process is not affected. We urge all citizens (in the diaspora) to follow the recommendations of the authorities, rely on official information, and continue honest voting," Moldova's Foreign Ministry said. 

Moldova's Information Technology and Cyber Security Service also said that it had blocked a series of cyberattacks targeting the country's election infrastructure.

The targets of the cyberattacks included Moldova's Central Electoral Commission website, government cloud service systems and process automation systems, as well as some voting stations abroad, according to the Information Technology and Cyber Security Service.

Among the reported incidents were distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, including one orchestrated simultaneously from multiple countries, with over 16 million generated sessions designed to simulate real traffic and bypass protection systems.

"All attacks were detected and neutralized in real time without affecting the availability or integrity of electoral services," Moldova's Information Technology and Cyber Security Service said.

Moldovans, both at home and abroad, are heading to the polls in critical parliamentary elections on Sept. 28 that could determine whether the country continues to move toward its path of EU integration, as envisioned by President Maia Sandu's party, or pivots back to Moscow.

"Moldova, our beloved home, is in danger and needs the help of each of you. You can save it today with your vote — tomorrow it might be too late," Sandu said after casting her vote on Sept. 28, urging Moldovan citizens to go out and vote.

"Let's show the world that the Republic of Moldova is not only a small country with a big heart, but also a country of dignified people, people who do not sell their country. Let's not allow thieves and traitors to sell our future."

On the eve of the election, Moldovan authorities barred the pro-Kremlin Greater Moldova (Moldova Mare) party from participating, citing suspicions of illegal financing, officials said on Sept. 27.

A day earlier, the country's Central Electoral Commission had suspended the Heart of Moldova party, one of four factions in the Russia-aligned Patriotic Bloc, which had been positioning itself to challenge Sandu's ruling pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS).

Citing documents it had seen, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 22 that Moscow has devised a plan to interfere in Moldova's parliamentary elections and hinder the country's bid for EU membership. In a separate investigation published Sept. 21, the BBC said a covert, Russia-funded network was working to influence the outcome of the vote.

Since the end of the 1992 Transnistrian War, Russia has exerted control over Moldova's Transnistrian region, maintaining a military presence there.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance confirmed on Sept. 28 that the U.S. is "looking at" providing Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles, as Moscow continues to refuse bilateral and trilateral peace talks brokered by President Donald Trump.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pawel Wronski told Polish outlet RMF24 that "a missile element or a small-caliber rocket" fell on the roof of the embassy, piercing through the ceiling. The debris landed in the kitchen of the embassy with Wronski adding that the damage was "not large," with no casualties reported.

HUR claimed that an explosion rocked a guarded military base on the airfield in occupied Melitopol, destroying a Soviet-era UAZ-452 van and at least four operators who were allegedly inside the vehicle. 



Bomb threats were also reported at polling stations for the Moldovan diaspora in Belgium, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the U.S., Moldova's Foreign Ministry said on Sept. 28, in what officials described as "the Russian Federation's assault on the electoral process in the Republic of Moldova."


The new sightings come after several media outlets reported unidentified drones being detected in the airspace of Denmark, Lithuania, and Finland on Sept. 27.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur covers U.S. President Donald Trump's shift in rhetoric after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York, including his support for NATO allies shooting down Russian jets entering the alliance's airspace.

In Zaporizhzhia, a Russian missile struck a high-rise building. At least 38 people in the city have been injured, including three children. In Kyiv, four victims have been hospitalized. 

Lavrov claimed that the upcoming meeting with Rubio is intended to eliminate what he claimed were "irritants" in Washington-Moscow relations. 

All eyes in the EU, Ukraine, and Russia are on Chisinau today as Moldova began parliamentary elections that could leave the landlocked country U-turning from its path to join the bloc one day and build closer ties with Moscow.

The number includes 1,110 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Moldovans head to the polls on Sept. 28 for a pivotal parliamentary vote that could potentially derail Chisinau from its path to accession in the European Union. 

The incidents come as Russian drones and military aircraft have increasingly entered NATO airspace, prompting heightened alert and readiness across the alliance. 

Ukraine is planning both a "Mega Deal" — a major agreement on the purchase of American weapons — and a "Drone Deal," to sell Ukrainian unmanned systems to the U.S., Zelensky said.

Moscow immediately demanded a "repeat round of voting" after failing to garner the support needed to return to the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) 36-member council.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

At least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, were killed and over 70 were injured in the latest overnight mass Russian missile and drone attack, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on Sept. 28. 

The attack lasted for over 12 hours, and Russia launched almost 500 drones and over 40 missiles, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia have reported the heaviest damage from the attack thus far. Nearly 20 locations were damaged from the attack, including a five-story building that suffered from “partial destruction,” according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. Seven districts had endured damage, the city's military administration said. 

At least four people have been killed in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl. At least 14 people were also reported injured. In the surrounding Kyiv Oblast, the regional military administration reported that 28 people were wounded, including three children. Four victims, among them a child, were hospitalized, and their conditions are "moderately severe," according to the local authorities.A nurse and a patient died due to the attack at the Institute of Cardiology, according to Klymenko. 

The southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia was also targeted by the Sept. 28 missile attack. Zaporizhzhia Oblast Governor Ivan Fedorov reported that at least 38 people have been injured, among them three children.The three children have been hospitalized and two of them are in serious condition, according to Fedorov – one from mine exposion injuries and the second from carbon monoxide poisoning.Throughout the night, swarms of Shahed-style drones also threatened a number of Ukrainian regions. Explosions were reported in Kyiv, Kyiv Oblast, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi Oblast, and Sumy. 

Five Russian Tu-95 bombers took off from Olenya airfield in Murmansk Oblast at approximately 1:45 a.m. local time, monitoring channels reported. At around 2:25 a.m., the Kyiv City Military Administration warned that Russia had launched MiG-31K bombers, prompting an aerial alert across the country.  

Ukraine's Air Force then issued a warning at 3:52 a.m., saying Russia had likely launched Tu-95s from the Engels air base. 

A five-story building in the capital was partially destroyed and residential infrastructure has been damaged in multiple districts, Kyiv City Military Administration Head Tymur Tkachenko said. The attack also damaged non-residential buildings and parked cars. 

In Kyiv Oblast, fires broke out in several homes and buildings in districts outside the capital during the "mass enemy strike," regional authorities said. 

In Zaporizhzhia — the regional capital of partially Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast in southeastern Ukraine — the attack targeted the city's civilian infrastructure, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. One missile struck a multistory building directly. 

Nine houses and 14 high-rise buildings were damaged in total, Fedorov said. The attack also damaged non-residential buildings, including a school and the production facilities of an unspecified enterprise. 

"Insidious tactics, an inhuman thirst for human suffering," Regina Kharchenko, acting head of the Zaporizhzhia City Council, said the morning after the attack. 

"Yesterday's life still smolders in the windows — someone's photographs, children's toys, books. People have suffered, and the city is counting its wounds again."

Explosions were also reported in Ukraine's Khmelnytskyi Oblast. Governor Serhii Tiurin confirmed that air defenses had been active over the region during the attack, but said preliminary reports indicated no casualties.

Poland scrambled fighter jets in response to the mass attack, as it has done previously when Russian strikes threatened western Ukraine. During a mass attack on Sept. 10, Poland shot down multiple Russian drones that crossed the border and breached Polish airspace. 

Flight monitors reported that Poland on Sept. 28 closed the airspace over Lublin and Rseszow due to "unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security."

Russia has intensified the scale of its aerial attacks on Ukraine throughout the spring and summer of 2025. Heading into the colder months, officials have warned Ukrainians to brace for a new wave of Russian mass attacks targeting the country's energy infrastructure. 

Earlier in September, Russia launched over 810 Shahed-type drones and 13 missiles in a record-breaking attack that struck the Cabinet of Ministers building in central Kyiv. Two nights later, Russia attacked again, striking Ukraine and violating Polish airspace.

The incident marked the first time a NATO member has destroyed Russian drones during the full-scale war against Ukraine. It was followed by a string of Russian airspace violations and suspicious drone incursions in NATO territory. 

Amid these escalating provocations, world leaders convened in New York for the high-level U.N. General Assembly, where President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump. 

In an abrupt tonal shift, Trump declared after the meeting that Ukraine "is in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form" — with European support.

Trump later lobbed criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin for the ongoing attacks on Ukraine. 

"I'm very dissatisfied with what Russia is doing and what President Putin is doing," Trump told reporters on Sept. 25. "I haven't liked it at all. He's killing people for no reason whatsoever."

Trump has still not imposed any new U.S. sanctions against Russia despite the mounting civilian death toll.

CHISINAU, September 28. /TASS/. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has not ruled out that the results of the current parliamentary elections may be annulled due to accusations of interference in the electoral process.

"We know there was a great deal of interference, but the decisions on sanctions are taken by the competent authorities. We saw certain measures adopted by the Central Election Commission even this week," Sandu said after visiting a polling station, responding to a journalist's question about the risk of annulment due to alleged Russian meddling. Earlier this week, the CEC barred the Heart of Moldova and Greater Moldova parties from the elections, accusing them of financing violations. The final decision on Greater Moldova still requires court approval.

Earlier, Russian Ambassador to Chisinau Oleg Ozerov described the current election campaign in Moldova as the dirtiest he has ever encountered. He pointed to the "absolutely groundless accusations" made by the country's leadership against Russia. Ozerov also stressed that the authorities' refusal to allow a number of foreign observers, including those from Russia, casts doubt on the fairness of the vote.

Public opinion polls suggest that the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) could lose its majority in parliament. The opposition includes the Patriotic Electoral Bloc, centered around the Party of Socialists, which includes the parties "Heart of Moldova," "Future of Moldova," and the Communist Party. Among PAS's opponents is also the "Alternative" bloc, formed by the "National Alternative Movement," the Party for Development and Consolidation of Moldova, and the "Partidul Actiunii Comune — Congresul Civic" party. "Our Party" is also likely to enter parliament.

Voting will conclude at 9 p.m. local time [6 p.m. GMT]. The elections will be considered valid if one-third of registered voters, more than 3.2 million people, participate. The Central Election Commission is expected to announce the first preliminary results a few hours after polls close, while the final outcome must be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.

When she sees customers flocking to the Chinese-owned shops in Tanzania's biggest city, Halima Nyondo worries about the future of her small fabric shop. She recently lost a long-time buyer who preferred the cheaper prices of the Chinese retailers.

“If they keep doing it, our children will become beggars,” she said. “It's a very unfair game.”

Tanzanian merchants cannot hope to match the low prices of the Chinese shops, Ms. Nyondo says in her small store in Dar es Salaam. “They import directly in bulk, while we rely on middlemen. But this small business is the only way we survive.”

The mounting anger of Ms. Nyondo and thousands of other Tanzanian traders finally led to government action this year: a new regulation to ban foreigners from 15 economic sectors, mainly small businesses.

It's part of a larger anti-Chinese backlash across the continent. A growing number of Africans are resentful of the expanding presence of Chinese traders in markets and shops, and the mood has triggered a surge of protests, arrests, government restrictions and social-media outrage.

Over the past 20 years, China has rapidly become the biggest trading partner of most African countries, and one of the most important investors. Its construction companies have built highways, ports, railways, soccer stadiums, presidential palaces and government offices across the continent – including the headquarters of the African Union and the parliament buildings of Zimbabwe, Malawi, Gabon and Lesotho.

But while the investment is welcomed by African state leaders, the dramatic growth of Chinese shopkeepers and small mining companies is increasingly controversial at the grassroots level, where the migrants are often accused of profiting from corruption, unfair competition, counterfeit goods and environmental damage.

In Angola, scores of Chinese shops were looted by angry protesters in August, triggering the shutdown of many factories and an exodus by thousands of Chinese nationals who fled the country. In South Africa, inspectors and vigilante groups have raided Chinese factories and shops, hunting for immigration violations and other infractions.

In Zimbabwe and Zambia, local media have exposed environmental disasters caused by Chinese mining companies, including poisoned rivers and razed hillsides, provoking public outrage. In Ghana, authorities have arrested dozens of Chinese migrants, accusing them of illegal mining, a phenomenon that has led to deforestation, soil degradation and toxic river pollution.

There have been anti-Chinese protests in Africa in the past, as far back as the early years of the century. This time, however, the protests are more widespread and more vociferous, even in countries that are traditionally friendly to Beijing.

Several countries have taken the same step as Tanzania: promising stronger enforcement and regulations to crack down on Chinese activities. 

In Zimbabwe, where China has long been welcomed, the government has recently become more willing to criticize, with one official accusing the Chinese of bribery, illicit financial activities, evading the banking system and even desecrating graves.

“We are noticing that some Chinese companies are digging up our ancestors' graves to extract granite or gold,” said Tafadzwa Muguti, secretary for presidential affairs in Zimbabwe's cabinet office, in a speech to a Chinese business forum. “They move the bones aside and begin digging. That is a deep sign of disrespect in any culture.”

By some estimates, anywhere from 700,000 to one million Chinese nationals are living in Africa today. Some are workers for Chinese companies, but many are traders, merchants or mining entrepreneurs who found China's business sectors too crowded and competitive – so they migrated to Africa instead.

“Africa is a big market, people need everything here, and they want it cheap,” said Xin Li, who sells Bluetooth speakers and cellphone chargers in Dar es Salaam's vast and bustling Kariakoo market.

He arrived from China six years ago. While his imported goods can sometimes be stuck at Tanzanian ports for weeks, he says he still makes money. “For us, it is opportunity. In China, competition is too much. Here, if you work hard, you can make profit.”

Another Chinese trader, Zhang Xinghao, sells brightly coloured plastic shoes from a stall in the market. “I came because friends told me business is good here,” she said. “And yes, it is good, but it is also very hard. Customers always want cheaper, cheaper. Profit is small. But if you sell a lot, you can get something.”

Many Tanzanians are grateful for the Chinese businesses, seeing them as sources of employment and cheap prices. And some Chinese have quickly integrated by learning the local Swahili language. “Sometimes, you forget they are foreigners,” said Said Ally, a motorcycle taxi driver who often ferries Chinese customers. “They call me kaka [brother] just like anyone else.”

In the dense warren of alleys in Kariakoo market, the streets are packed with vendors shouting prices, porters pushing overloaded tricycles and motorbikes swerving recklessly through the crowds. The air is heavy with sweat, diesel fumes and the sharp tang of raw sewage. Every square inch of space is claimed: wooden stalls crammed with second-hand jeans, fruit piled high in plastic containers, boxes of Chinese electronics spilling into the street.

Here, a Tanzanian trader typically sells a pair of plastic sandals for 5,000 shillings (less than $3) – but the same sandals in a nearby Chinese-owned shop are just 3,500 shillings. A kettle that would cost 22,000 shillings at a local stall is just 15,000 across the street.

“Why should I pay more?” asked Anna Mwakyusa, leaving a Chinese shop with a bag of plastic plates. “I know these things don't last long, but I can buy two for the price of one.”

For many Tanzanian traders, the consequences are dire. The Kariakoo Traders Association estimates that the monthly income of the average small trader has dropped by about 40 per cent in the past five years as Chinese competition intensifies.

“Some of the Chinese are even hawking shoes or frying potato chips – jobs that should be done by Tanzanians,” said Severine Mushi, chairman of the traders group.

“Let them work in large-scale manufacturing projects, where they can bring technology transfer. But don't let them open shops selling the same socks and cooking oil as our people. It is killing us. We are being slowly strangled.”

Chinese traders have unfair advantages, he said, because of their access to cheap imports from Chinese factories and cheap credit from Chinese banks.

“People are already saying, ‘Why are we suffering in our own land while foreigners take the profits?' This breeds anger, even xenophobia.”

Some Tanzanian traders allege that Chinese merchants use bribery for quick access to licences and permits. “If you are local, you wait months to get a licence, but if you are Chinese, you just pay someone and within days you are trading,” said Mohammed Musa, a clothing dealer.

Elsewhere in the city, thousands of Chinese migrants have moved into an upscale suburb, Mikocheni, where they run everything from garages and car-wash stations to herbal clinics and restaurants.

Tanzanian trader Salum Juma points to a stack of plastic chairs that have stood unsold for weeks. “Before the Chinese came, I could move a whole batch like this in two days,” he said. “Every morning, I wonder if I will make enough to pay rent and support my family.”

A shop called Chinese Citistore is popular among bargain-hunters. Almost everything – cosmetics, costume jewelry and beauty kits − is priced at 3,000 shillings (about $1.70). “It's unbelievably cheap,” said Mariam Lubogo, a university student shopping for eyeliner and earrings. “If I buy it elsewhere, I'd pay three times this price.”

Tanzanian traders are waiting for a new regulation to take effect banning foreign nationals from 15 types of business activities.Imani Nsamila/The Globe and Mail

Under a new Tanzanian regulation, approved in July, foreign nationals are prohibited from 15 types of business activities, including cellphone and electronics repair, mobile money transfers, beauty salons, small-scale mining, tour guiding, real estate brokering, home and office cleaning, crop buying and parcel delivery. Violators can be jailed, fined or lose their work visas and residence permits.

Tanzanian traders were pleased by the new regulation – until they discovered that the government had unofficially delayed its enforcement until after the Oct. 29 national election, seeking to avoid political turbulence.

“We were excited when this rule finally came out, but now I'm disappointed,” said Mariam Hussein, a 43-year-old mother of three who sells domestic utensils.

“It's frustrating. It's like fighting a ghost. Every day, we see the Chinese quietly at it again. They just change the shop name, or put a Tanzanian in front, while they stay inside organizing everything.”

While some Chinese traders are betting that the anti-foreigner regulations will be diluted after the election, others are planning their exit.

“This law is unfair to people like us who are trying to make a small profit by selling the goods that Tanzanians need,” said Zhang Xinghao, the plastic-shoe seller.

“Shutting down our shops would be really hard and painful. We've built our whole lives here. If they force us out, some of us will have no choice but to leave.”

The Trump administration has condemned the “tyrannical” arrest of a Scottish anti-abortion campaigner for breaching the country's buffer zone laws.

Rose Docherty, 75, was detained by police on Wednesday for standing across the road from Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital while holding a sign that read: “Coercion is a crime, here to talk, only if you want.”

Footage of the incident shows the grandmother-of-two being loaded into a police van by four officers before she was allegedly left in a cell for two hours without a chair, despite having undergone two hip replacements.

It is the second time she has been arrested for breaching Scotland's buffer zone laws, which are enforced within 200m of every hospital, forbidding harassment, intimidation and “influencing” of anyone seeking to access abortion services.

Ms Docherty was charged and released on bail under conditions that ban her from entering an area surrounding the hospital.

The US State Department denounced Ms Docherty's latest arrest as “egregious”, warning that “common sense and basic civility are under attack” in Britain.

A State Department spokesman told The Telegraph: “The arrest of Rose Docherty is another egregious example of the tyrannical suppression of free speech happening across Europe.

“When 75-year-old grandmothers are being arrested for standing peacefully and offering conversation, common sense and basic civility are under attack.

“The United States will always speak out against these violations of fundamental rights.”

The comments are the latest warning from the Trump administration about freedom of expression coming under threat in the UK.

Reacting to her arrest, Ms Docherty said: “Everybody has the right to engage in consensual conversation. I held my sign with love and compassion, inviting anyone who wants to chat, to do so – and stood peacefully, not approaching anyone.

“I should not be treated as a criminal for inviting people to chat with me – lending a listening ear. Conversation is not forbidden on the streets of Glasgow. And yet, this is the second time I have been arrested for doing just that.”

In February, Ms Docherty became the first woman to be arrested under Scotland's abortion buffer zones law, when she held the same sign outside the same hospital.

A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Around 1.50pm on Wednesday, Sept 24 2025, we were called to a report of a small protest on Hardgate Road in Glasgow.

“Officers attended and a 75-year-old woman was arrested and charged in connection with a breach of the Safe Access Zone legislation.

“We take the health and safety of those who come into our custody seriously and ask people about vulnerabilities to provide the facilities they need.”

The Safe Access Zones Act was passed by MSPs last year and came into force in September.

The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Scotland's public prosecution service, eventually dropped the case against Ms Docherty last month amid global outcry against her prosecution.

The State Department responded by applauding Scottish prosecutors' “sensible decision”.

The move to arrest Ms Docherty for a second time comes after months of scrutiny from the Trump administration, which has increasingly been prepared to intervene in British domestic affairs on the issue of freedom of speech.

In March, a delegation of US officials was sent to Britain to meet with pro-life activists, including Ms Docherty, amid concerns about the erosion of freedom of expression.

After the visit, the Glaswegian churchgoer said it was “heartening that others around the world, including the US government, have realised this injustice and voiced their support”.

Concerns around freedom of expression have taken on renewed significance in the US following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, with Republicans framing his killing as an assault on Christian values.

Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York last week, Donald Trump called on world leaders to “defend free speech” and “protect religious liberty”, labelling Christianity the “most persecuted religion on the planet”.

Lorcan Price, legal counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom International, which sponsored Ms Docherty's case, said: “It's deeply concerning that Scottish policing resources are being ploughed into arresting and prosecuting a peaceful grandmother offering to speak to people in public, rather than focusing on the problems caused by real crime in Glasgow.

“This is not a case about harassment, intimidation or violent protest – this is simply a grandmother, who held a sign offering to speak to anyone who would like to engage.”

Funding for the federal government is set to run out after Sept. 30, triggering a halt to “non-essential” government work.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is speaking out against the Crown prosecutors' attempt to seize the truck belonging to one of the Freedom Convoy's organizers, Chris Barber, who is awaiting sentencing.

Barber, who was one of the organizers of the 2022 Freedom Convoy protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other pandemic measures, was found guilty of mischief along with fellow organizer Tamara Lich in April. Barber was also found guilty of counselling others to disobey a court order.

NEW YORK, September 28. /TASS/. US businessman Elon Musk said that he had rejected in the past an invitation from financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to visit his island.

"Anyone pushing this false narrative deserves complete contempt. Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I refused," he wrote on the X. Musk responded in this way to reports appeared in mass media that his name is present in Epstein case files.

Epstein was detained by New York State law enforcement on July 6, 2019. The prosecutor's office said that there was evidence that in 2002-2005 he organized visits to his Manhattan home by dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14 years old. Epstein's friends and acquaintances included a large number of current and retired officials not only from the United States, but also from many other countries (including former heads of state), major entrepreneurs and show stars. The criminal prosecution of the financier in the United States was terminated after his suicide in a prison cell on August 10, 2019.

A gunman opened fire inside a Mormon church in Michigan during Sunday services before apparently setting the building ablaze, killing at least one person and injuring nine before police shot him, authorities said.

The shooting occurred at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Detroit, local police said in a social media post.

GRAND BLANC TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service and set the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring eight others before police shot him, authorities said.

Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a four-door pickup with two American flags in the truck bed through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Investigators believe he “deliberately” set the building on fire, Renye said.

Officers responded to a 911 call and were at the church within 30 seconds and killed the shooter about seven minutes later, Renye said. After the suspect left the church, two officers pursued him and “engaged in gunfire,” the chief said. 

Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out.

Renye identified the suspect as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from neighboring Burton. Reyne did not specify a motive at a news conference on Sunday evening. Police cordoned off the street leading to the suspect's home.

Renye said one of the wounded people was in critical condition Sunday evening and seven others were stable. Earlier in the day, Renye had said authorities believed they would find more victims once they could sift through the wreckage and find where the fire was.

Investigators were searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church.

It was the latest of many shooting attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children during Mass at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis. 

President Donald Trump said in a social media post that he was briefed on the shooting and applauded the FBI for its response. Local authorities said the FBI was sending 100 agents to Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint. 

“PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!” Trump wrote. 

The church building, circled by a parking lot and a large lawn, is near residential areas and a Jehovah's Witness church. 

Brad Schneemann, whose home is about 400 yards (365 meters) from the church, told The Associated Press that he and his daughter heard “two rounds of four to five shots” around 10:30 a.m. “Then, we really didn't hear anything for a while” before they left their home to see what was going on.

Timothy Jones, 48, said his family is part of another Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation, or ward, about 15 minutes away, but that his children were at the Grand Blanc Township ward Saturday night for a youth fall festival. He and his family moved to Flint two years ago in large part because of how strong the faith's community is in the area, he said. 

As people in his congregation got word of the shooting from texts and phone calls during their Sunday service, his ward went into lockdown and police came as a precaution, he said. His children were “frantically, just trying to get word that people were OK.”

Sundays are “supposed to be a time of peace and a time of reflection and worship,” Jones said. Yet in the wake of violence at other houses of worship, a shooting “feels inevitable, and all the more tragic because of that,” he added.

The shooting occurred the morning after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101. The next president is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol. 

“The church is in communication with local law enforcement as the investigation continues and as we receive updates on the condition of those affected,” spokesperson Doug Anderson said.

“Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved.”

When striking nurses at nearby Henry Ford Hospital heard about the shooting, some left the picket line and ran the short distance to the church to help first responders, Teamsters Local 332 President Dan Glass said.

“Human lives matter more than our labor dispute,” Glass said.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart was breaking for the community. “Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” she said.

The impact spread quickly to neighboring communities, including the small city that shares a name with the township.

“Although we are two separate governmental units, we are a very cohesive community,” said city of Grand Blanc Mayor John Creasey. “This sort of thing is painful for our entire community.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Armed federal agents patrolled Chicago's downtown streets on Sunday, a new escalation of an immigration enforcement crackdown there that followed President Donald Trump's announcement that he will send troops to Portland in the latest examples of creeping federal law enforcement presence in U.S. cities. 

Meanwhile, Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has said federal authorities, including immigration and drug enforcement agents, are expected to arrive in Memphis starting this week. 

In Chicago on Sunday, dozens of armed federal agents, in full tactical gear, walked the streets of some of the city's most prominent tourist and shopping areas. That comes amid a surge of immigration enforcement that began early this month, including repeated conflict at an ICE building in Broadview, west of Chicago, where federal authorities  on Friday and Saturday fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters. 

Trump said on social media Saturday that he was directing the Department of Defense to “provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland.” Trump said the decision was necessary to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. His announcement was met with pushback from Oregon's Democratic governor.

The moves follow Trump's crime crackdown in the District of Columbia and actions in Los Angeles in response to immigration protests that turned violent with the arrival of troops.

Here's a rundown of potential and current federal law enforcement activity in Chicago, Portland and Memphis.




On Sunday, federal agents marched along Michigan Avenue, the Chicago River and upscale neighborhoods, attracting attention from shoppers and families dining at sidewalk cafes. Many pulled out cameras to record. Activists also trailed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, blowing whistles and shouting.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blasted the sudden physical show of force. 

“While Chicagoans and visitors are enjoying another gorgeous Sunday, they are being intimidated by masked federal agents flaunting automatic weapons for no apparent reason,” Johnson said in a statement. 

Pritzker echoed the sentiment. 

“This is not making anybody safer — it's a show of intimidation, instilling fear in our communities and hurting our businesses,” Pritzker said in a statement.

Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol agent central to the Los Angeles immigration crackdown, was among the agents who walked several miles near downtown. 

Federal officials have said the Chicago surge was intended to arrest “the worst of the worst” people in the country illegally and with criminal records. Bovino told The Associated Press that agents had made “several arrests” but declined to give specifics on whether the patrols downtown were aimed at specific people.

“We've always got a target that's anyone who is here illegally,” Bovino said. 

Over the weekend, tension rose outside an ICE building in suburban Broadview about 12 miles (19 kilometers) west of Chicago. On Friday, agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward a crowd of over 100 protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. Pepper bullets and tear gas canisters went into the crowd, most of them standing away from the fence and not blocking traffic.

Protesters and local reporters described similar scenes on Saturday night. 

Broadview's mayor criticized ICE for actions that she said have endangered local police, firefighters, residents near the facility and protesters. 

In previous weeks, protesters had also tried to block agents' vehicles from moving in or out of a yard next to the building. 

Activists and family members of detainees have raised concerns in recent days that the facility meant to process arrestees is a de facto detention center plagued by inhumane conditions. 

Trump previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago but has yet to follow through.

Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek responded to Trump's comments that he was “authorizing Full Force, if necessary” to handle “domestic terrorists” by saying he is abusing his authority by ordering troops into a city that she said is doing “just fine” on its own. 

Other government, police and business leaders said soldiers are not needed and Trump is presenting a false picture of the city.

“There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security,” Kotek told reporters.

The governor said she “tried to understand his reasoning” during their conversation and his response was just, “Let's keep talking.”

A Pentagon spokesperson said the Department of Defense would provide information and updates when available. A spokesperson for the Oregon National Guard said any requests for Guard support would need to be coordinated through the governor's office.

Late Saturday, a small crowd of protesters gathered on the sidewalk outside an ICE facility. One person was arrested by federal law enforcement after a brief confrontation as ICE agents cleared a path for a vehicle exiting the facility.

Recent demonstrations have focused on the area around the ICE building. Some federal agents have been injured and several protesters have been charged with assault. Some demonstrators also say they have been injured. 

Trump said earlier this month that he was creating a task force of federal law enforcement agencies to combat crime in Memphis. The city has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that the majority-Black city is seeing decreases this year in some crime categories. 

Lee, the governor, has publicly said he would not expect more than 150 National Guard members to be sent to Memphis, though he's said the numbers aren't solidified. The city said Friday there won't be tanks. The Guard troops won't be making arrests and won't be armed unless local authorities request that, Lee said Friday. 

It's unclear when Guard members will arrive. Lee also said 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers will be in the region.

Latinos in Memphis have expressed concern that ICE agents will increase their presence in Memphis and detain people who are in the country legally.

On Saturday, dozens of people marched to a plaza in front of City Hall to protest the law enforcement surge. Speakers at a news conference said that, instead of federal troops and agents, Memphis needs more funding for education, crime prevention, youth services and hospitals. 

Oregon officials have made similar comments.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will speak at a hastily called meeting of top military leaders on Tuesday, according to a White House official.

Hundreds of generals and admirals — senior commanders of the one-star rank or higher and their top advisers — have been summoned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from all over the world to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, with little notice.

The White House official was not authorized to discuss the president's plans before a public announcement about his attendance and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Trump told NBC News in an interview Sunday that they would be “talking about how well we're doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.”

News about the meeting broke Thursday, and no reason was initially provided for the unusual gathering. Trump didn't seem to know about it when first asked by reporters during an Oval Office appearance.

“I'll be there if they want me, but why is it such a big deal?” Trump said. 

The official said the president's participation was not part of the original plan for the meeting but that he decided that he wanted to go. 

Trump's participation in the meeting raises the likelihood of a politicized event in front of a nonpartisan audience of military leaders. For example, he delivered campaign-style remarks to uniformed personnel at Fort Bragg in North Carolina in June, attacking his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.




The Republican president is also expanding his use of the military in American cities, arguing that it's necessary to fight crime in places where Democratic leaders are failing to ensure public safety.

The National Guard continues to patrol in the District of Columbia, and a smaller deployment is expected in Memphis, Tennessee. On Saturday, Trump said he would also send troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect against “domestic terrorists.”

Over the objections of local and state officials, Trump previously sent the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, where there were protests against immigration raids. 

The Pentagon's top spokesman has previously confirmed that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.”

Across the military, there are 800 generals and admirals of all ranks. Many command thousands of service members and are stationed across the world in more than a dozen countries and time zones.

The Washington Post first reported on Trump's plans to attend the upcoming meeting.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — On the eve of meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel is working on a new ceasefire plan with the White House, but details are still being sorted out.

Netanyahu has come under heavy international pressure to end the war, especially during the ongoing offensive in Gaza City. The death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has topped 66,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said Sunday.

In Monday's White House meeting, Trump is expected to share a new proposal for ending the conflict.

“We're working on it,” Netanyahu told Fox News Sunday's “The Sunday Briefing.” “It's not been finalized yet, but we're working with President Trump's team, actually as we speak, and I hope we can -- we can make it a go.”

Arab officials briefed on the plan say the 21-point proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the proposal has not been formally announced.

Netanyahu has vowed to continue fighting until Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war, is destroyed. But he repeated an offer to allow Hamas operatives to leave Gaza as part of a deal ending the conflict.

“If they finish the war, release all the hostages, we let them out,” he said. 




Trump has so far stood behind Israel. But the U.S. leader has shown signs of impatience lately, particularly after Israel struck the headquarters of Hamas' political leadership in Doha, Qatar, earlier this month. Ceasefire talks have stalled since, despite growing international and domestic protests.

Key Western allies have joined a list of countries recognizing a Palestinian state over Israeli objections. The European Union is considering sanctions and there are growing moves for a sports and cultural boycott against Israel.

A defiant Netanyahu told fellow world leaders Friday at the U.N. General Assembly that his nation “must finish the job” against Hamas in Gaza, where 48 hostages are still held captive, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive.

Trump's ceasefire proposal would include the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks, said the proposal is not final and changes are highly likely.

Trump discussed the proposal with Arab leaders in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Hamas has said it is ready to “study any proposals positively and responsibly.”

The official said the group had previously said it was willing to release all hostages in return for an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip.

Local hospitals in central Gaza said at least 10 people were killed when at least two strikes hit homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Gaza's Health Ministry said in its daily report the death toll has climbed to 66,005, with a further 168,162 wounded since the war started.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run administration, does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its toll, but has said women and children make up around half the dead. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts.

Residents reported hearing sounds of explosions overnight across the city, likely coming from the demolition of buildings through the detonation of explosive-laden vehicles and robots. “They were nonstop,” Sayed Baker, a Palestinian who shelters close to a Shifa hospital, said of the explosions.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes, but said it struck 140 Hamas military targets over the past 24 hours, including militants, observation equipment and infrastructure.

On Sunday, the military said it had struck a high-rise building in Gaza City after warning residents to evacuate. The strike leveled the 16-story Macca tower. No casualties were reported.

The Israeli military said the building housed “military infrastructure belonging to Hamas.” It is the latest in a series of demolitions in recent weeks as Israel expands its offensive.

Israel's offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displacing around 90% of the population amid a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.

On Sunday, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier died of wounds sustained in an attack at a road junction near Nablus in the West Bank, and security forces shot dead the alleged attacker, the army said. The attack was praised by Hamas. Violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want for a future state. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Dell'Orto reported from Jerusalem.

Richard Sterban of the Oak Ridge Boys shared a devastating health update with his fans.

The 82-year-old musician took to his band's website on Thursday, Sept. 25, to announce that he has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

"In March of this year, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer," Sterban said. "But I am under the care of the best cancer doctors in the country and, with the help of the Good Lord above, I believe I will be able to get through this."

He continued: "I want to thank everyone, especially the fans, for your concern, and I would appreciate your continued prayers. Most days I'm feeling very good, and I hope to be back out on the road in several months."

COUNTRY STAR RAUL MALO SHARES CANCER HAS ‘TAKEN A TURN' DUE TO RARE COMPLICATION, CANCELS 2025 SHOWS

Sterban has been a member of The Oak Ridge boys for over 50 years, having joined the quartet in 1972. He last appeared on stage with the band during their performance at the Academy of Country Music Awards in May, with Aaron McCune and Tim Duncan filling in for him lately during the band's tour.

"I want to thank everyone, especially the fans, for your concern, and I would appreciate your continued prayers. Most days I'm feeling very good, and I hope to be back out on the road in several months."

His announcement comes one year after late band member, Joe Bonsall, died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) complications. Bonsall had announced in January 2024 that he would no longer be touring because his diagnosis had gotten "to a point that walking is impossible."

"It has been a great 50 years and I am thankful to all the Oak Ridge Boys band crew and staff for the constant love and support shown to me through it all," he wrote at the time. "I will never forget and for those of you who have been constantly holding me up in prayer I thank you and ask for you to keep on praying," he added.

The popular country and gospel music band was originally founded in 1943, and was originally known as The Oak Ridge Quartet. Throughout the years, the band has had many members.

At the height of the band's popularity, the band consisted of baritone William Lee Golden, tenor Bonsall, bass Richard Sterban and Duane Allen, the lead vocalist.

Allen spoke to Fox News in January 2021 about his relationship with Golden, Bonsall and Sterban, saying "I think the four of us have grown closer than we've ever been in our whole career."

"We've all just matured into good friends. We've always been close. We've always been good friends. But when you're younger and when things are exploding all around you and your career is exploding in the public, then little grievances that we might have one toward the other, they all explode, too," Allen said.

He continued: "We've been through that period of time and we lived through it and we realized that the things that we love about each other and the things that we've accomplished with each other are so much more important than the little things that might pull us apart."

President Donald Trump reacted to the mass shooting that occurred Sunday at a church in Michigan, calling it a “targeted attack.”

“I have been briefed on the horrendous shooting that took place at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in Grand Blanc, Michigan,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. 

“The suspect is dead, but there is still a lot to learn. This appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America. The Trump Administration will keep the Public posted, as we always do. In the meantime, PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!” Trump added.

ONE DEAD, MORE FATALITIES EXPECTED FROM FIRE IN MICHIGAN MORMON CHURCH SHOOTING

As of Sunday afternoon, one victim had died as a result of being shot, and ten others were wounded. The gunman is also suspected of starting a fire at the church, which has since been contained. Authorities said they expect there to be more victims found as a result of the fire. 

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often referred to as the Mormon church, have largely been considered outsiders to Christianity. While centered on Jesus Christ, the LDS faith includes more scripture than most Christian denominations, as the Book of Mormon, in particular, gives them their nickname.

Vice President JD Vance also responded to the shooting.

“Just an awful situation in Michigan. FBI is on the scene and the entire administration is monitoring things,” Vance wrote on X. “Say a prayer for the victims and first responders.”

Just an awful situation in Michigan. FBI is on the scene and the entire administration is monitoring things. Say a prayer for the victims and first responders. 🙏

LEADER OF THE LDS CHURCH DIES AT 101

The members of the LDS Church are a throng of 17 million members, with the majority residing outside of the United States. Over 46,000 Michiganders are counted in the religion. Grand Blanc's city and township has a combined total of 47,500 people, and is located north of Ann Arbor and Detroit. 

Officials haven't released the name of the suspect, who is now deceased, but have described him as a 40-year-old male. He drove into the church after worship services had begun.

Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst discusses the release of American citizen Amir Amiri, who was held by Taliban since 2024.

The U.S. secured the release of an American citizen being detained in Afghanistan following months of negotiations on Sunday, Fox News has learned.

The U.S. and Qatar jointly negotiated for the release of Amir Amiry, U.S. Special Envoy Adam Boehler told Fox News on Sunday.

"When we went to Kabul to pick up George Glezmann six months ago, I asked to see Amir Amiry. He was brought to the airport gate and when he saw us he started to cry. Leaving an American was the hardest thing that I have ever done in my life and I promised him that we would come back for him," Boehler told Fox.

"Amir Amiry became a citizen by putting his life at risk fighting for our country and our troops. Today we repay the favor. God bless America and God bless the President," Boehler added.

"Throughout Mr. Amiry's detention, Qatari diplomats remained in close communication with US officials and carried out regular health checks to ensure his wellbeing," a source familiar with Amiri's detention told Fox News.

"His release was facilitated by Qatari diplomats in close coordination with the team of the US Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs, through Qatar's role as the United States' protecting power in Afghanistan," the source added.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated Amiry's release, thanking Qatar in an X post Sunday afternoon.

"Today we welcome home Amir Amiry, an American who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan. I want to thank Qatar for helping secure his freedom," Rubio said. "@POTUS has made it clear we will not stop until every American unjustly detained abroad is back home."

Amiry's release comes roughly a week after the Taliban released an elderly British couple after eight months in captivity.

Barbie Reynolds, 76, and husband Peter Reynolds, 80, arrived in Qatar on Friday following months of negotiations between Qatar, the Taliban and Britain.  

The couple had lived in Afghanistan for 18 years, where they ran an education charity. Despite the ordeal, Barbie Reynolds said they would return to Afghanistan if they could. They are both Afghan citizens.

"God is good, as they say in Afghanistan," she added at the Kabul airport.

Oregon moved up to No. 2 in The Associated Press college football poll on Sunday, Mississippi earned its highest ranking since 2015, Alabama jumped back into the top 10 and Virginia was in the Top 25 for the first time in six years in the wake of a volatile weekend in which four top-10 teams lost.

Ohio State won at Washington and remains No. 1 for the fifth straight week. The Buckeyes received 46 first-place votes, six fewer than a week ago, and their 37-point lead over Oregon is the closest margin between the top two teams since the preseason poll in mid-August.

Oregon's two-overtime win at Penn State earned the Ducks 16 first-place votes, 15 more than last week, and gave them their highest ranking since they were No. 1 for two months last year.

Miami, which had an open date, slipped one spot to No. 3 and was followed by Mississippi and idle Oklahoma. The No. 4 Rebels got a nine-rung promotion for beating LSU and have their highest ranking since they were No. 3 in late September 2015. LSU fell to No. 13, swapping places with Mississippi.

Texas A&M, Penn State, Indiana, Texas and Alabama round out the top 10. 

Alabama, which had been out of the top 10 since losing its opener against Florida State by two touchdowns, has won three straight after beating Georgia for the 10th time in 11 meetings and ending the Bulldogs' 33-game home win streak. No. 12 Georgia has its lowest ranking since it was No. 12 on Dec. 6, 2020. It's just the second poll the Bulldogs have been out of the top 10 since 2021. 

Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll.

The losses by Penn State, LSU and Georgia marked the first time since 2016 that three top-five teams lost the same week in the regular season.

Florida State's loss at Virginia was the latest development in an up-and-down season for the Seminoles. They went from unranked to No. 14 for beating ‘Bama, were in the top 10 for three weeks and plunged 10 spots to No. 18 this week.

No. 24 Virginia, not listed on any ballots in the previous poll, was rewarded for beating its highest-ranked opponent since then-No. 4 Florida State in 2005. The Cavaliers are 4-1 for a second straight season for the first time since 2003-04.

No. 25 Arizona State's come-from-behind victory over TCU returned the Sun Devils to the Top 25 after a three-week absence.

Southern California (21) and TCU (24) dropped out.

— Week 5 marked the second time this season that four top-10 teams lost. It also happened in Week 1, but three of the four top-10 teams had to lose that week because there were three top-10 matchups.

— Mississippi's nine-spot rise into the top five was the biggest by any team since the Rebels jumped 12 spots to No. 3 for beating Alabama in 2015.

— Indiana has been the fastest riser over the past month, moving up 15 rungs since Week 1. Over that span, Oklahoma and Texas A&M have each risen 13 spots.

SEC (10) — Nos. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19.

Big Ten (6) — Nos. 1, 2, 7, 8, 20, 22.

Big 12 (4) — Nos. 11, 14, 23, 25.

ACC (4) — Nos. 3, 17, 18, 24.

Independent (1) — No. 21.

Miami at Florida State: It will be the 27th time the Hurricanes and Seminoles face off as ranked teams. Miami is 15-11 in those games but Florida State has won the last five such contests, the last of which came in 2016.

Vanderbilt at Alabama: Crimson Tide will be looking for payback. Vanderbilt's 40-35 win as a 23-point underdog last season marked the Commodores' first over a No. 1 team and was widely regarded as the 2024 upset of the year.

U.S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran and Acting I.C.E. Director Todd Lyons show 'My View with Lara Trump' around their joint intelligence and operations center in New York City.

The Department of Homeland Security released images of firearms confiscated from anti-ICE "rioters" in Chicago on Sunday.

DHS says it has launched an investigation after discovering "what appears to be" an explosive device outside the Chicago ICE facility. Authorities did not announce the specific charges leveled against the protesters.

"11 violent rioters were arrested last night in Chicago outside the ICE detention facility: These are two guns that were taken off rioters in Chicago right against the fence at our ICE detention facility," DHS wrote.

"An investigation is underway into what appears to be some sort of explosive device found last night near the ICE Chicago detention facility," the statement continued.

Federal law enforcement agents deployed pepper balls and tear gas Friday during a standoff with anti-ICE protesters outside of Chicago.

The confrontation came just two days after a shooter opened fire at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas. The gunman in that incident killed one detainee and injured two others before taking his own life, authorities said.

At least 50 protesters were seen midday Friday at an ICE processing center in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. An ICE spokesperson told Fox News that two were arrested, one of whom was carrying a firearm.

At one point, video showed federal law enforcement attempting to clear the protesters out of the area. The demonstrators were also seen trying to block vehicles from leaving.

Last week, violent clashes between protesters and ICE agents at the facility led to 16 arrests.  

In the demonstration, "rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property," the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, adding that rioters also assaulted law enforcement officials.

Former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker joins 'Fox News Live' to react to a shooting and fire at a Mormon Church in Michigan.

A gunman was "down" after shooting multiple people at a Michigan church that was also engulfed in flames on Sunday, authorities said.

The active shooter situation unfolded just before 10:30 a.m. local time at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, the Grand Blanc Township Police Department said in a post on social media.

"There are multiple victims and the shooter is down," police said. "There is NO threat to the public at this time. The church is actively on fire."

Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye told reporters at a press conference that the suspect is a 40-year-old male from Burton.

"He drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church," Renye said. "He then exited his vehicle, firing several rounds at individuals within the church. Ten gunshot victims have been transported to local hospitals at this time, including one who has been deceased."

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was receiving briefings about the "horrific shooting" and fire at the church.

"Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling," Bondi said in a post on X. "Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy."

Bondi said that agents with the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were heading to the scene.

Video from the scene shows dark billowing smoke rising into the air and multiple firetrucks working to extinguish the fire. Medical responders were seen rolling several gurneys toward the church while law enforcement officials in tactical gear were also on the scene.

The shooter is believed to have set the church on fire, a source told FOX2 Detroit. 

No further details about the shooter or how the shooter was neutralized were immediately provided.

A spokesperson for Henry Ford Health confirmed to Fox News that its hospital "is receiving patients from a shooting at a nearby church."

Police sources told the station that six to eight people were shot.

No details about the victims or their conditions were immediately provided.

Church services for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are typically two hours long, with the services at this location starting at 10 a.m. with a sacrament service. Based on initial reports of the shooting, it appears the shooting happened during the sacrament service when the congregation was gathered in the chapel.

CAIRO (AP) — The death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has topped 66,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Health Ministry said Sunday, a day before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu heads to the White House for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump on halting Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza City.

Netanyahu has come under heavy international pressure to end the war. Key Western allies have joined a growing list of countries recognizing a Palestinian state over Israeli objections. The European Union is considering sanctions and there are growing moves for a sports and cultural boycott against Israel.

After dozens of delegates poured out of the hall, a defiant Netanyahu told fellow world leaders Friday at the U.N. General Assembly that his nation “must finish the job” against Hamas in Gaza as his military pressed on with an offensive in Gaza City.

Trump has so far stood behind Israel. But the U.S. leader has shown signs of impatience lately, particularly after Israel's bombing of Qatar earlier this month in what appears to have been a failed attempt to kill Hamas' leadership. In Monday's White House meeting, Trump is expected to share a new proposal for ending the war.

Forty-eight hostages are still held captive in Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive, since an attack by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered the war. Ceasefire talks have been stalled since Israel's widely condemned strike in Doha, Qatar.




Trump has floated a 21-point proposal for an immediate ceasefire.

The proposal would include the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks, said the proposal is not final and changes are highly likely.

Trump discussed the proposal with Arab leaders in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Hamas has said it is ready to “study any proposals positively and responsibly.”

The official said the group had previously said it was willing to release all hostages in return for an end to the war and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, will visit Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials to discuss the ceasefire as well as Egypt's frayed ties with Israel, according to officials.

The U.S. Embassy in Israel said Huckabee will travel to Cairo as part of “regular diplomatic consultations” between regional partners, though the exact timing was not confirmed.

The relationship between Israel and Egypt — the first Arab country to establish ties with Israel — has unraveled in recent months over Israel's attack targeting Hamas leadership in Doha and worries that Palestinians squeezed out of the Gaza Strip could flood into Egypt. Israel has also expressed concern over an Egyptian military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula, a violation of the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries. 

Local hospitals in central Gaza said at least 10 people were killed when at least two strikes hit homes in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Gaza's Health Ministry said in its daily report the death toll has climbed to 66,005, with a further 168,162 wounded since the war started. Among the dead were 79 who were brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, it said.

The ministry, part of the Hamas-run administration, does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its toll, but has said women and children make up around half the dead. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts.

Residents reported hearing sounds of explosions overnight across the city, likely coming from the demolition of buildings through the detonation of explosive-laden vehicles and robots. “They were nonstop,” Sayed Baker, a Palestinian who shelters close to a Shifa hospital, said of the explosions.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strikes, but said it struck 140 Hamas military targets over the past 24 hours, including militants, observation equipment and infrastructure.

On Sunday, the military said it had struck a high-rise building in Gaza City after warning residents to evacuate. The strike leveled the 16-story Macca tower. No casualties were reported.

The Israeli military said the building housed “military infrastructure belonging to Hamas.” It is the latest in a series of demolitions in recent weeks as Israel expands its offensive.

Israel's offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.

On Sunday, Israeli security forces also shot dead the alleged attacker in a car-ramming incident in which a man was seriously injured at a road junction near Nablus in the West Bank. The attack was praised by Hamas. Violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want for a future state. ___ Lidman reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

A shooter at the Church of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, killed at least two people and injured multiple other victims on Sunday. The gunman is now deceased, according to local police.

Police said there is no threat to the public at this time. The church building was on fire, and authorities now say the blaze is contained. They expect more victims to be found at the site where the fire erupted.

Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford has been identified as the suspect who drove a vehicle into the church's front doors Sunday morning, where “hundreds” of people were attending service. Law enforcement was dispatched at 10:25 a.m. The suspect exited his vehicle and opened fire on attendees. One person was announced dead at the church, and another was announced dead at a nearby hospital. Eight victims are now hospitalized. At least some of those hospitalized are in critical condition.

Renye said it is believed the church's fire was started “deliberately” by the suspect, and believes victims who were not able to escape will be found there. 

Police engaged with the shooter, who is “no longer with us.” Renye said the next steps will be to issue search warrants on the suspect's residence to find out more about him, and more information about this shooting will be provided at 5 p.m. today.

“My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Grand Blanc close,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) said on X.

FBI agents have been dispatched to the scene, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. Reyne said over 100 federal agents are expected.

“We are tracking reports of the horrific shooting and fire at an LDS church in Grand Blanc, Michigan. @FBI agents are on the scene to assist local authorities. Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act. Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy,” Patel said on X.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also condemned violence in a place of worship, calling it “chilling.”

“I am receiving briefings about what appears to be a horrific shooting and fire at an LDS church in Grand Blanc, Michigan. @FBI and @ATFHQ agents are en route to the scene now. Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling. Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X.

President Donald Trump said he had been briefed on the attack and called it “yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America.” 

Police directed the public to avoid the area, and several reunification sites were established.

New York City police also put out a statement, saying they would increase law enforcement presence at religious institutions following the attack.

Grand Blanc's city and township has a combined total of 47,500 people, and is located north of Ann Arbor and Detroit.

Sunday's shooting comes only a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest president of the LDS Church, died at 101.

A shooter at the Church of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, killed at least two people and injured multiple other victims on Sunday. The gunman is now deceased, according to local police.

Police said there is no threat to the public at this time. The church building was on fire, and authorities now say the blaze is contained. They expect more victims to be found at the site where the fire erupted.

Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford has been identified as the suspect who drove a vehicle into the church's front doors Sunday morning, where “hundreds” of people were attending service. Law enforcement was dispatched at 10:25 a.m. The suspect exited his vehicle and opened fire on attendees. One person was announced dead at the church, and another was announced dead at a nearby hospital. Eight victims are now hospitalized. One of those hospitalized is in critical condition.

Renye said it is believed the church's fire was started “deliberately” by the suspect, and believes victims who were not able to escape will be found there. 

Police engaged with the shooter, who is “no longer with us.” Renye said the next steps will be to issue search warrants on the suspect's residence to find out more about him, and more information about this shooting will be provided at 5 p.m. today.

“My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. Violence anywhere, especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable. I am grateful to the first responders who took action quickly. We will continue to monitor this situation and hold the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Grand Blanc close,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) said on X.

FBI agents have been dispatched to the scene, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. Reyne said over 100 federal agents are expected.

“We are tracking reports of the horrific shooting and fire at an LDS church in Grand Blanc, Michigan. @FBI agents are on the scene to assist local authorities. Violence in a place of worship is a cowardly and criminal act. Our prayers are with the victims and their families during this terrible tragedy,” Patel said on X.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also condemned violence in a place of worship, calling it “chilling.”

“I am receiving briefings about what appears to be a horrific shooting and fire at an LDS church in Grand Blanc, Michigan. @FBI and @ATFHQ agents are en route to the scene now. Such violence at a place of worship is heartbreaking and chilling. Please join me in praying for the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X.

President Donald Trump said he had been briefed on the attack and called it “yet another targeted attack on Christians in the United States of America.” 

Police directed the public to avoid the area, and several reunification sites were established.

New York City police also put out a statement, saying they would increase law enforcement presence at religious institutions following the attack.

Grand Blanc's city and township has a combined total of 47,500 people, and is located north of Ann Arbor and Detroit.

Sunday's shooting comes only a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest president of the LDS Church, died at 101.

GRAND BLANC, Mich. (AP) — Police say one person was killed and nine injured in a shooting at a Mormon church in Michigan, and the suspect is also dead. 

The shooting happened Sunday at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, about 50 miles north of Detroit, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye told reporters. The church was also set ablaze.

Police said there is no ongoing threat to the public. Authorities have not released details on the surviving victims' conditions.

The church, circled by a parking lot and a large lawn, is located near residential areas and a Jehovah's Witness church in Grand Blanc. The community of roughly 8,000 people is just outside Flint.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community. “Violence anywhere especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,” she said.

The shooting occurred the morning after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, died at 101. The next president of the faith, known widely as the Mormon church, is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will speak at a hastily-called meeting of top military leaders on Tuesday, according to a person with knowledge of his plans.

Hundreds of generals and admirals — senior commanders of the one-star rank or higher and their top advisers — have been summoned from all over the world to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, with little notice by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

The person was not authorized to discuss the president's plans before a public announcement about his attendance and spoke on condition of anonymity.

News about the meeting broke Thursday, and Trump didn't seem to know about it when first asked by reporters during an Oval Office appearance.

“I'll be there if they want me, but why is it such a big deal?” Trump said. 

Trump's participation in the meeting raises the likelihood of a politicized event in front of a nonpartisan audience of military leaders. For example, he delivered campaign-style remarks to uniformed personnel at Fort Bragg in North Carolina in June, attacking his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

The Republican president is also expanding his use of the military in American cities, arguing that it's necessary to fight crime in places where Democratic leaders are failing to ensure public safety.

The National Guard continues to patrol in the District of Columbia, and a smaller deployment is expected in Memphis, Tennessee. On Saturday, Trump said he would also send troops to Portland, Oregon, to protect against “domestic terrorists.”




Over the objections of local and state officials, Trump previously sent the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, where there were protests against immigration raids. 

The Pentagon's top spokesman has previously confirmed that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week.”

Across the military, there are 800 generals and admirals of all ranks. Many command thousands of service members and are stationed across the world in more than a dozen countries and time zones.

The Washington Post first reported on Trump's plans to attend the upcoming meeting.

Iowa Democrats are rallying behind a school superintendent who was arrested by ICE on allegations that he is in the country illegally this week, and they are led by a school board chair who once held a key role in the Obama White House.

After ICE arrested Ian Roberts, the superintendent for Des Moines Public Schools (DMPS) last week, school board chair Jackie Norris called for people to have "radical empathy" as Roberts' case plays out. Norris previously served as White House chief of staff for then-first lady Michelle Obama. Meanwhile, Republicans in the state legislature are also launching a probe into how the board chose Roberts in the first place.

Norris supported Roberts in a statement on Friday in which she said that officials "do not have all the facts."

"There is much we do not know," Norris said. "However, what we do know is that Dr. Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined over two years ago."

"During his time with our district, he has shown up in ways big and small and has advocated for students and staff, and has begun introducing concepts that will help us reimagine education for future generations," she continued.

Norris said Roberts joined the school district in July 2023 after having served in various school districts across the U.S. for "over 20 years." Norris was not the chair of the school board at the time Roberts started, but she has been a member since 2021.

Meanwhile, Republicans in the Iowa legislature are calling for a wider probe to ensure proper hiring practices are being followed across the state. Iowa's House Government Oversight Committee also sent a letter to the DMPS directing it to preserve documents related to Roberts' hiring.

"I will not hesitate to introduce and pass legislation to mandate enhanced hiring protocols, increase transparency in district operations, and protect the resources allocated to our schools through the appropriations process," State Rep. Austin Harris said. "Iowa's families deserve nothing less than a safe, lawful, and effective education system for their children."

DMPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

ICE alleges that Roberts is in the country illegally from Guyana. They say he is not legally permitted to work in the United States and had a final order of removal from a judge issued in May 2024.

Roberts was arrested after allegedly driving away from law enforcement. He later abandoned his car in the woods, and Iowa State Patrol ended up finding him, according to a press release.

"This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement," ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement.  

"This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats," Olson continued. "How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district."

The district said Roberts had previously done an I-9 to prove legal status, but that it was conducted by a third-party group and that it did not know about an order of removal, according to The Associated Press.

Roberts came to the United States with a student visa in 1999 and had charges for weapon possession in 2020, according to ICE.

Olivia Dunne was on the receiving end of some playful jabs during the week as she nervously watched her boyfriend Paul Skenes help the Pittsburgh Pirates to a win against the Cincinnati Reds.

Dunne had her arms over her head as she watched Skenes pitch and revealing sweaty armpits. The moment went viral across social media. But the former LSU Tigers gymnast got the final word.

"You pit the ‘pit' in Pittsburgh," one person wrote on TikTok in response to one of her videos from Great American Ballpark.

Dunne responded, "You'd break a sweat too being a Pirates fan."

There's a kernel of truth in that as the Pirates haven't exactly had the best seasons recently. The Pirates are 70-90 this season and have not made the playoffs since the 2015 season.

Skenes has been one of the few bright spots for the Pirates over the last two seasons. He was the 2024 National League Rookie of the Year and is a contender for the National League Cy Young Award this season.

He has 216 strikeouts and a 1.97 ERA in 32 games. However, he was 10-10 as the Pirates struggled to find run support for him. 

"I'm actually worse than I was last year," Skenes said. "It was 1.96 last year. I'm 1.97 this year. Just got to be better. No, it's cool. I don't come into the year with any numerical goals."

The Pirates announced during the game against the Reds that he set the mark for most strikeouts in a single season by a righty. Bob Veale and Oliver Perez each had more strikeouts in a single season.

Bob Landon, president of Landon Winery in Texas, tells Fox News Digital why he believes wine lovers should give wines from the Lone Star State another taste.

Bob Landon didn't seem destined to become a Texas winemaker. 

Born in Kansas City, he was raised in a small Missouri town near Hannibal – "Mark Twain country" – with a childhood shaped by a schoolteacher mother and a Southern Baptist preacher father. But a seventh-grade class experiment changed everything.

"Our science teacher taught us how to ferment grape juice into wine," Landon told Fox News Digital.

"And I'm sure that's illegal today, but I remember tasting my experiment. I loved it. It's like, 'Oh, I love wine.' I went home and I asked my parents, 'Can I make wine at the house?' And they said, 'You can make it in the garage.'"

He was 12 years old.

That early itch carried through to college, graduate school and a corporate career in accounting.

Landon became a certified public accountant (CPA) and spent years in the finance world, making beer and wine as hobbies.

SOME ALCOHOL CHOICES LIKE DRY RED WINE AND CLEAR LIQUOR ARE LESS HARMFUL THAN OTHERS, EXPERTS SAY

A job transfer brought him and his wife – also a CPA – to Texas for what was "supposed to be a one-year stint." Thirty years later, they're still calling the Lone Star State home.

When the job threatened to pull them back to Kansas City, Landon and his wife balked. They didn't want to leave Texas. Instead, Landon made his own change by stepping away from corporate life.

"We'd saved some money, made some good investments and started the winery," he said.

Landon Winery opened 20 years ago in McKinney, Texas. It's still going.

WHY RED WINE IS MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU A HEADACHE

"I just don't do what causes you to lose money," Landon said. "I know that sounds silly and stupid, but it's true. I look at the ways that wineries lose money – and I just don't do that."

For instance, Landon said each wine barrel costs $1,000 – and that's before the wine is even made. He has 700 of them.

Although Americans mostly associate California with wine country, Texas deserves credit, Landon said. 

Next, take the grapes. "You better have enough money to live on for a long time because you're not going to get a harvest of grapes for four years," he said.

Meanwhile, Landon said, the expenses continue to pile up, from labor and equipment to facilities. "All that costs money," he said.

Financial planning has made the difference between survival and growth for the Texas winemaker, he said — and his wife used to require him to submit business cases before every big expense.

"She's always back here in the back of my head," Landon said.

Although Americans mostly associate California with wine country, Texas deserves credit, Landon said.

Texas is now the third-largest wine-producing state, Landon said, and it's "on the way to being No. 2."

The climate mirrors Spain's Rioja region, home to the tempranillo grape.

"A lot of people think of Texas as being hot, which it is during the day, but it gets really cool at night," Landon said. "Pinot [Noir] loves that."

Landon's 2019 tempranillo took first place in its category at an international competition, a feat that landed him on the cover of Forbes magazine.

"I think a lot of people were surprised that a Texas wine would take No. 1 in the world," he said.

Landon produces an exclusive tempranillo for the Fox News Wine Shop under the "Legacy" label. It's also featured in the introductory case to Fox News American Wine Club members.

"I would say if you haven't tried [Texas wines] in a while, you need to try them again," Landon said. "We've really come a long way on what grows well."

Fox News Digital spoke to Baltimore residents about the major issues facing the city.

BALTIMORE – While politicians debate how to combat crime in Baltimore, Maryland, local residents who spoke to Fox News Digital advocated for more affordable housing, recreational centers and accessible community resources.

Earlier this month, Gov. Wes Moore and Mayor Brandon Scott deployed the Maryland State Police and the Transportation Authority Police to partner with the Baltimore Police Department after President Donald Trump floated deploying the U.S. National Guard to crackdown on crime. 

"We got so many kids getting into stuff and killing and on drugs, especially down here in this neighborhood on the Penn North," Tasha, a young mother who spoke to Fox News Digital earlier this month while pushing her baby's stroller through Baltimore's Penn-North neighborhood, said. 

Tasha said more kids need access to rec centers because "so many of them are getting hooked on drugs and caught up in things that they don't got no business getting caught up in, all because they don't have nothing else out here to do."

Fox News Digital spoke to more than a dozen Baltimore residents about how crime is impacting their community. While locals were split on whether Trump deploying the National Guard would curb crime, residents said safety concerns were top of mind. 

'BALTIMORE IS ON FIRE': RESIDENTS REVEAL WHETHER TRUMP SHOULD SEND NATIONAL GUARD TO COMBAT VIOLENT CRIME

More than two dozen people were hospitalized in a mass drug overdose event in Penn-North in July. Meanwhile, three out of the seven homicides in Baltimore during August were in the nearby Park Heights, according to local reporting. 

Between people selling and using drugs on the corner as one police car was parked just down the street, Tasha said that in Penn-North, "everything is back out here running like it didn't even happen a month ago."

Joseph, a Penn-North resident who spoke to Fox News Digital while a homeless woman slept on his front stoop, said there are abandoned houses and buildings on his street and "all over the place."

But Trayvon, another Baltimore local, asked, "How can you fix a place and not fix the people?"

"If you fix that, all you're going to do is make a prettier place to sell drugs," he said. 

Scott Graham, a Republican who campaigned in 2022 for Maryland's House of Delegates to represent the Baltimore suburbs, said high property taxes "discourage people from coming in and buying" property. 

"We have vacant housing all over the place, and people are reluctant to come in. That vacant housing is in areas where there's high crime," Graham said.

Moore and Scott have touted "historic reductions in violent crime" in Baltimore, pointing to 91 homicides and 218 nonfatal shootings in 2025, which Scott said are 29.5% and 21% drops. 

But statistics compiled by the nonprofit research institute Just Facts show that Baltimore's 2024 murder rate is still 6.8 times the average for all metropolitan areas in the nation and that if the murder rate stays the same as it was in 2024, roughly 1 in every 38 people in the city will have their lives cut short by murder at some point during the course of their lives. 

The 17 Baltimore locals who spoke to Fox News Digital earlier this month were divided over whether deploying the National Guard is the solution to their crime concerns. While many worried it would raise tensions and inspire riots, others said the troops could serve as a crime deterrent. 

"We just need to get back to where we used to be when we were coming up as kids, where everybody got together and everybody worked together, and they moved people off the blocks, and they made the clean blocks, and they did all of those things," Ronette, a Baltimore resident, said. "Our city just got to a point where we just, it's everybody for their self. Nobody works together."

Trump signed a memorandum this month establishing a task force to address crime in Memphis, Tennessee, similar to his ongoing crime crackdown in Washington, D.C.

He said the effort includes deployment of the National Guard, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Homeland Security Investigations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

Last month, Trump mobilized 800 D.C. National Guard troops to reduce crime in the nation's capital. More National Guard troops from Ohio, West Virginia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee were dispatched to support the crime crackdown.

In addition to Baltimore, Trump has also floated deploying troops to Chicago and Oakland, but the plans have been met with resistance by Democrats.

In an exclusive interview, Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid praised U.S. forces for defeating ISIS but emphasized the partnership must evolve to trade, energy and investment — while ensuring Iraq's independence from outside powers.

Iraq is entering "a new phase" of stability and growth, President Abdullatif Jamal Rashid said in an interview, declaring the country "100% safe" as U.S. troops prepare to draw down after more than two decades on the ground.

While praising the U.S. for helping to defeat ISIS, Rashid stressed that Iraq now intends to stand on its own — maintaining ties with both the United States and neighboring Iran.

"Americans have helped us in defeating terrorism… and I think Iraq is 100% safe and secure," Rashid told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. "It's a new phase in Iraq, really concentrating on improving the infrastructure."

Those who served in Iraq in the early 2000s — through the War on Terror and a civil war — may not recognize it as the same place, according to Rashid.

"We have started development in every field of life, and there are good opportunities for number of American companies, American businessmen, to be our partner in improving the situation in Iraq."

Under this "new phase," Rashid said he wants Iraq to be defined less by conflict and more by commerce.

"Our relationship with the United States is a long relationship. We want to make a stronger relationship… on trade, on investment, on energy and water."

The timing is significant. The U.S.-led coalition that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 and later fought ISIS was scheduled under an agreement last year to begin its final withdrawal this September. That exact timeline is unclear, and the Pentagon has disclosed few details.

The issue is sure to dominate next month's parliamentary elections, where a swath of Iraqis want the U.S. to adhere to its agreement and leave.

"This is a hot button political issue," said Behnam Taleblu, fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), "with a timetable that was technically — or at least allegedly — already supposed to have started by then, is going to be something that we should be keeping our eyes on."

American commanders have warned that ISIS cells remain active in rural areas, while Iran-aligned militias have targeted U.S. and Iraqi government facilities with rockets and drones.

Some argue the counter-ISIS mission is not over, and U.S. troops should remain. Others say the U.S. footprint lacks a clear purpose at this point.

"ISIS is a shell of its former self — the Caliphate collapsed in 2019 and its strikes on Europe have ended since then.  The remaining threat can be handled by others, notably the Iraqi government, which is popular at home and capable of carrying the load, along with the Kurdish Peshmerga and other regional states," said Will Walldorf, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities.  

"Iran's influence has waned with the near-total collapse of its regional proxies.  Any threats the U.S. might face in the future can be handled from over the horizon."  

"The deterrent effect of U.S. forces there, I think, could be significant," countered Taleblu.

Pressed on concerns, Rashid dismissed talk of Iraq being "overrun with Iranian proxies" as exaggerated and said Baghdad is determined to prevent outside powers from dictating its politics.

"We want to keep our independence, our decision-making in Iraq as the Iraqis, not to be influenced by outsiders," he said.

On reports of militia attacks, Rashid claimed ignorance but insisted such actions would not be tolerated.

"I'm not really aware of any groups [carrying out attacks]. We will not allow it. And these are against the Iraqi security and Iraqi independence," he said.

Still, the perception of Iranian influence remains a flashpoint in Washington.

"Iranian influence has already taken over Iraq," Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

Tehran has close ties to Shiite parties that shape government coalitions in Baghdad, and it supports militias within the Popular Mobilization Forces that remain powerful players in the country's security environment.

Iraq also relies on Iranian electricity and natural gas imports, while Iranian goods fill local markets, making Iraq one of Tehran's most important trading partners despite international sanctions.

That reach, however, is not uncontested. Iraqi nationalist movements — including many Shiites — have resisted Tehran's sway, and mass protests in recent years have condemned Iran's role, sometimes targeting its consulates. Baghdad today remains a space of competing influence.

"The Islamic Republic benefits from Iraq looking like Swiss cheese," said Taleblu, referring to Iranian pockets of influence across the country and its institutions.

"Iran and Iraq are two neighbors," Rashid said, emphasizing that they had friendly relations. "We will not allow politicians from either [U.S. or Iraq] to be imposed on Iraqi people."

Still others say Iran could take note of the Iraqi success story. In less than 20 years, the nation rose from decades of conflict and dictatorial leadership under Saddam Hussein to relative stability and democratic elections.

Rashid confirmed that Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government have resolved their dispute over oil exports, paving the way for flows to resume after months of disruption. "It's a big deal," said Rashid, who himself is Kurdish by background.

The Iraqi presidency is reserved for a Kurd under an informal power-sharing agreement, while the prime minister is Shi'a Arab and the speaker of the parliament is Sunni Arab.

Rashid also pointed to November's parliamentary elections as proof of democratic stability.

"We are going to have elections in two months' time in November. That's really an indication of how stable the country is… We want the process to be fully democratic," he said.

But the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) — a state-sanctioned umbrella of mostly Shiite militias, some with close ties to Tehran — are seen by critics as a parallel power structure undermining Iraq's sovereignty.

Rashid, however, argued that integrating all armed groups under the constitution strengthens, rather than weakens, the state.

And on foreign policy, Rashid tried to position Iraq as a bridge.

He welcomed growing recognition of a Palestinian state, cautiously praised Donald Trump's push for peace in Gaza, and reiterated that war — whether in the Middle East or in Ukraine — "doesn't solve any problem. It makes the problem more complicated."

Tropical Storm Imelda formed over the Bahamas Sunday afternoon and is expected to intensify into a hurricane, and while its forecast is less ominous for the Southeast coast, the storm will still be felt there.
    


            Newly-formed Imelda has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and is 355 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, as of 5 p.m. ET, according to the National Hurricane Center.
    


            Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the central and northwestern Bahamas where the tropical storm is currently wringing out heavy rain. Rainfall totals could range from 4 to 12 inches in the Bahamas and eastern Cuba, more than enough to trigger flash flooding.
    


            The eventual path of Tropical Storm Imelda has been trending away from a direct landfall along the Southeast coast over the last 24 to 36 hours. After moving north and parallel to Florida's Atlantic coast through Monday, the storm is now expected to make an abrupt turn east and away from the coast while intensifying into a hurricane by late Monday or Tuesday.
    


            The National Hurricane Center discontinued the tropical storm watches that had been in effect for portions of the east coast of Florida based on updated forecast information.
    


            Imelda has joined Hurricane Humberto in the Atlantic. The powerful Category 4 hurricane rapidly intensified into a rare Category 5 storm Saturday over the warm, energy-filled water of the open ocean and has a role to play in Imelda's future.
    


            Imelda's slower than expected northward movement means Humberto will win out in a tropical tug-of-war between it and a weather pattern over the Southeast US. On Tuesday, Humberto will tug Imelda away from the coast and the weather pattern trying to draw it closer to land.
    


            It seems unlikely that this steering pattern will shift again, but those on the Southeast coast shouldn't fully let their guard down just yet.
    


            “The risk of significant wind impacts along the southeastern United States coast is decreasing, but interests in that area should continue to monitor the latest forecast updates,” the hurricane center said Sunday.
    


            The first effects from the storm could reach the Southeast as early as Monday, with coastal areas of eastern Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas expected to experience brunt of the storm's impacts.
    


            Flooding rain is still a concern, especially in the coastal Carolinas, even with the center of the storm forecast to remain offshore of the Southeast US. Onshore winds will also kick up high surf that could cause coastal flooding and beach erosion.
    


            The rainfall forecast has trended down since Saturday. Totals of 2 to 6 inches are now forecast in the coastal Carolinas through Wednesday morning.
    


            Imelda's wind field will grow and allow strong, gusty winds to howl along the Southeast coast early-to-midweek.
    


            Officials in the Southeast geared up to deal with the storm even though things were looking more encouraging Sunday. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued a state of emergency Friday, activating statewide response plans and mobilizing agencies to prepare for significant wind, flooding rain and storm surge across the state.
    


            The City of Charleston declared a local state of emergency Saturday, and began distributing sandbags and clearing storm drains, according to a statement.
    


            Meanwhile, over the open Atlantic, Hurricane Humberto rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm Saturday while tracking over warm water and a less hostile environment in the central Atlantic.
    


            Humberto weakened slightly to a high-end Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning. It's expected to remain a powerful Category 4 storm into early in the work week.
    


            It is not a direct threat to the US, and will likely steer far to the west of Bermuda. That said, Bermuda could still see bands of rain and gusty winds Tuesday into Wednesday. The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a tropical storm watch for the archipelago for that reason. Imelda could come near Bermuda by late week as well.
    


            Anyone from the Bahamas to the Southeast coast and Bermuda should continue to keep a close eye on the forecast, but for now, it appears the US will avoid a more serious impact.

President Donald Trump on Monday used the platform of the presidency to promote unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism as his administration announced a wide-ranging effort to study the causes of the complex brain disorder.

An Indiana woman with an autistic son says President Donald Trump was blaming moms when he made unfounded claims that taking Tylenol while pregnant causes autism.

A Kentucky woman diagnosed with the condition as an adult thought Trump was villainizing autism by describing it as a “horrible, horrible crisis.”

A Massachusetts man whose twin boys have profound autism found the Republican president's words hopeful because it was the first time the father had seen autism discussed at the highest levels of government.

Recent comments about autism by the Republican president and others in his administration are rippling through the United States, stirring up a wide range of views and feelings among autistic people and their families. Some welcome the renewed focus and pledges of research money for the complex developmental condition. Others are outraged by what they consider the blaming, shaming and spreading claims not grounded in science.

On Monday, Trump repeatedly warned pregnant women not to take Tylenol, known by the generic name acetaminophen, and he fueled discredited claims about autism and vaccines. Some studies have raised the possibility that taking acetaminophen in pregnancy might be associated with a risk of autism. Many others, however, have not found a connection and no causal link has been proved. 

Meantime, scientists stress that concerns that vaccines could be linked to autism have been long debunked. A fraudulent study claiming a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it. Science has shown autism is mostly rooted in genetics.




Dr. Noa Sterling, an OB-GYN, said Trump's comments, particularly about Tylenol, touched a nerve for many parents of young autistic children.

“There's this kind of narrative that you have to be careful of absolutely everything you do in pregnancy, and if you eat the wrong thing or do the wrong thing, you're going to irreparably harm your baby,” she said. “So the Tylenol just plays directly into this fear that, ‘I've taken something that has caused this condition in my child.'”

Dani Derner, who has a 4-year-old autistic son, said it is “really disappointing” that women are being blamed.

“I personally did not take Tylenol during my pregnancy,” said Derner, of Dripping Springs, Texas. But, she said, “some women might not have a choice.”

Some women said the blaming was reminiscent of the disproven mid-20th century theory that emotionally cold “refrigerator mothers” caused autism. 

“When I heard that he said acetaminophen was the cause, I was a little scared and a little sad because as a mom of a child with autism, I felt like maybe I was being blamed for that,” said Rachel Deaton of Fishers, Indiana, who has a 22-year-old autistic son. “We really don't know what causes autism.”

Kelly Sue Milano of Fullerton, California, who has an autistic son, added: “A lot of responsibility and at times criticism is placed on mothers, I think, in a really unbalanced and unfair way.”

Some autistic people recoiled at the notion that autism is something to cure.

“It is part of who we are,” said Dani Bowman, CEO of DaniMation Entertainment and a cast member of “Love on the Spectrum.” “My mom never took Tylenol while she was pregnant with me or my sister. My dad has autism. My sister has autism. I have autism.”

Katy Thurman, a legal assistant in Lexington, Kentucky, who was diagnosed with autism as an adult, grew angry at the concept of eradicating autism.

“There are actual crises going on in this country. People being autistic is not one of them,” Thurman said.

Others were encouraged by the attention on the developmental disorder. 

“We need a voice at the table and we have to do something,” said Matt Murphy of Ayer, Massachusetts, who has twin 8-year-old boys with profound autism. “That's the hopeful thing I take out of this -– finally, the top level of government is talking about this.”

He said people with profound autism will need lifetime support, and federal and state governments will need to take action in many areas, including education and housing. Murphy is glad to see federal money going toward research into autism's causes.

“Even if you find the cause … we still have the current population that we need to support and address and help,” he said. 

Deaton, who has an adult autistic son, agrees, but worries about federal cuts affecting things such as Medicaid and special education. Those help autistic people contribute to society, get jobs and be taxpayers, she said.

Judith Ursitti leads the Profound Autism Alliance and was among a group of people who met with the director of the National Institutes of Health in June. She said hearing the term “profound autism” in a White House event was validating and she was pleased with the list of research being funded.

But Ursitti, mother of a 22-year-old son with autism, realizes that people on other parts of the autism spectrum found some of the language hurtful and that others in her community were outraged because they believe moms were being blamed. 

Ursitti also said some of the discussion was confusing, including the failure to tease out profound autism from other parts of the spectrum when mentioning the statistic that 1 in about 31 children is affected by autism spectrum disorder in the U.S.

“The vast majority of people with autism don't fall into that profound category,” she said.

She said reactions to comments made at the White House were in some ways as diverse as the autism community itself.

“There's a divide that's quite similar to what we're seeing in our country, honestly,” she said.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Help is available if you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters.In the US: Call or text 988, the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.Globally: Befrienders Worldwide has contact information for crisis centers around the world.



            One beautiful spring day in New York last year, I found myself in a 10th floor medical clinic, hooked up to a saline IV drip. I was there for my very first ketamine IV infusion, a treatment meant to help me with anxiety, depression and PTSD.
    


            A kind nurse sat by my side and explained that I could use a button to call her if I was uncomfortable in any way or wanted help. And did I want a blanket? Yes, I did want a blanket. I wanted to feel warm and cozy, and I had brought everything else I needed: an eye mask, a journal to reflect on the ketamine therapy experience, my headphones for music and a suitably jolly playlist on my phone.



            “Do you want the blinds open or closed?” the nurse asked. I thought for a second. “I guess closed?” She shut the blinds and continued her work, leaving the room to get the blanket and ketamine vial. Appearing a few minutes later, she carefully laid the blanket over me, tucked me in reassuringly and positioned the recliner so I was comfortably somewhere between seated and lying down. She took the vial, measured out the dose and injected it into the IV bag.
    


            Once she inserted the ketamine into the IV drip, it took longer than I thought to take effect. For around 20 minutes I lay in the darkness, feeling no different. “Nothing is happening,” I thought, though I was relaxed, enjoying the peace of being alone. “Maybe she didn't really give me anything. Maybe all of this is a weird con.”
    


            Then, I felt my tongue start to go numb. I giggled quietly to myself. “Oh. I guess this is it,” I thought.
    


            First synthesized in the 1960s, ketamine was originally developed as an anesthetic for which it is still used. Ketamine is not a psychedelic like psilocybin, MDMA or LSD — these drugs are hallucinogens or psychoactive substances that can “temporarily alter a person's mood, thoughts, and perceptions,” according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
    


            Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic, which can have some hallucinogenic effects at low doses, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The drug induces a state of sedation and calmness, meaning patients feel detached from their environment and pain, and it may produce hallucinations by distorting senses. This makes the dissociative anesthetic feel pretty close to a psychedelic experience, but they are distinctly different classes of drugs.
    


            The Western world is experiencing something of a psychedelic renaissance, with an increasing amount of interest in drugs that decades ago were considered rebellious and dangerous to some groups but fun to others who used it while clubbing and attending raves. And yes, there are people who prescribe and use it irresponsibly, as is the case with many drugs.
    


            But there is a growing body of evidence showing that psychedelics can help people who are struggling with their mental health: MDMA has shown promise as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. A clinical trial showed that synthetic psilocybin — the active compound in magic mushrooms — rapidly eased severe depression in people with treatment-resistant depression. Two years ago, Australia legalized prescriptions of MDMA and psilocybin for PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. Last year, advocates attempted to get MDMA approved for therapeutic use in the United States, a move that was rejected by the US Food and Drug Administration.
    


            As for ketamine, it's a Schedule III controlled substance in the US (defined as drugs with a low to moderate potential for psychological and physical dependence) but approved as a general anesthetic, as it is in the United Kingdom and across many countries in Europe, including Germany and Poland. Patients have reported that ketamine helps with chronic pain, and studies have shown it to be incredibly effective at reducing symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. That's why it's being used off-label around the world to treat people with a variety of mental health issues.
    


He wanted to end his life at 15. Why his family tried a medication off-label



            The research is limited but promising, and pharmaceutical companies have been looking at how to get the benefits of ketamine without the dissociation typically experienced with the drug. A nasal spray version of ketamine, called esketamine — brand name Spravato — was developed by Johnson & Johnson and approved in the US by the FDA for treatment-resistant depression, or TRD, in 2019. Earlier this year it became the first approved stand-alone treatment for TRD.
    


            For all its promise, ketamine also has high risk. The drug rose in prominence in 2023 when “Friends” actor Matthew Perry died of the acute effects of ketamine. It is still bought, sold and used recreationally around the world despite its status as a controlled substance, and the damage can be devastating when used improperly, leading to painful bladder inflammation and damage, as well as kidney and liver damage.
    


            In the United Kingdom, ketamine is reportedly being used regularly by children as young as 12. The British government is in the process of reviewing the classification of ketamine, meaning that it could become a Class A drug along with heroin and cocaine — the highest and most dangerous classification.
    


            While I was aware of Perry's death when I looked into ketamine therapy for myself, I also knew that the actor had struggled with addiction and taken it outside of a clinic. I wasn't worried that things would go wrong for me, because I knew I'd be in a controlled, medical setting.



Has ketamine's time of reckoning arrived? 5 things to know after Matthew Perry's death



            I've struggled with my mental health since I was a teen, and at age 35 I was diagnosed with a form of PTSD in 2023. In my case, it wasn't caused by a single formative experience but prolonged exposure to a previous toxic work environment. Though I was years out of the situation, the experience still had a hold on me, like a dark cloud hovering just out of view. It wasn't something I consciously thought about, but it affected me deeply. My self-confidence and self-worth had been destroyed. At my best, I seemed fine, but certain situations would make me anxious. At my worst, I'd experience full-body flashbacks — taking me back to how I felt when I was experiencing it. Panic. Tight chest. Nausea. Struggling to breathe. Headaches. Persistent brain fog.
    


            For years, I'd lived in an internal world of anxiety and rumination that prevented me from fully living my life, in big ways and small. The muscles in my shoulders and neck were as hard as rocks, and I could never relax. Everything made me nervous, and everything felt overwhelming, all the time.
    


            In the weeks prior to starting the ketamine treatment, I had migraines several times a week. Weekends gave me no respite: I'd get migraines on a Friday or Saturday, spend the whole day trying to recover and be completely wiped out the next day, unable to do anything. By the time I recovered, if at all, it was back to work.
    


            I had already done everything I could think of. I'd tried different antidepressants on and off for years. I had counseling. Sometimes, something would work for a while, then it would stop. Other times, things just didn't work. Some therapy styles, for instance, made me feel like I was being criticized for my responses to things rather than feeling empowered to make positive changes. Some drugs left me an emotionless zombie with no capacity for joy. I couldn't stand feeling empty and numb.
    


            The last straw was when my mother confided that she was worried that my dad was seriously ill. For an expat living thousands of miles away from my family, this was one of my biggest fears. I couldn't be there to see him or gauge whether it really was a concern. I thought about how quickly I might be able to fly home, how much money it would cost, whether my job would support me taking leave. It was an incredibly intense period of my life, feeling under pressure from all angles. I found myself wondering if I would see him again, spiraling rapidly, fretting at every moment that I would get a call confirming the worst. I was in freeze mode, unable to function, lost in impending doom and preemptive grief. It was taking a huge toll on my daily life, and I needed to fix it.
    


            I had heard through a friend that ketamine was being used legally but off-label for treatment-resistant depression in the US and wondered if it could help me, too. I set about researching its applications for PTSD and anxiety, reading everything I could get my hands on. After several weeks, I decided to try it. At best, it might help me. At worst, it was a waste of money but something I could at least say I'd tried. I looked online and found a clinic in New York that would do infusions.
    


Vagus nerve stimulation may relieve treatment-resistant depression, study finds



            After looking at dozens of positive reviews and recommendations online, I scheduled a consultation with the founder — a doctor with decades of experience using ketamine in medical settings. It is possible to get a prescription for lozenges to use at home, but I wanted to be treated in a medical setting being watched and cared for by professionals.
    


            The 90-minute video call filled me with reassurance. I explained my situation, how I was feeling, how I was utterly incapable of coping with what was going on and how it was starting to affect me at work. The doctor listened sympathetically, and I asked if I would be a good candidate for the treatment.
    


            While he couldn't guarantee it would help me, he told me I fitted the profile of those who found most benefit: Women in their mid-30s who had experienced anxiety and depression tended to respond well.
    


            “This is crazy,” he told me as we ended the call. “You're too young to live like this. Let's get you better.”
    


            Afterward, I burst into tears. It felt like he was the only person who truly understood how I was feeling, even though we had just met.
    


            For six days over two weeks, I would settle in that cozy recliner at the clinic, where the staff were incredible, treating me with care and compassion. A nurse would take my blood pressure, gently put a blanket over me and give me an eye mask when I forgot mine at home. The team would assess how I felt since the last infusion and decide whether to increase my dosage. I'd be set up with the IV, and someone would check in on me every 20 minutes — not that I was aware of it, as I had my music and eye mask on. Afterward, the staff would give me a carton of apple juice. My first infusion was 50 milligrams for 90 minutes, and over time increased to 95 milligrams over 75 minutes, with the addition of magnesium to alleviate anxiety.
    


            During those two weeks, the clinic became my second home. I conceived of the sessions as almost like having a vacation inside my head, in a safe and caring space. I did nothing except lie very still for an hour or two, and I diligently problem-solved everything that was bothering me. I lived out 12 different lives each time, unraveling new insights each time.
    


            Music was key to my experience. During my research, I had found a Reddit community and other forums where people exchanged recommendations for playlists to use during treatments. The advice from the clinic was to listen to “whatever makes you happy,” so I opted for Spotify-created playlists with names like “Sunshine Mix” and “Happy Mix.” For me, “Lovely Day” by Bill Withers, “Happy” by Pharell Williams, and “Adventure of a Lifetime” by Coldplay became as vital to the experience as the drug itself.
    


            Most of the time, the experiences were interesting or fun. In one, I was a heart-shaped rocket slowly ascending into space. That was to the song “Mr. Blue Sky” by Electric Light Orchestra. Even now, I can't listen to it without remembering my experiences in those clinic rooms. In another, I saw my future self, married with a child, living in a trendy part of Brooklyn. Some experiences were unsettling. The one time I tried a different playlist — my own, which I hadn't fully vetted prior to treatment — I ended up observing a shimmering army of multicolored skeleton soldiers marching to war. It didn't scare me, but after a few minutes, I took the eye mask off and changed the playlist back to the usual.
    


            A recurring theme in my sessions was the sense that I was flying backward and upward, out of the clinic, out of Manhattan, out of New York, up into space, quietly observing the planet and the people on it. I would marvel that everything and everyone exists, and will continue to exist, with or without me. It gave me a great sense of peace to simply observe human existence from so far away.
    


            A couple of sessions in, I realized that the tension in my neck and shoulders was gone, and situations that would have upset me or caused frustration didn't bother me anymore. Nothing had materially changed in my life, but my response to challenges changed to one of quiet acceptance: In the nicest possible way, I stopped caring so much about everything, all the time. I had a newfound sense of peace and calmness that I couldn't remember experiencing for a very long time. I had no migraines during the fortnight of treatments.

            I liken the experience to the growth of a tree: Picture a sapling with weak roots, swaying in the wind, branches bending and breaking. Then think of a tree with strong, thick roots and big branches. The wind still blows as hard as ever, but the tree is grounded, barely moving. In therapy-speak, my “window of tolerance” expanded because of the drug; now, things don't throw me off as much as they used to. I can accept them and be emotionally distanced from them, instead of being engulfed and consumed by them.
    


            Ketamine therapy in a clinic is not easily accessible since it's so expensive. While some insurance companies cover the cost of a treatment like Spravato, my insurance didn't cover ketamine therapy in the clinic. I paid $525 out of pocket for each session.
    


            I wouldn't say ketamine has cured me — I still experience anxiety and worry about the future — but it gave me a glimpse of what my therapist explained was “peak experience.” Coined by psychotherapist Abraham Maslow, a peak experience is an altered state of consciousness in which individuals experience profound euphoria and fulfillment.
    


            For me, ketamine gave me the experiential knowledge that I have everything I need to feel good, calm and secure. I attended booster sessions for a couple of months after that first two-week session, and I expect to need boosters every so often when I start feeling like the effects are wearing off. In the meantime, the therapy has given me the space and peace to be able to do the hard inner work while also being able to function daily.
    


            Two days after my first infusion, I went for a run. I booked a session with a personal trainer after months of agonizing and deliberation. I tidied my apartment after weeks of letting the mess pile up. Things went wrong at work, and I brushed them off with an indifference that shocked me. I felt that I was capable of coping with whatever came my way. I found that the world isn't all sadness, anxiety and worry. The world can also be transient and beautiful, and I am grateful to have experienced the difference in perspective to be able to really see it now.

            As Zohran Mamdani was asleep on another continent, his top campaign aides wrangled over how he should sound in his statement about an off-duty police officer who had just been shot and killed in Midtown Manhattan along with three other people.
    


            Drafts went back and forth as the news dribbled in, people familiar with and involved in the conversations that night tell CNN about the previously unreported moment. Lines were suggested, pushed back on, tweaked.
    


            This was a tragic moment with a lot of eyes on a measured response, some on the campaign were saying. Not at the expense of their values, others responded. Their candidate had already been navigating how to explain years of speeches, statements and social media posts calling for defunding the police or abolishing them entirely.
    


            Tempers flared. At one point, as the hours ticked by while Mamdani's small inner circle debated what to say and whether to call the candidate and wake him up, some aides panicked that they weren't taking the situation seriously enough. A few outside the inner circle even started spit-balling ideas like having someone enlist former Mayor Bill de Blasio to call Mamdani.
    


            The timing of the July rampage, at the end of Mamdani's two-week vacation in Uganda to celebrate his wedding, challenged a campaign still wrapping its collective head around actually having won the Democratic mayoral primary a month earlier. Mamdani's absence from New York, which he had announced via a social media video mocking those who'd attack him for it, felt for a moment like a liability.
    


            Officer Didarul Islam's death laid bare what Mamdani could be facing if he wins the November election and takes over the nation's largest metropolitan police force after intensely and extensively criticizing the police for years.
    


            Mamdani's campaign chalks up the critiques he was writing, speaking and posting about the last five years while serving in the State Assembly as from a different political moment than the one he's in now. But the discussions during what his advisers consider a crucial leadership moment demonstrate how present the thinking behind his longstanding anti-police positioning still is.
    


            Elizabeth Glazer, who served as a criminal justice adviser to de Blasio and current Mamdani opponent Andrew Cuomo when he was governor before starting the group Vital City, told CNN that trying to understand where Mamdani stands is like “Kremlinology watching the reviewing stand and seeing where people are.”
    


            “As he gets closer to actually winning this race, he's going to have to be able to mediate the reality of what's happening on the ground in order to govern,” said Glazer, who recently attended an hourlong session on public safety with Mamdani that her group hosted at Columbia University. “That will by necessity mean finding middle ground.”
    


            Jeff Dinowitz, an assemblyman from the Bronx who has served with Mamdani and chairs the Codes Committee, which oversees police, said he is willing to have an open mind about why the candidate's positions are so different now that he's running for mayor.
    


            “Some people are smart enough to know that what's true then may not be true today,” Dinowitz told CNN.
    


            Asked if he would count Mamdani in that group, Dinowitz said, “There's no way to know.”
    


            Campaign aides declined to have Mamdani or others discuss how his positions on policing changed, or to answer specific questions about whether he still believes in what he said previously. They instead provided a statement from the candidate.
    


            “I will govern on my clear campaign agenda — one New Yorkers have voted for in historic numbers. Leading a city of 8.5 million people requires listening to them to understand their safety concerns, and working with police officers to determine effective solutions,” Mamdani says in the statement. “What I've repeatedly heard from rank-and-file officers is that we're making it too hard for them to perform their primary responsibility: addressing violent crime. They're overworked and often tasked with responsibilities beyond policing. I'm preparing to face this reality head on, invest in a whole-of-government approach to public safety, and prove that safety and justice are not mutually exclusive.”
    


            Mamdani a few years ago delivered a searing critique of what Mamdani wants to be as a candidate now.
    


            Running for mayor, Mamdani has proposed a Department of Community Safety, and though he has been vague on both the details and the funding sources for it, the idea is the department would do the kind of community and mental health work that law enforcement are in part doing now and was what the “defund the police” slogan was originally meant to be about.
    


Zohran Mamdani is reaching out to the police



            Five years ago, Mamdani was on a Zoom discussion forum organized by the Democratic Socialists of America's New York chapter, wearing headphones and a light red T-shirt. As organizers cycled photos of social justice protests on the screen, he dismissed body cameras as proven to have been ineffectual in stopping a Minneapolis police officer from killing George Floyd. He shrugged off “half-assed reforms in response to a system that is built on punishment of Black people.”
    


            “The answer here is not reform. It is replacement. Every time the system is threatened, it will attempt to co-opt critique through the implementation of reform,” Mamdani said, in a video of the session obtained by CNN.
    


            Mamdani went on to call for a “wholesale replacement” of the political class of New York City, and for New York State to “not accept anything less than what we are demanding,” explaining of police, “we really do not need reform, we need replacement. We need the abolition.”
    


            In noting that he got an opponent to return campaign donations from one of the city's police unions, Mamdani said that the standard should be refusing all such donations because “cop money, law enforcement money, this is money that is coming from unions whose power is built on the murder of Black people across this city and across this country.”
    


            During his first run for assembly in 2020, he said, “police do not create safety for many, many people across this city in this state. Police actually create and amplify violence.” He said of how prisons “are set up in our society, I would argue that they do not work. They do not make us safer.”
    


            Mamdani now says he no longer believes in defunding the police. He told The New York Times earlier in September that he only called police “racist” in what he called “the height of frustration” after Floyd's killing and that he would apologize.
    


            Mamdani's campaign did not answer a CNN question about whether he had formally apologized or if his comment to the Times was itself the apology. He also did not address what he now makes of his 2020 comments about not accepting smaller reforms.
    


            Mamdani had his first conversations about running for mayor in the spring of 2024. He scrubbed his campaign and official websites of positions that had previously been listed there. By May 2024, he had replaced the campaign website from those runs with its DSA red-rose icon with just a photo of himself smiling and holding a cup of tea. Later that year he set its content fully to private.
    


            But some of the website's content remains visible through the Internet Archive, including that Mamdani was calling the New York police “racist” online at least through December 2023.
    


            “We can't reform our way out of a racist police system that's working exactly as designed - as a means of control over black & brown New Yorkers. We need to dramatically curtail the power and presence of the NYPD,” the archived website reads. 



            Mamdani's ultimate post on X about Officer Didarul Islam was mostly biographical, about the pregnant wife and children the officer left behind and how he told his mother that he joined the force to leave behind a proud legacy. Like Mamdani, Islam was a South Asian immigrant and a Muslim.
    


            “He has done that, and more,” the much worked-over tweet read. “I pray for him, his family, and honor the legacy of service and sacrifice he leaves behind.”
    


            By the time that was posted just after 6am the morning after the shooting, Mamdani was preparing to board a plane back to New York. In part out of genuine concern and in part out of seeing an opportunity to distract from the fact that he was still not back, several aides spread word that Mamdani might be waylaid at the airport at the direction of someone in the Trump administration looking to harass him, two people familiar with the conversations tell CNN.
    


            The aides' concerns were real enough that they had been in touch with both the New York attorney general's and governor's offices in advance to prepare, and had worked out a code for Mamdani to quickly text them if he was being detained.
    


            In the end, Mamdani changed into a suit in the airplane bathroom before he landed, was quickly through customs, and went right to visit the first of the mourning families. He said afterward his criticism of the police didn't come up when he sat with Islam's family, and in the long press conference he had afterward pledged, “what I will be as the mayor is someone who recognizes the work that these officers do.”
    


            Dinowitz, the assemblyman who served with Mamdani, has not made an endorsement in the race but he thinks there might be a gap between Mamdani's mayoral platform and what he truly believes.
    


            “When people say negative things,” Dinowitz added, “I think most reasonable people would want to see more than just your word that you've changed.”

President Donald Trump's proposal to use tariff revenue to bail out farmers experiencing harm from his administration's trade policies is putting Democrats in the crosshairs of a sticky policy fight: support relief for working-class voters or continue battling the Trump administration's economic agenda that they say is harmful to those Americans.

The president on Thursday floated using cash bailouts to ease the burden on farmers, a significant pro-Trump voting bloc, indicating that he is aware of the consequences of the trade war he is waging against other countries.

TRUMP SAYS ‘SOME' TARIFF REVENUE WILL GO TOWARD FARMER RELIEF PROGRAM

But Democrats are not jumping at the chance to help provide Republicans or Trump with any assistance, particularly as the 2026 midterm elections approach and the GOP defends the work of the trifecta since it took effect in January.

House Agriculture Committee ranking member Angie Craig (D-MN), who is running for Senate, said in a statement that the solution to alleviate the tariff's effects on farmers is to “stop the trade wars.” 

“President Trump is desperately trying to find a way out of the mess he's made with his trade war against the world,” Craig said. “Trump's tariffs hurt farmers, but they also hurt small businesses, manufacturers and working families by making everything cost more.… stop pushing our largest trading partners into the arms of our competitors, stop the chaos in farm country.”

Several House Agriculture Democrats echoed Craig's sentiments in statements to the Washington Examiner. Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-MD) said Trump's tariffs have made life worse for farmers  “already facing incredible uncertainty under this administration's trade policies.”

“The President's proposal sets a dangerous precedent, both for Congress' power of the purse, and for our farmers who deserve real accountability, not temporary fixes tied to unpredictable and unsettled trade decisions,” McClain Delaney said.

Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) echoed McClain Delaney's comments, arguing the relief is just a “band aid on a bullet wound; not nearly sufficient.”

Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), another committee Democrat, argued that future legislation should focus on preventive measures rather than fixing the consequences of the administration's “reckless tariffs.” 

“Talk of bailouts is proof the administration knows its reckless tariffs are driving up input costs and crushing farmers and rural America in the process,” Vasquez said. “Farmers want stable prices, access to markets, and predictability — we need policy changes that could prevent farmer bankruptcies from happening in the first place.”

Democrats seem united against plans to funnel revenue in the name of removing the tariffs altogether. But strategists argue that feeling could be short-sighted. 

A vote on a farm aid package — or an appropriations omnibus package before Nov. 21 that includes relief for farmers — would put Democrats between a rock and a hard place, said William Reinsch, senior adviser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Reinsch told the Washington Examiner that he doesn't blame farmland Democrats for sharing Craig's sentiments. He added that he believed a separate vote on using tariff revenue for farmer aid relief, which does require congressional approval, would get Democratic support. 

But anything tucked into a larger bill, like a continuing resolution to fund the government, would likely be a party-line vote.

“And then [Trump] will say, you know, ‘The Democrats want to starve all the farmers,'” Reinsch said. “It's a very clever strategy, and the Democrats are not in a good spot on any of this stuff.”

Trump's remarks come as a government shutdown looms on Oct. 1. As of Friday, Democrats and Republicans are still unable to agree on a short-term spending deal that would punt the funding deadline and allow appropriators to work on the remaining appropriations bills. The proposed deal is a seven-week CR until Nov. 21, but Democrats are demanding healthcare concessions for their votes on the “clean” spending bill.

Whether farm aid could be used as a bargaining chip in this CR fight or in the battle leading up to the Nov. 21 deadline remains to be seen. Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) office did not respond to a request for comment on whether there have been any discussions with Trump on a legislative path forward on the farmer aid relief, or if they have a timeline for bringing bills on the subject to the floor.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, told the Washington Examiner that “we would not get ahead of the President on any support for pending legislation.”

“President Trump and [Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins] are always in touch with the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President's November victory,” Kelly said. “President Trump is delivering on his promise to cool inflation, which will lower input costs, and negotiate fairer trade deals that are opening new markets for America's agriculture industry.”

Democrats in Congress, as well as some Republicans, have criticized the Trump administration's use of tariffs, arguing they undermine the legislative branch's power of the purse as set in the Constitution. House GOP leadership has largely insulated the president against any votes against his tariff policies, with a recent vote on a procedural rule successfully blocking any effort to terminate the tariffs until the end of January. In the interim, the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on the legality of Trump's tariffs on Nov. 5.

Providing farm relief to offset his policies is not a new move for Trump. During his first term, relief was sent out to farmers through a series of aid packages between 2018 and 2020 that totaled more than $23 billion. The funds were funneled through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation, rather than being appropriated by Congress.

However, Reinsch, who served as the undersecretary of commerce for export administration during the Clinton administration, pointed out that using the CCC's money to bail out farmers during the first term “really depleted the fund.” 

Because of this, he said, Trump will be forced to go to Congress for additional funding.

“The irony of it is, he's spending a lot of money to solve a problem that he created,” Reinsch said. “The farmers are in bad shape because of the tariffs. So his solution, rather than undoing the policies, is to basically pay them off, which is exactly what he did in the first term.” 

Republicans, including House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson (R-PA), have praised Trump's comments and plans to direct portions of the tariff revenue to farmers. Thompson and Rollins have floated a farm aid package or redirecting tariff revenue to farmers in some capacity for months.

“Years of Biden's broken promises, from failing to enforce the Phase 1 agreement to letting inflation run wild while foreign governments use our farmers as pawns, have devastated American agriculture,” Thompson said in a statement. “President Trump is right to support them and step in to provide a bridge to the enhanced farm safety net policies in H.R. 1, which will kick in next year. I'm committed to working with the Trump Administration to support farmers and rural America during critical economic times.”

H.R. 1, or the “big, beautiful bill,” signed into law in July, is set to provide $56 billion to increase agriculture programs over the next decade. But Reinsch noted that farmers won't feel the effect of that law now.

“That's in the next crop year,” the strategist said. “That won't help them.” 

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who has legislation to provide stimulus checks to working-class Americans, said in a post to X that he agrees with the president's plan. When asked for comment, his office pointed the Washington Examiner to an interview with Punchbowl News, in which he criticized Democrats who would oppose the proposal.

“I'd just say to my Democrat colleagues — they always say they're the party of the working class,” Hawley said. “Well, fantastic, you know what, let's compromise and let's agree to give working people relief. We can start with farmers and go from there.”

Farmers have always traditionally leaned toward Republicans. The most farming-dependent counties in the United States overwhelmingly voted for Trump by an average of 77.7% in the 2024 election, and a similar but slightly smaller percentage in 2020. 

Then came Trump's decision to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which purchased roughly $2 billion in products from farmers every year, causing significant ramifications for farmers dependent on that income. Farming aid groups have raised the alarm, and Democrats from farming communities have been quick to blast the administration over harmful policies to a large sector of the U.S. economy. 

But Democrats shouldn't expect farmers to shift blue suddenly, Reinsch said. Even in the aftermath of Trump's policies, Reinsch does not anticipate the 2025 tariffs will affect farmers' support of the president and Republicans.

TRUMP GETS AD SUPPORT FOR CHINA TARIFF WAR AS FARMERS PUSH FOR ECONOMIC RELIEF

“If you talk to farmers, they'll take the money partly because a growing number of them are underwater,” Reinsch said, citing reports that farmers are projecting they may lose $100 to $200 an acre. 

“If somebody comes in and offers them money, that's fine, but if you ask them what they want, what they'll really say is, ‘What we want is to be able to sell our products. We don't really want government handouts. We want markets.' And what [Trump's] doing is limiting the markets rather than creating them,” Reinsch said.

            The decision followed a dispute with curators over how to display a painting that reimagined the Statue of Liberty as a Black, trans woman. Sherald cited censorship, which she later claimed in an op-ed had “taken hold” of the federally funded Smithsonian, cautioning that “history shows us” what happens when governments demand loyalty from cultural institutions.
    


            Sherald's cancelation is just one warning sign of strife at the Smithsonian as the Trump administration takes unprecedented steps to tighten its grip over the eminent museum network. Aiming to eradicate “improper ideology” from its walls, per an executive order in March, the administration has taken aim at displays involving race and gender; called for the National Portrait Gallery's director to be fired (she subsequently resigned); and launched a review of exhibitions to ensure they follow the president's directive to “celebrate American exceptionalism,” demanding that the Smithsonian hand over gallery labels, information on future exhibitions and internal communications on artwork selection. The institution has responded by assembling a team to address the administration's requests.
    


            The American Alliance of Museums (AAM) is among those concerned that the threat of interference stretches far beyond Washington, DC. On August 15, three days after President Donald Trump announced his administration's review, the group issued a statement warning of growing “threats of censorship against US museums,” describing “increasing external pressures to modify, remove, or limit exhibitions and programs.”
    


            Days later, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to call museums nationwide “the last remaining segment of ‘WOKE,'” adding that — following his systematic targeting of universities — his attorneys would focus on museums next. Like universities, many American art institutions benefit from federal funding, and the Trump administration has gutted agencies that support them (and museums more broadly), with grants worth tens of millions of dollars denied or rescinded as a result.
    


            Despite a growing sense of unease, museum leaders across the country have largely remained silent. CNN sought comment from more than a dozen museum directors and other arts leaders, and those who responded spoke to a hush over the field as institutions avoid attention and, in some cases, self-censor exhibitions or programs that could provoke federal ire. Most, however, failed to respond or declined to comment.
    


Smithsonian wrestles with independence as White House review picks up



            “You have some really prime examples of disappointing museum leadership — museums that are deciding that being stealthy and risk-averse, and canceling (shows) or censoring artists, is the right tack,” said Alyssa Nitchun, executive director of New York's Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, the only major US museum dedicated to LGBTQ art. “And Leslie-Lohman is very much taking the opposite tack.”
    


            Earlier this year, the museum hosted parts of an exhibition, featuring the work of queer Indo-Caribbean artist Andil Gosine, that had been canceled without explanation by the Art Museum of the Americas in Washington, DC. The canceled show was one of two exhibitions featuring Black and queer artists that were pulled by the DC museum in February. Citing one of the institution's curators, the New York Times has since reported that the decision was a direct response to Trump's January executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. (The museum did not return CNN's request for comment.) The Times also noted several other exhibitions and programs around the country that have been amended or delayed in recent months, echoing the AAM's statement of a “chilling effect” across the sector.
    


            “That is the power of censorship,” said Janet Marstine, a museum ethics scholar, in a phone call. “You only have to do it on select occasions for select institutions to have a domino effect throughout the museum sector.”
    


            According to a White House official, the administration's oversight of museum content is limited to federally funded institutions and ascertaining whether taxpayer money has been “improperly used to promote ideological and partisan viewpoints.” However, the White House did not respond when asked to clarify if “federally funded” only means institutions that receive the majority of their funding from federal sources, such as the Smithsonian, or any museum that receives federal dollars. (According to a recent AAM survey, 63% of US museums said they receive federal grants, awards or contracts.) In response to the AAM statement, the White House said that “accountability and transparency” do not equate to censorship.
    


            In late August, arts professionals rallied together to release a statement declaring that cultural institutions “must maintain autonomy” from political pressures or “risk becoming instruments of propaganda.” While it has thus far been signed by nearly 250 arts organizations and hundreds of individuals, major museums are conspicuous by their absence, with signatures predominately coming from arts centers, associations and regional councils.
    


            “It's actually a national emergency,” said Carin Kuoni, senior director of the Vera List Center for Art and Politics at The New School, which co-organized and published the statement. She noted her “regret” that larger museums did not sign the statement, but pointed to its wide geographical reach. “In every state and in every city, you have a signer,” she said, adding: “The fact that the entire country is behind this statement is huge and tremendous.”
    


Asian painters were ‘othered' in Paris a century ago. Now, the art world is taking note



            Art organizations have already been deeply affected by the Trump administration's gutting of major national agencies, like the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), that have long funded — with bipartisan support — museums and arts programs.
    


            According to AAM, one third of museums have had federal grants or contracts canceled — though several lawsuits are ongoing, and one museum in Pennsylvania recently dismissed its legal action after the federal goverment restored its $750,000 grant.
    


            “All of our federal funding has been cut; all of our grants are gone — and that's pretty much across the country,” said Scott Stulen, director and CEO of the Seattle Art Museum (SAM). According to Stulen, the museum was notified in the spring that it was losing grants worth $700,000. “Every director that I know has basically zeroed out that budget line for next year and for the coming years, because we don't anticipate anything coming.”
    


            Museums were already feeling financial pressures before and during Covid-19, Stulen said, and “challenges have “actually gotten more acute” since the pandemic. By 2024, only half of museums had recovered their pre-Covid attendance levels, according to AAM.
    


            An even more financially catastrophic blow to a museum would be losing its tax-exempt status — something with which the president has threatened other nonprofits, such as Harvard University. This is one reason why many museums are staying quiet, multiple sources told CNN. When asked, a White House official said taxpayer-funded  institutions that “persist in advancing partisan or ideological agendas” may “risk losing” their status. That power is not currently within presidential authority, though Republican lawmakers have recently tried to expand the Treasury's power to suspend tax exemption.
    


            “I think that threat is real — and it would be devastating,” said Stulen, noting that many smaller organizations likely could not weather the financial burden. Nonprofits that lose their status would face severe fallout, losing tax breaks on donations and gifts, and becoming ineligible for many types of fundraising and grants. Sixty percent of SAM's operating budget comes from gifts, Stulen said.
    


            Compelling museums — even private ones — to fall in line to receive funding is a form of indirect censorship familiar in countries whose cultural sectors enjoy fewer freedoms than in the US, said museum scholar Marstine.
    


            Cesáreo Moreno, the director of visual arts and chief curator of National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago, similarly warned that flattening history and the arts will result in “propaganda.”
    


            “If you don't look at the ugly things as well as the beautiful things, the successes and the failures, the good and the bad, then you are getting a one-sided, incorrect history, and there will be ramifications for that,” he said in a phone call. “That complexity really is what makes for a collective memory, and it makes for a successful democracy.”
    


            The federal government's message is being broadcast not only through its widespread funding cuts, but the specific grants selected for cancelation. Quoting a grant termination email, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art said funding for its exhibition on Jeffrey Gibson — the first Indigenous artist to represent the US with a solo show at the Venice Biennale — was cut because it fell “outside” the president's “new priorities.”
    


            The White House told CNN that it believes in curatorial independence “in principle” but that institutions that receive federal funds must operate “responsibly.”
    


            Further muddying the waters, the administration has declared many DEI programs “illegal,” targeting them in both government and private sectors without clarifying how it defines DEI or its scope. (The White House official told CNN that the administration considers “illegal DEI” to be discriminatory, exclusionary and in violation of civil rights law, but did not explain further.) The National Endowment for Humanities, another federal agency that funds museum programs, has singled out grants related to DEI as grounds for termination.
    


            In response, museums — following in the footsteps of some universities — have already “scrubbed their websites” of references to diversity, according to the chair of the Japanese American National Museum, William T Fujioka, who issued a statement vowing to never abandon the museum's DEI content.
    


            Bookended by the Barack Obama and Joe Biden presidencies, the institutional response to Trump's first term was markedly different. With the tides seemingly swelling toward social justice over the past decade, museums enthusiastically staged exhibitions spotlighting Black, Indigenous, AAPI and queer artists; promoted curators of color to prominent roles; and acknowledged colonial systems by repatriating looted art and publishing Indigenous land acknowledgements.
    


‘Scourged Back' exposed the horror of slavery. Now it's embroiled in America's censorship debate



            Amy Sadao, a nonprofit consultant who until 2019 served as the director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, attributes private museums' lack of response this time around, in part, to their governing boards. There is, she said, a growing disconnect between wealthy board members, who guide a museum's spending decisions and oversee its directors, and the values their museums promote.
    


            “A lot of institutions and organizations are looking at how they got into this stew of having a board of directors whose main purpose is to give a lot of money and how that qualifies them to make values-based decisions for an institution that purports to be values-based,” she said.
    


            The administration's current crusade against DEI is, she added, coded. “It's not DEI work — it's American culture and art. That includes not just histories of Whiteness, but histories of every race and ethnicity represented in the United States,” she said in a phone call.
    


            In addition to targeting diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which are often internal initiatives at an organization, the White House has also singled out Smithsonian exhibitions, programs, artworks and texts — many of them related to race, identity, sexuality and disability — that it finds objectionable. Various official decisions have meanwhile prompted claims of erasure, from the Pentagon stripping the name of history-making gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk from a US Navy ship to information about Harriet Tubman being removed from a federal website, then restored following backlash. Earlier this month, the infamous 1863 photo of a formerly enslaved man's scarred back became a flashpoint when the Washington Post reported that officials had ordered its removal, along with other signs and exhibits related to slavery, at an unidentified national park, though the US Interior Department later denied the reports to CNN.
    


            On the Trump administration's language around diversity, Sadao asked: “What is it signaling? And my understanding is that it's signaling an elimination — or a narrowing, a deep narrowing, a serious narrowing — of the story of American culture and art, American's history and America's future, into a very narrow channel that is White supremacist.”
    


            The White House responded that alleging the president is signaling white supremacist views is “categorically false, inflammatory and irresponsible.”
    


            Despite being a cultural flashpoint, Americans broadly support public funding for art. A 2023 survey commissioned by Americans for the Arts (AFTA) found that backing for the arts “transcends political divisions,” with four in five Democrats and three in five Republicans and Independents surveyed favoring government funding for arts and culture organizations.
    


            But while many Americans may not yet feel the direct impact of museum sector turbulence, Sadao warned that “fewer people are going to feel welcome or just even be able to access art.”
    


            Nitchun, of the Leslie-Lohman Museum, said it is now museums' responsibility “to be louder, to be stronger.” In October, the lower Manhattan museum will open a new show featuring the works of David Wojnarowicz, the seminal artist and gay activist who worked at a time “when the government was doing its best to erase and not acknowledge the reality of the queer community and the decimation by the AIDS pandemic,” Nitchun said. “It's poignant to be showing these works at this moment in time when the culture wars are alive and well.”
    


Huge archive of drag culture takes on new urgency in today's political climate



            SAM, meanwhile, is currently hosting the largest ever US exhibition of the Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei — a show about political power structures and resistance that, Stulen noted, is timely. The museum director hopes SAM can be both a haven and a catalyst for conversation at a time when, he said, the arts are critical.
    


            “The fact that an administration is going after museums and cultural organizations is only more proof that we matter,” Stulen said. “The fact that they are trying to change didactics in a museum, and want to change that language, is indicative that those things are important, and they're an important part of our culture.”

Conservatives aren't learning the right lesson from Charlie Kirk's assassination.

That's my conclusion after watching Kirk's funeral service on Sunday. It was a moving event, a powerful tribute to a young conservative who inspired millions of people with American ideals. If there was a common thread among the many speakers, it was that conservatives must do as Charlie did, and redouble our commitment to open, honest, and respectful debate.

MAGAZINE: AFTER CHARLIE KIRK, A GREAT AWAKENING?

But that's not the most important thing. It's even more essential that conservatives redouble our commitment to reclaiming the commanding heights of American culture. Why? Because the Left has corrupted our culture to such an extent that it cost Charlie Kirk his life.

Don't get me wrong: Conservatives should absolutely engage in debate. We have the benefit of believing the right things. Freedom. Family. Faith in God and in America. Our ideas are inherently better than the Left's. All they have is faith in the power of government — and it's diametrically opposed to individual freedom and family life. In a fair debate, conservatives win.

But we don't have a fair debate — not even close. To the contrary, the deck is so far stacked against conservatives that we have little chance of winning in the public square.

Every conservative knows this deep down. We know the Left controls the levers of cultural power and influence. This was true when I was growing up in the 1970s, and it's even more true today. The legacy media is uniformly controlled by leftists. Higher education is proof that while the Soviet Union fell, communism won. Ditto K-12 education. And going back decades — even under Republican administrations — the vast apparatus of the federal government has steadily advanced a far-left line.

At every level of society, leftists have indoctrinated people to believe that power is the only thing that matters. So it's no surprise that, in pursuit of total power, liberals are increasingly stooping to violence.

We saw it in the riots and wreckage of the post-George Floyd Black Lives Matter madness. We saw it in the assassination attempts against President Donald Trump last year. Now we've seen it in the successful killing of Charlie Kirk. And we've even seen it in the leftist reaction to that awful, evil, immoral act.

In the days since Kirk's murder, liberals have fallen over themselves to denounce not only his killing, but also his views. In Congress, nearly 100 Democrats — including party bigwigs such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — refused to vote for a resolution honoring him. They say he was filled with hate and did horrible things, and true to form, the media and cultural institutions parrot the leftist line. By attacking Kirk even in death, the Left is tacitly encouraging those who target conservatives with violence.

No open, honest, respectful debate can truly challenge this far-left dominance of our culture. Only one thing can: defeating their institutions while building new ones of our own.

This is the truth that conservatives must learn — now more than ever. The good news is that some on the right are waking up. Trump is shredding leftist control in parts of D.C., while a growing number of conservatives are investing in institutions such as movie studios, new universities and education models, and media outlets and social media. But as exciting as Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter was, the truth is that conservatives need orders of magnitude more action and investment.

MAGAZINE: WHILE JIMMY KIMMEL HAS RETURNED, THE LATE-NIGHT RECKONING CONTINUES

It's not enough to purge federal agencies of leftist radicals; they must be co-opted to advance American ideals. It's not enough to drive Stephen Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel off the air; they must be replaced with conservatives or, failing that, faced with conservative competition that blows them out of the water. It's not enough to move Hollywood to the center-left or even the middle; we need an entertainment juggernaut that's fully on the right. Put simply, we need the dominant cultural institutions in America.

Charlie Kirk's murder should give us an unprecedented sense of urgency. The Left is increasingly violent — and it will keep getting worse so long as leftists control the cultural levers. By all means, let's debate with the Left about the superiority of our ideas and the failure of theirs. But the best thing we can do to honor Charlie Kirk is rebuild the America he believed in.

            Hot Stocks 





            Americans have more money in stocks than ever before. But while the market's climb may be inflating their accounts, they are more exposed than ever to a potential market slump.
    


            Direct and indirect stock holdings, including in mutual funds or retirement plans, accounted for an all-time high of 45% of households' financial assets in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve data.
    


            The record-high stock ownership raises red flags about whether a market downturn could hit Americans' personal finances — especially in an economy with an increasingly fragile labor market and stubborn inflation.
    


            The milestone is a product of multiple factors: stocks have hit record highs, boosting the value of holdings; more Americans are directly participating in the stock market; and retirement plans like 401(k)s that invest in the stock market have risen in popularity in recent decades.
    


            Record-high stocks are generally good — that lets more people benefit from Corporate America's gains, especially long-term investors.



            But it's not all upside.
    


            Because so many people now own and have so much of their money in stocks, the market has more influence on the economy, for good or ill, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.
    


            “The impact of a stock market melt-up or a meltdown — it goes both ways — is going to be much more impactful across the economy than, say, just a decade ago,” Roach said.
    


            Notably, Americans' stock ownership has surpassed that of the late 1990s, just before dot-com bubble burst, said John Higgins, chief markets economist at the consultancy Capital Economics.
    


            “That should ring alarm bells, even if the buoyant stock market keeps rising for a while amid enthusiasm for AI,” Higgins said in a note to clients.
    


            “Indeed, our forecast is that the S&P 500 will make further gains this year and next,” Higgins added. “But the current very high share of equities is a red flag to watch closely.”
    


            The S&P 500 has rallied 33% since hitting a low point on April 8. The benchmark index is up 13% since January 1 and has notched 28 record highs this year.
    


            The AI boom has fueled the market rally this year. Big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) have surged, lifting major indexes like the S&P 500, which are weighted by companies' market value.
    


            The Magnificent Seven tech stocks — including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for roughly 41% of the S&P 500's gains this year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
    


            Investors are benefiting, but as the S&P 500 becomes increasingly concentrated — the Mag Seven account for 34% of the S&P's market value — they remain exposed to the fate of a few enormous companies.
    


AI and tech stocks slide as summer rally peters out



            It's not just American households that are holding record levels of stocks. Foreign investors' share of US stocks also hit a record high in the second quarter, according to Fed data.
    


            History shows that when levels of stock ownership are at record highs, the risk of a downturn and the potential for below-average returns increases, according to Rob Anderson, US sector strategist at Ned Davis Research.
    


            “Investors shouldn't expect the same magnitude of returns that we've seen during the last decade to repeat,” Anderson said. “Going forward, over the next 10 years, there's probably going to be a downshift in returns.”
    


            While the S&P 500 floats near record highs, concerns are also mounting about the emergence of a “K-shaped economy,” in which the richest Americans get even richer while the poorest Americans continue to struggle or get even poorer.
    


            That's in part because the job market, where most Americans make the bulk of their money, is stagnating, while the stock market, which is how wealthy people tend to make their money, is surging.
    


            “Those who have a high degree of wealth in the stock market feel like they're doing extraordinarily well,” said Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management. “Those who don't, who are largely tied to employment as their primary asset, feel much more constrained in today's society.”
    


            That is creating distortions in economic data, too, helping to paint a rosier overall picture than the one many Americans are feeling in their lives. The buoyant stock market is propping up the net worth of the wealthy, fueling their own spending, which in turn has helped propel economic growth, Roach at LPL Financial said.
    


            The data reflect that dichotomy: The top 10% of earners (earning more than $353,000 annually) accounted for more than 49% of consumer spending in the second quarter, the highest share on record going back to 1989, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
    


            But underneath the hood, the economy is on shakier grounds: Lower-income Americans are increasingly strained, and if there is a market slump, it could spook the wealthy Americans who have been propping up the economy with their spending.
    


The Fed just cut rates. But relief might not come quickly enough for some Americans



            “The stock market becomes a bigger economic driver when you've got that much exposure,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab.
    


            Gordon said while the market's gains can spur consumer spending, the opposite can be true when the market tumbles.
    


            “There is a bigger risk that to the extent you get a protracted downturn in the market, that starts to weigh on household spending, and starts to weigh on the psychology in particular of people up the wealth spectrum,” Gordon said.

            A day after President Donald Trump's second inauguration, the mayor of Portland, Oregon, knew that a “sanctuary city” like his was going to have a bumpy four years ahead.
    


            “We must come together to live our city's shared values of freedom from fear and sanctuary from federal overreach in the days ahead, no matter what our city may face,” Mayor Keith Wilson said in a letter to the city council on January 21.
    


            In the past eight months, the city has reaffirmed that commitment by joining a lawsuit against the Trump administration and issuing a zoning violation notice for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer.
    


            Most of the protests outside the ICE facility, about 2 miles south of downtown, have been peaceful, but occasionally have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days in the summer.
    


            President Donald Trump on Saturday followed through on his pledge to make the city a target of his next National Guard deployment, saying in a social media post he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “provide all necessary troops” to Portland, a city he described as “war ravaged,” to protect ICE facilities he claimed are “under siege” by Antifa and “other domestic terrorists.”
    


            Trump has said, without evidence, that “paid terrorists” are wreaking havoc in Portland.
    


            Last week, Trump refocused attention on Antifa – the loosely organized group of leftists and anarchists who are known for anonymity and destructive masked demonstrations – designating it as a “major terrorist organization.” The White House emphasized incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the United States to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.
    


            Here is what we know about what is ahead for the city famous for loud protests and liberal politics as its standoff with federal immigration officials gets more tense.
    


            In spite of the president's ire, Portland has doubled down on sanctuary city status, making it the first thing you see on its official website. Now the city council is moving toward an ordinance that would make it legally binding, prohibiting any Portland government organization from assisting in federal immigration enforcement, except for providing information that is already available to the general public.



            The decision could be a costly one for Portland. The administration announced it would withhold a variety of federal grants – including FEMA funding, highway grants and airport improvements – from cities it classified as “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including some cities that don't use that term. For Portland, that puts $350 million in jeopardy.
    


            Portland joined 15 other local governments in a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration earlier this year, and a judge blocked the government from freezing those funds. But the administration is appealing, denying that they are cutting federal funding “in an indiscriminate or wholesale manner.”
    


The legal battle over Trump's use of the National Guard moves to a California courtroom



            Alongside Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, sanctuary cities have been the biggest direct targets of Trump's second term, with three different executive orders specifically mentioning them and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to make a list of them.
    


            In response, Louisville, Kentucky, dropped its policy refusing to hold immigration suspects in its local jail for ICE, with the mayor acknowledging that “millions of dollars in federal grants were at stake.”
    


            From Portland, the message has been much different.
    


            “As a proud sanctuary city in a sanctuary state,” Mayor Wilson said, “we are committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all who live here, working together to strengthen our community.”
    


            Portland first called itself a sanctuary city nearly a decade ago with a nonbinding resolution saying the Portland Police Bureau “shall not cooperate with ICE except as expressly required by Federal Law.” This week, the city council discussed taking things further by making its sanctuary status permanent.
    


            “I think that when we are facing such an extreme level of federal overreach … then we do have a responsibility to act boldly in ways that we haven't had to act before,” said council member Angelita Morillo during a committee meeting Tuesday. “These are unprecedented times, and we have to do unprecedented things.”
    


            None of the members of the public who testified at the meeting spoke against the proposal, which does not yet have a final vote scheduled.
    


            The story of protests against the ICE facility on Macadam Avenue is most starkly told through photos taken there over the past two years.
    


            As the months wear on, you see an ordinary-looking tan brick and stucco building in an industrial area is gradually swallowed by increasing layers of fencing, its lower-level windows suddenly blocked by plywood, a concrete retaining wall covered in anti-ICE graffiti.
    


            Protester Deidra Watts told the Associated Press earlier this month that she feels ICE's actions against immigrants are cruel and require a loud response.
    


            “In the face of that, there has to be people who will stand up and make it known that that's not gonna fly, that that's not something the people agree with,” Watts said.
    


            In the summer, protesters blocking the processing facility caused it to be closed for several days, CNN affiliate KATU reported, something the Trump administration blamed on “anarchists and rioters.”
    


            But the building has become a magnet for a wide variety of protesters, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported, with daytime demonstrators mostly coming from religious organizations, quietly holding signs and monitoring the movement of migrants in and out of the building until the mantle is picked up by rowdier protesters at night.
    


            While protesters have tried to shut down the building physically, the city government is trying to do it by other means.
    


            So far this year, federal prosecutors have charged 27 people with federal charges for activity outside the facility, said Jessica Biggers, a spokesperson for the US Attorney for the District of Oregon. Most of the charges are for assaulting a federal law enforcement officer or failing to obey a lawful order, the district attorney's office said in press releases.
    


            Portland sent a notice to the building's private owners last week, saying ICE has committed code violations by boarding up windows and keeping some detainees in the holding facility for longer than 12 hours.
    


            “Federal records show that ICE violated its land use conditions of approval 25 times in 10 months,” the notice states.
    


            The building used by ICE is owned by a family partnership whose beneficiaries are not listed publicly. An attorney for that partnership did not return requests for comment on the zoning violation notice.
    


            Morillo, the council member, acknowledges it's questionable whether the city could force the ICE facility to close, even if the legal violations aren't addressed. And her proposal to add extra fees on buildings used for federal detention raised concerns from another council member.
    


            “If we start to begin to cherry pick on who and how the federal government gets to rent places, that's concerning to me,” said council member Loretta Smith.
    


            The Trump administration says shutting down the processing facility, where undocumented migrants have to periodically check in with immigration officials, would actually make things harder on immigrants.
    


            “If the city allows further separation of families by forcing ICE to operate processing elsewhere, that is on them,” ICE said in a statement to CNN affiliate KATU. “Lending no hand to ICE in the name of ‘sanctuary,' means also lending haven for criminals that has proven to be a great risk to public safety and national security.”
    


            While city leaders have been largely supportive of the right to protest outside the ICE facility, they have also made it clear they do not want a repeat of the city's most notorious demonstrations in 2020.
    


            The murder of George Floyd in May of that year touched off protests – frequently violent – in major cities around the country, but the demonstrations in Portland continued for more than 100 consecutive nights.
    


            Through that summer, a grim routine developed where peaceful marches would devolve into vandalism and threats against police officers. The Portland Police Bureau would declare a riot and order protesters to disperse, eventually responding physically against protesters. There were more than 6,000 uses of force by police during that period, according to city records.
    


            In what turned out to be a foreshadowing of rhetoric that would get even hotter in his second term, Trump in July 2020 called Portland a “beehive of terrorists” and deployed the National Guard to protect federal buildings downtown.
    


            Locally, the response was more complicated, with police frequently criticized for their use of force and tear gas. Eventually then-Mayor Ted Wheeler – who also served as the commissioner of police – banned the bureau's use of CS gas, but a study later found so much gas had been deployed on a single night in June across 18 downtown blocks prior to the ban that it became a public health danger.
    


            In 2022, the Biden administration's Justice Department criticized the Portland Police Bureau, saying it didn't do enough to review its procedures and see if its use of force was warranted.
    


            Ultimately, most of the people arrested – including some accused of rioting – were released without charge after Multnomah County's District Attorney's Office announced in August 2020 it was declining to prosecute cases against protesters who did not use force, steal or damage property.

            “If we leverage the full force of the criminal justice system on individuals who are peacefully protesting and demanding to be heard, we will cause irreparable harm to them individually and to our society,” former DA Mike Schmidt said at the time.
    


            While hundreds of people who were arrested went free without charge during that turbulent year, prosecutors are now pointing to those past protests in a warning to people who hope to send a message about ICE.
    


            “Let's not kid ourselves,” Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez said in June. “In the past, the voices of tens of thousands of peaceful protestors have been drowned out. Their message was hijacked by a small number of individuals with a message of vandalism, destruction and violence.”
    


            And local officials have made it clear that, regardless of any concerns about more flare-ups in the tense standoff between ICE and protesters, they don't want the Trump administration's help.
    


            “Like other mayors across the country, I have not asked for – and do not need – federal intervention,” Wilson said.

            Israel is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage as the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continue, with the backlash seeping into economic, cultural and sporting arenas.
    


            International condemnation has soared since Israel announced a ground assault on Gaza City and conducted an unprecedented strike against Hamas leadership on Qatari soil. It also comes as an independent UN inquiry concluded for the first time last week that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, a finding that echoes those of other genocide experts and human rights groups, but which the Israeli government has rejected.
    


            Last week, the European Union – Israel's biggest trading partner – proposed sanctions that would partially suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, if approved by EU member states. Several Western nations have already implemented targeted sanctions against certain Israeli individuals, settler outposts and organizations supporting violence in the occupied West Bank.
    


            The global outcry is hitting Israel's economy in other ways as well.
    


            In August, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, announced it was divesting parts of its portfolio in Israel due to the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
    


            Israel also faces partial or complete arms embargoes from France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and others over its conduct in Gaza.
    


            The backlash has been so stark that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself acknowledged it earlier this month, warning that Israel is facing a “kind of isolation” that could last for years, adding that the country has no choice but to stand on its own. Netanyahu said Israel would need to further develop its weapons industry and adapt its economy to become less reliant on external trade. He later downplayed those comments, saying he was talking only about the defense industry.
    


            As the war escalates, Israel is also taking hits in the entertainment and culture sphere.
    


            Broadcasters in several European countries, including Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain, have said they will boycott the much-beloved Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to participate in 2026.  The Irish national broadcaster, RTE, said it “feels that Ireland's participation would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.”
    


            Israeli broadcaster KAN 11 has pushed back, saying it will press ahead with selecting Israel's 2026 contestant and arguing that the musical celebration should “not become politicized.” The European Broadcasting Union, the Eurovision organizer, has said member countries will vote in November about which countries can participate next year. Israel has been part of Eurovision since 1973.
    


            In the fine arts, a music festival in Ghent, Belgium, recently canceled a concert by the Munich Philharmonic, which was set to perform with Israeli conductor Lahav Shani. The festival said in a statement that “Shani has spoken out in favor of peace and reconciliation several times in the past, but… we are unable to provide sufficient clarity about his attitude to the genocidal regime in Tel Aviv.”
    


            The Israeli government has maintained it is conducting the war in Gaza in self-defense and in accordance with international law, firmly denying all accusations of genocide.
    


Israel's culture minister vows to defund ‘Israeli Oscars' after film about Palestinian boy wins big



            In Hollywood, thousands of filmmakers, actors and movie industry workers have pledged not to work with Israeli film institutions “that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.” Signatories include Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield and Hannah Einbinder, who recently made headlines by ending her Emmys acceptance speech with the words “free Palestine.”
    


            Nor has sport been immune. The final stage of a major bike race was canceled earlier this month after several large pro-Palestinian demonstrations disrupted the event, in protest of the Israel-Premier Tech team's participation. Also in Spain, organizers of a chess tournament told Israeli players they could not compete under their national flag, prompting them to withdraw from the competition earlier this month, according to Reuters.
    


            And Israeli media outlets have recently reported fears that Israel could be at risk of suspension from European football competitions. In August, UEFA came under fire after a banner was displayed on the pitch ahead of the Super Cup final that read “Stop killing children, Stop killing civilians,” without specifically mentioning Israel or any other nation. Israel's Culture and Sports minister Miki Zohar said he and other Israeli officials had been “working intensively” behind the scenes “to block the initiative to expel Israel from UEFA.”
    


            Several Premier League soccer players, including Liverpool star Mohamed Salah, have also spoken out against the war in Gaza and called for solidarity with the Palestinian people.
    


            The economic and cultural backlash to Israel has sparked comparisons to the pressure placed on South Africa during the era of apartheid racial oppression.
    


            Between the 1950s and 1990s, South Africa faced a strong boycott movement that, little by little, turned it into a pariah. South African products were pulled from grocery stores in the West, campaigners urged divestment and bank exits, and many musicians refused to play in the apartheid state. A sporting boycott saw South Africa's exclusion from international sporting competitions like cricket and eventually rugby.
    


            “The symbolic has more leverage than the bolts and numbers,” said Ilan Baruch, Israel's former ambassador to South Africa, who resigned from the Israeli Foreign Ministry in 2011 to protest the government “ditching” its commitment to peace through a two-state solution.
    


            “Eurovision is very popular, and the football tournaments are very, very popular. And if you even mention a connection between the pressure on Israel on policy issues and culture and sports and so on, it will make an impact,” as was the case with South Africa, he told CNN.
    


            Baruch is now the chair of the Policy Working Group, a collection of Israeli academics, activists and former diplomats advocating for the recognition of the State of Palestine and a two-state solution.
    


            He said some assertive pressure on Israel is necessary, arguing it should not be possible for the country to retain “such privilege in its trade relations with the EU” and “at the same time, undermine the Palestinian human rights and future.”
    


France leads a number of nations recognizing Palestinian state amid anger over Israel's conduct in Gaza war



            “It's not the mere trade relations, but the privileged status of Israel that is now in the balance,” he said.
    


            The Israeli government has also faced plenty of opposition within the country, with regular protests against the war and widespread calls to reach a ceasefire to bring home the hostages captured by Hamas militants in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
    


            Meanwhile, for the past two decades, a Palestinian-led civil society campaign, called the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement has tried to replicate the impact of the South African anti-apartheid boycott. After years of marginal success, the movement has gained more attention and traction since the war in Gaza began.
    


            This week's United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) ﻿brought further isolation for Israel on the world stage.
    


            Several more Western countries formally recognized a Palestinian state ahead of the UNGA, including diplomatic heavy hitters like Canada, France and the United Kingdom.
    


            And a fresh analysis of key UNGA votes on resolutions related to Israeli-Palestinian affairs between 2017 and 2025, conducted by Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, found that some of Israel's longtime defenders are “leaving the fold.”
    


            The number of states that have formally abstained from UNGA votes related to Israel – generally seen as passive support for the country – is declining.
    


            “There's no doubt that there is performative voting here. Some of these countries that voted against Israel have very important, quiet relationships with Israel and are viewed as strong partners,” Satloff told CNN. But from an Israeli perspective, “the trend should be disconcerting when, over time, there's a clear pattern of once-strong supporters moving in the opposite direction.”
    


            Satloff said the big question is whether Israel's deepening diplomatic isolation is repairable.
    


            Some UN member states already demonstrated “deep animosity toward Israel” before the current conflict, while other countries “are deeply moved by the specifics of what's happening in Gaza, and they're likely to soften their view of Israeli government behavior once the war ends and or when a new government emerges in Israel,” Satloff said.
    


            Meanwhile, the UN commission's report on genocide in Gaza has drawn renewed attention to the International Criminal Court investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine, with the inquiry recommending that prosecutors examine genocide as part of that case.
    


            The ICC's issue of an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu has already severely limited where he can travel outside of Israel. Netanyahu's flight to the UN meeting in New York this week took a circuitous route – maneuvering around French and Spanish airspace – in an apparent effort to avoid countries that could enforce an outstanding arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes.
    


            Despite the apparent decline in support from other nations, the United States still firmly votes with Israel.
    


            Speaking earlier this month about the Israeli strike on Qatari soil, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “I think the president's comments speak for themselves on that front. He didn't like the way it went down. That said… our relationship with Israel is going to remain strong.”

Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the 30-year-old man who was wrongfully deported from the United States to his native El Salvador during President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, has been transferred to a detention facility in central Pennsylvania.

Abrego Garcia was moved to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Phillipsburg, PA, on Friday morning, according to court documents filed the same day to his lawyers. 

The long-running deportation saga of Abrego Garcia has become one of the most high-profile cases of Trump administration's deportation efforts to date. The administarion has claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that he denies and for which he was not charged. 

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official told Abrego Garcia's lawyers that the transfer from Virginia's Farmville Detention Center will “allow Mr. Abrego-Garcia's legal team greater access to him,” the filing stated. In response, his attorneys said, “It is not yet clear whether that is true.”

Abrego Garcia filed a status report on Sept. 19, detailing how his detention at the Farmville Detention Center “placed substantial burdens on the defense's ability to meet” with him, his counsel told the judge. 

Abrego Garcia's lawyers have argued that travel to Moshannon is far more difficult for members of the defense team based in Nashville, and not easier for those in New York.

“Conditions at Moshannon are also deeply concerning,” his attorneys said, citing a detainee who died by hanging in August, reports of assaults, inadequate medical care and insufficient food.

HOW TRUMP'S DEPORTATION AGENDA IS BEING STALLED IN COURTS

The administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in June, but only to face human smuggling charges. His lawyers have called the case preposterous and vindictive. 

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty.

The Obama Foundation has yet to fulfill its pledge to create a $470 million reserve fund meant to shield taxpayers if the Obama Presidential Center runs into trouble, according to recent tax filings, which show millions instead going to the Tides Foundation.

When the 19.3-acre section of land in a public Chicago park was acquired for just $10 in 2018 under a 99-year deal, the construction of the presidential library required the creation of an endowment fund to spare taxpayers should the project ever go belly up. 

The latest available tax filings indicate that the foundation, founded by former President Barack Obama, has only deposited $1 million — 0.21% of the pledged funds — since the construction site was broken in September 2021, and has not added to it since. 

Although the foundation's agreement with the city required the creation of an endowment, it did not set a specific amount. The $470 million figure emerged during city council deliberations and was later confirmed by the foundation in its 2020 annual report.

The Obama Presidential Center was conceptualized as a campus, including a museum, library, athletic facility, and fruit and vegetable gardens to act as a community space in commemoration of the 44th president of the United States. 

Amid reports that the endowment remains largely unfunded, Illinois GOP Chair Kathy Salvi criticized the project as an “abomination” and condemned Democrats for potentially putting taxpayers at risk with the deal.

A long-developing plan to protect South Side residents from rising rents and displacement tied to the Obama Presidential Center is headed to the City Council for a vote after clearing committee on Wednesday.

Construction in the section of Jackson Park, often described as Chicago's equivalent of Central Park, has been slow. The project's estimated cost has ballooned from $330 million to at least $850 million, potentially leaving Chicagoans on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars.

Records further indicate that in 2022 and 2023, the foundation sent $2 million to the Tides Foundation. The Tides Foundation, also funded by Democratic mega-donor George Soros, is a network that operates as a fiscal sponsor for groups that have not registered with the IRS as charities. 

The $2 million was granted to over 50 organizations nationwide to help reduce “surging summer violence” and provide “safe spaces”  for young people, a spokeswoman for the Obama Foundation told the New York Post. 

The Tides Center, part of the larger Tides network, is under House Ways and Means Committee scrutiny for supporting anti-Israel groups like the Adalah Justice Project, Palestine Legal, the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, and the Catalyst Project. It provided fiscal sponsorship to organizations promoting pro-Hamas messaging and organizing potentially illegal protests, including post–October 7 demonstrations and college encampments following the Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 Israelis.

In addition to sending donations to Tides, the Obama Foundation has sent more than $3 million in 2022 and 2023 in grants to Gofundme.org for undisclosed “grassroots leaders to empower girls through education,” according to the group's filings.

“It should come as no surprise that the Obama Center is potentially leaving Illinois taxpayers high and dry — it's an Illinois Democrat tradition,” Salvi told Fox News Digital. 

DEMOCRATS AND TRUMP DIG IN ON SHUTDOWN DEMANDS

The Obama Foundation's latest tax return further revealed financial strain marked by volatile year-to-year revenue, fundraising shortfalls, and unfulfilled donor pledges. 

Meanwhile, the foundation admitted it has so far spent more than $615 million building the Obama Presidential Center, which is scheduled to open in spring 2026, according to its website.

President Donald Trump warned Sunday of widespread layoffs if the federal government shuts down this week, telling NBC News that "we are going to cut a lot of the people that ... we're able to cut on a permanent basis."

"[I'd] rather not do that," he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.

The White House is doubling down on warnings that thousands of government jobs could be on the line if the government shuts down at midnight on Tuesday.

The Trump administration last week told federal agencies to begin preparing for mass firings if Congress does not agree to a deal to avert a shutdown. If the White House follows through on its threat, it would mark a break from precedent, as federal employees are typically furloughed in such cases.

When there was a full government shutdown in 2013, for instance, about 850,000 employees were furloughed, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The warning of potential mass firings — which was made via a memo released by the Office of Management and Budget — marked a significant escalation of pressure on congressional lawmakers to head off a shutdown.

Still, with less than three days until the government funding deadline, lawmakers remain far apart on negotiations, increasing the chances of a shutdown.

A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service before apparently setting the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring several others before police shot him, authorities said

Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a 40-year-old man rammed a pickup truck through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Police believe he "deliberately" set the building on fire.

After the suspect left the church, two officers pursued him and "engaged in gunfire," Renye said. The man was killed.

Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out. First responders were then sifting through the wreckage.

"We do believe we will find some additional victims once we find the area where the fire was," Renye said.

Police initially said that nine people were injured. When Renye later announced that one additional person had died from a gunshot wound at a hospital, he did not say whether that person had been included in the number of injured.

Police said they did not yet have a motive for the fire or shooting. Investigators are searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church.

It was the latest of many shooting attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children during Mass at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.

President Donald Trump said he was briefed on the shooting. In a social media post, he applauded the FBI, which local authorities said is sending 100 agents to the area, for responding.

"PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!" Trump wrote.

The church building, circled by a parking lot and a large lawn, is near residential areas and a Jehovah's Witness church. It is in Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint.

The impact spread quickly to neighboring communities, including the small city that shares a name with the township.

"Although we are two separate governmental units, we are a very cohesive community," said city of Grand Blanc Mayor John Creasey. "This sort of thing is painful for our entire community. I'm struggling to digest all that has happened, and my heart goes out to all of the affected families."

Timothy Jones, 48, said his family is part of another Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints congregation, or ward, about 15 minutes away, but that his children were at the Grand Blanc Township ward the night before the shooting for a youth fall festival. He and his family moved to Flint two years ago in large part because of how strong the faith's community is in the area.

As people in his congregation got word of the shooting from texts and phone calls during their own Sunday service, the church went into lockdown and police came as a precaution, he said. His children were "frantically, just trying to get word that people were okay."

Sundays are "supposed to be a time of peace and a time of reflection and worship," Jones said. Yet in the wake of violence at other houses of worship across religions, a shooting "feels inevitable, and all the more tragic because of that" he added.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart was breaking for the community. "Violence anywhere especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable," she said.

The shooting occurred the morning after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the faith, died at 101. The next president is expected to be Dallin H. Oaks, per church protocol.

"The church is in communication with local law enforcement as the investigation continues and as we receive updates on the condition of those affected," Doug Anderson, a spokesperson for Utah-based faith said in a statement.

"Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved."

Some striking nurses at nearby Henry Ford Hospital left the picket line and ran the short distance to the church to help first responders, Teamsters Local 332 President Dan Glass said.

"Human lives matter more than our labor dispute," Glass said.

A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service and set the building ablaze, killing at least two people and injuring eight others before police shot him, authorities said.

Hundreds of people were inside the church in Grand Blanc Township when a man rammed a four-door pickup with two American flags in the truck bed through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters. Investigators believe he "deliberately" set the building on fire, Renye said.

Officers responded to a 911 call and were at the church within 30 seconds, Renye said. After the suspect left the church, two officers pursued him and "engaged in gunfire," the chief said. They killed the shooter about seven minutes later.

Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out.

Renye identified the suspect as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from neighboring Burton. Reyne did not specify a motive at a news conference on Sunday evening. Police cordoned off the street leading to the suspect's home

Renye said one of the wounded people was in critical condition and seven others were stable. Earlier in the day, Renye had said authorities believed they would find more victims once they could sift through the wreckage and find where the fire was.

Investigators were searching the suspect's residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church.

The church building, circled by a parking lot and a large lawn, is near residential areas and a Jehovah's Witness church. It is in Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint.

Brad Schneemann, whose home is about 400 yards (365 meters) from the church, told The Associated Press that he and his daughter heard "two rounds of four to five shots" around 10:30 a.m. "Then, we really didn't hear anything for a while" before they left their home to see what was going on.

The impact spread quickly to neighboring communities, including the small city that shares a name with the township.

Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said he is optimistic about the future of TikTok in the U.S.

"I feel very confident that we have successfully separated this company from TikTok global and actually made it so that we can control people's data security," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "We can ensure that the algorithm is not being used as a propaganda tool by a foreign government."

The popular social media platform has long faced concerns about its data collection practices and parent company ByteDance's relationship with the Chinese government.

After months of uncertainty following former President Joe Biden's signing of a national security law effectively banning TikTok from U.S. app stores, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday approving a proposal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the country.

"The way that we've set up this deal from a national security perspective is that it's the American investors and the American businesspeople who will make the determination about what's actually happening with TikTok," said Vance, who has said the agreement values TikTok's business at $14 billion.

Under the terms of Trump's executive order, a new joint-venture company would oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. Among the company's investors would be tech giant Oracle, private-equity firm Silver Lake and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX investment fund.

ByteDance investors, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna, and Sequoia, are expected to contribute equity in the new TikTok U.S. entity. According to the deal, the federal government would not take an equity stake — or a so-called golden share — in TikTok's U.S. operations.

"At the end of the day, I believe that north of 80% of the company will be owned by the American investors and their partners," said Vance. "This is not something where the Chinese or any Chinese entity has a large stake of the table."

On the day he signed the executive order, Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping gave the deal the go ahead, while Vance said the Chinese government had some resistance to the deal.

So far, ByteDance has not acknowledged Trump's executive order, nor has it confirmed that the transaction is actually taking place. There has also been no indication that the Chinese government has made any changes to laws that would be necessary for a deal to occur.

As congressional Democrats push to tie extending Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies to the government funding fight, Republican leaders say they're willing to debate the issue — but not until after a shutdown is averted.

"The Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year ... not right now, while we're simply trying to keep the government open," House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on CNN's "State of the Union."

His comments were echoed by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who called the ACA, also known as Obamacare, a program "in desperate need of reform."

"We acknowledge that there's gonna have to be — hopefully there'll be some steps taken that can address the concerns that Democrats have," he said on NBC News' "Meet the Press." "But you can't do this by Tuesday."

Their comments threw cold water on Democrats' main sticking point just days before the government is poised to shut down.

If the ACA tax credits expire at the end of the year, premiums could soar for millions of Americans, a reality that could prove to be a political vulnerability for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

With the budget funding deadline looming, President Donald Trump is poised to meet on Monday with the top four congressional leaders — Johnson, Thune, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The scheduled meeting comes after Trump last week abruptly cancelled a meeting with Democratic leadership, saying that no meeting "could possibly be productive."

It remains unclear whether the 11th-hour meeting will yield a deal that averts a shutdown on Tuesday at midnight.

"[Trump] wants to talk with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries and just try to convince them to follow common sense and do what's right by the American people," Speaker Johnson said Sunday.

Schumer, for his part, said that the prospect of a government shutdown "depends on the Republicans."

"We need the meeting. It's a first step, but only a first step. We need a serious negotiation," Schumer said on NBC News' "Meet the Press."

Democrats have repeatedly insisted that any government funding proposal include an extension of the Obamacare tax credits.

They remained firm with their demands on Sunday.

"We actually need to enact legislation to ensure that the Affordable Care Act tax credits are extended," Jeffries said, warning that "notices" are set to begin going out for the millions of Americans who rely on the subsidies.

Republicans, however, argue that there is still time to hammer out a deal on the subsidies.

"That doesn't happen until the end of the year," Thune said during an interview on NBC News' "Meet the Press."

"We can have that conversation, but before we do, release the hostage, set the American people free, keep the government open."

Republicans in the Senate need eight Democrats to vote with them to pass their continuing resolution through the upper chamber, Thune said, a prospect that, at this point, seems difficult.

Struggling to stay on top of your money is not a unique problem.

But neurodivergent people — such as those with autism or ADHD — can face a unique set of challenges when managing their finances, says Andrea Ewalefo, founder of Modern Lady Vibes, a financial coaching business specializing in neurodivergent women of color.

One of these challenges is something called executive dysfunction. It can crop up in variety of areas — "anything from your impulsivity, to your ability to make decisions, to your to your ability to be consistent," Ewalefo says. "Time blindness is another one, you get caught up in certain experiences. Or you don't have enough dopamine to keep you focused for a long period of time."

If any of this sounds like you, the traditional approach to managing money you've been taught may not work for you, says Ewalefo, herself a member of the neurodivergent community.

"A lot of the things people in the financial education space get caught up in is throwing systems in people's faces," she says. For neurodivergent folks, "we struggle with not only getting the systems set up, but sticking to them, or getting emotionally invested in them."

Ewalefo knows that no two people have the exact same concerns when it comes to money, and tries to meet clients where they are. Her advice for nearly all of them: "Don't beat yourself up." And whenever possible, try to automate and delegate the financial tasks that drain you the most, so you can focus more on achieving your money goals.

For some neurodivergent people, the "spoon theory," can serve as a useful metaphor for a daily store of energy that's depleted by doing tasks.

"Brushing your teeth — things that neurotypical people just wake up and do — we have to consciously think about, and it uses our energy, our spoons," Ewalefo says. "This morning brushing my teeth might take ten spoons. Yesterday it took two."

The idea is that you have a set amount of spoons for the day, and once they're gone, you're completely mentally spent, "a log on the floor," Ewalefo says.

For many of Ewalefo's clients, the first step to getting on track financially is about taking money-related spoons off the table.

"If we can remove as much decision fatigue as possible, particularly within our financial planning, then that can help preserve our energy to do other things," she says. "What that might look like is automating as much as possible."

Ewalefo recommends setting your bill due dates to align with the days you get paid. If you're paid once a month, for instance, set up autopay for all your bills on payday.

"Since it's happening right when you get that paycheck, once your bills are paid, everything left is just free spending money," she says. "Now have the freedom to enjoy your impulse buying without worrying about the fact that, oh no, I just spent my car payment."

What's more, setting rote financial tasks on autopilot can allow you to dedicate more of your mental energy to the money goals you really care about. To make progress on those, she says, you'll also have to pay yourself from each check — and that can be put on autopilot, too.

"It's not just the bills or the debt, it's also auto-drafting your savings and investing needs so that those are prioritized just as much as your rent, just as much as your water bill," Ewalefo says. "And all of that money has been set aside and put where it needs to go, so whatever is left in your account can literally just be spent on whatever you want."

In 2015, I packed up my life in Austin, Texas and moved to Madrid. I was 35 and it wasn't my first attempt. I had spent more than a decade dreaming, trying, and failing to make Spain home.

Since then, I've built a life in Spain and created She Hit Refresh, where I've helped hundreds of other women move abroad. 

Along the way, I've experienced moments when my life in Europe felt like a movie. Like the time I stumbled upon a flamenco dancer in a hidden square, sipped wine at a Parisian café while the world passed by, or rode a Vespa past the Colosseum in Rome.

But these moments aren't everyday life, and not everything about moving abroad is just as you imagine it to be. Here are the six myths I hear most often about relocating.

Many countries can feel more affordable than the U.S., but living abroad is probably not as cheap as you think. Costs are rising around the world, especially housing prices. House prices in the EU went up 57.9% between 2010 and the first quarter of 2025, while rents increased by 27.8%. 

My advice: Run the numbers based on today's reality, not outdated blog posts. And remember, what feels affordable to you on a U.S. salary may still be unaffordable for locals. Don't overpay. It only fuels the problem.

The real pressure comes from tourism, not the relatively small number of Americans moving abroad. And while anti-tourism sentiment exists in crowded cities, it's not really about Americans, or even expats at all. The bigger issue is affordable housing — or, as I mentioned, the lack of it.

But smaller towns across Europe want new residents due to depopulation. If you're serious about integrating, consider looking beyond hotspots like Lisbon, Barcelona, or Amsterdam. 

Regardless, in my own experience, when you learn the language, contribute, and connect, you'll usually be welcomed with open arms.

Of course you'll miss family and friends, but community abroad often forms faster than you'd expect.

Other Americans and English-speaking foreigners are eager to connect. Between meetups, language exchanges, and expat events, you'll have no shortage of opportunities to meet people.

That said, deep friendships take time. I'm an extrovert, and it still took me around 2.5 years to feel like I had a strong community in Madrid. Many of my closest friendships came from hosting my own meetups.

For deeper integration, friendships with locals are key, though those are definitely harder to form. Many locals already have tight circles, and breaking in takes patience and persistence. Learning the language is essential, and it takes time. Most people are still beginners after a year.

Living abroad can absolutely improve your quality of life — whether it's a slower pace, a relatively lower cost of living, or easier travel, there's a lot to love. But it's not a fairy tale.

You'll still deal with bureaucracy, taxes, and logistics like finding an apartment, setting up bank accounts, and making appointments with doctors. And sometimes the grocery store will just be closed on a Sunday when you need it most.

The hardest challenges are often personal. I'll never forget when I got the call that my father had passed away. It was in 2009, during one of my earlier stints in Spain, getting my master's degree. I learned then that the highs and lows of life still happen abroad, and the lows are tougher when you're far from home.

Your first move abroad doesn't have to be your forever home. Think of it as a starting point, not a lifelong commitment. As someone once told me: It's a move, not a marriage. 

When I moved to Madrid in 2015, I thought I'd never leave. But in 2020, I moved to Málaga, and now I'm considering heading back to Madrid again.

I've seen this with others, too. Cindy Sheahan, for example, moved to Porto, Portugal, but then decided Italy was a better fit and relocated there a year later.

Giving yourself permission to pivot can help you avoid getting stuck in research paralysis, trying to make the "perfect" choice before you even start. There are plenty of things you just won't know until you've actually moved.

I was 35 when I moved and thought I was already too old. At the time, I only knew of students and retirees moving abroad, not people in the middle of their careers. But at 45, I can say without hesitation that it was the best decision I've ever made.

And once I got here, I met so many people my age and older who had done the same. People make the leap at every age — 30s, 40s, 50s, even 70s.

In fact, moving in your 30s or later has advantages, since people tend to arrive with more financial stability, better self-awareness, and the wisdom to navigate challenges with perspective.

In the summer of 2024, a group of women in the Minneapolis area learned that a male friend used their Facebook photos mixed with artificial intelligence to create sexualized images and videos.   

Using an AI site called DeepSwap, the man secretly created deepfakes of the friends and over 80 women in the Twin Cities region. The discovery created emotional trauma and led the group to seek the help of a sympathetic state senator.

As a CNBC investigation shows, the rise of "nudify" apps and sites has made it easier than ever for people to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes. Experts said these services are all over the Internet, with many being promoted via Facebook ads, available for download on the Apple and Google app stores and easily accessed using simple web searches.

"That's the reality of where the technology is right now, and that means that any person can really be victimized," said Haley McNamara, senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation.

CNBC's reporting shines a light on the legal quagmire surrounding AI, and how a group of friends became key figures in the fight against nonconsensual, AI-generated porn.

Here are five takeaways from the investigation.

Because the women weren't underage and the man who created the deepfakes never distributed the content, there was no apparent crime.

"He did not break any laws that we're aware of," said Molly Kelley, one of the Minnesota victims and a law student. "And that is problematic."

Now, Kelley and the women are advocating for a local bill in their state, proposed by Democratic state Senator Erin Maye Quade, intended to block nudify services in Minnesota. Should the bill become law, it would levy fines on the entities enabling the creation of the deepfakes.

Maye Quade said the bill is reminiscent of laws that prohibit peeping into windows to snap explicit photos without consent.

"We just haven't grappled with the emergence of AI technology in the same way," Maye Quade said in an interview with CNBC, referring to the speed of AI development.

Jessica Guistolise, one of the Minnesota victims, said she continues to suffer from panic and anxiety stemming from the incident last year.

Sometimes, she said, a simple click of a camera shutter can cause her to lose her breath and begin trembling, her eyes swelling with tears. That's what happened at a conference she attended a month after first learning about the images.

"I heard that camera click, and I was quite literally in the darkest corners of the internet," Guistolise said. "Because I've seen myself doing things that are not me doing things."

Mary Anne Franks, professor at the George Washington University Law School, compared the experience to the feelings victims describe when talking about so-called revenge porn, or the posting of a person's sexual photos and videos online, often by a former romantic partner.

"It makes you feel like you don't own your own body, that you'll never be able to take back your own identity," said Franks, who is also president of the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to combating online abuse and discrimination.

Less than a decade ago, a person would need to be an AI expert to make explicit deepfakes. Thanks to nudifier services, all that's required is an internet connection and a Facebook photo.

Researchers said new AI models have helped usher in a wave of nudify services. The models are often bundled within easy-to-use apps, so that people lacking technical skills can create the content.

And while nudify services can contain disclaimers about obtaining consent, it's unclear whether there is any enforcement mechanism. Additionally, many nudify sites market themselves simply as so-called face-swapping tools.

"There are apps that present as playful and they are actually primarily meant as pornographic in purpose," said Alexios Mantzarlis, an AI security expert at Cornell Tech. "That's another wrinkle in this space."

The site that was used to create the content is called DeepSwap, and there's not much information about it online.

In a press release published in July, DeepSwap used a Hong Kong dateline and included a quote from Penyne Wu, who was identified in the release as CEO and co-founder. The media contact on the release was Shawn Banks, who was listed as marketing manager. 

CNBC was unable to find information online about Wu, and sent multiple emails to the address provided for Banks, but received no response.

DeepSwap's website currently lists "MINDSPARK AI LIMITED" as its company name, provides an address in Dublin, and states that its terms of service are "governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland."

However, in July, the same DeepSwap page had no mention of Mindspark, and references to Ireland instead said Hong Kong. 

Maye Quade's bill, which is still being considered, would fine tech companies that offer nudify services $500,000 for every nonconsensual, explicit deepfake that they generate in the state of Minnesota.Some experts are concerned, however, that the Trump administration's plans to bolster the AI sector will undercut states' efforts. In late July, Trump signed executive orders as part of the White House's AI Action Plan, underscoring AI development as a "national security imperative." 

Kelley hopes that any federal AI push doesn't jeopardize the efforts of the Minnesota women.

"I'm concerned that we will continue to be left behind and sacrificed at the altar of trying to have some geopolitical race for powerful AI," Kelley said.WATCH: The alarming rise of AI 'nudify' apps that create explicit images of real people.

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties, several companies are well-positioned to deliver strong returns to investors from rapid technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. 

To pick attractive stocks with strong prospects, investors can track top Wall Street analysts, whose recommendations are based on in-depth research and analysis of a company's financials and growth drivers.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

We start with semiconductor giant Nvidia (NVDA), which has strengthened its dominant position through continued innovation and strategic deals, such as the recently announced $5 billion investment in Intel and massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI.

Following a conversation with Nvidia's CFO on the OpenAI deal, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis reiterated a buy rating on NVDA, saying the chip company is the "AI ecosystem of choice, not just with its CUDA software stack, but also with its connectivity solution, NVLink, which we think is poised to become a de facto standard."

The top-rated analyst increased his price target on Nvidia to $225 from $214 and said that Nvidia remains a top pick for Evercore. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $204.

Highlighting the key takeaways from his conversation with the company's CFO, Lipacis said that Nvidia will be the preferred supplier to OpenAI, adding that the ChatGPT platform has underestimated demand for its solution and wants to get ahead of future demand. Nvidia is well-positioned to help OpenAI with this infrastructure buildout.

Lipacis noted that the deal specifies at least 10 GW (gigawatts) of AI infrastructure, and Nvidia management confirmed that, historically, the company's total addressable market (TAM) was $30 billion to $40 billion per GW, although it could increase in the future. The analyst increased his 2026 revenue and earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 2% for Nvidia, but thinks that his forecast may be conservative.

Lipacis ranks No. 53 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See Nvidia ETF Exposure on TipRanks.

Next is database management software company MongoDB (MDB). The company recently held a MongoDB.local event in New York City, hosting an Investor Session focused on profitable growth and providing a 3- to 5-year financial framework.

Following the event, Needham analyst Mike Cikos reiterated a buy rating on MongoDB and increased his price target to $365 from $325. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MDB stock, giving it an "outperform" rating and a price target of $355.

Cikos said that while investors' initial reaction to the high-teens revenue growth forecast was underwhelming, he expects both AI and competitive migrations to drive incremental growth for MongoDB.

The 5-star analyst noted that management plans to continue investing in the business, though at a slower rate than revenue and gross profit growth. MongoDB's investments will mainly focus on developer awareness, research & development and its sales force.The company has also identified areas for optimization and expects its scale to drive profitable growth through efficiencies.

Cikos said that following the MongoDB.local event he is "incrementally more positive on MongoDB's AI positioning," driven by embeddings, which bridge data and Large Language Models (LLMs), and the continued integration of Voyage's best-in-class models.

Cikos ranks No. 581 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.1%. See MongoDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike (CRWD) is this week's third pick. The cloud-native platform offers security solutions for critical areas of enterprise risk — endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data.

Following CrowdStrike's recently held Fal.Con 2025 event, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on CrowdStrike with a 12-month price target of $510, saying the commentary from management, partners and customers reinforced his bullish long-term thesis. CrowdStrike remains one of RBC's top cybersecurity ideas, he added. TipRanks' AI Analyst has a "neutral" rating on CrowdStrike stock with a target price of $543.

"Overall, we thought the event made a compelling case for the company's positioning as we enter the agentic era," said Hedberg.

The 5-star analyst mainly noted lucrative prospects in agentic security for CrowdStrike and the evolution of its agentic security operations center (SOC). He added that management views the agentic revolution as a huge opportunity (potentially over a 100x), with the rise of more identities and complexity creating new security needs.

Management sees a total addressable market (TAM) of $300 billion in 2030, up from $140 billion in 2026, with key tailwinds resulting from market consolidation, the evolving threat landscape and technological advancements. Helped by these tailwinds, Hedberg believes CrowdStrike is well-positioned for continued market consolidation as it secures an AI-led transformation.  

Hedberg noted that CrowdStrike is about halfway through its $10 billion annual recurring revenue (ARR) goal for fiscal 2031. While cloud, the Next-Gen Identity Security offering and the Next-Gen SIEM platform are the key drivers for the current ARR of $4.7 billion, management expects agentic SOC to be the main catalyst for achieving the $10 billion ARR target for fiscal 2031. CrowdStrike expects Agentic Everywhere to be the key driver for the newly introduced $20 billion ARR target for fiscal 2036.

Hedberg ranks No. 37 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 70% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.6%. See CrowdStrike Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

The Trump administration needs to strike multiple deals with U.S. miners to secure the nation's supply chain against China, said Mark Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels, a miner focused on uranium and rare earth minerals.

The Pentagon decision to take an equity stake in MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, in July and support the company with a price floor surprised many in the industry, Chalmers told CNBC.

But it was a necessary step that the White House should now follow with more deals to diversify the U.S. supply chain and reduce the risk that would come with backing a single national champion, the CEO said.

"One company doesn't fix it," Chalmers said of the MP Materials deal. "You have to have multiple deals to ensure that you don't just have the company risk, because all companies aren't going to deliver."

The White House is "not ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn't mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal," a Trump administration official told CNBC.

Rare earths are key inputs in weapons platforms such as the F-35 warplane as well as consumer products like electric vehicles and smartphones. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. 

China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said.

"We've seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market — and something needed to give," Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC.

Energy Fuels' stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. Critical mineral miner NioCorp Developments is also up almost 200%, Ramaco Resources has gained 140%, and USA Rare Earth is up more than 70%.

MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said.

Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said.

Energy Fuels is focused on "providing a product that is attractive to the U.S government" and complements the strengths of MP Materials, the CEO said.

"The government cannot bet on one horse — it just doesn't make sense," Chalmers said. "We spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy," he said.

Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications.

The Trump administration has proposed an equity stake in Lithium Americas, as the Canadian company renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada. The mine is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America, with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027.

Lithium Americas stock surged more than 90% this week on news of the potential government stake.

Albemarle CEO Kent Masters told CNBC that something "in the ballpark" of the MP deal could apply to the lithium sector. Albemarle, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest lithium producers in the world.

"What you want to do is move the market such that private industry can invest behind it," Masters told CNBC in July, pointing to Apple's offtake agreement with MP just days after the Defense Department deal.

While it might take a government equity stake to move the market in some cases, the price floor established by the Pentagon in the MP deal is the "critical part" that allows private industry to invest and build out the supply chain, Masters said.

Price support from the federal government "sends a true market signal that these investments are long term, that they are here to stay," the National Mining Association's Nolan said.

Under the MP deal, the Pentagon set a price floor of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, a key input in rare-earth magnets. The government pays MP the difference when the market price is below $110 but in turn takes 30% of the upside when the price is above $110.

The price of NdPr surged 40% in the wake of the MP deal, Castilloux said.

"It serves as a blueprint for any market where suppressed pricing is slanting the competitive playing field against the U.S. and its allies," the analyst said of the price floor. The deal signals that "there is a way to break free of China's artificially suppressed pricing," he said.

Computer science went from a future-proof career to an industry in upheaval in a shockingly small amount of time.

"For people like your son, by the way, who four years ago were promised, go study computer science, it's going to be a great career. It is future-proof — that changed in four years," UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid said during a recent episode of Nova's "Particles of Thought" podcast. "That is astonishing."

It's too easy to just blame AI, though, Farid said.

"Something is happening in the industry," he said. "I think it's a confluence of many things. I think AI is part of it. I think there's a thinning of the ranks that's happening, that's part of it, but something is brewing."

Farid and the host, astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi, discussed how Oluseyi's son, a senior studying computer science, is struggling to find a job. Farid says he's seeing the same thing unfold at Berkeley, home to one of the top CS programs.

"Our students typically had five internship offers throughout their first four years of college," Farid said. "They would graduate with exceedingly high salaries, multiple offers. They had the run of the place. That is not happening today. They're happy to get one job offer."

The debate over the future of CS is playing out around Silicon Valley. The rise of vibecoding and AI's ability to create software by itself has only exacerbated these concerns. OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor has said that students learn concepts in computer science that go beyond mere coding languages.

Farid, one of the world's experts on deepfake videos, said he is often asked for advice. He said what he tells students has changed.

"What I used to tell people is you want a broad education," Farid said. "You should know about physics, and language, and history, and philosophy, but then you have to go deep, deep — like deep, deep into one thing, become really, really good at one thing. Now, I think I'm telling people to be good at a lot of different things because we don't know what the future holds."

Like many in the AI space, Farid said that those who use breakthrough technologies will outlast those who don't.

"I don't think AI is going to put lawyers out of business, but I think lawyers who use AI will put those who don't use AI out of business," he said. "And I think you can say that about every profession."

Home - Crypto Presales - Best Crypto ICO of 2025: BlockDAG, PEPENODE, SUBBD, & Maxi Doge Capture Attention

The search for fresh crypto opportunities often begins with presales, where lower entry points and exclusive rewards create strong appeal. In 2025, several projects are gaining traction not only because of hype but also because of real adoption and technical direction.



Among them, BlockDAG, PEPENODE, SUBBD Token, and Maxi Doge (MAXI) are standing out. Each brings different strategies, from infrastructure and creator tools to gamified mining and meme-driven growth. For anyone asking about the best crypto ICO of 2025, these four are currently among the strongest options.

BlockDAG has become the focal point of the presale market, proving itself with results far beyond early projections. It has raised over $410 million, signed up 312,000+ holders, and continues adding more than 1,000 new participants daily.

Hardware is already in use, with over 20,000 X-Series miners shipped to 130+ countries. Its Awakening Testnet, now active, delivers live stress testing and features such as account abstraction, UTXO removal, Stratum miner integration, and early EIP-4337 groundwork.

At the same time, adoption through the X1 app has surged, with more than 3 million people mining directly on smartphones. This dual system, pairing mobile mining with high-performance hardware, creates a structure that is already active, not just planned.











The Batch 30 price has been cut to $0.0013 for a limited time, offering major ROI potential. In discussions of the best crypto ICO of 2025, BlockDAG stands out because it compresses years of development into months, making early entry more compelling.

SUBBD Token is targeting the creator economy with AI and Web3 tools. Its presale has already raised about $1.1 million, with tokens priced at $0.056475. Utilities include AI-powered content generation, avatars, voice cloning, and monetization models for subscriptions.

Staking is available at a 20% APY during presale, while after launch the token will support rewards, access, and payments within the platform. Price forecasts suggest growth toward $0.4463 by the end of 2025, with longer-term projections above $2 if adoption continues.











The project has also undergone audits by Coinsult and SolidProof, strengthening its credibility. For those exploring creator-focused ecosystems in the best crypto ICO of 2025 discussions, SUBBD offers direct exposure to a fast-growing sector.

PEPENODE has built momentum by blending meme-driven culture with a mine-to-earn model. Users can create and upgrade virtual mining rigs (nodes) to earn rewards in PEPE and Fartcoin, while 70% of tokens spent on upgrades are burned, creating a deflationary system.

Early participants are seeing staking rewards above 1,000% APY, boosting presale interest. The project has raised between $1.2M and $1.3M, with tokens priced at $0.0010617. The roadmap includes a dashboard for node management, governance features, and listings on Uniswap and later centralized exchanges.

Analysts speculate on possible 100x returns if adoption scales, though such forecasts remain uncertain. Still, PEPENODE's mix of gamification and economics makes it a creative contender in the best crypto ICO of 2025 lineup.

Maxi Doge (MAXI) combines meme appeal with staking-driven rewards. Its presale price ranges between $0.000256 and $0.000258, and it has raised more than $2.2 million. With a supply of about 150.24 billion MAXI, it is structured as an ERC-20 token with a focus on community growth.

Staking returns range between 140% and 160% APY, while weekly trading competitions and the Maxi Fund aim to boost partnerships and liquidity. The presale stages will raise pricing gradually, with a Token Generation Event planned for Q4 2025.











MAXI also has plans to introduce futures trading with leverage as high as 1000×, an ambitious move for a meme project. Forecasts vary, with some expecting $0.003294 by the end of 2025, while others project between $0.00035 and $0.00053. Regardless, MAXI's blend of meme energy and real features makes it a notable entry in the best crypto ICO of 2025.

Presales remain one of the most important stages for discovering future leaders. BlockDAG, PEPENODE, SUBBD Token, and Maxi Doge are four projects making strong progress, each with different strengths.











BlockDAG leads with its hardware delivery, app adoption, and live testnet, providing proof instead of promises. PEPENODE adds gamification, SUBBD focuses on creator monetization, and MAXI blends meme appeal with staking. For those evaluating the best crypto ICO of 2025, this group is shaping the conversation, and timing will determine who captures the upside first.

Cryptocurrency — the once avant-garde monetary alternative — is going mainstream. The GENIUS Act, recently signed into law, and the CLARITY Act, passed by the House and waiting on a vote by the Senate, are central to the industry's effort to obtain regulatory clarity and to level the playing field with traditional finance (TradFi).

In its quest for legitimacy, however, the crypto industry has been betrayed by the proposed legislation. These bills suggest abandoning the x-factor that made crypto so powerful and attractive in the first place: trustless decentralization. New crypto legislation would benefit from tapping into what makes this trailblazing industry so appealing by embracing regulation as technology itself.

Cryptocurrencies — digital currencies that leverage blockchain technology to enable secure and transparent peer-to-peer transactions — are decentralized. Their trustless nature, where no central authority is needed to verify transactions, is essential to crypto's adoption, with a market cap of $3.78 trillion.

Until now, the industry has thrived without central oversight or burdensome government regulation. Crypto's huge success is the culmination of no-holds-barred free market competition.

Over half of all cryptocurrencies have failed. Yet, through this process of trial and error, new and powerful technologies have emerged.

Blockchain technology is being utilized by 81 of the top 100 public companies. The global market for smart contracts, self-executing contracts built on blockchain technology, was valued at $684.3 million in 2022 and is expected to grow to $73.7 billion by 2030. The transaction volume of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset like a fiat currency, has exceeded the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard. And the RWA market, tokenized real world assets, is expected to reach a $50 billion market cap by the end of this year.

Despite the successes and lessons learned from these technologies, new legislation in the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, seek to bring crypto under the same centralized regulatory umbrella that controls traditional financial markets. These bills posit a regulatory framework that aligns state and federal stablecoin oversight.

The current legislative approach misses an opportunity to tap into the potential of self-regulation, where private legal bodies compete to test and refine regulatory approaches. Through experimentation, as the crypto industry demonstrated with money, ledgers, and contracts, regulation can become a powerful technology.

Private regulation and competing regulatory regimes are not just theoretical concepts cooked up at some egghead convention, they have a long history of success across various sectors.

Private regulation has been key in areas like environmental protection, human rights, privacy, employee and customer safety, and animal welfare, with companies setting strict standards to attract customers.

The NYSE and NASDAQ stock exchanges, as self-regulatory organizations, establish their own rules for listing and trading, going beyond government oversight to shape their respective regulatory environments.

Industry standards, such as those from the International Organization of Standardization for quality and environmental management, reflect another form of private regulation, with companies voluntarily adopting them to improve operations and meet market needs.

Other notable private regulatory systems include Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA, the American Arbitration Association, and the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution.

These examples highlight the potential of private regulation to serve as a complement to, and in some cases, a substitute for, government oversight. If the crypto industry were allowed to embrace this model, regulatory technology could evolve, with private actors developing and testing regulatory frameworks that fit the unique needs of decentralized networks.

If the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts allowed private regulators in the crypto ecosystem, they would not only preserve the innovation that crypto brings to the market but also ensure that it remains flexible enough to adapt to an ever-changing technological landscape. This would mirror the way many industries, from finance to technology, have evolved over time: through trial and error, competition, and constant refinement.

To unleash crypto's full potential, we must recognize that regulation itself can be subject to market forces. Crypto's decentralized nature has already demonstrated its value, now it's time for regulation to evolve along with it.

The SEC's Spring 2025 agenda has caused ripples in the cryptocurrency market, casting uncertainty over major tokens. As regulatory developments unfold, investors are closely monitoring the impact on Ethereum and Solana, as the market anticipates potential policy changes. Trading activity has become cautious, with participants reassessing risk exposure amid broader market turbulence. Analysts are tracking the movement of sentiment as regulatory clarity or uncertainty could impact short-term volatility and longer-term investment strategies.

In this context, MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to make a name for itself. The Ethereum-based token is garnering traction as analysts forecast that it could benefit from increased transparency regarding SEC rules while market trust evolves.



The SEC Spring 2025 agenda puts digital assets at the center of its policy program. It aims to provide clearer guidelines for the issuance, custody, and trading of cryptocurrencies while ensuring investor protection.

Deregulatory measures include streamlining fundraising channels, lessening operational burdens, and re-evaluating the Consolidated Audit Trail system to balance cost against security oversight considerations. Analysts believe that these measures could provide confidence and institutional participation, creating opportunities for projects that comply with them. Investors consider that greater regulatory clarity could help ease uncertainty, boosting adoption and liquidity across digital assets.

Ethereum has been under pressure short term after recent highs. The initial small ascending channel from the prior weeks broke down, signaling a change of momentum. RSI has declined towards 40, indicating a weakening bullish strength without reaching extreme oversold levels. Traders are paying close attention to key support levels around $4,200 and $4,000.

Exchange netflows show consistent ETH outflows, indicating coins moved to self-custody or staking. Nonetheless, this decreases selling pressure and offers medium- to long-term bullish support. Despite short-term technical weakness, Ethereum's broader fundamentals remain strong, supported by institutional interest and ongoing network improvements.



Analysts have pointed out that if support holds, ETH could make a higher low and retest previous resistances. Conversely, failure to hold these zones may intensify selling pressure, raising the chances of deeper retracements. Momentum indicators indicate consolidation ahead of a bullish recovery.

Solana has fallen by 10% recently but bounced back to yield a higher low. Despite the downward shift, the higher highs and higher lows since April have held. Long-term horizontal resistance is near $250, which has proven difficult for the price to break since 2021. It reached an all-time high of $295 earlier this year.


Based on technical wave theory, SOL appears to be in the fifth of five waves up that it is moving in. A bullish move above $250 could break through overhead resistance and initiate a parabolic rally. Further upside targets include Fibonacci retracement levels between 0.064 and 0.071 ETH.

Analysts believe Solana can outperform Ethereum throughout the remainder of 2025 with continued momentum. Volume patterns show strong accumulation around recent lows, which supports upside potential. Traders are closely observing resistance and liquidity zones to determine the direction of Solana's upcoming rally.



In 2025, Solana and Ethereum remain the top smart contract environments, but their courses are unique. Solana is known for speed, processing thousands of transactions per second with low latency. With its unique combination of Proof of History and Proof of Stake, this network is primed for high-frequency applications like gaming and DeFi in real-time, providing a competitive advantage that drives swift adoption.

On the other hand, Ethereum depends entirely on its Layer-2 ecosystem for scalability, with significantly fewer transactions per second on the base layer. However, its network enjoys unmatched developer activity, mature DeFi protocols, and a strong institutional following. The future upgrades, like danksharding-enabled Dencun, promise to deliver enhanced throughput and decreased fees, streamlining the competitive position of Ethereum.

From a market standpoint, Solana has demonstrated more acute short-term increases, making it a viable option for traders aiming for rapid profits. Ethereum has proven more stable, and the greater liquidity and regulatory clarity are drawing long-term investors. Analysts have noted that Solana could move to the lead for upside potential, particularly if it finally breaks past persistent resistance levels. Overall, Ethereum is poised for long-term growth as various factors such as network maturity, security, and adoption by institutions boost its strong fundamentals.

Amid the Solana vs Ethereum debate, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly stealing attention at a time when the SEC's latest agenda update has unsettled the broader market. Built as a Layer 2 project on Ethereum, it benefits directly from Ethereum's growth while carving its own path. What makes it stand out is its design; early supporters are placed at the center, with a structure that rewards them from the start.

A significant share of tokens is set aside for community growth and exchange liquidity. This approach is aimed at creating stable trading conditions once the token lists, giving investors confidence that volatility will be managed from day one. To add even more momentum, MAGA

COIN FINANCE has introduced a limited-time 50% bonus for buyers using the promo code PATRIOTS100X. The bonus has already sparked strong demand, with investors treating it as a chance to maximize exposure before wider listings.

As Solana and Ethereum wrestle with market turbulence following the SEC update, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the project many are watching for fresh growth potential.

The SEC's agenda has introduced both short-term volatility and long-term opportunity for Ethereum and Solana. Regulatory clarity may boost investor confidence and support compliant projects. Ethereum faces short-term consolidation, with Layer-2 solutions and upcoming upgrades supporting medium- to long-term growth. Solana's speed and low fees position it for potential breakout momentum in the coming months.

Amid this landscape, MAGACOIN FINANCE emerges as a notable Ethereum-based token. Analysts believe it is well-positioned to benefit from evolving rules and market confidence, making it a project to watch alongside these established blockchains in 2025.

The world of Digital Asset Treasury (DATs) has entered a new era, after Strive (ASST) announced an all-stock deal to acquire Semler Scientific (SMLR) this week. 

The deal marked the first merger of two publicly traded bitcoin treasuries, and according to a Wall Street banker familiar with the situation, this is just the start of a massive consolidation wave among the DATs.  

The banker, who opted to remain anonymous, outlined three scenarios for how DATS may evolve.

The first of the three paths is the DAT-to-DAT mergers. 

Strive's acquisition of Semler is the first clear example of unifying BTC holdings, boosting bitcoin per share, and establishing governance under one roof, the banker said.

When it closes, the deal will create a new company that will hold nearly 11,000 BTC after Strive's simultaneous $675 million purchase of 5,885 coins.

It's worth noting that Semler's shares had been trading below the value of its bitcoin, effectively assigning negative value to its medical device business. For Strive, the acquisition consolidates balance sheets, adds BTC scale, and pushes forward a key company metric: Bitcoin per share.

“Strive's merger announcement is accretive in bitcoin per share, meeting our short-term goal,” CEO Matt Cole wrote on X. 

“We believe the combined power of the entities will give the combined company more ability to access the capital markets in a way that will drive increased bitcoin per share and accretion in a way neither could do on their own.”

With the bitcoin treasury market being saturated with many publicly traded companies, this strategy is likely to be one of the most efficient ways to grow for the DATs. 

The banker said the second path of evolution is acquiring cash-flowing businesses to offset dilution and fund ongoing BTC purchases. 

Metaplanet, Japan's largest bitcoin holder, has already said it will use its treasury to buy cash-generating businesses as part of its “phase two” strategy. 

Metaplanet is also exploring the use of perpetual preferred stock, a financing strategy that Strategy (MSTR) has already employed, allowing it to buy bitcoin without diluting shareholders through at-the-market (ATM) common stock offerings.

Third, is merging with legitimate businesses instead of using special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), according to the banker. 

SPACs are shell firms designed to take companies public quickly, but the “de-SPAC” process can be messy, requiring shareholder votes, regulatory filings, and often suffering from investor redemptions. Making things more complex, to bridge funding gaps, many SPACs rely on PIPEs (private investments in public equity), which bring dilution, discounts and uncertainty. 

For DATs, merging directly with a company that already has operations and governance avoids these pitfalls. 

The bottom line is that DATs are at a point where they need to evolve and get creative with their growth strategies. 

In fact, other companies are already catching on to this trend. Recently, FRNT Financial (TSXV: FRNT), a digital asset investment bank, said it has entered into a consulting agreement with an undisclosed DAT with $100 million worth of digital assets in its balance sheet. 

According to the deal terms, FRNT will help evaluate and structure lending opportunities for the company's next growth phase. 

The deals, such as the Strive-Semler merger, show digital asset treasury companies will need to scale through consolidation, buy profitable businesses, or align with established operators that bring legitimacy, ushering in the next phase of DATs' evolution.

The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with a new wave of innovation, as artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly converges with blockchain technology. This powerful synergy is giving rise to a new generation of presale cryptos that promise not just speculative gains, but tangible utility and groundbreaking features. Among the projects capturing significant attention for their innovative AI-based functionalities and potential for high returns on investment (ROI), Lyno AI, Ozak AI, and Layer Brett are standing out as frontrunners, signaling a shift towards more intelligent and integrated blockchain solutions.

As of late September 2025, these projects are not merely riding the AI hype train; they are building robust ecosystems designed to solve real-world problems and enhance the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Their presales have garnered substantial investor interest, reflecting a growing market appetite for projects that blend cutting-edge AI capabilities with core blockchain principles. This article delves into the unique offerings of each, exploring what makes them compelling investment opportunities in the rapidly evolving crypto space.

The ascent of Lyno AI, Ozak AI, and Layer Brett in the presale market is directly attributable to their distinct approaches to integrating AI and blockchain, each targeting specific niches within the broader digital economy.

Lyno AI positions itself as a formidable player in the DeFi sector, specifically revolutionizing cross-chain arbitrage. Its core innovation lies in the deployment of autonomous machine-learning algorithms and AI-powered trading robots that meticulously scan over 15 blockchains in real-time. This sophisticated system allows Lyno AI to swiftly identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities within milliseconds, a domain traditionally monopolized by institutional giants. By making institutional-level arbitrage accessible to retail investors, Lyno AI aims to democratize a lucrative segment of the market. Furthermore, the platform provides real-time AI-powered trading insights, offers staking rewards, incorporates governance features for token holders, and implements a deflationary buy-and-burn mechanism for its $LYNO token. The project's commitment to security is underscored by audited smart contracts by Cyberscope, bolstering investor confidence during its presale phase which has already seen significant traction and funds raised.

Ozak AI is carving out its niche at the intersection of AI and blockchain by focusing on utility and real-world applications. Central to its ecosystem are AI-powered prediction agents designed to analyze vast data streams, detect real-time market opportunities, and empower users with more accurate trading decisions. Ozak AI is not just about theoretical concepts; it aims to deliver decentralized applications (dApps) with practical use cases. Its strategic partnerships are a testament to its ambition, collaborating with large-scale AI ecosystems such as Perceptron Network (for data access from 700,000+ nodes), HIVE (for ultra-fast 30ms market signals), and SINT (for AI-driven cross-chain bridges and voice interfaces). The $OZ token is integral to this utility-driven ecosystem, powering governance, rewards, and access to AI tools, ensuring its demand extends beyond mere speculation. The presale has attracted substantial investment, including from significant "whale" investors, signaling strong belief in its long-term potential.

Layer Brett (LBRETT) presents a unique hybrid model, blending the viral appeal of meme culture with robust Ethereum (ETH) Layer 2 scalability. While many meme coins lack inherent utility, Layer Brett introduces technical purpose, staking mechanics, and interoperability features. Leveraging Ethereum Layer 2 technology, it aims to provide low-cost, high-speed transactions, targeting up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with gas fees as low as $0.0001, directly addressing Ethereum's persistent scalability and cost issues. The project fosters community engagement through gamified staking rewards and NFT integrations, offering high APYs to early adopters. With plans for cross-chain interoperability, transparent tokenomics (a capped supply of 10 billion $LBRETT tokens), and community-driven governance, Layer Brett is often hailed as a "Dogecoin Killer" due to its superior technical infrastructure and utility. Its presale success has been notable, surpassing $1.8 million and reportedly reaching between $2.9 million and $3.9 million by late September 2025, driven by both retail and institutional interest.

The emergence and potential success of Lyno AI, Ozak AI, and Layer Brett could significantly reshape various segments of the financial and cryptocurrency markets, creating clear winners and losers.

 Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov said that French intelligence pressured Telegram into censoring political content, which he refused to do. 

Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov claimed that French intelligence services asked him to censor content related to the election in Moldova in 2024 in exchange for saying “good things” to the judge overseeing his trial, which he declined to do.

Durov said the messaging platform initially took down some posts that “clearly” violated Telegram's terms of service, but declined to remove any additional content for political reasons. Durov wrote in a Sunday Telegram post:

Their only commonality was that they voiced political positions disliked by the French and Moldovan governments. We refused to act on this request,” he continued.

The crypto industry rallied behind Durov following his August 2024 arrest in France, and the related developments in his ongoing case, as the battle for free speech between tech platforms and state governments attempting to impose censorship polices unfolds.

In May 2025, Durov pointed to a previous incident in which French intelligence services pressured Telegram into censoring Romanian election content, which he also declined to do.

"You can't 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can't 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don't,” he wrote. 

Following his 2024 arrest, which drew widespread condemnation from the crypto community and human rights activists, he became highly critical of the French government and the direction of the European Union.

France is inching toward societal collapse due to state censorship and the failed policies of the current government, he warned in June.

He also stated that Telegram will exit jurisdictions, including France, before compromising user privacy by handing over encryption keys or building a backdoor into the messaging platform for state surveillance.

Durov's repeated warnings about state-led attacks against online free speech and privacy came to a head in 2025, when an EU proposal to monitor all chat messages, including encrypted user communications, gained support from 19 member nations of the EU.

Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, recently expressed her preference for Bitcoin over Ethereum during an interview with Wilfred Frost on the Master Investor podcast. Wood discussed her outlook on the cryptocurrency space, emphasizing that Bitcoin is likely to dominate in the long term. She outlined her views on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, clearly indicating why she believes Bitcoin has a superior role.

Wood argued that Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency and will remain the most significant one.

 “Bitcoin owns the cryptocurrency space when it comes to pure crypto. Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency,” she said.

She also emphasized that Bitcoin would remain “by far” the largest cryptocurrency moving forward.

According to Wood, Bitcoin stands out as a “monetary system built on rules” with a capped supply of 21 million units. As of now, nearly 20 million Bitcoins are already in circulation. Wood's confidence in Bitcoin stems from its scarcity, transparency, and established presence in the market.



She contrasted Bitcoin with stablecoins, calling them cryptocurrencies that rely on collateral, mainly Treasury securities. Stablecoins, such as Tether and USDC, are tied to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. While they have a place in decentralized finance (DeFi), Wood believes they are secondary to Bitcoin in terms of overall impact.

Wood acknowledged that stablecoins have impacted Bitcoin's demand to some extent. However, she pointed out that stablecoins provide higher returns compared to traditional banking systems.

“Lending out stablecoins allows for returns that banks can never offer,” she explained.

She believes that DeFi has improved transparency, offering a safer alternative to traditional financial systems.

In her view, blockchain technology has removed middlemen and reduced transaction costs. She highlighted that transaction fees could fall to 1% or less, compared to the high costs of traditional remittances. She also stressed that DeFi has allowed individuals excluded from the traditional banking system to access loans and earn income.

Despite this, Wood emphasized that Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto space. It is not just a store of value; Bitcoin also serves as a robust layer-one blockchain technology. This belief separates Wood's outlook from others in the space, such as Tom Lee, who has suggested that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in value and influence.

Wood disagreed with the notion that Ethereum could surpass Bitcoin in the near future. She noted that Bitcoin serves three distinct roles: a global monetary system, a decentralized technology, and the pioneer in the cryptocurrency market.

“Bitcoin is the first of its kind in a new asset class,” she stated.

She acknowledged Ethereum's importance in DeFi but reaffirmed Bitcoin's central position. According to Wood, Ethereum plays a crucial role in the DeFi ecosystem as its native currency. However, she cautioned that the increasing number of layer-two solutions might lead to fragmentation, undermining Ethereum's dominance.

Wood also highlighted ARK Invest's Bitcoin holdings, confirming that the firm maintains exposure to both Bitcoin and Ether. However, she clarified that her firm's focus remains on Bitcoin's long-term potential.

Analysts mapped a slow-grind path for bitcoin and flagged $112,000 as the trigger while gold advocate Peter Schiff revived the gold-versus-bitcoin debate by challenging Michael Saylor's BTC treasury bet for his firm.

CoinDesk Senior Analyst James van Straten said bitcoin's market structure has shifted alongside gold's repricing. 

He expects a slow, stair-step advance supported by steady ETF inflows, with 10–20% pullbacks along the way. He compared the setup to gold in the early 2000s, when prices climbed for years but often paused for healthy corrections. 

In his framing, bitcoin may sometimes lag gold and sometimes outperform it, yet he still sees bitcoin leading on total returns over a full cycle.

Michaël van de Poppe focused on near-term levels. 

He called sub-$107,000 a buy zone, signaling where he thinks dip buyers are likely to step in. He also pointed to $112,000 as the ceiling to beat. A clean break and hold above $112,000 on UTC closes would, in his view, confirm strength and broaden risk appetite, the point at which flows often rotate into large altcoins. That is what he means by “altcoin mode.”

Euro Capital CEO Peter Schiff, meanwhile, challenged Michael Saylor's strategy by contrasting Strategy's bitcoin exposure with a hypothetical gold program. 

His core claim is liquidity. He argued that tens of billions of dollars in gold could be sold with limited market impact, while trying to exit a similar bitcoin position could hit prices hard and set off copycat selling. 

Supporters of bitcoin would counter that any large seller could stage exits over time and use over-the-counter channels, but Schiff's point is that gold's market depth offers more flexibility to very large holders.

Home - Crypto Presales - Crypto News: Dogecoin Price Plummets Despite ETF, Experts Back A New 1000x Meme Coin

Recent crypto news reveals a puzzling trend: Dogecoin price continues to struggle despite mounting ETF speculation, while blockchain experts increasingly point toward next-generation alternatives. Layer Brett is pulling in funds, combining the viral appeal of memecoins with genuine Layer 2 utility. This shift highlights a fundamental question plaguing the meme coin space: can outdated technology survive in an era demanding speed and scalability?

Dogecoin has become an old car that everyone loves but can't handle modern highways. While DOGE trades between $0.21-$0.24 with institutional interest growing, its underlying technology remains frozen in time. The network processes transactions like a dial-up internet connection in a fiber optic world. When crypto markets face massive volatility—like the recent $1.5 billion liquidation event—DOGE‘s infrastructure simply can't adapt quickly enough.

The real problem isn't just speed, either. Dogecoin price movements show classic signs of a token trapped by its own limitations. Even with ETF hype building momentum, DOGE struggles because it lacks fundamental blockchain improvements that modern investors expect. Smart contracts, staking rewards, and low gas fees aren't luxury features anymore—they're basic requirements.











Layer Brett represents everything Dogecoin could have become with modern technology. Built on Ethereum Layer 2 infrastructure, this memecoin processes transactions at lightning speed while maintaining rock-bottom fees. The $LBRETT presale has already raised almost $4.1 million, proving that investors understand superior technology when they see it.

The technical advantages become obvious during market stress. While DOGE networks bog down during high-volume periods, Layer Brett‘s infrastructure scales seamlessly. The project offers over 620% staking APY, turning passive holding into active earning. This is about creating an entire ecosystem where meme culture meets cutting-edge blockchain solutions.











Smart money follows innovation, and crypto news increasingly reflects this migration pattern. DOGE holders who experienced years of technological stagnation now discover what modern memecoin infrastructure can deliver. Layer Brett‘s rapidly growing social media presence demonstrates genuine community excitement rather than artificial hype.

The $1 million giveaway campaign proves how Layer Brett rewards its community beyond simple price appreciation. While Dogecoin price action depends entirely on external factors like ETF approval, $LBRETT holders benefit from staking rewards, governance participation, and ecosystem growth. This community-first approach builds sustainable value rather than relying on celebrity tweets or market manipulation.

Layer Brett solves Ethereum's notorious gas fee problem while maintaining full security and decentralization. Unlike DOGE‘s single-purpose design, this Layer 2 blockchain supports smart contracts, DeFi integration, and cross-chain functionality. Comparison reveals it as a Swiss Army knife compared to Dogecoin's simple bottle opener. The presale offers early access to an ecosystem built for actual utility rather than speculation alone.

The project's roadmap extends far beyond typical meme token ambitions. Layer Brett plans NFT integration, gamified staking, and interoperability features that create genuine use cases. While Dogecoin price remains trapped by its technological limitations, $LBRETT positioning targets real-world blockchain problems.

As such, Layer Brett represents the natural evolution of meme culture meeting blockchain innovation. While DOGE struggles with fundamental technological constraints despite ETF speculation, this next-generation Layer 2 solution delivers the speed, utility, and community engagement that modern crypto demands.

Fundstrat's Tom Lee has praised Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood for her early conviction in Bitcoin, calling her foresight one of the most important endorsements the asset has received from traditional finance.

He argued that Wood's long-standing commitment to Bitcoin helped validate it as more than a speculative play and paved the way for institutional adoption.

According to Lee, Wood recognized Bitcoin's potential when most of Wall Street dismissed it outright, and that ability to see ahead of the curve remains central to her influence. “She had foresight on Bitcoin when others ignored it,” Lee said, stressing that her confidence gave legitimacy to a still-controversial asset class.

Lee now sees Wood's outlook gradually expanding to Ethereum. Her recent comments about “warming up” to ETH, combined with new investments in ETH-focused infrastructure such as BitMine, suggest a broader view of the crypto ecosystem.

While Wood continues to frame Bitcoin as the ultimate rules-based monetary system and highlight its security record, she appears increasingly open to Ethereum's role in powering decentralized finance and blockchain applications.

For Lee, this evolution is significant. He argued that Wood's ability to frame Bitcoin as digital money, while at the same time acknowledging Ethereum's utility as an innovation platform, could help push traditional investors toward a more balanced perspective.

The combination of Bitcoin as a store of value and Ethereum as a programmable network, he noted, reflects how institutions are beginning to view the space as a whole.

“Cathie saw Bitcoin before almost anyone else,” Lee said. “And I think she'll continue to grow more supportive of Ethereum as its ecosystem matures.”







According to a detailed weekly report by Wu Blockchain, the past few days have been packed with ecosystem developments across major blockchain projects.

Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has reshuffled his altcoin portfolio, citing underperformance in some large-cap holdings and growing momentum in smaller-cap tokens.

Stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle are profiting from the current high-interest rate environment while stablecoin holders see none of the returns, said Wormhole's co-founder, Dan Reecer, at Mercado Bitcoin's DAC 2025 event.

Speaking as a panelist, he said the companies are effectively “printing money” by keeping the yield from the U.S. Treasuries backing their tokens. Tether, for example, reported $4.9 billion in net profit in the second quarter of the year. That has seen the company's valuation soar to a reported $500 billion in a new funding round.

As interest rates remain elevated, Reecer suggested it's only a matter of time before users expect a share of that yield or move their funds elsewhere.

Platforms like M^0 and Agora are already responding to that demand, he suggested. These projects allow stablecoin infrastructure to be built in a way that routes yield to applications or directly to end users, instead of the issuer capturing all of it.

“If I'm holding USDC, I'm losing money, losing money that Circle is making,” Reecer said in the session, referring to the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding token that's backed by U.S. Treasuries generating income.

Tether and Circle likely do not share the yield generated from their stablecoins directly with users as doing so could draw the ire of regulators. An alternative that's steadily growing are money market funds, which allow investors to gain exposure to the yield behind these stablecoins.

Circle, it's worth noting, acquired Hashnote earlier this year for $1.3 billion, the issuer of the tokenized money market fund USYC. With this acquisition, Circle aims to enable convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains.

These money market funds, however, are still a fraction of the stablecoin market. According to RWA.xyz data, their market capitalization currently stands around $7.3 billion, while the global stablecoin market has topped $290 billion.

A Tether spokesperson told CoinDesk that “USDT's role is clear: it is a digital dollar, not an investment product.” He added that “hundreds of millions of people” rely on USDT, especially in emerging markets, “where it serves as a lifeline against inflation, banking instability, and capital controls.”

“While few percentage points might make the difference for rich Americans or Europeans, the real savings for our USDT user base is the one against dramatic inflation so common in developing countries - often reaching numbers as high as 50% to 90% year-over-year, with declines of local currency values against the US dollar at 70% year-over-year,” he said.

“Passing along yield would fundamentally change a stablecoin's nature, risk profile, and regulatory treatment,” the spokesperson added. “Competitors experimenting with yield-bearing stablecoins are targeting a completely different audience, and they take on additional risks.”

Fireblocks' Stephen Richardson, during the panel, said the broader stablecoin market is meanwhile evolving toward real-world use cases, including cross-border payments and FX services.

He pointed out that tokenized money moving instantly could help solve problems that exist today, such as slow corporate payment rails or expensive remittances. Financial innovation, Richardson added, is already being seen in the sector, with an example being tokenized money market funds that are being used as collateral on exchanges.

The UN has released a white paper praising the effects of blockchain technology in its pension fund system. 

Blockchain technology has steadily helped companies and organizations to improve transparency, cut costs, and reduce fraud in areas like finance, supply chains, and healthcare. Now, the United Nations is taking steps to integrate the technology more deeply into its operations after testing it within its pension system.

The United Nations stated that blockchain technology is a key tool for its digital transformation and inclusive governance strategy after a successful trial in its pension fund system.

A new white paper released by the global body concluded that blockchain provides “the ultimate technology for digital identity verification,” with the potential for the UN to now scale the technology across its agencies and promote it as a global digital public good.

The project is centered on the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund (UNJSPF), which manages retirement benefits for staff across the UN system. For decades, the pension fund has operated using a manual, paper-based process that required beneficiaries to prove their identity and confirm they are still alive.

With more than 70,000 beneficiaries in 190 countries, the system was slow, costly, and vulnerable to fraud. The reliance on physical documents often led to errors, delays, and even suspensions. It also led to around 1,400 pension payments being paused each year because of verification problems.

To address these challenges, the UN decided to utilize blockchain in partnership with the Hyperledger Foundation. The initiative was launched first in 2020, and then there was a larger rollout in 2021 when the pension fund moved to a digital certification system built on blockchain.

The white paper described the old pension system as “a 70-year-old process prone to error and abuse.”

Every year, the fund had to manage paper forms from tens of thousands of retirees worldwide. Staff spent hours receiving, opening, scanning, and archiving documents, and all these steps introduced opportunities for mistakes or delays.

According to the report, this change to blockchain technology improved efficiency and transparency. Beneficiaries could confirm their status digitally, while the fund gained greater confidence with fewer weak points in the system to be exploited.

“The shift away from physical documentation has substantially reduced processing times,” the UN report's authors noted. They referred to how blockchain allowed beneficiaries to securely verify their identity and status without mailing or submitting physical paperwork, cutting down on processing times and making the system more resilient, while also eliminating repetitive checks and the risk of duplicate data entry.

The United Nation is now exploring ways to adapt the Digital Certificate of Entitlement model, which is the blockchain-based identity verification system, across its agencies and potentially share it with other international groups.

Sameer Chauhan, the director of the United Nations International Computing Centre, wrote in the paper's conclusion that the project provided not only a technical solution but also “an operational model for how organizations across the UN family can collaborate to design secure, scalable, and inclusive digital public infrastructure.”

The crypto mining sector is reportedly worth $2.75 billion, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% until 2035. Mining plays a crucial role in both securing Proof-of-Work networks and fairly distributing tokens to holders – and so it's unsurprising that some of the biggest Bitcoin mining firms are worth billions of dollars.

However, the corporatization of crypto mining has changed everything – it's no longer indi miners validating Bitcoin transactions from their gaming laptops, as in the Satoshi era. Instead, publicly listed companies now absorb almost every new bitcoin using state-of-the-art ASIC rigs, funded through equity financing and convertible notes.

Retail users haven't stood a chance for years – the dream of bedroom mining crypto rewards while they sleep was long gone – until PEPENODE emerged. It's not a decentralized mining pool or anything like that; it's the world's first Mine-to-Earn meme coin, giving users full control to earn crypto rewards through a virtual mining experience

As a result, the project is generating a huge buzz among retail investors. It recently launched a presale and has just surpassed the $1.5 million raised mark, underlining its market appeal and the potential for continued demand once it hits exchanges. 

Think of PEPENODE as an on-chain mini-game where you're the owner and operator of a virtual crypto mining factory. You use the in-game currency (PEPENODE tokens) to buy and upgrade Miner Nodes, aiming to generate as much mining power as possible because that's how you earn rewards.

Users earn PEPENODE tokens proportional to the mining power they generate. Additionally, there is an in-game leaderboard that rewards top scorers with other meme coins, such as Pepe and Fartcoin, helping to broaden the project's appeal to a wider range of investors.

There's also a strategic element, as different node combinations yield varying results. It's the player's job to test setups and then scale once they've found a winning formula.



Look at other P2E games with airdrop rewards, such as Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, which launched last year – and you'll see that there are tens of millions of willing participants ready to join gamified earning opportunities. However, PEPENODE is much more entertaining than the 2D Tap-to-Earn formulas they were based on.

Another important point is that 70% of tokens spent in the PEPENODE store will be burned, meaning that a large portion of in-game spending will contribute to the project's longevity and price appreciation potential.

The more people use the game and the more they strengthen their mining rigs, the lower the supply of PEPENODE, which in turn increases its value. This could create a scarcity-driven flywheel effect, where rising prices attract more users, which in turn fuels the cycle.

But there's a caveat: like Bitcoin, PEPENODE mining favors those who get in early. Users who purchase Miner Nodes in the presale can receive the most powerful equipment, allowing them to generate greater mining power and ultimately earn higher rewards.

Given its deflationary tokenomics, which are expected to increase PEPENODE's value over time, these early-bird Miner Nodes could deliver the type of returns that transform portfolios.

And regarding the potential for PEPENODE's price gains, several respected analysts have already weighed in and forecasted explosive growth. In one recent YouTube video, Crypto Tech Gaming predicted it could see up to 100x returns once it lists on exchanges.



Another reason the PEPENODE presale is attractive is its lucrative staking rewards, currently valued at around a 900% APY. However, rewards will decrease as the staking pool grows, which is why traders are eager to buy in early.

Positioned at the crossroads of meme culture and Play-to-Earn, PEPENODE strikes a unique balance between utility and viral potential. It can attract liquidity from various sources – whether that's the Pepe community, blockchain gamers, or retail users who have been priced out of traditional crypto mining.

Of course, it's still early days, and anything can happen – but with $1.5 million already committed to the presale, PEPENODE clearly has backing from serious market participants. And considering the lucrative Mine-to-Earn and staking rewards that are also available, the outlook becomes even more promising.

Analytics platform Swissblock says one metric indicates that a local bottom is in for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins.

In a new post on X, Swissblock says the crypto market is in a reset phase based on its Aggregated Impulse metric, which measures exponential price structure across the top 350 assets.

According to the analytics firm, the metric has been a reliable bottom signal for BTC and altcoins since 2024.

“The last seven times this signal triggered since 2024, it marked a major bottom.

What happened next?

BTC rallied +20–30%

Altcoins surged +50–150%…

What's it telling us now?

22% of altcoins show negative impulse. Historically, bottoms form in the 15–25% zone. Once the reset completes, ETH & alts tend to lead the next rotation.”

Looking closer at Bitcoin, Swissblock sees consistent demand for BTC from multiple investor cohorts, while noting that sellers are losing ammunition.

“Bitcoin's range is nearing resolution.

• 10 weeks trapped in $109,000–$124,000.
• LTH (long-term holder) distribution slowing? seller exhaustion close.
• ETFs (exchange-traded funds) + treasuries persistent buyers.
• Seasonality flips bullish into Oct/Nov.
• Fed easing cycle adds tailwinds.

Swissblock Vectors show the inflection:

Bitcoin Vector: Impulse score compressing at the upper band? coiled energy.
Altcoin Vector: Breadth improving, ETH + majors rotating higher.

Key trigger: A reset through negative aggregated impulse would flush weak hands and reload the signal? clearing the path for continuation.

This deadlock is not permanent. Once supply clears, Q4 setup favors a decisive breakout in both Bitcoin and altcoins.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $109,603.

Investor sentiment in the Web3 market transitions into “fear,” as Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $110,000 for the first time in over three weeks. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) briefly dipped toward $3,800, matching its lows from early August.

A culmination of macro headwinds and a stronger US dollar has provoked more than $1 billion in crypto liquidations over the past day. But there's consensus among market observers that the recent dip is mainly sentiment-driven, rather than a byproduct of fundamental concerns.

In fact, September has historically been a relatively tough month for cryptocurrencies. That's why savvy market players are now eagerly awaiting the arrival of “Uptober” next month. Anticipating a revival across the crypto market in Q4, investors have injected over $4 million into the Snorter Token (SNORT) presale ahead of its October 20 launch.

SNORT is the native token powering Snorter Bot, an automated trading bot using Solana's technology to unlock sub-second transactions at minimal cost. With the project now in the final leg of its presale, interested investors have just over three weeks left to buy SNORT for $0.1055.

As the risk-on sentiment temporarily wanes, the US spot ETH ETFs have recorded a net outflow of over $547 million over the past week alone.

From a technical perspective, Ethereum's price fell below the psychological $4,000 support level for the first time in over a month.

The altcoin's recent dip has now turned this support level into resistance, at least in the short term.

But it's worth knowing that ETH briefly rebounded from the support level near $3,840, as bulls line up to prevent a broader sell-off.

In fact, the analytics firm Lookonchain reports that crypto whales are piling up on Ethereum. Over the past two days, whales have withdrawn 406,117 ETH (worth approximately $1.6 billion) from crypto exchanges.

Whales keep accumulating $ETH!15 wallets have received 406,117 $ETH($1.6B) from #Kraken, #GalaxyDigital, #BitGo, and #FalconX in the past 2 days.https://t.co/YXZyneFrFR pic.twitter.com/T2YDClezW9

In an earlier update, Lookonchain mentioned that 11 wallets had already picked up nearly 296,000 ETH ($1.19 billion) in just one day. This steady accumulation shows that smart investors are viewing the recent dip as an opportunity to buy ETH at a discounted price.

The rising likelihood of a full-fledged altseason is now encouraging investors to rotate their funds into small-cap tokens where the potential upside is significantly higher. They're now aggressively stockpiling Snorter Token ahead of its recently announced exchange listing date.

Snorter Token is the native token of Snorter Bot, an automated trading bot democratizing technology usually reserved for the biggest players on the market. The advantage of whales over everyday traders is one of the main reasons that the project is developing an automated trading solution, empowering its users to make quick market moves and “snipe” new cryptos in under a second.

The bot will use its proprietary technology to help investors discover and access new token launches before the broader market. It will scan through meme coin pools on Ethereum and Solana, tracking liquidity in real-time and giving its users a chance to enter at a ground-level price.

More importantly, the bot also comes loaded with industry-leading security features. During testing in its beta phase, Snorter Bot was able to effectively detect scam or rug pull projects 85% of the time.

Since Snorter Bot is built from the ground up using Solana's tech stack, it also unlocks some of the lowest fees on the market. For perspective, users who hold the SNORT tokens are eligible for a 0.85% fee per trade, a notable discount from the industry standard of 1% for a bot capable of rapid-fire trade execution.

Moreover, SNORT token holders will be able to enjoy unlimited snipes, in addition to governance and other exclusive VIP benefits. Because of its genuine value proposition within the Snorter Bot ecosystem, SNORT has successfully raised over $4 million from investors.

Analyst Chino de Dios from Crypto Tech Gaming highlights Snorter Token as one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025, praising the project's utility-led approach, along with strong community backing.

With the SNORT token presale quickly drawing to a close, de Dios predicts the project's automated trading solution, believed to already be fully developed, will drive the token's price after the October 20 listing.

Snorter Token is currently selling for just $0.1051 each, offering what may be the lowest entry point before its exchange listing. All purchased SNORT can immediately be staked for an annual yield of up to 115% even before the official listing.

Oops, something went wrong

Over the past week, Ethereum price has corrected another 10.35%, slipping under the crucial support of $4,000. Big market players and ETH whale entities see this correction as an opportunity to accumulate more. Crypto market experts also believe that the ETH bottom formation could be near, and so a reversal to the upside could follow soon.

Popular crypto analyst Lark Davis recently noted that Ethereum price has fallen 20% over the past two weeks, pushing its Relative Strength Index (RSI) into the most oversold territory since April. The last time ETH reached such levels, it went on to rally 134% within two months.

The second-largest cryptocurrency has bounced from the $3,800–$3,900 range. Davis noted that this is a key support level that ETH price must hold to maintain a bullish outlook. Market watchers suggest that if broader crypto sentiment improves in the fourth quarter, this oversold signal could pave the way for Ethereum to target the $7,000–$8,000 range.

Furthermore, popular crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that September has been a historically weak month for ETH and the crypto market. However, he still expects a good Q4 ahead, followed by a strong Q1 2026. In a message on X, Poppe wrote:

“The markets always have a correction in September / October. Historically, Q4 and Q1 are a great period for altcoins. September is a terrible month, and that's what we've seen with $ETH, it's down nearly 10%. Q4 is almost always positive, Q1 is the best quarter in the history”.

As of now, ETH is trading at $4,006. Failing to hold this crucial support could trigger a downside further to $3,600. The MVRV price bands indicate that an ETH price drop to $ 2,750 cannot be ruled out.

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that large Ethereum whales have accumulated 431,018 ETH, valued at approximately $1.73 billion, over the past three days.

The inflows were distributed across 16 wallets from major platforms, including Kraken, Galaxy Digital, BitGo, FalconX, and OKX. This signals continued accumulation by whales despite recent market volatility.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin may soon join gold as a reserve asset on central bank balance sheets, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank, as momentum builds behind efforts to reshape the global financial system.

Key Takeaways:

Deutsche Bank says Bitcoin could sit alongside gold on central bank balance sheets by 2030.

Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve plan is fueling renewed debate around institutional adoption.

Bitcoin's low correlation to traditional assets strengthens its case as a long-term store of value.

The prediction comes amid a sharp uptick in geopolitical and monetary shifts, with Bitcoin and gold both seeing renewed demand.

Marion Laboure, research analyst at Deutsche Bank's Research Institute, said the Trump administration's decision to create a US strategic Bitcoin reserve earlier this year “reignites the argument for central banks to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset.”

In a note seen by CNBC, she added: “We conclude there is room for both gold and Bitcoin to coexist on central bank balance sheets by 2030.”

The price of Bitcoin surged to over $124,000 last month before retreating, as traders digest U.S. monetary policy moves and brace for further volatility ahead of the 2026 election cycle.

Meanwhile, gold has surged to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, pushing its market cap past $25 trillion. Bitcoin's market capitalization currently stands above $2.3 trillion.

The Trump administration's March executive order calling for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve marked a major policy shift.

While details remain limited, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the government is committed to “budget-neutral pathways” to build the reserve.

“The Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government is the foundation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve,” Bessent said.

The idea of adding Bitcoin to central bank reserves mirrors past strategies involving gold.

A recent Federal Reserve research note highlighted that revaluing US gold holdings could increase their book value from $11 billion to $750 billion, a precedent that could be extended to crypto.

Laboure noted that Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets gives it similar store-of-value characteristics as gold, making it appealing to institutions.

“Bitcoin also has the potential to provide both an investment and a consumer-good value,” she wrote. “This explains why when equities rally strongly, their correlation to Bitcoin can rise.”

Hex Trust CEO Alessio Quaglini believes US banks are on the verge of mainstreaming Bitcoin, pending regulatory clarity.

He predicts that within months, most American banks will offer custody, trading, and deposit services for Bitcoin, calling U.S. regulation the “global benchmark” for institutional adoption.

Founded in 2018, Hex Trust provides crypto custody, trading, lending, and staking services to institutions across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

With over 200 employees and a million end users via B2B deals, the firm is targeting $20 million in revenue by 2025 and considering a future IPO.

Quaglini also sees stablecoins as a disruptive force, potentially replacing the SWIFT system for cross-border payments.

Unlike US-listed crypto companies that rely on retail trading, Hex Trust's strategy focuses on providing infrastructure for institutions and avoiding direct exposure to crypto market volatility.

Oops, something went wrong

Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, is stepping up its presence on the continent by joining the African Blockchain Summit as a platinum sponsor. Through this sponsorship, the exchange will likely expand its reach as more people consider the exchange. This is not the first time Binance is sponsoring a crypto event. In the past, the exchange sponsored a crypto conference in Kenya.

Meanwhile, South African fund manager Syngnia Limited has urged diversification in Bitcoin investments. Bitcoin is a premier crypto exchange and is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy. Public firms, especially in Europe, North America, and Japan, have bought BTC, adding the crypto to their balance sheets.

In South Africa, the country's tax agency has warned crypto traders against failing to declare crypto income. The country has made huge strides in crypto regulation and is among the continent's top adopters, boasting clear laws supportive of the industry.

Let's look at these stories making continental headlines this week:

Global exchange giant Binance will be a platinum sponsor of the Africa Fintech Summit 2025, which will be held in Accra from October 8 to 10, 2025.

Binance has increased its profile on continental conferences, regulatory engagement, and more. Larry Cooke of Binance Africa spoke on the sponsorship as follows:

“Africa is a continent of immense opportunity, and we are committed to supporting its growth through innovation, education, and regulatory collaboration. From expanding trading networks to engaging with policymakers on frameworks like Kenya's VASP Bill, and our recent visit to Ghana to meet with key policy makers, Binance is focused on helping African businesses and users transact safely, efficiently, and transparently.”

The Africa Fintech Summit aims to bring together fintech and crypto leaders on the continent. It will feature speakers, forums, and workshops to advance crypto entrepreneurship on the continent.

Syngnia Limited has urged investors in its Bitcoin ETF to avoid going all-in on Bitcoin investments. This advisory comes even as Bitcoin enjoys a record bull run, with prices well over $100,000 for months on end.

The advisory stems from Bitcoin's enduring volatility. However, many Bitcoin bulls would give the exact opposite argument, given the ridiculous gains made over the past two years.

Nonetheless, advice for diversification is great, especially for investors who use retirement funds and vulnerable groups who cannot afford to lose too much.

Sygnia is a traditional investment firm that takes a cautious stance on crypto. However, the fact that their ETFs now provide exposure to Bitcoin is an acknowledgement of Bitcoin's inevitability in financial markets.

The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is reportedly going after crypto owners failing to declare their crypto gains. This stance, even as the actual status of cryptos within the South African monetary system is being litigated in courts.

SARS has broad powers, ranging from audits to criminal charges against individuals suspected of tax evasion. These measures could soon be directed at crypto owners who fail to declare and remit taxes on their gains.

Governments globally have an incentive to pursue crypto taxes because of the sector's increasing revenue potential. The blockchain operates outside traditional banking channels, and it may be challenging to track all assets and gains owned by individuals.

However, crypto owners, including those with large chunks of top Solana meme coins, must contemplate regulations in this direction as the industry grows larger.

 Learn how option expiries in Bitcoin and Ether derivatives markets can cause price swings that catch inexperienced traders off guard. 

Options expiry creates volatility as traders lock profits, cut losses and reposition around large BTC and ETH contracts.

Put-call ratios signal sentiment: Above 1 shows a bearish outlook, while below 1 points to bullish expectations.

Max Pain theory suggests expiry prices gravitate to where the most contracts expire worthless, amplifying potential manipulation risks.Understanding expiry helps traders track key metrics, anticipate volatility and manage risk more effectively during these periods.

To most people, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) market prices can seem unpredictable. But look closer, and there's a hidden force driving the infamous volatility: options expiries.

When large volumes of these derivative options contracts approach their expiry date, it sends ripples through the crypto markets. Understand this, and you'll know when prices are more likely to move sharply.

To understand option expiries, you first need to understand the fundamental concept of an option. It's a more complicated trading method than spot trading.

Options are contracts that give the holders the right (not the obligation) to buy or sell BTC or ETH at a predetermined strike price before the contract expires.

Now, as a contract approaches expiry, it affects the price at which this contract option can trade. Near its expiry, its price tends to become more volatile.

When large amounts of options contracts are due to reach expiry at a similar time, it can send ripples through the traditional spot BTC and ETH markets, causing the underlying asset prices to make sharp moves.

Call options give the holder the right to buy, and put options offer the right to sell an asset for a specified price before it expires.

The balance between calls and puts delivers an indicator of the overall market sentiment. They essentially show future bets on where the market thinks prices will move. And if one outweighs the other, it can influence directional pressure on prices.

Along with the expiry date, a contract also has a strike price and a premium. These three key elements directly determine profitability, along with offering a mathematical framework that reflects expiry-related price movements.

Did you know? Unlike traditional markets, BTC options don't run on fully standardized schedules. They can occur across multiple timeframes, but most commonly, they expire on the last Friday of every month at 08:00 UTC.

Let's start with an example. If $5 billion worth of options contracts expire simultaneously, even a small percentage of these contracts being exercised or hedged could move the entire market.

Remember, option traders have the option to execute a contract. So, the full $5 billion in crypto wouldn't be sold or bought necessarily.

When there is a large upcoming option expiry date on the market, you're likely to see increased trading activity. It triggers heightened market activity as traders reposition, creating a surge in volume. This concentrated time window of trading amplifies price swings beyond normal market conditions.

When analyzing markets, you can see a clear correlation between option expiries and crypto price fluctuations. When it comes to BTC and ETH, you will be able to spot significant changes in market prices.

For example, if you look at the BTC volatility index, an event in June 2021 saw over $4 billion in BTC and ETH options set to expire. This led to a 5.80% increase in the volatility index on June 14, the highest peak in the last five years.

With BTC, the quarterly options expiries usually have a more pronounced impact on the market compared to the monthly expiries. Patterns like this help you understand which expiry events will create the most volatility and require attention in your trading.Did you know? The world's first options exchange for any type of asset was the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which opened in 1973, decades before BTC launched.

When expiries approach, trading volatility increases as traders close positions to lock in profits or reduce losses. This creates a feedback loop that triggers further position adjustments and amplifies the volatility.

To get a better temperature on which way the market is likely to move, you can use put-call ratios. They're a useful sentiment indicator that shows insight into institutional and retail sentiment.

When the ratio is above 1, it indicates more bearish bets, while ratios below 1 tend to be more bullish, indicating potential price rises.

Max pain theory is like a tug of war in the options markets.

An option buyer wants the stock to move in their direction. Option sellers want the opposite. The max pain is the price where the most options would expire worthless.

This is important, as large market participants and whales might attempt to push crypto prices toward the max pain point, influencing the price as they move closer to expiration dates.

It indicates shorter-term price movements while also locating potential support and resistance levels.

Savvy traders might also look past expiry dates. If there is evidence of extreme put-call ratios, this could signal that a potential market reversal is on the cards. If you start to see ratios hit historical extremes, it could mean that asset prices are oversold or overbought. This increases the chances of a reversal after expiry.Did you know? In August 2025, the world's largest options exchange, Deribit, processed over $14.6 billion in BTC and ETH options expiry contracts. It marks the highest single expiry notional on record for digital assets in 2025.

Option expiries can send cascading ripples through the BTC and ETH markets. They can have a direct effect on the underlying asset price as traders look to reposition. So, how can you manage these events?

Monitor key metrics: Track open interest, put-call ratios and max pain to gain early warning signals for volatility and directional bias.

Position hedging: You can use options to protect your spot positions during high volatility expiry periods. A hedge can limit the downside while retaining upside opportunity. This could be critical when prices move 5% or 10% in hours.

Diversification: It's often recommended to spread risk across multiple assets and timeframes. This will minimize realized losses during expiry events. High single asset concentration over a short period can leave you exposed to major expiries.

Time considerations: Marking key dates can help you prepare, avoid losses and capitalize on volatile periods.

Use advanced tools: Advanced data analysis platforms like CoinGlass and CME Group calendars provide insights into options markets. The real-time data can give you a crucial edge over simple spot traders.

Volume and liquidity: Understanding trading volume patterns along with liquidity can help you manage risk as expiry approaches. It'll help you determine when liquidity typically dries up.

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are no longer theoretical. From the Bahamas' Sand Dollar to Jamaica's Jam-Dex, and Nigeria's eNaira to India's e-Rupee, countries of the Global South are experimenting with new forms of digital money. 

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are no longer theoretical. From the Bahamas' Sand Dollar to Jamaica's Jam-Dex, and Nigeria's eNaira to India's e-Rupee, countries of the Global South are experimenting with new forms of digital money. Among them, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pilot has attracted particular attention. By March 2025, more than 6 million users and 420,000 merchants had tried the e-Rupee, with circulation rising 334% in a year to $122 million—making it the second-largest CBDC pilot globally (Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker, 2025). Yet, beneath the numbers lies a paradox: while India is a pioneer in CBDC policy, mass adoption in retail has lagged behind its wildly successful Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which already processes billions of transactions monthly (BIS, 2024).

For the Global South, where financial exclusion and patchy digital infrastructure remain pressing challenges, India's journey is less about competing with existing systems and more about finding unique value propositions.

A snapshot of official Reserve Bank of India data illustrates this dynamic. Total e₹ in circulation rose from ₹16.4 crore in March 2023 to ₹234.1 crore in March 2024 and is projected to reach ₹1,016.5 crore by March 2025—a nearly 62-fold increase in two years. Retail CBDC (e₹-R) drives this surge, while wholesale CBDC stagnates. Usage has shifted toward higher denominations: by 2024, the ₹500 note made up 70.2% of retail circulation, projected to rise to 84.4% in 2025. By volume, smaller denominations dominated early use, but by 2025 the ₹500 unit is expected to account for more than a third of all pieces in circulation. This reflects how the e-rupee has moved beyond small-value transactions to become a common instrument for larger, everyday payments.

Beyond Payments: Policy Precision and Inclusion

The real promise of the e-rupee has not been as another payment option but as a tool for targeted policy delivery. India's Subhadra Yojana welfare program in Odisha used programmable e-Rupee wallets to transfer benefits directly to 88,000 women, ensuring funds were spent as intended (Economic Times, 2024). For countries with high leakage in subsidy schemes, this case illustrates CBDC's potential as a “precision instrument” for social impact.

Another breakthrough lies in offline capabilities. With 65% of rural Indians still relying on cash due to weak connectivity (PwC India, 2024), RBI is testing offline CBDC solutions. This matters for other Global South nations, where digital divides appear similar. CBDCs must first demonstrate their ability to replace cash before competing with advanced instant payment systems. As RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das put it, “The biggest potential for CBDC going forward will be cross-border money transfer” (Economic Times, 2023). He also spoke of “offline functionality in CBDC-R for areas with poor or limited internet connectivity” (Times of India, 2024). These comments show India's CBDC vision is both ambitious and pragmatic, balancing long-term cross-border goals with immediate domestic needs.

The Trust Paradox

Public perception in India shows both high trust and high fear: 85% awareness of CBDCs, but over 70% cite cybersecurity concerns, and 44% worry about government surveillance (Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management, 2024). This underlines a universal truth: trust is the currency of CBDCs. Legal frameworks on privacy and data governance must be built before scaling; otherwise, adoption risks stagnation.

Experiences from other Global South nations reinforce this point. In Nigeria, despite an early launch of the eNaira in 2021, adoption has been extremely low—less than 1% of the population use it regularly—due to poor awareness campaigns, distrust of government, and the dominance of mobile money (IMF, 2023).

Indonesia offers another cautionary tale: in 2025, public trust was shaken when the Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (PPATK), Indonesia's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing agency and the key watchdog of financial transactions often seen as the spearhead of state surveillance, froze thousands of dormant bank accounts, citing links to terrorism financing and online gambling. The move triggered widespread anxiety and even small-scale bank runs, reinforcing suspicion toward centralized oversight. This perception matters for future CBDC adoption: if PPATK's role is not clearly delimited and transparently communicated, citizens may see CBDCs as another layer of state surveillance, rather than an instrument of inclusion.

Beyond surveillance concerns, another key challenge is shifting public perception so that CBDCs are not conflated with cryptocurrencies, which in many contexts of the South are associated with speculation, gambling, and high risk. Building a clear narrative that CBDCs are fundamentally different—state-backed, stable, and designed for inclusion—will be critical to avoid confusion and skepticism.

For Global South nations, the lesson is clear—beyond regulation, strong grassroots outreach is essential. That outreach cannot rely on conventional top-down communication alone; it must involve informal leaders, community networks, and culturally resonant campaigns. Storytelling-based communication, gamified financial literacy programs, and trusted local figures—teachers, religious leaders, and cooperatives—can all play a role. Examples from other contexts strengthen this point: in Kenya, mobile money literacy campaigns relied on church groups and women's savings collectives; in Brazil, digital inclusion initiatives leveraged football clubs and community radio to reach the unbanked. Pilots should begin with small but highly visible interventions—such as targeted subsidy disbursements or government aid—that build confidence from the bottom up. Building trust at the ground level is as important as building secure code at the top, and only by combining both can CBDCs achieve meaningful adoption.

Other Southern Experiments

The Bahamas stands as a global pioneer in retail CBDCs, launching the Sand Dollar nationally in October 2020. With over 700 islands, the country faced extremely high costs and logistical difficulties in distributing physical cash, especially in the aftermath of hurricanes that crippled banking infrastructure. The Sand Dollar was designed to provide reliable access to financial services for residents in remote islands and to strengthen resilience. Adoption challenges remain, but the initiative is recognized as a milestone and learning model for others.

Jamaica followed with the launch of Jam-Dex in mid-2022. The government offered an initial incentive of about US$16 to the first 100,000 citizens who opened Jam-Dex wallets (Bank of Jamaica, 2022; IMF, 2023). While this spurred some early interest, sustained adoption has been weak. Public misunderstanding, limited merchant acceptance, and a persistent preference for cash or existing digital payment options have slowed traction. The Jamaican case underlines that incentives alone cannot ensure lasting adoption without deeper trust, usability, and ecosystem readiness.

A Playbook for the South

One practical entry point for CBDC adoption in the Global South is starting with social assistance programs. By channeling government subsidies or welfare transfers through CBDC wallets, authorities can demonstrate tangible benefits to citizens and build trust through immediate, visible impact. Just as India's pilots have shown, this approach tackles leakage and ensures aid reaches its intended recipients.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has explicitly stated that one of the greatest potentials of the e-rupee is for Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programs. With the feature of “programmability,” CBDCs can be designed so that aid funds are restricted to specific uses (for example, buying fertilizer or food), drastically reducing leakage and misuse. Currently, the use of e-Rupee for DBT remains in the pilot stage, but the proof of concept is strong: India's success in reducing subsidy corruption through its existing DBT system—using Aadhaar biometric identity and the UPI payment system—has demonstrated the effectiveness of direct digital payments. CBDCs are seen as the next evolutionary step to make the system even more efficient and tamper-proof.

Because digital and internet infrastructure remains uneven across much of the South, CBDC design must also allow transactions to be executed and recorded reliably even under poor connectivity conditions—or fully offline when necessary. These features transform CBDCs from a theoretical experiment into a practical solution for real-world challenges.

From India's experience, five key lessons emerge for developing nations considering CBDCs:

As of today, 137 countries—representing 98% of global GDP—are exploring CBDCs (Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker, 2025). Of these, roughly three-quarters are countries in the Global South, highlighting how developing economies see CBDCs as a tool to expand inclusion and reduce dependence on cash. For many in the Global South, India's experiment is not a warning but a blueprint: CBDCs can bridge inclusion gaps if designed with humility, trust, and a focus on technology for real impact. Ultimately, the story of CBDCs in the South is not just about money; it is about dignity, confidence, and building financial systems that people genuinely believe serve them rather than watch over them. The true measure of success is not simply the number of transactions recorded, but whether CBDCs can address fear, distrust, and the everyday needs of ordinary people.

To achieve this, a pentahelix approach is crucial: academia can research to adapt CBDC design to local needs and ensure user experience is accessible for rural communities; media can act as hubs for literacy and public awareness; fintech firms can innovate products and services on top of CBDC infrastructure; civil society can serve as watchdogs to safeguard privacy; and government can provide legitimacy and regulatory clarity. Together, these five stakeholders form the collaborative ecosystem needed for CBDCs to be trusted and effective in the Global South.

Global policy debates echo this need. The IMF's REDI framework (Regulation, Education, Design, Incentives) emphasizes that CBDC adoption requires not only strong regulatory guardrails but also grassroots education, careful design tailored to local contexts, and well-structured incentives to sustain use. Chatham House, through its Inclusive Governance Initiative, emphasizes that legitimacy in digital finance hinges on incorporating civil society and non-state actors into the design process from the outset, thereby fostering trust and ownership. Likewise, the BIS 2023 survey on CBDCs found that more than half of central banks in emerging and developing economies are prioritizing offline access and interoperability as core features for retail CBDCs. These global perspectives align closely with the realities of the Global South, and without inclusive governance, local adaptation, and trust-building, CBDCs risk becoming technical projects with little to no real impact.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce - affectionately known as "Crypto Mom" - has launched her own NFT collection called The Dog's Breakfast. This unique initiative criticizes the chaotic regulatory environment and opens a pathway for a more constructive relationship between regulators and the crypto community. What does this mean for the future?

The Dog's Breakfast introduces original characters inspired by crypto culture, showcasing the quirks, humor, and challenges of the industry. Its very name suggests a mix of ideas and chaos, poking fun at the state of the crypto landscape.

Peirce's initiative represents a shift in the approach regulators take toward crypto. By engaging with the cultural conversation surrounding Web3, she shows that regulators can be part of the dialogue rather than just rule enforcers. This approach could foster a collaborative atmosphere between regulators and innovators, potentially leading to better outcomes for both.

Peirce's collection cleverly critiques the regulatory challenges facing the crypto industry. Through satire, she draws attention to the absurdity of regulatory ambiguity and the divide between traditional finance and the decentralized ethos of crypto. Characters in her collection might represent flawed legal guidance or the resistance faced by crypto innovators, highlighting the need for clearer, principles-based regulations.

However, this playful take on the issues at hand risks trivializing serious subjects, from jurisdictional uncertainty to the rapid pace of innovation that complicates regulatory responses. At the same time, it prompts crucial conversations about the need for cooperation between regulators and the crypto community. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has pointed out that the regulatory landscape for crypto is not singular, but spread across multiple authorities with differing mandates.

Peirce's NFT project, while a creative engagement, carries potential risks. One major concern is exposure to the fraud, scams, and theft that permeate the NFT market. The U.S. Treasury Department's "Illicit Finance Risk Assessment of Non-Fungible Tokens" reports that while illicit finance is rare, fraud and scams are rampant and millions are lost to theft.

Moreover, regulators engaging in cultural projects may muddy their public perception. If they appear to endorse or be part of a market with legal ambiguities, it could undermine trust in their neutrality. The SEC's focus on enforcement actions has already cast doubts on the mutual trust between regulators and the crypto community.

Peirce's NFT initiative could have significant implications for the worldwide regulatory landscape, especially for fintech startups in Asia and SMEs in Europe. By advocating for a balanced and clear approach to crypto regulation, her collection could inspire similar models internationally. This could particularly help fintech startups navigating complex compliance environments, as clearer regulations can reduce uncertainty and stimulate innovation.

In Asia, where regulatory obstacles are rising, Peirce's approach may motivate regulators to adopt frameworks that support innovation while protecting investors. Likewise, in Europe, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework seeks to provide clearer guidelines for crypto-assets, and Peirce's endorsement of balanced regulation could underline the necessity of regulatory clarity.

Peirce's NFT collection intersects with larger trends in the crypto world, including the rise of crypto payroll. As an increasing number of companies explore cryptocurrency payments, the potential for financial inclusion expands. Crypto payroll could reach unbanked and underbanked populations, providing access to financial services that traditional banks often overlook.

The interest in crypto payroll is particularly driven by Gen Z, who actively seek jobs that offer cryptocurrency as a payment option. This trend reflects a wider cultural shift towards digital assets and underscores the need for regulatory clarity to facilitate these innovations. As companies begin to pay salaries in crypto, compliance with trade regulations, anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and consumer protection will be crucial.

In summary, Hester Peirce's The Dog's Breakfast NFT collection serves as both a critique of the current regulatory landscape and a cultural symbol of its evolution. By initiating dialogue and promoting collaboration between regulators and innovators, Peirce's collection could shape global crypto regulation, enhance financial inclusion, and redefine the future of digital assets. As the industry navigates its complexities, the demand for clear, principles-based regulations will be essential.

 Nation-state Bitcoin adoption is at the “tail end" of the gradual stage and entering "the beginning phases of suddenly," Jan3 founder Samson Mow said. 

An increasing number of countries are preparing to ramp up Bitcoin adoption after moving past the initial skepticism, according to Jan3 founder Samson Mow.

“I think we're on the tail end of gradually, and we're at the beginning phases of suddenly,” Mow told Danny Knowles on the What Bitcoin Did podcast published on YouTube on Saturday.

“These things happen very quickly,” Mow said, referring to the potential for more countries to adopt a Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve. “It's like literally gradually then suddenly,” he said, adding:

Mow emphasized that while US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the US still hasn't started buying. 

However, he pointed out the nation is “pushing forward” with budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition and the Bitcoin Act.

Galaxy Digital's head of firmwide research, Alex Thorn, recently said there is a high likelihood that the US government will form the highly anticipated Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by the end of this year.

While the US still leads all governments in total Bitcoin holdings, Mow told Cointelegraph Magazine in June that the US “has to start” acquiring Bitcoin this year. 

“The risk is that the US is front-run by Pakistan,” he explained. At the time of publication, the US government holds 198,012 Bitcoin, according to Bitbo data. 

Mow anticipates significant Bitcoin moves from the Latin American region, which he says is one of the areas he is most bullish on.

Nation-state Bitcoin adoption has been a widely discussed talking point in the crypto industry this year. 

Fidelity Digital Assets said in a research paper in January that it anticipates “more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in Bitcoin.”

Meanwhile, Mow pointed out that Bitcoin's price hasn't played out how many market participants thought it would for 2025. 

“We should have had a bull run already,” he said, “like a massive run up,” he added.

“So I think this cycle, if you want to call it a cycle, is delayed; it might push into next year,” he said. Several other market participants have echoed a similar sentiment in recent times. On July 26, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said, “I bet 2026 is an up year.”

“I broadly think we're in for a good few years,” Hougan said. Bitcoin is trading at $109,400 at the time of publication, down 1.97% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap.

Mow's and Hougan's comments come as the industry continues to debate whether Bitcoin's usual four-year cycle is still relevant now that ETFs and institutional demand are in play.

It was only in June that Mow said the $1 million Bitcoin price tag “is a given at this point, maybe this year, maybe next year.”

A federal judge has rejected drone maker DJI's efforts to get off a Department of Defense list of Chinese military companies.

U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ruled Friday that the DoD had provided “substantial evidence” that DJI contributes “to the Chinese defense industrial base.”

Pointing to the use of modified DJI drones in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Friedman wrote, “Whether or not DJI's policies prohibit military use is irrelevant. That does not change the fact that DJI's technology has both substantial theoretical and actual military application.”

At the same time, Judge Friedman rejected some of the DoD's other rationales for the listing.

Other government agencies, including the Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department, placed DJI on similar lists before it was added to the DoD list in 2022.

When DJI filed the lawsuit last year, the company said it was “not owned or controlled by the Chinese military” and that “the DoD itself acknowledges that DJI makes consumer and commercial drones, not military drones.”

The lawsuit also said the company had “suffered ongoing financial and reputational harm, including lost business” as a result of the listing.

TechCrunch has reached out to DJI for comment. The company told Reuters that it's considering its legal options and said Judge Friedman's decision was “based on a single rationale that applies to many companies that have never been listed.”DJI faces other legal hurdles in the United States, including a potential ban on sales starting in December unless a national security agency determines that its drones do not “pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States.”

This week's Peacemaker episode ended with a twist fans have been calling for weeks, and now it's affecting the show's Fortnite presence.



At the end of Thursday's “Ignorance is Chris,” the 11th Street Kids go to find Chris in the alternate universe he's been hanging around in. Turns out it's the Nazi dimension, made clear by Adebayo getting chased down by white people and the swastika in place of the 50 stars on the American flag. On Saturday night, Epic Games revealed it was disabling the “Peacemaker Hips” emote while it “inquires into our partner's creative intentions. Assuming it's not coming back, we'll issue refunds in the next few days.”

The “Hips” emoji references the show's season two intro, which has its cast flap their arms up and down in a way that makes them look like swastikas. That dance may also have been hiding the Nazi twist in plain sight (boy, what a sentence), so Epic's spent two weeks potentially unaware that it was charging people 400 V-bucks (or $3.29) to make their characters dance like Nazis. At time of writing, neither WB or James Gunn have commented on the emote being disabled.

Fortnite's no stranger to emote-related controversy, but the apparent secrecy behind the Peacemaker dance's intent makes this all so fascinating from different angles. Is Gunn and WB at fault for not giving Epic a heads up about the meaning, or did the developer not do its job in properly vetting it? Is this just what happens as IP collaborations become so normalized, which Fortnite itself has had a hand in? The aftermath of this will be interesting to watch play out, and probably make the emote itself feel like an important part of the game's ever-evolving life.

You can see the same behavior if you try to ask an LLM to code in an API that is not commonly used.When it comes to MCP tooling I followed a different path but with similar assumptions.There are tools that LLMs have been Rled to death to use. So I'm modeling my tools after them.Specifically, I try to have a “glob” tool, used to let the LLM figure out structure. A search and a read tool and use regexp as much as possible for passing parameters.You can see an early version of this pattern here: https://github.com/typedef-ai/fenic/blob/main/examples/mcp/d...It has been working well, at least in terms of the model knowing how to invoke and use the tools.I have to say though that each model is different. I see differences between Claude code and Codex when I use the MCP for development, at least on how good they are in retrieving the information they need.Maybe I should try to run some benchmarking and compare more formally

Yeah since it's using Deno it'd be cool just use Deno throughout. Definitely gotta clean up the code quite a bit.

The fetch code isn't any better than the tool code I agree, but typescript code is more common so I'd guess this would be too?But anyway I think the real power comes with the type-safety part that I left out this morning (working on it now). From what I understand Cloudflare is essentially generating an SDK for the LLM to write code against.Instead of writing that fetch call. The LLM would generate```
const redditResults = await redditMCP_getTopPosts(subreddit);
const insertMutation = await duckdb_Insert("SQL STUFF", redditResults.map(...));
const results = await duckDb_Query(args: duckDb_QueryArgs);
return resultsInSomeNiceFormat;
```Where the method names come from the MCP server tools, and the argument types are autogenerated from the MCP schemas themselves.No idea if this is a valuable workflow or not personally. I just thought it was cool and wanted to tinker with it.

Except it can use Typescript to manipulate the data mid stream.So in reality this is MCP Middleware + MCP Orchestration + Tool Call Efficiency.It will save tokens as well due to only returning what it needs, but more so just think of going from 10 consecutive tool calls, to 1 call that gives you everything you need and nothing you don't, with 1/10th the time taken to accomplish.

1. Tool calls are intentionally simple; adding a code generation layer introduces needless complexity and failure points.2. Cloudflare already acts as a man-in-the-middle for ~20% of the Internet with limited transparency about government data requests3. This is clearly designed to drive adoption of their Worker platform and create lock-in for AI agent developersSimilar to their x402 payment scheme that reinvents HTTP 402 under their control, the community has already built alternatives (see the Aperture implementation from Lightning) that don't require surrendering more of your stack to Cloudflare.Remember what's happening here: a company with unprecedented visibility into web traffic wants even more control over how AI agents interact with the internet. Even if you don't believe that AI will eventually self govern itself, this is a horrible idea to limit individual's ability to automate portions of their access to the web.No thanks.

In which case your likely wrong, people do want it, and AI will be very good at orchestrating simple patterns.CF definitely has a vested interest.. The problem for them now that I see is that THEY DIDN"T ACTUALLY LAUNCH IT... but did describe what it is/does in complete detail.Now there are gonna be dozens of non CF locked clones, just like the one OP linked.

If you run `deno check` before executing the code you'd get the type-safety loop (working on this now)Later I want to see what'd happen if you give the LLM a repo of sorts to store useful snippets and functions with comments for later use. So the LLM itself would save workflows, be able to import them into the Deno environment and chain those together.It definitely needs a prompt that tells it to use the MCP server but I can see it being pretty powerful.I only did simple tests like get Reddit posts, their comments, find the weather on those days, stick them in duckdb, and run some social media metric queries.I could see that same test being: "find me leads, filter by keywords, run against some parquet file stored somewhere using duckdb, craft an email for my boss."I'm kind of ranting but I think this a pretty exciting approach.Edit: GraphQL style codegen layer but for all your APIs seems like a pretty obvious middle layer for this, maybe next weekend.

- has endpoints for creating/retrieving memories
- embeds stuff using ChatGPT models
- Uses Graph nodes for relating memories together
- Has a dream/sleeping phase which degrades long term memory relevant, finds and tracks patterns and more.
- Has an MCP which connects any AI directly to memory
- Automated hooks which record memory queues on commit, deploy, learning moments
- Automated storing of all queued memories on chat end.
- A lot more magic under the hood too.So in reality you get a near biological memory, useful by any MCP agent. To be fair Jack has about a 2 month head start on the rest of us with this idea haha.--The setup were building will be an always running setup, so it also has a scheduling runtime in Node that uses MD files to create automatable workflows, some uses agents, some just run bash.

Just because an agent “lives” in the environment, doesn't make it RL. It needs a reward function, or even better something like Gym.

So once it has the API shape in memory, it could make dozens of tool calls in a single call.It isn't about token saving, its about time/efficiency of tool usage/response time accumulation.Instead of 20 separate tool calls one after the other, you get one larger, orchestrated one that only returns exactly what it needed.

As Chinese firms scale and U.S. export rules tighten, Nvidia is fighting to keep a foothold in China. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says China is just “nanoseconds behind” the U.S. in chipmaking and that Washington should stop trying to wall off the market. Speaking on the BG2 podcast, Huang argued that allowing companies like Nvidia to sell into China would serve American interests by spreading U.S. technology and extending its geopolitical influence. “We're up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fast-moving, underregulated [competitor],” Huang said, talking about the pedigree of China's engineers and controversial 9-9-6 working culture.

His comments come as Nvidia hopes to ship its H20 AI GPU to Chinese customers again, following a months-long pause tied to new U.S. export rules. The Commerce Department is understood to have begun issuing licenses for the H20 in August, and Nvidia is already working on a successor chip designed to comply with current restrictions while offering better performance. The company has not confirmed specs, but it would be Nvidia's second attempt to tailor an AI accelerator specifically for the Chinese market since the original A100 and H100 bans took effect.

China, meanwhile, is accelerating its own plans to become self-sufficient. Huawei's new Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD systems, powered by the company's Ascend 910B chips, are now shipping in volume. The company has laid out an ambitious roadmap through 2027 with next-gen Ascend silicon that aims to match or exceed current-gen performance. These systems are CUDA-free by design and optimized for Chinese-built software stacks, a shift that puts real pressure on Nvidia's dominance, which, according to Huang, previously held a 95% market share in China.

Chinese hyperscalers are backing that roadmap with capital. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance are all investing in custom silicon, either through internal chip teams or by funding startups. That includes firms like Tencent, which has announced it has fully adapted its infrastructure to support homegrown silicon. Asked what he sees in the near future, Huang said, “They [China] publicly say… they want China to be an open market, they want… companies to come to China and compete in the marketplace… and I believe and I hope that we return to that.”

Nvidia's approach to that is to maintain a foothold in China and play both sides of the geopolitical divide. The H20 may be hobbled compared to the company's leading chips, but it gives Chinese companies a path to stay within the Nvidia ecosystem — at least for now.

Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. To get this in your inbox, sign up here for free — just click TechCrunch Mobility!

The autonomous vehicle industry is years — maybe decades — from maturing. And so there's still a Wild West quality to the sector, in spite of the steady stream of announcements that do show marked progress. Two such news items from this week illustrate my point of progress, possibility, and even a bit of peril (at least to the ups and downs a public market can provide).

First up is Gatik, an AV and logistics startup that is applying its tech to middle-mile trucks. The startup, which I first wrote about in 2019, announced a multi-year and expanded commercial partnership with Canada's largest retailer, Loblaw. Under the deal, Gatik will deploy 20 autonomous trucks by the end of 2025 to provide driverless delivery to Loblaw's network of stores in the greater Toronto area. Co-founder and CEO Gautam Narang told me the company will add another 30 autonomous trucks to the fleet by the end of 2026.

The deal is notable, and not just because of the fleet size. As Narang explained to me, the trucks will be handling the full regional network for Loblaw. This means these third-generation AV trucks will operate autonomously to pick up products from two distribution centers and make deliveries to over 300 retail stores. “These are multiple brands within the Loblaw umbrella,” he said. 

In other words, this is not some fixed-route pilot program. It's commercial, and it's complex.

Next up is Kodiak Robotics, another startup I have reported on since its founding. The company, which is developing self-driving trucks for highway, industrial, and defense uses, began trading on Nasdaq this week under the tickers KDK and KDKRW. 

The company, which is now called Kodiak AI, went public via a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II, an affiliate of Ares Management. The deal valued the startup at about $2.5 billion. 

Kodiak raised $275 million in financing. More than $212.5 million came from certain institutional investors, including $145 million in PIPE funding and about $62.9 million in trust cash from Ares. It should be noted that the trust cash is smaller (it was $562 million), as some SPAC investors redeemed their shares. 

I spoke to founder and CEO Don Burnette the day before Kodiak's big debut about why he took the company public — let alone via a SPAC. It was a big moment for Burnette, whose family was on hand to watch him ring the bell and mark the milestone. The stock was trading at about $7.70 Friday, down about 10% from its market open.

“As you can imagine, building and scaling a transformative autonomous driving company is very capital intensive, and we were looking to access the public markets as a path forward for the company. And when choosing between, you know, traditional IPO or a SPAC, we considered all the options,” he said. “We felt like, from a timing perspective, it was the right decision for the company (to take the SPAC route).”

It should be noted that Burnette is also quite bullish on defense. Here's why:

“I think autonomy is the future of ground transportation broadly,” he said, before noting the benefits within defense for logistics and reconnaissance operations for ground vehicles. “One of the key things is defense requires unstructured autonomy, and this is one of the areas where we become specialists.”

A few weeks ago, we wrote about some trouble at Hyundai‘s electric air taxi startup Supernal, including that the company had stopped work on its air taxi program and that its CEO and CTO were out. 

This week, a little bird told us that a wider reorg of Supernal's C-suite was afoot — something Hyundai Motor Group has now confirmed to us.

Chief strategy officer Jaeyong Song and chief safety officer Tracy Lamb are part of a “transition to new leadership,” according to the Korean conglomerate. Song's departure is particularly notable, as he was once the VP of Hyundai's Advanced Air Mobility division, which Supernal was spun out of in 2021. Also gone is Lina Yang, who most recently served as chief of staff to the startup's now-former CEO, but who also served as Supernal's “Head of Intelligent Systems” before that.

Remember Moxion Power, the portable battery startup that raised $110 million before going bankrupt? The founders are back with a new startup called Anode Technology Company, which has designed a mobile battery and inverter that can be used for EV charging and supplying remote power to construction sites and live events. The startup just raised $9 million in seed funding in a round led by Eclipse Ventures; its partner, Jiten Behl, who spearheaded the deal, was previously Rivian's chief growth officer. Apparently, Behl's interest was sparked by his experience at Rivian. 

Side note: Palo Alto-based venture capital firm Eclipse sure has been busy this year. The VC firm led the $105 million round of Also, the micromobility startup that spun out of Rivian, and recently hired longtime T. Rowe Price Group investor Joe Fath as partner and head of growth. 

The firm doesn't explicitly focus on transportation, but some of its portfolio companies in this sector include Arc, Bedrock Robotics, Reliable Robotics, Skyryse, and Wayve.

Other deals that got my attention …

Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India that competes with Uber, doubled its valuation to $2.3 billion following a secondary share sale by food delivery giant Swiggy. The share sale comes just weeks after Rapido began piloting food deliveries, edging into Swiggy's core territory.

Telo, the tiny electric truck developer, raised $20 million in a Series A funding round co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo's board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and early-stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo.

TheTrump administration is seeking up to a 10% stake in Lithium Americas in exchange for renegotiating the repayment period of a $2.26 billion Department of Energy loan. GM is a major investor in the Canadian company, which is developing a lithium mine in Nevada that is expected to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere.

Hackers have had quite an active week in the transportation sector. Stellantis confirmed a data breach involving customers' personal information. The breach is linked to a hack of its Salesforce database. Meanwhile, a hack that began last Friday and targeted check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace caused delays at Brussels, Berlin, and Dublin airports, as well as London's Heathrow. The U.K.'s National Crime Agency has arrested a man in connection to the ransomware attack. And finally, Jaguar Land Rover said it will not resume production at its factories for yet another week as it continues to grapple with fallout from a cyberattack.  

Battery materials startup Sila started operations at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer-range, faster-charging EVs. The factory is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West and will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs. Future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles.

Automakers continue to pull back on EVs and electrified vehicles. Honda is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle that was being built by General Motors in Tennessee, CNBC reported. And Stellantis has canceled plans to produce a 4xe plug-in hybrid Jeep Gladiator in North America by the end of 2025. Which EV is next on the chopping block?

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into Rivian over issues with the seat belts in its electric delivery vans that could introduce additional risk in the event of a crash, Bloomberg reported.

Tesla asked the Environmental Protection Agency not to roll back current vehicle emissions standards, breaking from other major automakers that want to see the rules eased. 

TuneIn, an audio streaming service, is collaborating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deliver emergency alerts directly to drivers. 

Volvo Cars is pledging a commitment to U.S. production. The company said it will continue to invest in its U.S. car plant near Charleston, South Carolina, and announced plans to expand the factory to produce a hybrid vehicle by the end of the decade.

Waymo launched “Waymo for Business,” a new service designed for companies to set up accounts so their employees can access robotaxis in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco.

Zoox has asked federal regulators for an exemption that would allow the Amazon-owned autonomous vehicle company to commercially deploy its custom-built robotaxis, which lack traditional controls like pedals and a steering wheel.

Finally, proof of life from Luminar founder Austin Russell. 

You may remember that Russell was mysteriously and suddenly replaced in May as CEO of the lidar company he created. The company has never truly explained his departure, only that it was the result of a “code of business conduct and ethics inquiry” initiated by the board.

Russell has been silent; while he remains on Luminar's board, he hasn't signed any of the filings the company has submitted with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since he was replaced. This week, he reappeared as the co-founder of a new company called Russell AI Labs. It's billed as a “platform that backs and builds transformative AI and frontier technology companies.”

It doesn't seem like his troubles at Luminar have affected his ability to attract high-profile support or make eyebrow-raising deals. Russell's co-founders are Markus Schäfer, CTO and board member at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Murtaza Ahmed, who served as a managing director at Goldman Sachs before joining SoftBank and was a partner in the $100 billion Vision Fund and managing partner of its $5 billion Latin America Fund.

As part of Russell AI Lab's debut, the startup announced it has taken a $300 million stake in agentic AI company Emergence AI.

It's never ideal being the second-most anything in the world, but there are worse places to be, too. The same applies to the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses Gen 2, which were the second-most exciting thing that Meta announced at Meta Connect this month. The first, if popular opinion is any indication, is Meta's Ray-Ban Display that, as you may already have gathered, has a screen in it.

But even if the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 (starting at $379) are the second-most exciting pair of smart glasses to come out of Connect, they can still be the first-most something, and in my estimation, they are. These are the best pair of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses you can buy without a screen. Period.

Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses Gen 2

Ray-Ban Meta AI Glasses Gen 2 aren't exciting but they're better then the original.

Pros

Cons

I've already covered this a few times, so I'll keep it brief; the biggest updates in the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are battery life and video. The size (aside from 2 grams of additional weight in Gen 2) is the same, there are all the same features as the original, and the speakers and mics are all carried over.

The battery life, though, is now rated for double, which in this case equates to about 8 hours of general use. The charging case also gets a bump from 32 hours to 48 hours. The battery increase in the smart glasses is thanks to what Meta is calling “ultra-narrow steelcan” batteries—the same ones it's putting in the Meta Ray-Ban Display, its smart glasses with a screen in them. On the video side of things, it's upping the max resolution of recording to 3K and also introducing a 60 fps option, though that will only be available if you're recording in 1080p. Unfortunately, for anyone who is more interested in still photos, the sensors are the same this generation. It's 12 megapixels with a max resolution of 3,024 x 4,032.

That may not sound like a lot, but you can't really understate the importance of battery life and videos in a pair of smart glasses—those are pretty important to any device that would dare encroach on phone territory. Even more important, though, is how videos look, and whether battery life is actually as advertised. On that front, Meta mostly delivers.

I often use my first-gen Ray-Ban Meta to record video while I'm biking, because recording with your phone in one hand while you're on a bike in New York City is kind of a death wish. Here's a side-by-side comparison of a still frame pulled from the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1's maximum 1080p video versus an image from the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. As you can see in the screenshot on the right, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 came out less blurry, which is to be expected with the resolution increase.

In my experience, the improved detail in image quality is fairly noticeable. Where some edges used to be blurred and a little too smooth, the videos recorded in 3K feel like a more accurate slice of life. That's not going to be important to everyone (a lot of people are just going to take still photos), but if you're like me and you want to capture some beautiful foliage on a bike ride, the upgrade is welcome.

There's another aspect to the video upgrade, 60 fps, that I would have loved to test out for you guys, but unfortunately, it's not available yet. According to a Meta representative, 60 fps will roll out in a software update for Ray-Ban Gen 2 on Oct. 1, coinciding with the release of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses. I'll update this review once my review unit gets the 60 fps option.

So, the other big piece of the puzzle is the battery. While it may not be as easy to test as shooting videos, I tried my best to use the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 for as long as possible. The verdict here is that, while you may not get the full 8 hours promised, you're definitely getting a lot more battery than the Gen 1.

As is the case with any gadget, the battery life will largely depend not just on density or size but also on your usage. One thing that I love to do with the first-gen Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses is use them as open-ear headphones, and I think lots of people who own them would agree. The speakers are the same here, so there are no upgrades in fidelity, but I wanted to test the mileage when it comes to audio. Listening to a podcast and eventually a live radio broadcast (Buffalo Bills sports talk radio in case anyone wants to know), I was able to go about 5 hours, which drained the battery from 100% to about 15%. The volume was fairly loud, though (a metric that affects battery life), since I was listening in a crowded coffee shop and needed to overpower music and chatter. That's not the 8 hours promised by Meta, but it's also an improvement over the first-gen smart glasses, which usually expire fully after about 3 to 4 hours for audio streaming.

That's not gold medal-worthy news, but again, your battery is going to depend on what you're doing with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. My second-favorite use of Ray-Ban Meta AI smart glasses is taking calls with them. I hopped on a call with my mom, which lasted 32 minutes at full volume, and the smart glasses barely took a hit, battery-wise. I started at 100% and after more than 30 minutes of talking, they were at 96%. Again, your mileage here is going to vary based on what you're doing. Taking lots of 3K video? Well, you can expect the Meta Ray-Ban Gen 2 to die sooner. Using them intermittently for audio and calls? You might get closer to the advertised 8 hours of battery life.

One thing is for sure: the battery definitely gets more juice, which should be welcome for anyone who's sick of having to pop their smart glasses back in the case just so they can listen to some music while they go for a walk. How this battery will hold up under the strain of Meta Ray-Ban Display is anyone's guess, but this is definitely the best battery in a pair of non-display Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses yet.

Those are the two main arenas where you're going to see improvements gen-over-gen, so if you feel like you want higher-res videos or you're really yearning for more battery life, Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 should be on your radar. If you're fine with how your smart glasses perform in those areas, though, I can't see a reason to rush out and pick up a new pair. Whether the updates appeal to you or not, though, these are still the best pair of non-display Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses you can buy, even if I would have liked to see substantive improvements to things like Meta AI, which is still finicky at best. Still pictures could have used an update, too, but you'll have to keep waiting for that.

As for connectivity to other apps, things are also the same. Spotify is what I use the most, and it works well most of the time. Meta's voice assistant nails your simple commands the majority of the time (like skip this song or play and pause), but asking it to play specific songs or artists can be hit and miss. What's also the same is the fact that messaging and calls are still limited. There is no direct integration with iOS and Android, so if you want to call or text with your smart glasses via the voice assistant, you'll need to link your Instagram or WhatsApp. For some people, that will be fine, but for others who don't use those platforms, it may be a dealbreaker.

Oh, and the Meta AI app still unfortunately loves to promote AI slop. And while it works fine for transferring and storing pictures and videos from your smart glasses, I still wish it didn't shoehorn an LLM (large language model) in there.

As is the case with any of Meta's products, you're going to have to be okay with knowing that you won't always get the best protections when it comes to personal privacy, too. As I've pointed out previously, Meta has a pretty bad track record on that front, so if the idea of Meta using photos and videos you take by using the “Hey, Meta” function to train its AI skeeves you out, you'd best steer clear of Ray-Ban smart glasses.

The second-gen glasses aren't groundbreaking, but they're improved. And for anyone who's not willing to spend $800 on the Meta Ray-Ban Display, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are probably the only smart Ray-Ban smart glasses worth buying.

Gaming laptops used to be pretty straightforward. They were powerful but thick and unwieldy. These days, you have options. There are gaming laptops that prioritize performance at all costs and others that hone in on thinness, cost, or design. Heck, there are even gaming tablets and 2-in-1s.

That breadth of choices means choosing a gaming laptop in 2025 isn't simple. While picking any option from our Best Gaming Laptops guide is a good place to start, you still might not end up with a gaming laptop perfectly suited for your needs. Having tested many gaming laptops in over a decade of reviewing products, I'll break down each element of these spendy machines to lead you in the right direction, as well as explain what to expect from the major laptop brands.

This is a great place to start when shopping for a gaming laptop. When we talk about “sizes” of these machines, we're usually comparing display sizes, measured diagonally. You'll often see three sizes across brands: 14-inch, 16-inch, and 18-inch.

16-inch is the happy medium. Though they are large laptops, they give the powerful gaming hardware enough space for the thermals to breathe. Having a larger screen is certainly not a bad thing either. These 16-inch gaming laptops replaced the 15.6-inch gaming laptops of the past, which used a 16:9 aspect ratio screen. With a few exceptions, most modern displays use a 16:10 aspect ratio display with thinner bezels. 16-inch laptops can be thin like the Razer Blade 16 or Asus ROG Zephyrus G16 or thick like the Lenovo Legion Pro 5 or Asus ROG Strix G16.

14-inch and 18-inch gaming laptops are more niche, but still have specific use cases where they are good solutions. 14-inch laptops are a newer development, tending to be highly portable and compact. The two primary standouts are the Razer Blade 14 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, but there are other models like the Acer Nitro 14, Asus TUF A14, HP Omen Transcend 14, and others.

18-inch gaming laptops are the exact opposite. They're too big for bags, too heavy to comfortably travel with, and are often quite thick. These are gaming laptops meant to primarily be left at a desk or workstation. Why buy them? Well, if you plan to mostly game at home, you might not mind the extra heft. The 18-inch screen gives you lots of screen real estate to game on. This is especially nice if you aren't playing on an external monitor. Some of the notable options are the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 or MSI Titan 18 HX AI.

There's a lot to consider when it comes to performance, but the place to start is with graphics cards. A gaming laptop needs a discrete GPU to be ready for 3D gaming, and typically, that means choosing from something in Nvidia's RTX lineup. The latest options, the RTX 50-series, have been launching throughout 2025, which include the RTX 5090, 5080, 5070, 5070 Ti, 5060, and 5050. Nvidia will have you believe that multi-frame generation is the reason to buy a new laptop with one of these GPUs, though in my testing, that hasn't always proven true. Either way, the feature is there to play with regardless of which GPU your laptop has.

As you'd expect, performance and price scale step by step. I won't list out all the specs for these graphics cards, but there are a few important things to know when deciding. The RTX 5090 (24 GB), 5080 (16 GB), and 5070 Ti (12 GB) all received additional VRAM over their predecessors in the RTX 40-series, whereas the RTX 5070, 5060, and 5050 are all stuck with just 8 GB. That means for certain game performance, the upgrade from the RTX 5070 to the 5070 Ti is bigger than the 5060 to the 5070. It's also important to remember that these laptop GPUs do not correspond with the desktop versions in terms of specs.

The other critical spec that is often forgotten about is the amount of power going to the GPU. For example, the RTX 5060 can run at 115 watts for the maximum amount of performance, which is what you'll see in a laptop like the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10. Some cheaper gaming laptops, such as the Gigabyte Aero X16, run that same RTX 5060 at a max of 85 watts. That severely limits the performance you can expect out of it. This spec is not always clearly labeled on retailer pages, so make sure to check with the manufacturer before buying.

Beyond graphics, your CPU matters in performance too. Intel and AMD both have a strong position in gaming laptops, and you'll find options for them spread out across different laptop lineups. The latest generation of chips you'll see in 2025 gaming laptops are the Intel Core Ultra Series 2 H or HX chips, and AMD has its third-gen Ryzen AI chips, such as the Ryzen AI 9 365 or the Ryzen AI 9 HX 375. Across both AMD and Intel, “HX” in these chips refers to a higher-wattage CPU, up to 55 watts. Although it's a bit rarer, we're also seeing some gaming laptops adopt the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, which is the absolute king of gaming performance right now. Meanwhile, Intel's latest chips are a bit more commonly used and get you better battery life.

Should you buy older gaming laptops that are now on discount? Well, I wouldn't recommend buying anything with a GPU older than the RTX 40-series. Remember: these GPUs have been around since 2023, so you're potentially purchasing something that's a couple of years old. If you can find a good discount on a high-end 2024 gaming laptop, I won't stop you. I just haven't found many options that are discounted deep enough to be worth it.

You won't find many new gaming laptops with less than 16 GB of RAM anymore, thankfully. That's become the new standard for even the cheapest gaming laptops. In fact, many companies are now moving to 32 GB, largely because of how memory-intensive modern games can be. The one exception to that rule that I've found is the HP Victus 15, the company's cheapest model, which starts with only 8 GB of RAM, paired with an RTX 5050.

The price of upgrading RAM, however, varies wildly from company to company. Razer charges a whopping $300 to go from 16 GB to 32 GB, while Dell charges just $100. That's also what Best Buy charges to upgrade the Asus ROG Strix G16 from 16 GB to 32 GB.

Unfortunately, some of these gaming laptops no longer let you easily upgrade the memory yourself, as it's soldered to the motherboard. But many still offer it, such as the aforementioned ROG Strix G16, Alienware 16 Aurora, MSI Titan 18 HX, and others. That means you can purchase cheaper, faster RAM yourself and upgrade it yourself. It's mostly the thinner gaming laptops like the Razer Blades that use soldered RAM.

For storage, 512 GB is still the standard, though some higher-end gaming laptops have moved to one terabyte as the base configuration. Razer did that with its Blade gaming laptops a few years back. Remember: modern games are absolutely massive these days, and while you'll no doubt be using external storage at some point for your game collection, having a terabyte of internal storage can be super helpful. Most gaming laptops will allow you to easily upgrade the storage yourself, though, and often offer a second empty M.2 slot. Like with RAM, this is a much cheaper option than configuring it in your laptop purchase up front.

Do not underestimate the importance of your gaming laptop's display. Unless you plan on exclusively using it while plugged into an external monitor (in which case you should probably buy or build a desktop PC), the display of your gaming laptop is the window through which you experience the world of your games.

Outside of the size, which we already discussed, there are three primary considerations with a gaming laptop's screen: resolution, refresh rate, and panel type. Gaming laptops these days come in either 1920 x 1200, 2560 x 1600, or 3840 x 2400. Occasionally, you may run across a 16:9 aspect ratio screen with an old-school 1920 x 1080 resolution, too. More pixels mean a sharper screen, which makes a big difference in games. But more pixels also mean more performance is required to get high frame rates at that resolution. You can always drop the resolution in a game to get higher frame rates, but that also means you're paying for extra pixels that you're not using.

Refresh rate is equally important. The good news is that all modern gaming laptops have a refresh rate of over 60 Hz, which is the standard for non-gaming laptops. From there, you'll see 120 Hz and 144 Hz as the new baseline, with options up to 240 Hz, 360 Hz, or even 500 Hz. Laptop manufacturers tend to do a good job of offering display resolutions and refresh rates appropriate to the amount of performance you can expect from the laptop, but sometimes you'll have a choice of a higher resolution or a higher refresh rate.

The last important consideration with a gaming laptop's display is the panel type, which is increasingly a very exciting aspect of these devices. While IPS is still the standard, higher-end gaming laptops have begun to adopt Mini-LED or OLED. Not only are these panels more color accurate and vivid, but they also allow for vastly better HDR performance. Many of these panels, including the OLED ones, can hit over 1,000 nits of peak HDR brightness, really bringing the lighting in games to life. If you haven't gamed in HDR on a gaming laptop before, you're in for a treat. The best part is that, unlike effects like ray tracing, it doesn't cost any extra performance to enjoy the benefits. OLED also offers better response times, offering more responsive gaming.

Lenovo

Lenovo

There was a time not so long ago when Lenovo didn't have much of a presence in the world of gaming. That began to change in 2016 with the launch of the Lenovo Legion PC gaming brand, which would, over time, gain a lot of ground. Lenovo is now up to the 10th generation of some of these devices across the Legion and Legion Pro lines of laptops. It offers both Intel and AMD versions of these devices, which range from $1,340 up to over $4,500.

Legion laptops don't always have the flashiest or thinnest designs, but they often offer great performance for the price. And because Legion laptops don't chase the ultra-thin designs like Asus and Razer, they often have strong thermals.

To fill in the lower end of the budget spectrum, Lenovo launched the LOQ (pronounced “Lock”) subbrand in 2023. This was to replace the old “IdeaPad Gaming” brand that Lenovo had back in the day. For now, LOQ laptops only feature lower-end GPUs: the RTX 4050, 4060, 5050, and 5060. One quirk with the LOQ gaming laptops is that, unlike most of the competition, they still use a 16:9 aspect ratio display, giving them less screen and a large bottom bezel. Still, they're one of the few gaming laptop brands right now that are offering the latest RTX 50-series GPUs in designs under $1,000.

My favorite Lenovo gaming laptop right now is the Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 10, which has a glorious OLED screen and a really clean, all-white design.

On the surface, Asus has just two lines for its gaming laptops: ROG (Republic of Gamers) and TUF. But don't you worry, ROG has grown insanely huge, encapsulating three other gaming laptop sub-brands: ROG Zephyrus, ROG Flow, and ROG Strix. Let's break those down.

ROG Zephyrus is the company's flagship gaming laptop brand. Asus has pared back the number of laptops in this line in recent years, focusing on the immense popularity of the ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16. These gaming laptops are some of the thinnest you can buy, while still offering high-end OLED screens and graphics up to an RTX 5090. Perhaps taking inspiration from Razer, ROG Zephyrus laptops feature a clean, minimalist design that makes them great as hybrid devices that can double for work or school just as well as for gaming.

ROG Strix is Asus's performance-focused subbrand. This is where the company's thicker, more conventional gaming laptops are found. Pricing can range widely, as it includes affordable options like the ROG Strix G16 with the RTX 5050, which starts at just $1,300.

TUF Gaming is the company's entry-level gaming laptop subbrand. These TUF gaming laptops used to be some of the most affordable gaming laptops you could buy, but they've gone up in price over the past few years. There aren't any Asus gaming laptops under $1,000 that feature the latest RTX 50-series GPUs, though you can find plenty of older models for less on Amazon or Best Buy.

Dell's gaming laptop lineup is fairly sparse these days. All of Dell's gaming laptops fall under the Alienware brand, which the company acquired back in 2006. Alienware has been through many cycles of reinvention with its gaming laptops, but in 2025, there's really only four laptops in the stack right now: the Alienware 16 Aurora, Alienware 16X Aurora, Alienware 18 Area-51, and Alienware 16 Area-51. I like the simplicity of the new lineup, which focuses on what Alienware has always been known for: its brash, gamer style and higher-end performance.

The Alienware 16 Aurora is the company's attempt to reach a cheaper demographic, starting the laptop at just $1,100 right now for an RTX 5050 configuration.

HP's Omen gaming brand has been around for over a decade, but it really feels like the company has started to build some momentum around it over the past few years. Interestingly, HP breaks down its options into three categories of thickness and performance. Omen Max is the chunkiest at almost an inch thick, and supports up to an RTX 5080. Omen 16 is the middle ground, capping out at an RTX 5070. Omen Transcend, which offers a 14-inch model, still supports up to an RTX 5070, but brings the thickness down to 0.7 inches. There are 16-inch size options available across all three subbrands; however, none of the laptops are as thin as some of the competition. There's also an Omen 16 Slim, which blurs the lines a bit.

Apart from Omen, HP also launched its “Victus” subbrand in 2021, which represents its budget-oriented options. HP only has a few configurations of the HP Victus 15 and Victus 16 available right now.

Razer

Beyond these mainstay brands, you also have PC gaming companies that have dipped into gaming laptops, such as Gigabyte, Origin, and Maingear. Just stay away from the no-name brands that have popular listings on Amazon despite lacking discrete graphics cards—like this.

Dell

While there's an entire ecosystem of laptops marketed toward gamers, that doesn't mean you can't play games on other devices. Laptops with dedicated graphics cards can often play games just as well as gaming laptops, but they're often targeted more at creatives who need better graphics to run creative applications. These include laptops like the Dell 14 Premium, Acer Swift X 14, and the Asus ProArt P16.

If you're buying a laptop primarily to play games, though, I wouldn't recommend one of these. They usually don't support the higher-tier GPUs like the RTX 5080 or 5090, and you won't get super-fast refresh rates beyond 120 Hz. If you're more of a casual gamer and just want a high-end laptop that can do it all, these are good options. They're especially good if you despise the “gamer” aesthetic and want something a bit more subtle.

I should mention that integrated graphics have improved tremendously in recent years. In particular, Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 2 chips with Intel Arc have respectable integrated graphics. You'll still need to drop down the settings (and perhaps the resolution) to achieve smoother frame rates, but I've been surprised by how well lighter games like Fortnite or Marvel Rivals play on the best laptops I've tested, like the Dell 14 Plus or Lenovo Yoga 9i, which both use the Core Ultra 7 256V or 258V. Again, I would never recommend someone buy a laptop like this just to play games on, but they can technically play games. Heck, I even happily played Baldur's Gate 3 on a MacBook Pro last year.

Buying directly from the manufacturer is always the safest way to go, whether that's Asus, Dell, HP, or Lenovo. But if you're hunting for the best deal, as you should be, you'll need to check around at third-party retailers. Best Buy has the best selection of gaming laptops, and does a good job of weeding out listings from unknown brands, too. It has some really good deals, too.

Amazon is similar, though I'd advise you to tread a bit more carefully. Searching for “gaming laptops” can lead you to some seemingly cheap gaming laptops that you really shouldn't buy. Stick to the name brands, and you'll be OK. On Amazon, you also need to watch out for the “Renewed” label, which indicates that it's refurbished. Lastly, make sure to check the seller when shopping on Amazon and double-check that you're buying from the manufacturer.

Aside from the big two, I'd also recommend checking out Newegg and Walmart, both of which sometimes have decent deals on gaming laptops. Walmart has the same problem as Amazon with junky, super-cheap listings, and even Newegg keeps listings up like this. Calling this a gaming laptop is wildly misleading.

If you're lucky, there's a Micro Center near you (or something similar), which is a great place to go and play around with the latest gaming laptops so you can get a proper feel for them before dropping a wad of cash.

Lutnick claims deal talks with Taiwan are advancing as the Trump administration turns up pressure on chipmakers to onshore advanced fabs.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Saturday that a major semiconductor deal with Taiwan is coming “pretty soon,” signaling a potential breakthrough in U.S. efforts to shore up domestic chip production and reduce reliance on a single, geopolitically vulnerable supplier. The comment came during an interview with NewsNation, where he also set an ambitious target of increasing U.S. chip production to 40% of national needs before he leaves office.

Speaking about “... countries that need to react correctly to America,” in reference to U.S. trade policy, Lutnick said, “You still have Taiwan. That's a big one that's coming, I think, pretty soon. I expect to really be talking to them and sorting that out.”

Lutnick framed the stakes in blunt geopolitical terms. “The Chinese have said, ‘we're going to take Taiwan,'” he told NewsNation. “They're not even shy about it.” That threat, he says, is exactly why semiconductor manufacturing cannot remain concentrated on “an island 80 miles from mainland China” that makes “95% of our chips.”

These comments echo long-standing concerns about overdependence on Taiwan's advanced foundries, particularly TSMC, which produces around 90% of the world's leading-edge chips below 10nm. But the 95% claim could overstate Taiwan's overall role. While the island is essential for high-performance CPU and GPU silicon, it accounts for around 44% of logic chips and 24% of memory chips that enter the U.S. market, according to a November 2023 working paper published by the U.S. International Trade Commission.

Still, the Trump administration is pushing hard to increase domestic manufacturing. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed under the Biden administration, is now being reinterpreted through a harsher lens. A proposed 1:1 chip rule would require companies to match every imported chip with one made domestically or face 100% tariffs, a major pivot from subsidies to leverage as U.S. officials seek lasting supply chain independence.

Lutnick's comments concerning a Taiwan deal suggests the administration is now looking to formalize or expand its partnership with TSMC, which is already building two fabs in Arizona and, in March, pledged $100 billion toward U.S. investments over five years. That includes packaging and R&D infrastructure, but not yet a commitment to bring its most advanced 2nm-class platforms to the U.S.

If — and it's a big if — an upcoming deal leads to TSMC bringing state-of-the-art node production to the U.S., it would mark a monumental shift in where leading-edge silicon is fabricated. TSMC is already producing N4 chips at its Arizona facility and plans to support N3 and then N2 by 2028-2029 at Fab 21, but locking in leading nodes will be tricky.

Taiwan's government has already signaled resistance to transferring its most advanced technology abroad, saying that it will ensure TSMC will “keep its most advanced manufacturing processes in Taiwan” under the proposed N-1 policy.

Make chips in the U.S., or pay tariffs.

The U.S. government is evaluating a plan to tax imported electronics based on the number of chips they contain and their estimated value within the device, according to Reuters. This plan, which is still under internal review, could impact everything from basic gadgets like the Apple Watch to high-end servers, marking a shift toward chip-specific trade penalties. However, there are obvious difficulties associated with implementing such tariffs.

The proposed system would calculate tariffs as a percentage of the estimated value of semiconductors within a product. A preliminary version under consideration suggests rates of 25% for chip-dense imports and 15% for devices originating from Japan or the EU. Although still uncertain, the numbers indicate a shift toward creating a tiered tariff system based on origin and chip usage intensity.

In addition, the Trump administration is also working on a policy that would require chipmakers to produce one chip in the U.S. for every one they import into the country, or face steep tariffs, potentially as high as 100%. The plan ties tariff exemptions to actual production volumes in terms of unit count. However, the proposed 1:1 import-to-domestic ratio raises serious feasibility concerns due to the wide variation in chip types, from low-cost smartphone system-on-chips to high-end AI processors, making accurate tracking and fair enforcement difficult.

Major chipmakers outside the U.S., such as TSMC and Samsung, would be particularly exposed under the current draft of the plan, as while both companies have production capacities in the U.S., their production capacity in Taiwan and South Korea is dramatically bigger, and it hardly makes sense for them to match their American and domestic capacities.

Both policies aim to encourage (or rather, force?) chipmakers and chip designers to produce more chips in the U.S. However, such policies may create their own set of problems. Critics warn that the plan could exacerbate inflation, particularly given the current price pressures in the U.S. economy. Since chips are embedded in all electronic devices (even cheap kettles), a wide range of consumer products could become more expensive. Economists note that even goods assembled domestically might carry higher price tags due to increased costs of foreign components.

Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters the White House is opposed to broad exemptions, viewing them as weakening the intended pressure on industry players to localize operations. Apparently, while chip-making lithography tools from ASML are currently exempt from tariffs, the Commerce Department is at least considering tariffs on chip-making equipment, which could increase the costs of fabs in the U.S.

Many wind turbine blades in China are approaching retirement, and researchers have come up with a creative way to reuse the giant components.

In a study published earlier this summer in the journal International Soil and Water Conservation Research, scientists suggest repurposing decommissioned wind turbine blades in sand control measures. Namely, in sand barriers. The approach could be the solution to two problems: dealing with old blades and finding optimal sand control measures.

“Wind turbine blades with high strength and durability can be directly cut and drilled into sand barriers,” the researchers wrote in the paper. “This approach not only addresses the recycling challenges of decommissioned wind turbine blades but also mitigates the shortage of windbreak and sand stabilization materials in the desert and the Gobi areas.”

In arid and semiarid regions, wind can wreak havoc on both human and natural landscapes, and sand control measures such as sand barriers aim to decrease the resulting economic losses and protect habitats. While sand barriers such as those made out of reeds and branches are inexpensive, easy to construct, and environmentally friendly, they're short-lived and don't hold up well to extreme environments.

More effective artificial sand control materials don't offer perfect solutions, because they also face challenges in extremely windy areas along railways. As such, people sometimes turn to stronger barriers made of materials such as cement, metal, and rocky sand. Ultimately, the materials should be strong, long-lasting, wind-abrasion-resistant, thermally stable, available, reasonably priced, and with optimal porosity.

As for the wind power industry, the question of what to do with old wind turbine blades faces high costs and complex traditional recycling processes, in addition to the risk of pollution in the case of improper management.

As such, the researchers investigated the efficacy of sand barriers made from decommissioned or damaged wind turbine blades. “First, we tested the mechanical properties of this material, including ultraviolet (UV) aging resistance, thermal stability, bending strength, and erosion resistance,” the researchers explained in the paper. “Second, through wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations, we analyzed the shelter and sand stabilization effects of the new sand barriers with different porosities compared with traditional nylon net sand barriers.”

The approach revealed that the new barrier's erosion rate can be 56% lower than that of wood composite materials, and its bending strength was 14 times greater. The researchers also found that a porosity of 20% was the best for the reduction of sediment transport.

“Therefore, the new porous sand barriers made from decommissioned or damaged wind turbine blades possess excellent UV and erosion resistance, high strength and thermal stability, recyclability, and long service life,” the researchers concluded. “It combines the porous structure of flexible sand barriers with the strength of rigid sand barriers, making it well-suited for regions with strong winds, large temperature variations, and intense UV radiation, which has significant potential for application in sand control practices.”

The study is the ultimate reminder of an age-old saying—one person's trash is another person's treasure. Or, in this case, one industry's trash is another's solution.

“One of the key things to understand about cybersecurity is that it's a mind game,” Ami Luttwak, chief technologist at cybersecurity firm Wiz, told TechCrunch on a recent episode of Equity. “If there's a new technology wave coming, there are new opportunities for [attackers] to start using it.” 

As enterprises rush to embed AI into their workflows — whether through vibe coding, AI agent integration, or new tooling — the attack surface is expanding. AI helps developers ship code faster, but that speed often comes with shortcuts and mistakes, creating new openings for attackers.  

Wiz, which was acquired by Google earlier this year for $32 billion, conducted tests recently, says Luttwak, and found that a common issue in vibe coded applications was insecure implementation of the authentication — the system that verifies a user's identity and ensures they're not an attacker. 

“That happened because it was just easier to build like that,” he said. “Vibe coding agents do what you say, and if you didn't tell them to build it in the most secure way, it won't.” 

Luttwak noted that there's a constant tradeoff today for companies choosing between being fast and being secure. But developers aren't the only ones using AI to move faster. Attackers are now using vibe coding, prompt-based techniques, and even their own AI agents to launch exploits, he said.  

“You can actually see the attacker is now using prompts to attack,” Luttwak said. “It's not just the attacker vibe coding. The attacker looks for AI tools that you have and tells them, ‘Send me all your secrets, delete the machine, delete the file.'” 

Amid this landscape, attackers are also finding entry points in new AI tools that companies roll out internally to boost efficiency. Luttwak says these integrations can lead to “supply chain attacks.” By compromising a third-party service that has broad access to a company's infrastructure, attackers can then pivot deeper into corporate systems.  

That's what happened last month when Drift — a startup that sells AI chatbots for sales and marketing — was breached, exposing the Salesforce data of hundreds of enterprise customers like Cloudflare, Palo Alto Networks, and Google. The attackers gained access to tokens, or digital keys, and used them to impersonate the chatbot, query Salesforce data, and move laterally inside customer environments. 

“The attacker pushed the attack code, which was also created using vibe coding,” Luttwak said.  

Luttwak says that while enterprise adoption of AI tools is still minimal — he reckons around 1% of enterprises have fully adopted AI — Wiz is already seeing attacks every week that impact thousands of enterprise customers.  

“And if you look at the [attack] flow, AI was embedded at every step,” Luttwak said. “This revolution is faster than any revolution we've seen in the past. It means that we as an industry need to move faster.” 

Luttwak pointed to another major supply chain attack, dubbed “s1ingularity,” in August on Nx, a popular build system for JavaScript developers. Attackers managed to unleash malware into the system, which then detected the presence of AI developer tools like Claude and Gemini and hijacked them to autonomously scan the system for valuable data.  The attack compromised thousands of developer tokens and keys, giving attackers access to private GitHub repositories.  

Luttwak says that despite the threats, this has been an exciting time to be a leader in cybersecurity. Wiz, founded in 2020, was originally focused on helping organizations identify and address misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security risks across cloud environments.  

Over the last year, Wiz has expanded its capabilities to keep up with the speed of AI-related attacks — and to use AI for its own products.  

Last September, Wiz launched Wiz Code that focuses on securing the software development lifecycle by identifying and mitigating security issues early in the development process, so companies can be “secure by design.” In April, Wiz launched Wiz Defend, which offers runtime protection by detecting and responding to active threats within cloud environments.  

Luttwak said that it's vital for Wiz to fully understand the applications of their customers if the startup is going to help with what he calls “horizontal security.” 

“We need to understand why you're building it … so I can build the security tool that no one has ever had before, the security tool that understands you,” he said. 

The democratization of AI tools has resulted in a flood of new startups promising to solve enterprise pain points. But Luttwak says enterprises shouldn't just send all of their company, employee, and customer data to “every small SaaS company that has five employees just because they say, ‘Give me all your data, and I will give you amazing AI insights.'” 

Of course, those startups need that data if their offering is going to have any value. Luttwak says that means it's incumbent upon them to make sure they're operating like a secure organization from the start.  

“From day one, you need to think about security and compliance,” he said. “From day one, you need to have a CISO (chief information security officer). Even if you have five people.” 

Before writing a single line of code, startups should think like a highly secure organization, he said. They need to consider enterprise security features, audit logs, authentication, access to production, development practices, security ownership, and single sign-on. Planning this way from the start means you won't have to overhaul processes later and incur what Luttwak calls “security debt.” And if you aim to sell to enterprises, you'll already be prepared to protect their data. 

“We were SOC2 compliant [a compliance framework] before we had code,” he said. “And I can tell you a secret. Getting SOC2 compliance for five employees is much easier than for 500 employees.” 

The next most important step for startups is to think about architecture, he said.  

“If you're an AI startup that wants to focus on enterprise from day one, you have to think about an architecture that allows the data of the customer to stay … in the customer environment.” 

For cybersecurity startups looking to step into the field in the age of AI, Luttwak says now's the time. Everything from phishing protection and email security to malware and endpoint protection is fertile ground for innovation ‚ both for attackers and defenders. The same is true for startups that could help with workflow and automation tools to do “vibe security,” since many security teams still don't know how to use AI to defend against AI. 

“The game is open,” Luttwak said. “If every area of security now has new attacks, then it means we have to rethink every part of security.”

There is an easy solution to this --- it is called "context sensitive" advertising. And the idea is simple --- ads are prioritized based on what you're currently viewing, not your viewing history (aka "personalized ads").What's wrong with "personalized ads"?  They are fundamentally rooted in the past --- and the past is often no longer relevant.  Just because I searched for a car last week doesn't mean I haven't bought one already --- so why am I seeing auto ads when I search for pet supplies?. But if I'm currently looking at an auto dealers web site, the odds are pretty good that I'm still interested in buying one.What's wrong with advertisers? Without any real proof, they have bought into this vision of advertising that is illogical, ineffective and simply not true in many cases --- the idea that personal browsing history is a good indicator of the future.In the process, they have surrendered their ad budgets to a "black box" process that they have no insight into or control over and can be easily manipulated against them.So why do I care?  Because we *all* pay a price for this.

In practice, that's most of them. Privacy Badger by itself is an OK ad blocker.Also, you can easily tell Privacy Badger to block sites.Privacy Badger warns you that blocking certain domains, such as Google Tag Manager (otherwise known as Google Backdoor Hostile Javascript Injector) will break some sites. In practice, this seems not to be a problem. I've had Google Tag Manager blocked for years.

Before that, there were classified ads in papers.  Those were lightly vetted by the local newspaper.  Also, with a warrant, the police could generally track down the person that placed the ad, which broke a lot of bullshit scams.

Yes, and anecdotally I've heard of better experiences using services that do not appear on the top search results. The reason being that the top results have already captured the local market and so are less incentivized to respond quickly, accept the job or task, or offer a better rate. They already have their business and may not need yours.

You're right, they'll find whatever incumbent cleaner instead. A marketing ban is something that all incumbents would love, because they don't need to attract more customers whereas marketing is basically the only way that upstarts can get a foothold.

The modern web was designed by predatory middlemen who want a cut of transactions they otherwise have no business being involved in.  It's a textbook case of rentier capitalism.So what needs to change is that we need to identify the design decisions made by those middlemen, rip them out root and branch, and fix the gaps with something that takes as an input the trust graph of the users so that the only way the middlemen can stay relevant is to personally gain the trust of each user whose transaction they've gotten in the middle of, and we need to publish the result as a protocol, not a platform, so it can be used without us (the authors of the protocol) being at risk of becoming the problem we're trying to solve.

So... this intuition is wrong.Across... well, basically every category of product... the product which you are most likely to purchase next is the same (or a substitute for or a complement to) the last product you purchased. Anyone who has ever worked in retail analytics will tell you this.Advertisers want to minimize their ad spend, so they always try to sell you first on the product which you have the highest propensity to buy. That's why they want personalized ads. The ROI is astronomically higher than for contextual ads.(That's why the DMA's prohibition on Facebook's pay-or-consent model, and HN's general cheerleading of it, is such a joke... and that's before you even get into the adverse selection problem of people willing to pay to avoid ads)There are plenty of greedy people in business. Rest assured: If cost of personalized grew to the point that ROI dropped below contextual ads, advertisers would switch to contextual ads in a heartbeat. They're A/B testing all the time, and it wouldn't take long at all for them to figure that out.

Targeted ads are definitely better for the publisher, but hard to automate (the matchmaking between publishers and advertisers is less automated), but the percentage of ad spend that goes to the publisher is much higher, and the quality of each ad impression is higher.There's some win for targeting on the margins, where there's no good place to buy ads.Also, there's an infinite inventory of targeted ad slots (like invisible windows displayed by malware or redirect spam), which could be better than display ads, where you might not be able to spend your marketing budget, at least in theory.

Havent almost everyone including MKBHD said youtube ads doesnt give them enough to be used as the only revenue.Contextual ads are more effective. You type shoes, you get shoes ads. It doesnt first need the shoe data and then later show shoe ads after you started searching for socks. And with no middlemen,more profitable. Duckduckgo employs this IIRC.Behavioural ads are easy cos you are setting up an api. Contextual ads would mean you need a worthy product and having to handle your ad folks yourself. You cannot buy a domain and immediately start showing ads.Behavioural ads breakeven because they sell your data. Not ads.The whole reason why new media outlets moved to subscription model is bizarre to me. They could've just started doing it old school and it would have made news open and more privacy friendly.

Channels like MKBHD (and LTT) need more revenue than what they get from YouTube ads because their expenses have greatly increased, particularly staff.You can't automate contextual ads in news media, otherwise you get airline ads next to stories about airplane crashes. Or travel ads for places experiencing natural disasters or political upheaval. People pairing ads with stories increases the labor costs and there's already not enough money being paid for actual journalism to increase the cost of having ads.

Everyone (except Amazon) just accepts "personalized" as the default --- mainly because there is no credible, large scale, organized, generally available alternative to compare it to.

1. You can easily argue that these "context sensitive" ads are actually personalized ads: They're personalized based on the search query you just made! Amazon context ads are the same as Google/Apple App Store "context ads". Suppliers are paying for higher ranking.2. It's a shopping website! Of course those context ads are going to have high ROI because they're showing an ad relevant to the thing you're shopping for!When people talk about context ads, they mean "Why doesn't Facebook or the local newspaper use context ads?"  They don't mean "Why doesn't Target put up a coupon for beans in the beans aisle?"

And this number is produced even with the edge case you brought up! Targeting is just that good.Advertising is also not just product advertising, as in, "we would like to purchase this exact product". Advertising spaces are also contested, so, if one brand doesn't buy it, maybe a competitor will. Advertising also increases mindshare - you might not buy another new car of course, but people are still influenced by what they see. Brands are also bolstering their image with ads, regardless if you particularly buy or not. They are associating situations, lifestyles, emotions with their brand.What I'm trying to get at is incentive. The incentive is huge, and measurable, from the advertiser standpoint. And so, we will never get rid of targeted ads, unless we legislate, and enforce.

They require more effort on the part of the site that produced the content, but are much more lucrative for that site.Since most of the internet has been low-effort algorithmic slop for the last twenty years, tracking ads are more popular.  They let low quality sites “steal” audience impressions from higher quality sites by displaying ads to people that happened to visit both sites.I think personalized ads / algorithmic targeting (and even collecting the datasets that enable it) should be banned.

Your browsing history gives a more reliable base to segment you based on buyer profiles (incl age groups, location, interests), figure out your "intent" and target ads based on it. If you were to, say, read a random "Top 10 cars with highest resale value" article, on its own without historical data it won't be of any use for targeting because they don't know if you're actually a potential buyer in the market or just some teenager passing their time. Showing you those ads will waste their $$ if it were the latter.This isn't in any way an endorsement of their intrusive advertising practices, by the way - I personally have been using ad blockers and aggressively taking every step possible to avoid all online advertisements for more than a decade. It's just to provide a perspective on why it's not so simple.

Those trackers, such as Facebook and Google, aren't loaded at all, so they are unaware of the request that was not tracked.What you are advocating is loading those libraries, etc., anyway and allowing them to have their way with your browser session. This will always be less private than not doing it. Even Tor Browser has all sorts of protections from these types of things in place, which you would need far less of if you just blocked these tracking libraries to begin with.Yes, theoretically, my blog or The New York Times could start profiling the missing requests and send them over to Facebook through the back-end, which is what is referred to as 'server-side tracking' in the industry, as far as I know. However, the chances of most websites doing this are slim, as it requires at least some effort on the server side. The way these websites usually do this is by passing along the account information they have on you, such as e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc. Even if you signed in on some site with Tor, they'd still send those things along if they had gone through this trouble.Ironically, even Tor relies on clearing cookies, disabling JavaScript, and blocking specific requests to protect your identity, not just the origin obfuscation. So, the thing you are claiming makes it easier to track you, and suggesting that Tor is the solution is somewhat at odds.

DJI, the biggest commercial and consumer drone manufacturer in the world, lost its case against the Federal Government after U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ruled against the company. According to the South China Morning Post, the court agreed with the Department of Defense, stating that it had sufficient evidence to include the drone maker in the Section 1260H list, which designates certain institutions as “Chinese military companies.”

The company was first added to the Pentagon's list in 2022, and it sued the federal government over this designation last year. DJI claims that it's neither owned nor controlled by the Chinese military, and that it has “lost business deals, been stigmatized as a national security threat, and been banned from contracting with multiple federal government agencies.” Despite this loss, it said that it will continue operating in the U.S. and explore other legal remedies.

“While DJI is pleased that the court agreed with DJI and rejected most of DoD's purported justifications for listing DJI, we are disappointed that the court nonetheless upheld the listing,” a company spokesperson said in response to the ruling. “This decision was based on a single rationale that applies to many companies that have never been listed.”

Although being included in the list is not an outright ban, it makes doing business more difficult in the U.S. and could even lead to further, more drastic actions. In fact, the company narrowly escaped a proposed law that would have prohibited its sales within the United States. However, it must still undergo a security review in 2025 to prove that its products aren't a national security risk.

DJI has been facing these challenges due to its market dominance and its Chinese origin. Despite not creating military drones, lawmakers are concerned that, due to the ubiquity of its products in the American market, Beijing could force it to insert a backdoor in its products. This would allow the U.S.'s main rival unfettered access to its secrets, especially for drones used by the civilian government.

China-based DJI isn't the only company that has challenged the U.S. government over its designation as a Chinese military company. Hesai Group, which manufactures Lidar components for vehicles, also sued the DoD, with the same judge ruling against the company in mid-2025. It has since appealed the decision and is waiting for word from a higher court.

Basically, your head becomes a big Wiimote.

The first game that uses Apple's AirPods as a motion controller has been released on the App Store for iOS and iPadOS devices. RidePods – Race with Head delivers a fast-paced motorcycle racing experience, where head movements provide the control. Basically, your head becomes a big Wiimote. Developer Ali Tanis explains that he has become the first to launch an AirPods-controlled game after he successfully reverse-engineered the spatial audio feature of Apple's popular earbuds.

 




Tanis only came up with this idea a few weeks ago, when developing another app. It struck him that it might be possible to leverage the sensors powering Apple's spatial audio feature for other purposes, specifically for motion control. Of course, his hunch was correct.

After successfully reverse-engineering the spatial audio, a few weeks later, this motorcycle game was approved by Apple for inclusion in its walled garden App Store. Tanis explains that RidePods players control the game, where they race on a motorcycle, and you simply “tilt your head to steer.”

Sadly, I don't have AirPods to test RidePods. However, I downloaded the app and noted that there's an option to brake/accelerate by moving your head forward or backward.

App Store visitors are warned that “Without compatible earbuds, gameplay may not function as intended.” Specific models with spatial audio that are confirmed to be compatible include the Apple AirPods Pro and AirPods (3rd Generation) earbuds.

 




Beyond the headlining “World's First Earbuds-Controlled Motorcycle Racing Game” claims, the game is said to offer intuitive, fast-paced gameplay, with smooth and responsive handling. Players must dodge cars, trucks, and obstacles while chasing the highest score. You are challenged to beat your own records and push your limits in quick adrenaline-fueled racing sessions.

There are surely further possibilities for innovative apps to tap into the spatial audio API that Tanis has accessed.

This marks yet another developer who has tapped into an undocumented sensor in an Apple device to offer a unique experience. Earlier this month, we reported an engineer who tapped into Apple's hidden ‘LidAngleSensor' API in its MacBooks to create a creaky door simulator. Sam Henri Gold teased that this was just the beginning, and quickly followed up with a theremin (musical instrument) mode.

It's remarkable how quickly Proton Pass has evolved. The app is a little over two years old, and Proton has quickly moved to transform Pass from a bare-bones browser extension into one of the best password managers on the market. Major updates seem to show up every month or two. Even as I write this review, Proton launched an emergency access feature less than two weeks ago.

Proton didn't catapult to the top of the password manager stack solely because of new features. It has a clear, consistent commitment to updates, combined with the best free password manager plan I've seen and a robust system of apps you can get for a single price. Proton Pass can stand on its own, but it stands even taller as part of Proton's extensive suite.

Perhaps the greatest asset Proton Pass has is Proton itself. It's a company with a long history when it comes to security and privacy, and those same principles are at play with Pass, from end-to-end encryption to open source applications.

Proton Pass gives you a lot of flexibility in what you store in your vault, due in no small part to the fact that Proton gives you a ton of storage space. Every entry supports text fields, two-factor authentication codes, notes, and attachments. You get 10 GB of storage with a paid plan, but Proton shares your storage space across your Proton account. With the Unlimited plan, you have 500 GB of storage.

Broadly, there are five categories of entries: logins (including passkeys), aliases, credit cards, notes, and identities. Proton has several other starting points to choose from, including everything from medical records to API credentials, or you can start from scratch and add fields as you see fit.

Regardless of whether you choose one of Proton's starting points or start an entry from scratch, everything that falls outside of those five main categories is considered a “custom item," which can make organization a little tricky. I resorted to using vaults as my main method of organization. Proton caps the number of vaults you can create at 50, but I can't imagine a situation where you'd need more than that. Unfortunately, free users have access to just two vaults. With unlimited logins and cross-device sync, there had to be a catch somewhere on the free plan.

You can rename your vaults, but you can also assign them one of a few dozen icons, as well as choose from a handful of color presets. It's a small addition, but a little color-coding goes a long way in finding what you need at a glance.

Beyond logins, you can also generate and store email aliases, similar to NordPass. It's a standard feature, even if you don't subscribe. Free users are capped at 10 aliases, while paying users can create as many as they want.

It's not just a fake email tied to a real one. You can set up aliases like that, but Proton allows you to forward emails to multiple addresses, create catch-all addresses, and even reply directly from the web app. I appreciate the activity log most, though. Proton automatically creates contacts for everyone who interacts with your alias, and you can block spammy addresses without ever opening your email client.

Proton Pass was originally available only as a browser extension, but it now has apps for Windows, macOS, and even Linux, as long as you're on a Fedora- or Debian-based distribution. I mainly used Pass in the browser, not only because it's convenient but also because the extension is available on just about everything—Chromium-based browsers have access, and there are separate extensions for Firefox, Safari, and Brave.

The browser app has everything you need, and it works a treat when it comes to password capture and autofill. Proton occasionally asked me to save a password a second time after initially dismissing a capture notification. But outside of that small hiccup, I never encountered an issue with autofill for forms, logins, or credit cards.

Inside the app, you have a few features that aren't available through the extension. The key feature is Pass Monitor, which is Proton's security watchdog feature. It'll show you weak passwords, accounts where you can enable 2FA, and critically, accounts that have been victims of a data breach. If you want to go further, you can turn on Proton Sentinel, as well.

Pass Monitor is great, but breach notifications have a problem. By default, Proton only monitors the email associated with your Proton account. If you're importing passwords from another app, as I did, and you have different emails, those aren't a part of the monitoring by default. And Proton doesn't tell you that. You have to click into breach details and manually add addresses.

Proton includes a short setup process when you first open the app, and dark-web monitoring should be part of it. You can easily overlook manually adding your email and miss breach notifications. The app didn't show any breaches when I first started using it, but after manually adding a burner email for some logins in my account, I found it was involved in seven breaches. This really isn't the type of feature that should be left to chance.

That's my only issue with the desktop and web applications, thankfully. There are some useful upsides to these apps. You can unlock your account with a PIN instead of your account password, for example, which makes the 10-minute auto-lock less annoying to deal with. And Proton maintains a history of passwords it generates for two weeks, so you can look back in the event the capture fails and a new login isn't saved to your account.

Password managers are always a little spotty on mobile if that's not the primary place you create and store logins. Logins get associated with desktop URLs, and apps often redirect you elsewhere to log in. Proton Pass doesn't solve that problem—it can't—but it nails association. As I logged into apps with autofill, Pass silently associated whatever redirect I got on mobile to the proper login. It's not seamless, and until mobile apps are designed more purposely around autofill, it never will be. But even after a week of using Proton Pass, I was no longer stumbling upon pesky login fields.

By default, your vault locks on mobile after two minutes, but you can adjust the lock time from immediately up to four hours. You don't need to re-enter your password every time you need to unlock the app. It supports a custom PIN, along with biometrics on Android and Face ID on iOS.

My issue with the mobile app is that it only locks after the time you set. If you switch to another app and back to Proton Pass, your account stays unlocked. It even stays unlocked if you close the app completely and reopen it. The mobile app should lock immediately by default, or, at the very least, lock any time the app isn't pulled to the foreground.

Any password manager worth its salt uses end-to-end encryption, and if there's any company that knows a thing about end-to-end encryption, it's Proton. The company has received thousands of court orders over the years and has been unable to hand over data, and it has won challenges to such orders in a Swiss court. Its email service, Proton Mail, has been blocked in Russia for years, and India recently started cracking down on its use, as emails can't be decrypted or tracked. If Proton wants to store user data, lie about its encryption, and cooperate with the government, it's doing a pretty terrible job.

Proton Pass uses the same end-to-end encryption as Proton Mail. That's important in the context of password managers. It means that data is only ever encrypted or decrypted at rest. And to ensure a data breach wouldn't expose your passwords, Proton has, miraculously, not suffered a major data breach yet.

Proton Pass uses an asymmetric user key. It's a public-private key pair, and only you hold your private key. When you make a new vault, a vault key is generated that's encrypted with your user key. Items within a vault are encrypted with a random item key, which is then encrypted with your vault key, all with 256-bit AES-GCM. In short, Proton stores your data, but it doesn't have the means to decrypt that data, and that data can't be intercepted and decrypted while it's in transit.

This is a tried-and-true security model for a password manager. Proton Pass doesn't go as far as 1Password with its unique Two Secret Key Derivation, but it's still a secure, zero-knowledge model. Proton also has a stellar track record when it comes to user security and privacy, which is shocking considering how big a cybersecurity target is painted on its back.

At first glance, there's one weak point in Proton's security when it comes to Pass: it's tied to your Proton account. You should be using a strong, unique password regardless, but a breach of one app could compromise others. Thankfully, Proton allows you to set an extra password specifically for Pass if you want.

You'll need to enter your Proton account password first, then your Pass-specific password, to unlock your vault. It's a hassle, but even in the unlikely event of a breach, and in the even more unlikely event that your Proton password is exposed, you'll still have a layer of security. Thankfully, you don't need to enter two passwords constantly. After authenticating, Proton Pass will automatically lock after a specified period of time (10 minutes by default). You'll need to re-enter your password by default, but you can set up a PIN, as well.

On the plus side, Proton Pass is open source. Surprisingly few password managers open source their applications, but Proton is among them. Even with a secure foundation, application bugs can expose user data. Proton takes that seriously. Most major password managers have some sort of bug bounty program—as does Proton, offering up to $100,000 for critical flaws—but open source applications make finding those bugs much easier, and they allow security researchers to find bugs before they become a bigger issue.

Secure sharing is a standard feature in password managers, and the security model is fairly straightforward. Once again, a public-private key pair is at work when you share items or full vaults with Proton Pass. Unique to Pass, however, is Proton's Key Transparency system.

As battle-tested as public-key cryptography is, it's still susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks if an attacker can spoof a public key. It's a highly targeted attack that's out of the question for most users, but Proton still has a system in place to get around a potential attack. The Key Transparency system stores address keys connected to Proton users before they're hashed and anonymized, and stored on a private blockchain. It's a directory of users, just identified by keys and ciphertext instead of names and email addresses. When sharing with Proton Pass, the public key is checked against this ledger to ensure it's a legitimate user.

Proton Pass has grown up fast. It couldn't hope to match other password managers two years ago, and now, in some areas, it exceeds even the old guard. It has also taken up the mantle left in the wake of disastrous breaches with LastPass, offering a free, bare-bones password manager with unlimited login storage and cross-device sync.

As a paid password manager, Proton Pass still holds up. Individual and family plans are competitive with 1Password and NordPass and are a touch cheaper than Dashlane. The real strength comes through Proton Unlimited. Between a VPN, encrypted email, 500 GB of storage, and one of the top password managers on the market, it's hard to beat.

Your phone is usually attached to your hip (in terms of the recent iPhone 17's Crossbody Strap, I mean that literally). But in the comfort of your own home when you're trying to unwind and escape your phone with your favorite music, needing to stay in Bluetooth range for your headphones and wireless earbuds can be a little annoying. Qualcomm's audio engineers are trying to solve that issue by seamlessly switching to Wi-Fi if you travel away from your audio source. Sure, that sounds neat, but the tech implies a future where you won't even need any other device nearby to listen to your favorite tunes on your AirPods.

I can already hear the whining in the comments. The problem this feature hopes to fix is a very niche use case, but it's one that could end up in many next-gen wireless earbuds in the near future. I tested out this feature at Snapdragon Summer in Hawaii (full disclosure: travel and lodging were paid by Qualcomm, and Gizmodo did not guarantee any coverage as a condition of accepting the trip), dubbed XPAN for “Expanded Personal Area Network,” with a pair of nonspecific reference wireless earbuds used by Qualcomm. With the feature enabled, the buds work with the phone to detect if the device is in Bluetooth range. If you start walking away, they will automatically switch over to Wi-Fi.

In many ways, the tech is far more interesting than the end result. The wireless earbuds contained a Wi-Fi antenna, though neither the case nor the buds looked much different from what I've used in the past. I walked 30 feet away from the phone and back, and I didn't notice any interruptions in the song playing. The phone showed how it was swapping from a P2P (peer-to-peer) connection through various other connection types. A Bluetooth 5.3 connection range is technically close to 33 feet. While that means you won't lose connection walking from one end of the room to the other, intervening walls or—in my case—a crowd of bodies could interrupt that signal. XPAN merely expands the range to encompass everywhere there's a Wi-Fi signal.

Although wireless earbuds with the technology will be limited to local Wi-Fi, the technology could potentially allow you to listen to your device from “anywhere in the world” through a Wi-Fi access point. Dino Bekis, Qualcomm's general manager of connectivity, told me in a Q&A that there's no issue with latency on a Wi-Fi connection compared to Bluetooth. Modern wireless earbuds are already so damn good at cutting down on latency even when streaming high-bitrate lossless audio. Wi-Fi networks should be able to handle the 96kHz speeds necessary for lossless. It shouldn't matter if you're still using Wi-Fi 6 or the modern Wi-Fi 7 standard, either.

“Today, with XPAN, it's 96kHz 24-bit, but we see that evolving to 192kHz to be truly lossless,” Bekis said.

Qualcomm has talked up Wi-Fi audio connections for the past two years with its previous-gen S7 and S7 Pro platforms. The first wireless earbuds with XPAN built in were the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro released earlier this year. They support the 96kHz standard, though Bekis promised we should see more wireless earbuds soon enough with current or future S7 chips. Audiophiles would still extol the benefits of lossless and minimum latency. Regular folk who just want to listen to their tunes simply care that they need to be within close range of their paired music source. Still, the feature may end up being more useful for taking calls with your wireless earbuds than for listening to music.

Inevitably, it seems our wireless earbuds will become as connected as our phones are today. What that means for music listeners is a future where we connect to Spotify or Apple Music right from our wireless earbuds' or headphones' case, rather than needing to go through a phone. I don't think we'll need to wait long to see more wireless earbuds cases with screens used to control music. Hell, if you were longing for a device as dedicated to music as your old iPod, a Wi-Fi-enabled pair of wireless earbuds could fit the bill. You'll still have to pay your tithe to your favorite music streaming app, of course.

El Clásico Capitalino between Club America and Pumas was the marquee fixture of the weekend in Liga MX Apertura action, and Alejandro Zendejas turned it into his personal playground.

The USMNT star bagged a sensational brace as América dismantled Pumas 4–1 at the Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes. 

With the game still very much wide-open with América up 2–1, the Zendejas show began. In an action that he started splendidly, Allan Saint-Maximin left the ball for Zendejas near the edge of the box. Zendejas quickly looked up and then chipped a shot that arched beautifully into the top corner to score one of the best goals of the season.

To make it the goal even more impressive, it was legendary Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas who Zendejas chipped. América's No. 10 would go on to score from the penalty spot 10 minutes later to complete his brace and secure América's derby win. 

Zendejas's moment of magic left everyone in awe, including his teammates, who even compared his finish to one of Lionel Messi's most memorable goals. 

A post shared by Club América (@clubamerica)

Zendejas's goal and overall performance was incessantly talked about following the match. Club América vice captain Álvaro Fidalgo, who was seen completely amazed by the goal, took to social media to say it was one of the greatest goals he has ever witnessed in person.

But perhaps the biggest piece of praise came from Uruguay international Sebastián Cáceres. The Club América center back spoke after the match and recounted what he told Zendejas after the goal.

“That second goal, he chipped it, I told him, ‘you scored almost the same goal as the one Messi scored against Betis.' It was a great goal,” Cáceres said. “All I did was clap, there was nothing else I could do.”

Zendejas's strike eerily resembled the goal Messi scored for Barcelona against Real Betis to complete his hat-trick at the Estadio Benito Villamarín in 2019.

The 27-year-old Zendejas was a pillar for América in their historic run to conquer three consecutive Liga MX titles. After losing to Toluca in last season's final to end the streak, Las Águilas are once again  threatening to return to the top.

Zendejas has five goals and three assists through 11 games of the Apertura 2025 season. If he keeps up this level for the remainder of 2025–26, then the Tijuana born U.S. international should have a chance of making Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT roster for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Christian Pulisic continued his strong form for AC Milan in a a statement 2–1 win over reigning Serie A champions Napoli. In doing so, the Rossoneri find themselves top of Serie A after the result.

The U.S. men's national team star helped get the scoring started early with an assist, cutting into the box before delivering a low-driven cross to Alexis Saelemaekers for a tap-in opener in the third minute.

Later on, the 27-year-old bagged the eventual game-winning strike, firing a shot past goalkeeper Alex Meret after Strahinja Pavlović's blistering run allowed him to cut a ball back to Youssouf Fofana, who set up Pulisic's 31st-minute goal.

The two goal contributions brought Pulisic to four goals and two assists through the first five Serie A games of the season, leading the Italian top flight's Golden Boot race, and passing Kevin De Bruyne, who scored Napoli's lone goal from the penalty spot. 

Pulisic's total in all competitions also rose to six goals and two assists, having previously scored twice in the Coppa Italia.

Outside of Pulisic's two goal contributions, he also created two chances and completed 23 of his 24 passes before leaving the match in the 59th minute, as Milan saw out the win with 10 men following Pervis Estupinán's 57th-minute red card. 

“It feels incredible, honestly, just the spirit of the team, and the way we fought also after the red card, we really gave everything, and it's a special feeling now for us,” Pulisic said post-match.  “It sends a message, we're a good team, we're a strong team, we can score goals, but we can also defend like this, and we have a good spirit, so it shows a lot for sure.”

Pulisic and Milan now look ahead to another massive league match, as they prepare to face Juventus on Oct. 5, in a game that will feature, arguably, the two best players from North America in Pulisic and New York-born Canadian international Jonathan David. 

After that, Pulisic will likely turn his attention to the USMNT as head coach Mauricio Pochettino's group prepares for friendlies against Ecuador on Oct. 10 and Australia on Oct. 14, continuing to build momentum for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

GOAL reviews the major takeaways from Americans playing in Europe, including Pulisic's continued dominance

There's no slowing Christian Pulisic right now, and we're running out of superlatives for the American star. Simply put, he's a man in form.

Pulisic was once again the headliner in this weekend's slate of Americans Abroad, as the AC Milan star added a goal and an assist to his recent tally. With that, he's up to four goals and two assists in just four Serie A matches. Make no mistake about it: the U.S. men's national team star has been the league's best player to start this 2025-26 season.

He wasn't the only one with an assist this weekend, which turned out to be a fairly productive one for the USMNT stars in Europe. Gladbach's Joe Scally put on a show in the weekend's most chaotic game. Patrick Agyemang added another helper to his tally, too. And then there was Brenden Aaronson, who set up a goal, too, to silence some of the critics over in Leeds.

With USMNT camp looming, several Americans stepped up as the European season really gets into full swing heading into October.

Former Manchester United star and France's World Cup-winning defender Laurent Blanc has been relieved of his duties as head coach of Saudi Pro League giants Al-Ittihad. The decision came only a day after the reigning Saudi champions suffered a 2-0 defeat against Cristiano Ronaldo-led Al-Nassr. It was Al-Ittihad's third defeat in the 2025-26 campaign, which led to Blanc's sacking.

Yamal started on the bench against Real Sociedad and was introduced in the game just a minute before the hour mark. He came on and within a few seconds played a perfect cross for the Polish forward to score.

Arsenal stole a massive comeback victory deep in stoppage time at St James' Park as Gabriel rose highest to head home a 96th minute winner and close the gap on leaders Liverpool, in a massive statement early on in this season's title race. The home side had led through a Nick Woltemade header with Gabriel at fault for the goal but the Gunners fought back, substitute Mikel Merino guiding home a fantastic header before Gabriel powered home the winner.

Arsenal came into the game buoyed by Liverpool's defeat at Crystal Palace yesterday and began at a sprint, the home side did well to deny an early Gunners onslaught. Eberechi Eze forced the best from Nick Pope with two great saves in the first half, one particular save down low a major early moment after just six minutes.

Pope almost went from hero to villain soon after, though, as Viktor Gyokeres went through on goal and appeared to be taken out by the goalkeeper with the goal gaping. Referee Jarred Gillett pointed to the spot. But a VAR check would prevent Arsenal from scoring from the spot, as a review revealed Pope got the smallest of touches on the ball before taking down Gyokeres. No penalty.

Bukayo Saka caused the home side problems down the right and Leandro Trossard struck the post, before the game changed in the 34th minute as Newcastle took the lead against the run of play. Both of Arsenal's starting centre-backs would ultimately play a role in their downfall. First, Cristhian Mosquera sliced the ball out for a corner when a pass-back appeared simple. Then Gabriel went down at the slightest nudge from Woltemade, allowing the 6ft 6in striker a free run to head the ball into the corner of the net. Gabriel counted on a soft free-kick decision which would not come, and the Gunners were behind.

The Gunners searched for an equaliser in the second half but Pope was in inspired form once again when he kept out Jurrien Timber. Similarly to last weekend against Manchester City, though, Arsenal would simply not accept defeat. Merino headed home an inch-perfect Declan Rice delivery before Gabriel went from villain to hero with the final say deep in stoppage time, at the end of an enthralling encounter.

Club America's Alejandro Zendejas delivered a spectacular two-goal performance on Saturday night, punctuated with an audacious chip over Costa Rican icon Keylor Navas that put his side up 3-1 in a commanding 4-1 victory against rivals Pumas UNAM. The 27-year-old's masterful display continued his exceptional run of form in the Apertura 2025 campaign.

Ex-Chelsea midfielder Craig Burley has launched a scathing attack on his former club and their supporters following Saturday's loss to Brighton & Hove Albion.

Chelsea were beaten 3-1 after having another man sent off. Defender Trevoh Chalobah was dismissed in the second half, helping Brighton to complete a comeback and earn all three points.

The weekend before, it was Robert Sanchez who saw red in the Blues' 2-1 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

Sanchez did say sorry after the match, but Chelsea fans will still be angry with both him and Chalobah.

Chelsea went into this season with a lot of momentum after winning the Club World Cup in July.

However, Burley does not think it means much and has criticised Chelsea and their supporters for how they reacted to getting their hands on the trophy.

Speaking on ESPN FC, the 1997 FA Cup winner said: “This is a Chelsea side — and Chelsea supporters — who got carried away with this powderpuff Club World Cup nonsense, absolute nonsense. This here is their bread and butter. This here is what will define their manager, the Premier League. 

“So, you can forget all that world club, world club champions nonsense and all that. This is the crux of how their season will be defined and whether he [Enzo Maresca] will remain in a job.”

It is an interesting take. Had Chelsea got off to a good start in the Premier League, Burley could have easily been saying that the club's Club World Cup success has been a springboard for them.

Whatever the case, their start to the campaign has not been good enough, especially considering the teams they have played so far.

Jason Cundy has also torn into Chelsea following their second loss of the Premier League season.

Bayern Munich director of sport Max Eberl has been much more positive about Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph.

Before Bayern's recent 3-1 win against Maresca's side in the Champions League, Eberl stated that Chelsea deserved to win the Club World Cup and highlighted the energy that they showed during the tournament.

“I think Chelsea deserved to win the final, with their incredible energy,” Eberl said.

It is nice to hear, but the Blues cannot live off that forever. The competition is over and they now have to start picking up points in the Premier League.

Club America and USMNT midfielder Alejandro "Alex" Zendejas was disrespectful to a CONCACAF legend on Saturday night when he lobbed Keylor Navas to complete a brace in a 4-1 win over UNAM Pumas.

America led Pumas 2-1 in the 74th minute when Zendejas drove the middle and laid the ball wide to Allan Saint-Maximin on the left, drifting back into space to receive a return pass from the former Newcastle United wizard.

MORE — USMNT upcoming schedule, latest results

Zendejas, 27, has been red-hot and is clearly feeling it, as the Juarez-born American international spotted Navas in a tough spot and chipped a shot inside back post, He'd later convert an 83rd-minute penalty to complete his brace.

The United States men's national team has some audacious attackers and Zendejas is a man in-form as Mauricio Pochettino eyes his World Cup roster for next summer.

Zendejas has a goal or an assist in his last five Liga MX matches dating back to August 30, piling up four goals and two assists in that run.

Somebody notable is going to be left out of Pochettino's attackers for the 2026 World Cup, and Zendejas is complicating an already tricky call.

Zendejas joins Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Diego Luna, Brenden Aaronson, and Giovanni Reyna as playmakers hoping to get time for the USMNT in the home soil World Cup.

Zendejas scored on his second cap for the Yanks back in 2023 but waited 15 months between his seventh and eighth caps, then another 10 months between caps 11 and 12.

His 13th saw him score against Japan last month, as his sizzling form wasn't cooled off between club and country.

Club America and USMNT midfielder Alejandro "Alex" Zendejas was disrespectful to a CONCACAF legend on Saturday night when he lobbed Keylor Navas to complete a brace in a 4-1 win over UNAM Pumas.

America led Pumas 2-1 in the 74th minute when Zendejas drove the middle and laid the ball wide to Allan Saint-Maximin on the left, drifting back into space to receive a return pass from the former Newcastle United wizard.

Zendejas, 27, has been red-hot and is clearly feeling it, as the Juarez-born American international spotted Navas in a tough spot and chipped a shot inside back post, He'd later convert an 83rd-minute penalty to complete his brace.

The United States men's national team has some audacious attackers and Zendejas is a man in-form as Mauricio Pochettino eyes his World Cup roster for next summer.

Zendejas has a goal or an assist in his last five Liga MX matches dating back to August 30, piling up four goals and two assists in that run.

Somebody notable is going to be left out of Pochettino's attackers for the 2026 World Cup, and Zendejas is complicating an already tricky call.

Zendejas joins Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah, Diego Luna, Brenden Aaronson, and Giovanni Reyna as playmakers hoping to get time for the USMNT in the home soil World Cup.

Zendejas scored on his second cap for the Yanks back in 2023 but waited 15 months between his seventh and eighth caps, then another 10 months between caps 11 and 12.

His 13th saw him score against Japan last month, as his sizzling form wasn't cooled off between club and country.

Speculation about Rodrygo's future at Real Madrid was a running theme throughout the transfer window.

While the player's entourage consistently maintained his desire to remain at the club, he was linked with sides seeking his profile for two main reasons.

First, his unusual end to last season under Carlo Ancelotti, in which he was absent during the final two months of competition. Second, his continuing struggle to secure an undisputed starting role, something he has never fully achieved at the club.

Clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, and Manchester City were heavily linked with a move for the 24-year-old Brazilian. But it appears that another European giant explored the possibility of signing Rodrygo.

Indeed, according to MARCA, Bayern Munich acted discreetly, tasking a trusted intermediary and agent to approach Real Madrid and gauge the club's position on Rodrygo.

Discussions even reached the subject of money. However, Los Blancos made their stance clear: at no point did they show real interest in selling Rodrygo. The player, for his part, also showed no intention of leaving.

The failure of the attempt was due less to finances and more to Real Madrid's conviction that Rodrygo remains an important asset. Because of this, negotiations never progressed between the two clubs.

Despite the club's faith in him and the player's decision to stay, Rodrygo has found minutes hard to come by under Xabi Alonso.

The manager agreed to grant the Brazilian's wish to play on the left wing, effectively creating a positional rivalry with Vinicius Jr, who himself has struggled to make an impact.

So far this season, Rodrygo has started only one of seven La Liga matches, totalling up to 122 minutes, plus starting in the UEFA Champions League fixture against Marseille.

Alonso has repeatedly stated that he counts on the Brazilian, but his actions have not always made that evident.

Against Atletico, Eduardo Camavinga and Franco Mastantuono were introduced before Rodrygo, even though Real Madrid were already chasing the game at the start of the second half.

Alonso maintains that competition will benefit the team, but it is unclear how well Rodrygo will accept sporadic starts, especially with the 2026 World Cup looming on the horizon.

The 2014 World Cup champion doesn't like the idea.

Getty Images

The beautiful game's ultimate spectacle, the FIFA World Cup, is poised for its most dramatic transformation yet. Recent discussions between football's most powerful figures suggest a future where the tournament expands to an unprecedented 64 teams.

This potential leap has not gone unnoticed by one of the sport's most respected voices, former World Cup-winning manager Joachim Löw, who has expressed serious reservations about the direction the game is taking.

Fans want to see, above all, high-level football.

Löw said.

Löw, who masterminded Germany's 2014 triumph, believes that the soul of tournaments like the World Cup and the European Championships lies in the high-stakes, elite-level clashes that capture the world's attention. He argues that this very essence is being diluted.

With the upcoming 2026 World Cup in North America already set to grow from 32 to 48 participants, Löw contends that this initial expansion alone compromises the tournament's quality by reducing the frequency of those marquee matchups.

The push for growth, however, shows no signs of slowing. In a significant meeting in New York, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and CONMEBOL chief Alejandro Domínguez explored the radical proposal of escalating to a 64-team format for the 2030 edition. Should this plan receive the green light, the footballing calendar would be dominated by a mammoth event featuring 128 matches—a staggering figure that doubles the number of games played in any World Cup from 1998 right through to the recent 2022 tournament in Qatar.

Donald Trump has suggested moving the 2026 World Cup out of US cities that could be deemed unsafe, but there's a catch.

In 2022, 11 US cities were awarded the right to host the men's FIFA World Cup next year, but just two months before the tournament draw is set to take place, President Trump has made a threat against cities he calls 'too dangerous'.

The POTUS spoke on September 23 in the Oval Office about the cities that may have to be reconsidered for hosting the games, because they are ‘a little bit dangerous'.

Namely, Democratic ones.

Advert

Seattle and San Francisco are two of the cities that were awarded the right to host, but of course, they do not support the president's immigration policies.

Trump had first guaranteed that the World Cup would be ‘very secure,' but then went on to say he would even strip host cities of matches at the first fight of being unsafe.

When a reporter mentioned Seattle and San Francisco - cities that are to host six games each - and asked Trump what he would do if those cities ‘did not cooperate' with him, he said: “Well, that's an interesting question, but we're going to make sure they're safe. They're run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing.”

Advert

Other cities that are to host games include Inglewood, Atlanta, Boston, Arlington (Texas), Houston, Kansas City, Miami, East Rutherford, and Philadelphia.

The 2026 World Cup will also be shared by three countries for the very first time, with games also taking place in Mexico and Canada.

Trump said of his stance on safety next year: “If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup, or for the [2028] Olympics … but for the World Cup in particular, because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it.

“We'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

Advert

However, social media fans have been left scratching their heads at his comments.

Mostly, because Trump doesn't even have the authority to relocate World Cup matches, as those are overseen by FIFA. Also, because a lot of other cities that have increased crime were not mentioned in his comments.

One person wrote on X: “Aren't the crimes happening in Utah and Texas?” as another said: “He means Blue cities. What, Trump's going to move the World Cup to Oklahoma?”

Advert

Someone else commented: “He's not allowed to move matches! Government interference is not allowed!”

According to The Athletic, FIFA's contracts with host cities reveal it ‘shall not have the right for ordinary termination' of the agreements.

In preparation, the cities are likely to spend a fortune on the area to prepare for the event- and with time running out, making a big change like this could be tricky.

Advert

But for many, it seems unlikely it'll happen, as Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove for Inglewood said, per the LA Times: “It's so laughable, it'll make you want to take a Tylenol.”

“No one is taking this seriously,” she added. “He has absolutely no power over that. The World Cup is not about Donald Trump. It's also not about the United States. So another distraction and another example of ego and ignorance.”

She said: “My hope is that this president would be focusing on making sure that the U.S. host cities have the infrastructure that they need.”

UNILAD has reached out to FIFA for comment.

In Bayern Munich's 4-0 routing of Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena on Friday evening, Tom Bischof was given his first Bundesliga start of the season, which was his first start for Bayern since the FIFA Club World Cup. He started in Bayern's 1-0 loss to Benfica in Charlotte back at the Club World Cup in what was an underwhelming performance from the whole team in the blistering North Carolina heat. His 90 minutes against Werder Bremen was a far different story.

Joshua Kimmich was just getting over an illness, and Aleksandar Pavlovic was an unused sub in the 4-0 win over Bremen as Vincent Kompany had one eye on Bayern's trip to take on Cypriote side Pafos FC in the Champions League midweek. It could prove to be a tricky contest, and the Belgian manager did what he could to try to ensure he has fresh legs for the encounter, providing the perfect opportunity for Bischof to show what he's worth, and he hardly put a foot wrong. He capped off his 90-minute shift in Bayern's midfield with a lovely assist to Konrad Laimer late in the match in what was the German Rekordmeister's fourth of four goals on the night.

Speaking after the match, keeper Manuel Neuer was full of praise for Bischof, noting that the 20-year-old has been putting maximum effort into the training sessions at Säbener Straße. “He always gives it his all in training and is a special player who can be very dangerous in the box. He has taken a good step with his starting debut today – for himself and for the team,” Neuer enthused (via @iMiaSanMia).

There was added impetus for Bischof to make the most of the opportunity given to him vs. Bremen, too, as it's going to get tough for him to get solid minutes once Jamal Musiala makes his return from a lengthy injury layover at some point in November. Kompany is relatively spoiled for choice in attack with Harry Kane, Michael Olise, Nicolas Jackson, an in-form Serge Gnabry, and even Lennart Karl, who has come on and made an impact on more than one occasion.

Nonetheless, there will be more chances for Bischof as Bayern pushes across all three fronts. The fixtures list gets busy just before and after the winter holiday break and, by that point, we'll have a better idea of where Bayern stands in all competitions.

Bayern Munich was the home side in the Bundesliga on Friday when Werder Bremen came to town.

The Bavarians decimated the visitors 4-0 in a game that was never really close. Bayern Munich was relentless and dominant in every aspect of the match. It is not as if Werder Bremen did not try, but the players just could not match up with the machine that was Bayern Munich.

Let's get into all of the details — here is what we have on tap for this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works — Postgame Show:

A look at the starting XI — Tom Bischof and Leon Goretzka got the nod in the central midfield because Joshua Kimmich was sick.

A rundown of the scoring and substitutions.

Federico Valverde has been linked with a move to Manchester United over the last few days, and Real Madrid are now prepared to sanction his departure. 

A report recently claimed that Manchester United want to sign the 27-year-old central midfielder from Real Madrid. Now, Fichajes are reporting that the Spanish club is prepared to sanction his departure. Manchester United would be willing to pay close to €100 million (£87m) for him.

The 27-year-old has been exceptional for Real Madrid, and there is no doubt that he could improve Manchester United as well. It will be interesting to see if they can convince him to join the club. He will look to join an elite club where he will be able to fight for major trophies. The move to Manchester United might come across as a step down for him. They finished in the bottom half of the league table last season, and they have been quite poor this season.

Manchester United can forget about signing a player of his quality if they do not secure Champions League qualification for the next season. If they do, however, manage to get the deal done, it would be an exceptional acquisition. He is one of the best midfielders in world football, and he has been previously described as “irreplaceable”.

It remains to be seen how the situation develops. Manchester United will look to get back to the top of English football once again, and they need elite players to do so. The South American would be an exceptional addition, and he could transform them.

Valverde is at the peak of his powers, and this could be the right time for him to take on a new challenge and move to the Premier League. He will look to establish himself as a key star in English football.

The U.S. Under-20 men's national team has been forced into one roster change ahead of the U-20 World Cup. 

Gavin Beavers has replaced Diego Kochen on Marko Mitrovic's roster, U.S. Soccer announced Saturday. Kochen has been recalled by his parent club Barcelona following the injury to goalkeeper Joan Garcia. 

The Miami-born Kochen was slated to be Mitrovic's No. 1 goalkeeper for the competition, but is now set to Barcelona's No. 2 behind veteran Wojciech Szczęsny. Garcia was Szczęsny's backup but his injury forced Barcelona to make a decision. 

Kochen joined Barcelona in 2019 and has been alternating between the first and second teams over the past two seasons. He has yet to make a competitive appearance for the first team, but did sign a contract extension earlier this year. 

Beavers joins Duran Ferree and Adam Beaudry in the USMNT U-20 goalkeeping corps for the start of the U-20 World Cup in Chile. A former Real Salt Lake academy player, Beavers has previously represented multiple U.S. youth national teams. 

He is currently at Danish club Brondby and made his competitive debut for the club earlier this year. 

The USMNT U-20's will take on New Caledonia in their group stage opener on Monday. 

Bummer, but good for Kochen. This age group is deep in talented GK's. Eyestone is in this age group as well. Will be interesting to see who becomes the #1 for our Olympic team in 2028. And who breaks into the USMNT in the 2030 cycle. Dont forget Chris Brady and Slonina are still young too.

The disappointing parts are one he isn't going to play for Barcelona he's just going to be the backup and two he's the best keeper we have with his feet. It would have been a chance to see proof of concept with skilled field players and a GK with passing and dribbling working together.

Coco Gauff needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to hold off Leylah Fernandez's valiant comeback attempt in the China Open third round.

Coco Gauff's title defense at the China Open remains alive -- but only after fending off a formidable challenge from Leylah Fernandez. The No. 2 seed led by a set and a break, then 5-2 with a match point in the decider but ultimately needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to gut out a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 third-round victory.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Gauff had not dropped a set to Fernandez in two previous professional encounters, both on hard courts, and one junior meeting. Those matches had been characterized by the Canadian's inability to maintain the offensive level needed to hit through Gauff for an entire set.

That changed on Diamond Court, where Fernandez produced nearly three hours of high-quality, front-foot tennis. At times, she gave Gauff a taste of her own medicine with remarkable defense. However, the defending champion rose to the challenge. After a knife-edge start to the third set which saw five consecutive service breaks, she pulled away -- and then, despite Fernandez pegging her back and threatening to pull off a remarkable comeback, Gauff held her nerve in the final two games of the match.

Gauff will face Belinda Bencic in the fourth round after the No. 15 seed came from a set and 3-1 down to defeat qualifier Priscilla Hon 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. Gauff leads their head-to-head 3-2, including 2-1 in 2025.

Twists and turns: As Gauff built a 6-4, 1-0 lead with a break in the second set, the match had followed much the same pattern as their previous encounters. Fernandez had her moments of brilliance, but Gauff was able to lock in during the longer exchanges and the most important points. She broke Fernandez for 3-2 lead after turning defense into attack over a 20-stroke rally, finishing with a sharply angled smash.

Though a pair of double faults allowed Fernandez to level at 4-4, Gauff responded immediately, reclaiming the lead with another spell of brilliant defense that drew a netted drive volley.

Fernandez kept coming, though, and took advantage of Gauff's first serve percentage dropping from 75% to 53% in the second set. She broke back for 1-1 in the backhand winner and saved three break points to hold for 3-2. At 5-4, a pair of remarkable points -- a finely-cut counter-drop and a phenomenal defensive point that ended with Gauff, for once, netting the short backhand -- enabled Fernandez to level the match.

The pair went toe-to-toe through the first half of the second set, unleashing their best tennis on return in a riveting stretch of play. Gauff broke through with the first hold of serve for 4-2, sealing it with the best point of the match -- another astonishing feat of defense that saw her thread an angled forehand pass past Fernandez. But serving for the match at 5-2, Gauff sent a forehand long on match point -- sparking another thrilling resurgence from Fernandez.

As Gauff's double fault tally rose to nine and her play grew passive, the 2021 US Open finalist seemed to have all the momentum to snatch her first ever win in their rivalry. But at 5-5, a familiar dynamic came into play again. Unable to hit through Gauff consistently, Fernandez netted a forehand on the fourth break point of the game. Serving for the match for a third time, Gauff made no mistake, with a bold serve-and-volley play sealing her third match point.

New balls key for Gauff: "She definitely played great tennis," Gauff said afterward. "I thought she was being aggressive, striking the ball pretty well. She wasn't really giving me much free points either. I wish I was more aggressive in some moments. I could tell she stepped up the aggressiveness in the second. I think in that 3-2 game on those break points, I should have put the ball deeper and maybe tried to get her to open up the court.

"The conditions were so slow, which I feel like she does well with that because she likes to take the ball so early. So I felt like my heaviness wasn't doing a lot with her as the balls got older. I found when I had new balls, I would win, like, two or three games in a row.

"I think the toughest part was just dealing with the conditions and trying to feel like I could hit through her, but I couldn't do that as well today as I felt like I did earlier this year."

Coco Gauff needed 2 hours and 45 minutes to hold off Leylah Fernandez's valiant comeback attempt in the China Open third round.

 Carlos Alcaraz maintained his seamless debut campaign at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships on Sunday, where he eased past Brandon Nakashima to reach the last four. 

 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings produced a stunning serving display and plenty of crowd-pleasing moments in a 6-2, 6-4 night-session triumph in Tokyo. Alcaraz powered 25 winners past Nakashima with his forehand alone to march into his ninth consecutive tour-level semi-final. With his Tour-leading 65th match win of the season, the 22-year-old Alcaraz equalled his personal-best tally in a single season (set in 2023).

 “It's great to go through, to play another semi-final,” said Alcaraz in his post-match interview. “It's special because it's the first time I am playing here in Japan and here in Tokyo, so to reach the semi-finals in my first appearance is something great.” 

 Even after some of the sublime shotmaking Alcaraz produced in a classy opening-set performance, the Spaniard arguably saved his best for last inside Ariake Coliseum. Having let slip three match points on return at 5-3 in the second set, he reeled off four consecutive winners in the next game to wrap his win with a flourish. 

 “I always say that closing a match is difficult. Even tougher when you had match points, like I did when I was returning,” said Alcaraz. “Losing that game, I thought it was going to be really difficult, but I just tried to maintain my focus and play some great points in the last game. I don't think I've played a last game like this, so I'm really happy about it.”

 Now 50-3 since April, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Alcaraz will take on Casper Ruud for a spot in the championship match. The fourth-seeded Norwegian earlier raced to a 6-3, 6-2 victory against Aleksandar Vukic. 

 “Probably [it's the best period of my career]. I'm just feeling great on court, every time I step on the court,” said Alcaraz. “I just think I can do everything. I'm approaching the end of the season with a lot of confidence and these kinds of matches, this kind of level, helps a lot to keep the confidence high. 

 “I'm just trying to set up goals before matches, before tournaments, and trying to follow those goals. I think that helps me a lot to play great tennis and maintain the focus during the match.” 

 Alcaraz leads Ruud 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, with one of those victories coming in the 2022 US Open final. Yet the Norwegian triumphed in straight sets in the pair's most recent meeting, at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals, and he produced a commanding quarter-final win of his own in Tokyo, where he needed just 58 minutes to sink qualifier Vukic.

 In the bottom half of the draw, Taylor Fritz and Jenson Brooksby will contest an all-American semi-final. The second-seeded Fritz edged Sebastian Korda 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-3. The champion in Tokyo in 2022, Fritz moved one spot above Novak Djokovic to fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin by defeating Korda. 

 The World No. 86 Brooksby notched a 6-3, 6-3 upset of third seed Holger Rune to seal his semi-final spot. With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against Rune, the 24-year-old Brooksby improved to 9-1 in ATP Tour quarter-finals.

Jenson Brooksby has a unique game, and in Tokyo on Sunday he continued to build on a unique stat, improving to 9-1 in his career in ATP quarterfinal matches with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Holger Rune.The 24-year-old American was asked in his on-court interview about the stat, and he came up with a possible explanation for it."Once I get on a roll from a couple of matches, I just think I'm really able to get into my zone. I think that's one of my big strengths," he said. "I don't like to think about the records and stuff, but I think that shows."And there's more—in his only career loss in an ATP quarterfinal, a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 defeat to Christopher O'Connell in San Diego in 2022, he actually held two match points with the Australian serving at 3-5 in the third set.JENSON BROOKSBY IN ATP QUARTERFINALS: 9-1d.

The 24-year-old American was asked in his on-court interview about the stat, and he came up with a possible explanation for it."Once I get on a roll from a couple of matches, I just think I'm really able to get into my zone. I think that's one of my big strengths," he said. "I don't like to think about the records and stuff, but I think that shows."And there's more—in his only career loss in an ATP quarterfinal, a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 defeat to Christopher O'Connell in San Diego in 2022, he actually held two match points with the Australian serving at 3-5 in the third set.JENSON BROOKSBY IN ATP QUARTERFINALS: 9-1d.

Rune and Brooksby went toe-to-toe with their big groundstrokes from the start on Sunday, but Brooksby drew first blood—from 2-3 in the first set, he reeled off five games in a row to build a 6-3, 1-0 lead.Rune struck back with three games of his own to go up 3-1 in the second set, but Brooksby caught fire again with another five games in a row from there to snatch the one-hour, 30-minute victory.At the end of the day, Brooksby was just too solid, finishing with an almost-even 10 winners to 12 unforced errors in the match. Meanwhile, Rune had 15 more unforced errors (35) than winners (20).The two were playing each other for the first time."I thought I had a pretty good plan on him coming out here," Brooksby said. "I had never played him before, but I think that's good maybe, someone who hasn't faced my unique skills, I guess. I had a good rhythm from the first two matches and thought I was playing really good tennis, and I think I just stayed a little bit more consistent today."The No. 86-ranked American's victory over the No. 11-ranked Rune was his fifth Top 20 win of the year, after beating Felix Auger-Aliassime (No. 18) at Indian Wells, Tommy Paul (No. 13) and Frances Tiafoe (No. 17) in Houston and Ugo Humbert (No. 20) at Eastbourne.It was also the milestone 10th Top 20 win of his career.

BEIJING (AP) — Lorenzo Musetti has become the latest tennis star to apologize to Chinese fans."I am truly sorry. I respect you deeply, I feel at home here, and I value the warmth and kindness I have always received from you," the 23-year-old Italian said in a message he posted Saturday on social media.Musetti was annoyed by coughing in the crowd during his round-of-32 win on Friday against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at the China Open in Beijing, where he shouted "these (expletive) Chinese are always coughing."That outburst prompted a flurry of outrage on social media, with people commenting on one of his previous Instagram posts to accuse Musetti of being a racist, along with insults and slurs against the Italian culture."I would like to sincerely apologize for what I said in frustration yesterday during my match," Musetti continued in Saturday's post. "My words were directed only at a few individuals in the crowd who were coughing repeatedly and disturbing the play. They were never, in any way, meant for the Chinese people. It happened in a moment of stress and tension in the second tiebreak, but still, this is no excuse at all."

He added: "I realize that the way I expressed myself was wrong and inappropriate, and it hurt many Chinese fans' feelings."American tennis star Taylor Townsend apologized on Sept. 17 for making disparaging comments about Chinese food before the United States played Kazakhstan at the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen, China.Townsend had posted videos of local dishes including bullfrogs and turtles and joked she would need to "talk to HR" about the quality of the food. She took to Instagram again to apologize after facing a backlash online and said "everyone has been so kind and so gracious."

That a movie like “Anemone” could only have been made by the forces of nepotism that govern it — it's directed by Ronan Day-Lewis, and co-written by his father and the film‘s star Daniel Day-Lewis — is not something to ignore, but this dark, dense, deep two-hander about the Troubles in Ireland turns out to be quite better than you'd expect from that notion. 

Daniel Day-Lewis stars as a former British soldier who defected from the Irish Republican Army after a particularly traumatizing incident involving a dead civilian, with his brother, played by Sean Bean, taking over his life in the process: his wife (Samantha Morton) and son (Samuel Bottomley), who in the present day has become a traumatized beater.

“Anemone” is a miserable movie top to toe, but it's directed with enough promising skill to suggest actual smarts and talent on the part of its director/writer. Ones that aren't only linked to its star, who comes back out from the acting retirement hole to deliver a performance that is typically great, with a monologue about taking an actual shit on a priest that formerly abused him (and spared his brother, Sean Bean) that goes up in the Daniel Day-Lewis hall of fame.

Or did he really do that? We are ever meant to question the narrative reliability here. While “Anemone” stutters in its final gasp of breath, with a closing segment that too tidily binds up its prickly narrative branches, the movie does manage to suck you into a whirlpool of pain and suffering that becomes oddly addictive.

“Anemone” isn't destined for box office gold, despite its star's seasoned imprimatur, the movie too cold to the touch and reliant on Irish-British history that forces you to listen closely to plot details expounded in drawn-out speeches. It's scored by Bobby Krilic, aka Ari Aster's composer Haxan Cloak, with what sounds like the indie-rock acoustic-and-synth tools of someone at the nadir of their life on the cold tile floor of the world's most depressing bathroom. It's shot by cinematographer Ben Fordesman with the style and grayed-out flourish of a supernatural horror movie, even as Ray Stoker's (Daniel Day-Lewis) traumas are completely grounded in the real world. He's contending with “a crack in the ice that wouldn't heal over” after fleeing, some years ago, to the woods to live out the rest of his days after being deemed a war criminal by his compatriots.

His brother Jem (Sean Bean) took on duties of caring for Ray's abandoned wife and child in the process, and now that grown-up son Brian (Bottomley) has himself been conscripted into the military, and was recently sent home for attacking a fellow serviceman for daring to speak his father's name. Or daring to speak the rumors around him, as Brian is not aware of the fact that the man he thinks is his father is actually his uncle. Ray lives in filth in a hovel outpost in the middle-of-nowhere woods of North England, filthy enough that it's noticed by Jem, who's been jettisoned to recover him in order to speak some sense into Brian after his latest brush with pain, that he can barely wipe his own ass. And even refuses to. “You're going to hell,” Jem tells Ray. “Family reunion!” Ray replies.

 










“Ever hear about the Troubles?” Nessa (Morton) bluntly asks her son after he brings a box of Ray's former war correspondences down from the attic. “Anemone” does not proceed to give us a history lesson about the particulars of the thorny battles between Catholics and Protestants, royalists and independents. In fact, if you're not caught up on your 20th-century European history, “Anemone” might not mean a whole hell of a lot to you, though Ronan Day-Lewis harks back to a bombing that emotionally scarred Ray with spareness and reserve.

There are also shots of Daniel Day-Lewis contemplating his own despair against the flickering flames of a bonfire that will bring “There Will Be Blood” and Daniel Plainview to mind, a man who has built up his hatred little by little over the years, and now has only venom to spew. “I did the crime, and I'm still serving the time,” Ray says at one point amid a spiky, literary screenplay that appreciates the lusciousness of good dialogue.

There is a hallucinatory late sequence in which Ray encounters a translucent dream creature that may or may not resemble his son; then, there is a hailstorm whose ensemble-linking gravitas recalls just a bit too closely that final frog-raining scene in “Magnolia,” a deus ex machina event tacked on to tie the whole thing together, but less pungent here.

 










While “Anemone,” which effectively captures the feeling of dropping a shot of coffee into your Guinness or the reverse, uppers and downers combined to maximal effect, is often too damp and dreary to a fault, the confidence behind the camera justifies the miserable ends. It's a movie about lost souls, and how abuse begets further abuse and violence, even as Ray, the self-styled fugitive, has abandoned his life to try and prevent his son from absorbing his worst aspects. 

This is a dense, unforgiving movie in the classic sense, an adults-only drama that doesn't placate despite its stylistic overreaches. It's disappointing that in its final moments, the movie has come so far off its own hinges, so deconstructed its own rivets, that it can't put them back together again. But everything that's come before is so rich that you're ready to forgive it. The title, by the way, comes from the flowers that bloomed from Ray's own father's planting. Ronan Day-Lewis seems to have plucked and pruned the best lessons from them, too.

“Anemone” premiered at the 2025 New York Film Festival. Focus Features releases it Friday, October 3.

Plus: Nine Inch Nails lands its highest-charting album in over a decade with the TRON: Ares soundtrack.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



Cardi B scores her second No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart as AM I THE DRAMA? debuts atop the tally (dated Oct. 4) with 200,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States in the week ending Sept. 25, according to Luminate. That marks 2025's biggest week for an R&B/hip-hop album by a woman. AM I THE DRAMA? is Cardi B's second full-length studio project, and follows her chart-topping debut, Invasion of Privacy, in 2018.


	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, Nine Inch Nails' soundtrack to TRON: Ares debuts at No. 5, marking the first top 10 for the band since 2013.

	











	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Oct. 4, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Sept. 30. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.




	Of AM I THE DRAMA?'s 200,000 first-week equivalent album units, SEA units comprise 110,000 (equaling 145.72 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs during the tracking week — it also debuts at No. 1 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 88,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 2,000.


AM I THE DRAMA?'s opening-week sales were boosted by its availability across an array of permutations. It was issued as a standard 19-song widely available digital download album; 20-song CD and vinyl editions; and a 23-song download and streaming edition. There were also further digital variants: an iTunes Store and Apple Music edition with bonus live video tracks, a 30-track artist webstore-exclusive edition and two widely available expanded editions (with 24 tracks each).


	The CD and vinyl variants for AM I THE DRAMA? were largely only available through Cardi B's webstore and through some independent record stores. AM I THE DRAMA? was issued on two standard CD variants (one signed by the artist), seven additional CD cover variants (four of them signed, inclusive of three versions with cover art showing gone-viral photos of the artist on the stand during her assault trial in August, dubbed the “courtroom edition”) and eight deluxe CD boxed sets containing merchandise and a CD. The album was also issued on two standard vinyl editions (one signed) and nine additional vinyl variants (some with different covers and/or color vinyl, most of them signed, including a “courtroom edition” cover variant).


	In addition to a typical promotional press run to raise awareness of the album's release, the artist also mounted a busy schedule of in-store appearances during release week, doing photo ops and meet-and-greets with fans purchasing the album. During release week, she hit four independent record stores (Looney Tunes in West Babylon, N.Y.; Spin Me Round in Easton, Pa.; DBS Sounds in Riverdale, Ga.; and Fingerprints in Long Beach, Calif.) and a Hot Topic location in Elmhurst, N.Y. and a Walmart in Cypress, Texas.

	











	The widely available editions of AM I THE DRAMA? contain the Billboard Hot 100-charted hits “Outside” (No. 10 peak in July), “Imaginary Playerz” (No. 70 in August), “Up” (No. 1 in March 2021) and “WAP” (featuring Megan Thee Stallion, No. 1 in August 2020).


	The chart-topping KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack holds at No. 2 with 104,000 equivalent album units earned (down 7%). The set also notches a 10th week inside the top two on the Billboard 200, marking the most weeks inside the top two for a soundtrack since the Frozen album logged 21 nonconsecutive frames in the top two (13 of them at No. 1) in 2014. KPop surpasses Encanto, which had nine weeks in the top two (all at No. 1) in 2022.


Morgan Wallen's former No. 1 I'm the Problem is steady at No. 3 (90,000 equivalent album units, down 7%) and Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Man's Best Friend is stationary at No. 4 (69,000, down 21%).


	Nine Inch Nails are back in the Billboard 200's top 10 for the first time in over a decade, as the band's soundtrack to the film TRON: Ares debuts at No. 5 (the highest debut of 2025 for a soundtrack) with 45,000 equivalent album units earned. Of that sum, album sales comprise 39,000 (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 6,000 (equaling 8.37 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. Nine Inch Nails have tallied seven top 10 albums on the Billboard 200: TRON: Ares, Hesitation Marks (No. 3 in 2013), Year Zero (No. 2, 2007), With Teeth (No. 1, 2005), The Fragile (No. 1, 1999), The Downward Spiral (No. 2, 1994) and Broken (No. 7, 1992).


	The first-week sales of TRON: Ares were aided by its availability across four vinyl variants, a cassette, two CD variants and a download and streaming edition (all containing the same tracklist).

	











TRON: Ares is the companion soundtrack to the film of the same name, which will be released on Oct. 10 in movie theaters, and is the third in the Tron film series. It follows Tron: Legacy (2010) and Tron (1982). The TRON: Ares soundtrack is the second Tron movie soundtrack to reach the Billboard 200, following Daft Punk's TRON: Legacy (which peaked at No. 4).


TRON: Ares was preceded by the album's single “As Alive as You Need Me To Be,” which has reached the top 10 on both Alternative Airplay and Mainstream Rock Airplay.


	Also, with KPop Demon Hunters and TRON: Ares at Nos. 2 and 5, there are two soundtracks in the top five simultaneously for the first time in more than six years. It last happened on the March 30, 2019 chart, when Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's chart-topping A Star Is Born was No. 3 and Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody was No. 5.


	Rounding out the rest of the latest top 10 on the Billboard 200: Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid rises 7-6 (35,000 equivalent album units, down 3%); SZA's chart-topping SOS climbs 8-7 (33,000, down 2%); Wallen's former leader One Thing at a Time steps 9-8 (32,000, down 3%); Justin Bieber's SWAG shifts 6-9 (just under 32,000, down 27%); and Bad Bunny's former No. 1 DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS climbs 13-10 (nearly 32,000, up 21%).

A fan was reportedly pepper-sprayed during a Turnstile concert in Richmond, Virginia last Wednesday, September 24. The Baltimore hardcore band closed their set at Brown's Island with “Birds” from their new album Never Enough, during which concertgoers are typically invited to join them onstage.

In a video circulated widely by CBS 6 News, one fan attempts to climb onto the stage, at which point they appear to be pepper-sprayed by a sheriff's deputy. Turnstile bassist Franz Lyons can also be seen covering his eyes and running towards the back of the stage.

On Friday, September 26, Richmond Sheriff Antionette Irving told CBS 6 that the alleged pepper spray incident is currently under investigation. In the same report, a spokesperson for the Richmond City Sheriff's Office also confirmed that local police department had been handling security at the Turnstile show.

When reached by Pitchfork, the Richmond City Sheriff's Office offered no further comment. Pitchfork has also reached out to Turnstile's representatives for for comment.

Turnstile are currently touring North America in support of Never Enough, with support from Speed, Jane Remover, Amyl and the Sniffers, Mannequin Pussy, and Blood Orange. The album was led by the singles “Never Enough,” “Birds,” “Seein' Stars,” and “Look Out for Me.”

	As AI talent studio Xicoia unveils its first digitally generated “actor” Tilly Norwood to Hollywood, the avatar's real-life peers have some opinions.


	Following Deadline's report that several talent agencies are interested in signing Norwood, Melissa Barrera, Kiersey Clemons and more actors have suggested a boycott of such agencies after Xicoia founder Eline Van der Velden teased during a Zurich Summit panel that high-profile projects will be utilizing the technology in the near future.


	“Hope all actors repped by the agent that does this, drop their a$$,” wrote Barrera on her Instagram Story with Deadline's report. “How gross, read the room.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Clemons echoed that sentiment in the comments section, writing, “Out the agents. I want names.”


	“Not an actress actually,” commented Nicholas Alexander Chavez. “Nice try.”


	“Hey @sagaftra any thoughts here?” wrote Jenna Leigh Green, following the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes that partially centered around acceptable AI uses.


Mara Wilson also raised an important point. “And what about the hundreds of living young women whose faces were composited together to make her? You couldn't hire any of them?” she wrote.


	Despite the dystopian vibes of the innovation that is Tilly, some voiced their disapproval with a bit of levity. “She was a nightmare to work with!!!!” wrote Lukas Gage in a comment. “She couldn't hit her mark and she was late!”


	“She threw coffee in my FACE!!!” wrote Odessa A'zion.

	











Trace Lysette added in her own comment, “She cut me in line at lunch one day and didn't even say excuse me. She won't get far.”


	Part of AI production studio Particle6, Deadline exclusively announced Van der Velden's launch of Xicoia this week at the Zurich Film Festival conference, designed to create, manage and monetize a new generation of hyperreal digital stars.


	“We were in a lot of boardrooms around February time, and everyone was like, ‘No, this is nothing. It's not going to happen,'” said Van der Velden during Saturday's panel, moderated by Deadline's Diana Lodderhose. “Then, by May, people were like, ‘We need to do something with you guys.' When we first launched Tilly, people were like, ‘What's that?' And now we're going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months.”


	Xicoia is focused on creating AI talent for use in everything from film and TV productions to podcasts, TikTok, YouTube, brand campaigns and video games – as well as interactions with fans. Operating on a hybrid model of human creative oversight and autonomous AI responsiveness, they'll come equipped with complete backstories, distinct voices, evolving narrative arcs and fully realized personalities, as well as the ability to engage in unscripted conversations, perform monologues, respond to trends in real time and adapt tone and references to suit platform-specific audiences.

There's a healthy tradition of comedians invading morning television. From Mark Proksch showing off his yo-yo skills as his alter ego, K-Strauss, to Gianmarco Soresi shouting out his “cousin,” Luigi Mangione, live on the air, the unexpected burst of darkness tends to catch morning news anchors off guard. With his brief but hilarious interview on Fox 5 San Diego, we can add Connor O'Malley to the list.

Popping in to promote his “Comedic Humor Tour” with the wake-up crew in San Diego, O'Malley brought his parody of lonely, disaffected, and deeply redpilled men to people just having their first cup of morning joe. O'Malley, known for his spoofs of the male loneliness problem and the terminally online, didn't shy away from his interests. He tells a perfectly game Raoul Martinez that his show is a “medical” one about curing pornography addiction and that he's working with the government to fight antifa. The comedian also doesn't shy away from Hollywood gossip, saying that Seth Meyers fired O'Malley from his job at Late Night for political reasons (O'Malley is a “Branch Davidian”), but that his old boss is “definitely a nice guy.” Whoever booked O'Malley deserves a raise.

The actress, who has previously spoken out against the author's anti-trans views, recently opened up about their relationship.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


J.K. Rowling is sharing her thoughts on Emma Watson‘s recent interview with Jay Shetty, where she addresses her relationship with the Harry Potter author following Rowling's anti-trans stances.


	On Friday, the controversial author responded to a clip of comedian Intel Lady spoofing Watson's recent conversation on the On Purpose With Jay Shetty podcast. “I'm already missing @intel_lady's Angela Rayner, but I'm here for ALL the spoofs,” Rowling wrote on X.




	While the Little Women star has previously spoken out against Rowling's anti-trans views, she told Shetty that she now tries to separate her relationship with the author from their differing perspectives. “I really don't believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have mean that I can't and don't treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with,” Watson said. “I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don't get to keep and cherish to come back to our earlier thing. I just don't think these things are either or. It's my deepest wish that people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with.”

	In 2020, as Rowling continued to criticize certain aspects of the trans rights movement, Watson shared on social media at the time, “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are. I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.”

	











	In response, the iconic author said she would not forgive Watson nor her Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe for going against her views.


	Watson played Hermione Granger throughout the blockbuster film franchise from 2001 to 2011.

"I'm sorry to those who will be disappointed by this," the singer wrote.

Lola Young is taking time to rest and recover after collapsing onstage during a recent performance in New York City.


	On Sunday (Sept. 28), the 24-year-old South London singer announced through social media that she would be canceling her scheduled performance at the All Things Go music music festival in Washington, D.C., set for later that evening at the Merriweather Post Pavilion.


	The announcement came just one day after Young collapsed mid-song during her Saturday night (Sept. 27) set at All Things Go at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, New York.


	“I'm sorry to confirm that I won't be playing all things go in DC today,” Young wrote on Instagram. “I love this job and I never take my commitments and audience for granted so I'm sorry to those who will be disappointed by this.”

	











	She added, “I hope you'll all give me another chance in the future. Thank you to all those who listen and care. To all the people that love to be mean online, pls give me a day off.”


	Following her post, fellow artists and fans flooded the comments with messages of support. Kehlani wrote, “Get better sweetie pie. take all the time u need!!!!” while Aurora added, “I am so happy to see these comments … I'm so glad you're doing what's right for YOU, it's very easy to forget when you feel so much responsibility … much love and hugs to the end of the world.”




	Young's onstage collapse occurred Saturday during a live performance of her 2023 single “Conceited.” Midway through the song, she appeared to pause to communicate with her keyboardist but collapsed before reaching them. Security and members of her team rushed to assist, surrounding her onstage. She remained on the ground for roughly 30 to 45 seconds before being carried off.


	Later that day, Young reassured fans through an Instagram Story. “For anyone who saw my set at all things go today, I am doing okay now,” she wrote. “Thank you for all of your support.”

A post shared by billboard (@billboard)


	The incident followed another last-minute cancellation two days earlier (Sept. 26), when Young was pulled from Audacy's We Can Survive concert at New Jersey's Prudential Center. Her manager, Nick Shymansky, shared an update at the time, citing a “sensitive matter.”


	“Lola is very open about her mental health and there are very occasionally days where myself and my team have to take protective measures to keep her safe,” Shymansky wrote on Instagram. “She is an incredible person and always takes her fans, career and performances seriously. I can only send huge apologies for the inconvenience caused.”

	As the sequel to society's digital rise and fall is currently in the works with Aaron Sorkin and Sony, don't expect Andrew Garfield to reprise his role in The Social Network Part II.


	Following his performance as Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin in the 2010 docudrama, which was directed by David Fincher, the 2x Oscar-nominated actor shut down a return for the upcoming sequel.


	“No, no,” Garfield told IndieWire. “Eduardo is in Singapore having a good time.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Indeed, Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Singapore in 2009, which he insisted “was based solely on my interest in working and living” in the Asian country, amid speculation he made the move to avoid a massive tax bill.

	











	“I am obligated to and will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes to the United States government. I have paid and will continue to pay any taxes due on everything I earned while a U.S. citizen.


	Set in 2003, The Social Network dramatized the events surrounding Mark Zuckerberg's (Jesse Eisenberg) founding of Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits it sparker, including one from his former Harvard friend Eduardo Saverin (Garfield).


	Following the original movie's three Oscar wins and five nominations, Sorkin revealed last year that he has an idea for the sequel. “Look, yeah, I'll be writing about this. I blame Facebook for January 6,” he said at WME's White House Correspondents Dinner pre-party.


	This week, Sony announced that the sequel will be titled The Social Reckoning, premiering Oct. 9, 2026 in theaters. Jeremy Strong will take over the role of Zuckerberg, with Mikey Madison as whistleblower Frances Haugen and Jeremy Allen White as Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horowitz, who broke a series of articles known as ‘The Facebook Files'. Those October 2021 reports exposed the inner workings of and multiple harms caused by Facebook.

Farrell presented his new film, Edward Berger's 'The Ballad of a Small Player,' in Zurich, where he received the Golden Icon award in honor of his career achievements. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	In The Ballad of a Small Player, Edward Berger's adaptation of Lawrence Osborne's 2014 novel, Colin Farrell plays Lord Doyle, an Irish con man and high roller in Macau whose luck, he fears, may be about to run out. Farrell, however, is still on a roll. 


	The Irish actor received the Golden Icon Award at the Zurich Film Festival, in recognition of his career achievements and, in a wide-ranging Master Class discussion on Sunday, discussed the “extraordinary, unearned good fortune” that has been his life in cinema.  




	Growing up in Dublin, Farrell had no plans to act. “I wanted to be a footballer, a soccer player. I was handy enough,” he recalled. His father had played professionally for Dublin club Shamrock Rovers and sports were “the one way my father and I could have communication and a relationship. It was tricky everywhere else, but when it came to football, we were good to go.”

	His dream of a professional soccer career ended when, “I started drinking and smoking and all that stuff.” Acting came via his sister Catherine, who went to theater school. “It was the first time in my life when I heard that she was going to, quote, unquote, study acting. It sounded ridiculous. I didn't think it was something you could apply yourself to within a formal structure.”


	Farrell followed his sister to theater school. “Which gave me the chance to do something I do very well, which is drop out,” he said. “I dropped out and started working.”


	Farrell landed a role in the popular BBC series Ballykissangel and got his first film role in Tim Roth's directorial debut The War Zone (1999) — alongside his The Ballad of a Small Player co-star Tilda Swinton. But it was Joel Schumacher who changed everything, casting the still-unknown Irishman in Tigerland (2000) as a young soldier going through boot camp before heading over to Vietnam.

	











	“Joel kind of changed my life,” Farrell said. “He wanted a bunch of unknown actors. He took a chance on an Irish kid.” 


	After Tigerland, Farrell's rise was meteoric, leading to roles in Hollywood productions working alongside “my childhood heroes,” from Tom Cruise in Minority Report to Al Pacino in The Recruit. “I got to work with Al Pacino in my third year of acting on film. It was pure bananas.”


	The speed of it all was overwhelming. “It was so loud, it was so global, and I was so unprepared,” Farrell said. “I was only 22, but I was really [emotionally] 12. I hadn't earned it. The thing I understand now, at 49, is that there's no earning the degree of good fortune that came my way.” 


	By his own admission, the combination of sudden fame and heavy drinking nearly ended his career. “At a certain point, big Hollywood stopped calling. I got a certain reputation, which I probably earned.”


	The turnaround came with Martin McDonagh's In Bruges in 2008. “I read the script, loved it, and then I tried to talk Martin out of casting me,” Farrell said. McDonagh didn't listen.


	“It was a bit of a turning point. It might have been the first job I did sober,” he recalled.


In Bruges was a hit and the role marked the beginning of Farrell's second act, defined by more personal, often darker choices, from Yorgos Lanthimos' The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer to his Venice-winning, Oscar-nominated performance in McDonagh's The Banshees of Inisherin.

	











	Farrell has also managed to slip back into blockbuster territory, most memorably as the Penguin in Matt Reeves' The Batman. Being cast, he said, was a dream come true for “that child in Dublin who used to draw Batman signals on his jeans.” But he admitted, on first read, he didn't get Reeves' take on the cartoon villain.


	“I was so excited when I got the script and then I read it and was like ‘I've only got five scenes,'” he recalled. “I didn't really get it either. I thought he was a bit silly, a bit of a putz.” It wasn't until Reeves showed him the mockup of how Farrell would look, unrecognizable, in his Penguin makeup, that the penny dropped. 


	“I'll never forget it. Matt went: ‘Come in, come in.' And he opened up his laptop and showed it to me. The first time I saw it, the cogs crunched. Everything in the script became clear. Every little pockmark. The character was ferocious looking, but I could imagine every aspect of the character's life, even moving ones. It just gave me so much information,” Farrell said.


	The part proved strong enough to launch HBO's spin-off The Penguin, where Farrell got to dive deep into the character. “I can do five hours a day riffing as the Penguin, and even my sense of humor changes. I'd call my kids in character.” 


	Farrell will be back as the Penguin in Reeves' The Batman: Part II, even though he says, “I've got an even smaller role in this one. But I'm OK with that…I've read the script, from start to finish, and I can't say much about it. But it's deeper, scarier, the stakes are bigger. I'm really excited to see it.”

	











	Working on The Ballad of a Small Player also pushed Farrell into new territory. A fan of Edward Berger's since his 2018 Showtime series Patrick Melrose, Farrell had been talking to the German director about Small Player “since before [Berger's Oscar-winning movies] All Quiet on the Western Front and Conclave.”


	They shot the film on location in Macau, which, Farrell said, was “an assault on the senses. It's incredibly loud, the colors are brash and bombastic. It's how I felt reading the script. I flew through the script, but I kind of felt nauseous reading it as well. There's nothing subtle about it.”


	As for his character, Lord Doyle, Farrell described him as “somebody who's on the precipice of insanity…he's living in an incredibly aggressive kind of spiritual or emotional vacuum, with no connection to anyone. Like all addicts, regardless of what the addiction is, who inevitably end up in an emotional or spiritual vacuum.”


	The experience of making the film left him “fairly raw…everyone was fairly wrecked by the end of it,” Farrell said, noting he is looking forward to not working for a while and spending time at home with the kids. 


	Reflecting on what has been an extraordinary career with its share of awards — the Golden Icon honor follows a decade of awards heat, from a Golden Globe win and best actor nomination for The Banshees of Inisherin to a best actor Emmy nomination for The Penguin, Farrell said he's wary of the seductions that come with accolades. The point isn't winning, he argued; it's staying connected. “The nominations are the most joyous part of it,” he said. “Winning an award is a little bit of separation. The real juice is just being part of the community, when you and another group of actors are told: You did OK.”

Three members of the Putnam family have tragically passed away after a car crash. The family was featured on “Meet the Putmans,” which aired on TLC in 2017 for six episodes. It followed Bill and Barb Putman, their four children, and their extended family, all of whom lived together under one roof in Michigan.

 Fans rushed to pay their respects following this sad news.

A post shared by Growing Up Putman (@growingupputman)

A statement was shared on the family's social media page, announcing the news.

“I come to you with a heavy heart asking for your prayers. Our family was in a tragic car accident and we lost Papa, Neenee, and Aunt Megan. They have gone home to be with the Lord. Please keep Uncle Blake, Lulu, Alena, Noah, and Gia in your prayers as they remain in the hospital, we are asking for complete healing and strength for each of them,” the post said. 

“My entire family — Papa, Neenee, Billy, Jen, Brandon, Kacie, Blake, Megan, Jamie, Blair, myself (Isabelle), Abby, Emma, Addison, Bella, Mercy, Gabby, Noah, Mya, Nova, Lulu, Alena, Gia, Jonah, Eli, Solomon, Uriah, Samson, Luke, and Anna — all proclaim that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior. He is our hope, our peace, and our salvation. Even in this time of heartbreak, we rest in knowing that God is in control.”

“We asked for your continued prayers for Uncle Blake, Lulu, Alena, Noah, and Gia as they recover, and for our whole family as we walk through this deep loss. Even in this valley, we will praise Him. We rust that His plan is perfect, and that one day, we will be reunited in Heaven,” they continued. “Thank you for every prayer, message, and act of love. Your support means more than words can express. Please continue to lift us up, that our hearts remain fixed on the truth that Jesus conquered death so we could have eternal life.”

Fans left comments on the family's Instagram post, showing support and offering their love and prayers.

“My heart is broken for your entire family. You all will continue to be in my prayers during this time. Praying for a healing physically and emotionally. Your family is such an inspiration. Sending love to your family,” one person wrote.

“I'm incredibly shaken to hear of this great tragedy. Your sweet Neenee, Papa, and Aunt Megan leave such a beautiful legacy and testimony. Sending so much love and prayers for the rest of you in these coming days. Thankful for the hope that you have to be reunited some day,” another person commented.

“Loved you all since your show and I'm heartbroken for you… prayers for all of you for peace and comfort,” a fan said.

Universal's kid offering ‘Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie' comes in at No. 2  with $13.7 million.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, One Battle After Another, easily takes the No. 1 spot at the weekend box office with an estimated $22.4 million plus opening in North America in over 3,600 locations. Internationally, it has earned $26.1 million for an expected global cume of $48.5 million.


	The film cost a reported $130 million before marketing costs, meaning an opening in the low-$20 million range can easily be seen as disappointing. However, it can also be read as a solid start for an original movie from an auteur director with an R-rating and an almost three-hour runtime. One Battle is also seen as a major awards contender and is likely to generate press and word-of-mouth for many months. The film's second weekend performance will be a better indicator in terms of its staying power.

					Box Office: 'Demon Slayer' Tops 'Him' for No. 1, Passes $550M Globally		
			









	One thing is certain: The One Battle box office was buoyed by audiences seeking out premium formats. The film was offered in 70mm, IMAX 70mm, IMAX Digital and VistaVision (albeit on four screens). The movie earned $4.6 million in North America from 412 IMAX screens, or roughly 20 percent of the film's total domestic ticket sales. 


One Battle stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a washed-up and burnt-out revolutionary who is called back into action when his daughter (Chase Infiniti) is kidnapped by his former nemesis (Sean Penn). Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall and Teyana Taylor round out the cast.


	The film has opened to universal praise, with One Battle boasting a 95 Metacritic score and an A CinemaScore. The Hollywood Reporter's review of the film from Richard Lawson reads, “One Battle After Another is a furious film, a richly engaging and persuasive polemic from a filmmaker who has never shied from provocation but who has not before spoken so directly to his audience.”

	











One Battle is director Anderson's biggest opening weekend in a career that spans Boogie Nights to Licorice Pizza. Anderson's There Will Be Blood is his highest-earning title to date, with $40 million in North American ticket sales.


	As for Warners, the studio has been on a hot streak as of late, beginning with Minecraft ($957 million, globally), followed by Ryan Coogler's Sinners ($366 million, globally), and New Line offering Weapons ($264 million, globally). 


	Coming in at No. 2 at the domestic box office will be the weekend's other new offering: Universal and DreamWorks' Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie. The G-rated film, which carries a reported price tag of $32 million, is tracking to earn $13.7 million in its debut. 


Gabby's Dollhouse, a combination of live-action and CG animation, is based on the wildly popular streaming animated children's series of the same name that debuted in 2021 and has since premiered eleven seasons (the twelfth season is due out in November on Netflix). The film stars Laila Lockhart Kraner, reprising her role from the series, along with Gloria Estefan and Kristen Wiig.


	Internationally, the film opened in 37 territories, including Australia and Mexico. It earned $5.6 million for a current global haul of $19.3 million.


	Elsewhere, Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures' Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, which had a record-setting U.S. opening of $70 million, came in at No. 3, making $7.1 million from 2,984 venues over the weekend. The film's domestic total sits at $118.1 million after three weeks in theaters. 

	











	Warners title The Conjuring: Last Rites, now in its fourth weekend, landed at the No. 4 spot this weekend with $6.9 million in domestic ticket sales, bringing its domestic cume to $161.5 million and $435 million globally.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Filmmaker Stephan Elliot reveals to Deadline that Terence Stamp, the magnetic British star who died aged 87 in August, spent the final months of his life reprising his role as Bernadette, a transgender nightclub artist, for the sequel to beloved 1994 movie The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.


	The actor, who starred in Billy Budd, Far From the Madding Crowd, two Superman movies, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and The Hit, had initially been hesitant about agreeing to a sequel, but says Elliott, the actor was persuaded by a promise that Priscilla Queen of the Desert 2, its working title, would not just be a repeat of the original.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“So I came forward with something that is pretty special and unique,” Elliott tells us. “And that's when I got him.”


	The first movie, about a transgender woman and two drag queens, played by Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving, respectively, who set off from Sydney in an old-school bus they dubbed Priscilla to perform to disco golden oldies and ABBA hits in the desert plains of southern Australia, was an enormous hit when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.


	Elliott believes that his cast dressing to the nines in outrageously glamorous frocks and bejeweled Carmen Miranda-style headgear atop their wigs, helped pave the way for the likes of RuPaul's Drag Race to enter the mainstream.


	Elliott explains that “we had all agreed on a Priscilla… sequel just before COVID because it took me decades to find a plot and I found it. But then COVID came along, and of course, we all lost ground, but it did give us the time to get the script underway. And as well you know, we have very big heels to fill, and we've been pretty much at it ever since.”

	











	At the same time, he adds, “Terence wasn't getting any younger, and that's a fact he loved to shove down our throats almost every day.”


	We spoke to Elliott back in April 2024, and Deadline broke the news that a sequel was in the works to The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but he says now that he did not disclose “that we had been in pre-pre-makeup, hair and concept designs for a very long time.”


	Those discussions, Elliott notes, revolved around “what Terence's character Bernadette was going to look like at 88, it took a lot of trial and error. So the clock clicked on, and then when the AI wars broke out, Terence was indignant that he didn't want a digital clone of himself playing Bernadette. He wanted the chance to put the character down himself. And I will quote him in this case. He said: ‘Just in case I don't make the start line.'”


	Elliott declares that with Stamp pressing the case “and with the blessing of him and his family, Guy, Hugo and the financiers, I decided to pre-shoot all the Bernadette scenes.”


	Australian-born Elliott says of Stamp: “He was 87, turning 88… And I put him through a multi-cam shoot, spread over several grueling sessions. All I can say is, that the old trouper gave it everything he had. He hated putting the wig on again. But at the same time, my God, you could have bottled that smile. I mean, it was brilliant fun, and he really did have the time of his life. But calling ‘that's a wrap' on Terence Stamp… are going to be words that will haunt me to the day I die.”


	Elliott reveals that he shot scenes with Stamp “in character in a nine camera array of the entire script.”


	Following Stamp's passing, Elliott says that he's “pretty devastated” and “I'm still teary most days, but at the moment, I just need to down tools for a bit and mourn. I mean, he was such a unique human. He didn't have a lot of close friends, and I'm still pretty chuffed that he counted me as one of them. We had 32 brilliant years together, and I never missed a chance to hang out and chew the fat. And my God, the stories he told me that I can never put down. I mean, what a life!”


	“He was an absolute sweetheart, but he had an aura about himself, and he kept it that way. I mean, he knew I loved him to death… I mean, look at his resume, look at who he worked with. And I look at myself on this list of Fellini and Pasolini, and then I see my name there, and I just go: ‘What is my name doing there?'”


	Elliott adds that “right now, I've just had to tell everybody to down tools, I really need time to mourn. I need time to work this out. What happens next? Does anybody want to see the film now that he's passed? I mean, I just don't know. But I guess with a bit of time, we're going to find out.”


	He shot the Stamp sequences over three studios starting at Pinewood.


	Elliott says that it's not the first time “in film history” that technology has enabled actors performances to be introduced into a film after they've died, to live on. “I mean, look at Ollie Reed. Ollie Reed died in the middle of shooting Gladiator,” he notes, referring to how Ridley Scott and his creatives enabled Oliver Reed to appear, as it were, in Gladiator, following the actor's death from a heart attack in 1999. “There's a weird history. I mean, even if you look at Carrie Fisher, who basically was put into Star Wars [The Rise of Skywalker], but they were kind of all after the fact. This is a really weird one in that it's before the fact.”

	











	He adds: “They call it CGI face replacement. It's a tech that's been around for years, but basically we're going to have to, I don't know. I'm still trying to work it out, but the tech is there. We basically, we'd have to get a stand-in actor and Terence would be put onto that actor. Sci-fi films have been doing it for years, but in this instance, I'm going to have to have an actor playing Terence Stamp. I mean, it is scary. We're all scared, of course.”


	The script is very unusual, Elliott suggests. “Not what people expect… I've made a very, very unusual film, and it is about old age. It's very touching. I wrote a lot of what I went through with Terence over the last couple of years. I wrote into the script of what it's like to get old and to be either gay, trans—I mean, it's a subject that's never been explored.”


	Elliott says that for over a decade, Weaving and Pearce had been making jokes about wanting to do a sequel, however, Stamp hadn't wanted to be part of it. “He just absolutely refused,” the director recalls.


	“I had to come to him with a plot that is a really good one. And when I came to [Stamp], he looked at me and said, ‘Okay, I didn't see that one coming.' So I brought him something. I brought him a complete original. And at that point, he said, ‘Right, that's the promise. I'll do this because you're going in a different direction. But at the same time, I will never let you just repeat yourself.' None of us want that. And Guy doesn't want that either, and Hugo either. So I came forward with something that is pretty special and unique,” Elliott explains. “And that's when I got him.”


	The conversation begged all manner of questions. I ask Elliott if Stamp was in full hair and make-up and costumed as Bernadette?


	“Yes, he was in full costume as Bernadette,” Elliott confirms.


	Elliott says that Stamp “joked all the time, ‘You're running out of time, kids. You're running out of time.' And so he threw himself into it. I mean, he absolutely gave it his all.


	“It was tough dialogue for him, but he gave it everything,” Elliott explains during the call Sunday from his home in Portugal.


	“It's a game changer. It's kind of weird. So we're facing a whole brand new world here. Terence said, ‘I want a chance to do this myself.' So we gave him the chance.”


	Elliott and his collaborators, as noted earlier, are taking a break to enable them to think through how to proceed. I peppered him with questions about how the Stamp footage could be introduced into the sequel.


	“Look, I think the easiest way is for all of us, which is what it is. We've got Terence in the can as Bernadette. It's what we do technically with this point, as I said from this point about how we make it work. But we're not the first film in history to go through this.


	“And I've just said to financiers, everybody right now, and I said, ‘I just need some air. We'll figure it out.' So basically, he exists as Bernadette, and we've just got to work out how to make it work. And the question is, as I said earlier, does anyone want to see this film? And part of me thinks that they would. Now that he's put the effort in, and basically he gave the last months of his life to this. I think people want to see it. It's a tough one… It's a real tough one.”


	Elliott says that both Weaving and Pearce gave their blessing ahead of discussions between the filmmaker and Stamp. “I said, ‘Guys, I can't do this because it's going to cost a fortune, and I can't do this without your blessing, without your support.' And both of them did.”

	











	Costume designer Tim Chappel (Miss Congeniality), who shared the 1995 Oscar for Best Costume Design with Lizzy Gardiner (Hacksaw Ridge), created new costumes for Stamp. Elliott signed up makeup designer Rick Findlater (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, The Hobbit) to create Stamp's Bernadette. Makeup artist Sarah Jane Wai O'Flynn worked alongside Findlater.


	While acknowledging that Priscilla Queen of the Desert 2 will travel further afield than Australia and venture overseas, Elliott refuses to reveal more. “I can't tell you, Baz. I mean, on top of that one, even the boys were saying, ‘Do you want to release some of the footage?' And I said, ‘Of Terence's stuff?' And I said, ‘It's the plot. We'll just give the whole plot away.' I mean, the beauty of what we're trying to do is outdo ourselves on the first film, and I just can't give the plug away.”


	I ask him to clarify when principal photography might start. “When I can work out the mechanics of how this is going to work,” he responds.


	By Elliott's reckoning, the hope is that filming could start next year. “The boys have got their own schedules. They want to do it. We're going to have to reconfigure some of it because we have to deal with the simple fact that we've lost him. So we're going to have to do some reconfiguring and it's just going to take us a little bit of time to work it out. But I think we can get underway next year.”


	The work with Stamp on Priscilla Queen of the Desert 2 started, Elliott tells us, in 2024, “and we stretched into this year for the big shoot and the dialogue,” essentially shooting on and off over several months.


	“So. it'll be technical, but on top of that one. it will be him. He's in the film. It is him. He's in costume. He's doing his own dialogue,” Elliott confirms.


	“Come on,” Elliott argues. “You look at all the sci-fi epics you ever see, all those people have basically ended up acting on green screens, talking to tennis balls, we're not doing that.”


	Our conversation, as we recall our interactions with Stamp over the years, is a heartbreaking one, but then we're also excited in a strange way at the possibility of seeing Terence Stamp up there on a big screen one more time.


	Elliott nods. “Now, he didn't want a funeral, there's been a lot of talk recently about funerals, and he didn't want a funeral. He wanted a final curtain.


	“So we did everything in our power to make it happen… And by God, we're giving it to him.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Filmmaker Stephan Elliot reveals to Deadline that Terence Stamp, the magnetic British star who died aged 87 in August, spent the final months of his life reprising his role as Bernadette, a transgender nightclub artist, for the sequel to beloved 1994 movie The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.


	The actor, who starred in Billy Budd, Far From the Madding Crowd, two Superman movies, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and The Hit, had initially been hesitant about agreeing to a sequel, but says Elliott, the actor was persuaded by a promise that Priscilla Queen of the Desert 2, its working title, would not just be a repeat of the original.

	“So I came forward with something that is pretty special and unique,” Elliott tells us. “And that's when I got him.”


	The first movie, about a transgender woman and two drag queens, played by Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving, respectively, who set off from Sydney in an old-school bus they dubbed Priscilla to perform to disco golden oldies and ABBA hits in the desert plains of southern Australia, was an enormous hit when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.


	Elliott believes that his cast dressing to the nines in outrageously glamorous frocks and bejeweled Carmen Miranda-style headgear atop their wigs, helped pave the way for the likes of RuPaul's Drag Race to enter the mainstream.


	Elliott explains that “we had all agreed on a Priscilla… sequel just before COVID because it took me decades to find a plot and I found it. But then COVID came along, and of course, we all lost ground, but it did give us the time to get the script underway. And as well you know, we have very big heels to fill, and we've been pretty much at it ever since.”


	At the same time, he adds, “Terence wasn't getting any younger, and that's a fact he loved to shove down our throats almost every day.”

	











	We spoke to Elliott back in April 2024, and Deadline broke the news that a sequel was in the works to The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but he says now that he did not disclose “that we had been in pre-pre-makeup, hair and concept designs for a very long time.”


	Those discussions, Elliott notes, revolved around “what Terence's character Bernadette was going to look like at 88, it took a lot of trial and error. So the clock clicked on, and then when the AI wars broke out, Terence was indignant that he didn't want a digital clone of himself playing Bernadette. He wanted the chance to put the character down himself. And I will quote him in this case. He said: ‘Just in case I don't make the start line.'”


	Elliott declares that with Stamp pressing the case “and with the blessing of him and his family, Guy, Hugo and the financiers, I decided to pre-shoot all the Bernadette scenes.”


	Australian-born Elliott says of Stamp: “He was 87, turning 88… And I put him through a multi-cam shoot, spread over several grueling sessions. All I can say is, that the old trouper gave it everything he had. He hated putting the wig on again. But at the same time, my God, you could have bottled that smile. I mean, it was brilliant fun, and he really did have the time of his life. But calling ‘that's a wrap' on Terence Stamp… are going to be words that will haunt me to the day I die.”


	Elliott reveals that he shot scenes with Stamp “in character in a nine camera array of the entire script.”


	Following Stamp's passing, Elliott says that he's “pretty devastated” and “I'm still teary most days, but at the moment, I just need to down tools for a bit and mourn. I mean, he was such a unique human. He didn't have a lot of close friends, and I'm still pretty chuffed that he counted me as one of them. We had 32 brilliant years together, and I never missed a chance to hang out and chew the fat. And my God, the stories he told me that I can never put down. I mean, what a life!”


	“He was an absolute sweetheart, but he had an aura about himself, and he kept it that way. I mean, he knew I loved him to death… I mean, look at his resume, look at who he worked with. And I look at myself on this list of Fellini and Pasolini, and then I see my name there, and I just go: ‘What is my name doing there?'”


	Elliott adds that “right now, I've just had to tell everybody to down tools, I really need time to mourn. I need time to work this out. What happens next? Does anybody want to see the film now that he's passed? I mean, I just don't know. But I guess with a bit of time, we're going to find out.”


	He shot the Stamp sequences over three studios starting at Pinewood.


	Elliott says that it's not the first time “in film history” that technology has enabled actors performances to be introduced into a film after they've died, to live on. “I mean, look at Ollie Reed. Ollie Reed died in the middle of shooting Gladiator,” he notes, referring to how Ridley Scott and his creatives enabled Oliver Reed to appear, as it were, in Gladiator, following the actor's death from a heart attack in 1999. “There's a weird history. I mean, even if you look at Carrie Fisher, who basically was put into Star Wars [The Rise of Skywalker], but they were kind of all after the fact. This is a really weird one in that it's before the fact.”

	











	He adds: “They call it CGI face replacement. It's a tech that's been around for years, but basically we're going to have to, I don't know. I'm still trying to work it out, but the tech is there. We basically, we'd have to get a stand-in actor and Terence would be put onto that actor. Sci-fi films have been doing it for years, but in this instance, I'm going to have to have an actor playing Terence Stamp. I mean, it is scary. We're all scared, of course.”

Cardi B took the Global Citizen Festival stage by storm on Saturday night, rocking a baby bump and new songs alongside her earlier hits at Central Park in New York. The rapper announced she was pregnant with her fourth child, and first with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, on Sept. 17.


	Accompanied by a bevy of dancers dressed in camo shorts and white T-shirts and her DJ, their commander of the night turned up the heat with her performance, and while initially wearing a short camo jacket. “Now that you guys have seen my outfit, mother is hot, hold on,” she said after performing “Outside.” She then tossed the coat to one lucky fan in the audience. 


	Sporting a body suit that accentuated her baby bump and baggy pants, Cardi declared, “I look good” (and she did!) before launching into “ErrTime,” commanding the stage as she grooved across it and twerked.


	For “Bodak Yellow,” she hit a side-stage catwalk that brought her closer to the crowd as the audience sang along to every word. She closed with a twerk-filled, electric “I Like It.”

	











	Global Citizen organizers announced that Cardi was added to the lineup mere days before the event was to take place after the Weeknd pulled out for “personal reasons.” Rosé was also tapped to perform earlier this week.

Zach Bryan was only a few songs into his show at Ann Arbor's Michigan Stadium on Saturday when he shouted, “Thank you so much for the best night of my life.” And later, during “Dawns,” he marveled, “This might be the craziest thing I've ever done.” 


	What could be so crazy about a show at Michigan Stadium? For starters, there's no place like it — the Big House, as Michigan Wolverines football fans call it, has a capacity of 107,601, making it the largest stadium in the Western Hemisphere. Football fans in Ann Arbor are used to setting attendance records. Not to be outdone, Bryan fans looked to set a new mark for the largest ticketed concert in U.S. history. Final attendance figures are not yet available, but organizers announced before the show that more than 112,000 tickets had been sold, which would eclipse the 110,905 mark set by George Strait at Texas A&M's Kyle Field last year. For a guy like Bryan, who was still in the Navy four years ago and was playing small clubs as late as 2022, crazy indeed. 

	











	Just as crazy: Throughout its 98-year history, the Big House had never hosted a concert (unless you count a small show organized in 1987 by legendary football coach Bo Schembechler's wife, Millie Schembechler, to warn a crowd of 5,000 high-schoolers of the dangers of substance abuse). It might be an impossible task to work every bit of a 112,0000-strong crowd, but Bryan was up for the challenge. He scored points before he played a note, as he and the band walked onstage to the Killers' “Mr. Brightside,” an unofficial hype song played during every home football game, and Bryan wore a customized maize-and-blue football jersey, Number Two.

	From there, Bryan effortlessly moved between quiet, self-reflective acoustic songs (“God Speed,” “28”) and country-rock anthems (“Quittin' Time,” “Revival”). If there's a common thread through all of Bryan's songs, whether loud or soft, fast or slow, it's the shout-along chorus. When Bryan was at his best, as on the devastating song of love and loss, “East Side of Sorrow,” the stadium shook as tens of thousands joined him in the anthemic chorus, and when Bryan would drop out and let the crowd take the lead, he looked as much a spectator as a performer, taking in the magnitude of the scene.

	Bryan, setting up on a field where Michigan legends like Tom Brady, Charles Woodson and Tshimanga Biakabutuka once played, let a boisterous band of at least 15 as they tore through nearly 30 songs. He employed a four-pointed stage (Zach's “omnidirectional stage,” as fellow performer John Mayer quipped) at midfield that allowed Bryan to play to each side of the stadium throughout the set. From the stage the crowd spread across the field and up 98 rows of bleachers to the far reaches of the stadium. Four screens above the stage allowed the crowd to follow Bryan no matter which way he was facing. Volatile Midwestern fall weather was no issue, as it was a warm and cloudless night, and the scene outside the stadium looked not unlike a Michigan football Saturday, as fans tailgated along South Main Street and in the surrounding neighborhoods. Only they traded their football jerseys for cowboy boots, denim skirts, and 10-gallon hats and College Gameday on their TVs for Bryan on their stereos. 


	Despite the success of his tour, Bryan has hit some rough patches recently. He went through a very ugly and very public breakup with podcaster and influencer Brianna “Chickenfry” LaPaglia, who accused Bryan of emotional abuse and said he had asked her to sign an NDA. That led to a pair of diss tracks from LaPaglia's boss, Barstool founder and podcast cohost (and Michigan football superfan) Dave Portnoy, aimed at Bryan; Bryan's response was to burn a Bartsool flag before hitting it with a golf club. More recently, Bryan's feud with fellow country singer Gavin Adcock came to a head when Bryan was captured on video scaling a fence to confront Adcock at Oklahoma's Born & Raised Festival earlier this month. Saturday was his first show since the Adcock confrontation, and if the controversy was on his mind Saturday night, Bryan didn't show it — nor did he address it from the stage.

	Bryan got some help from a huge name. At 47, John Mayer is a ways removed from his days as a blues-pop heartthrob, but he's still in his prime. While he hasn't released a solo record since 2021's Sob Rock, he's kept plenty busy defining an increasingly impressive legacy. Mayer has been a part of Dead & Company for a decade now, and the band spent parts of the past two years in residence at the Sphere in Las Vegas before celebrating the Dead's 60th anniversary with a series of shows in Golden Gate Park last month.


	The night was about Bryan — Mayer himself said, “Zach is the guy right now, carrying the torch ” — and the tone of Mayer's set seemed to recognize that. Mayer steered away from the megahits of his youth in favor of a career sampler that included a soulful rendition of 2006's “Gravity” and the breezy “Who Says,” during which Mayer substituted “Ann Arbor” for “Austin” in the chorus. From his more recent catalog, the delicate and disillusioned “I Guess I just Feel Like” from Sob Rock showed how much Mayer has matured since he launched onto the scene with 2001's Room for Squares.


	Mayer's time with Dead & Company has left a mark on his guitar playing. While he's always been a virtuoso, these days Mayer seems less interested in blues-rock shredding and showing off as he does in finding out where Jerry Garcia's more fluid and laid-back improvisational style might take him. 


	Bryan invited Mayer onstage for a cover of “Friend of the Devil,” the Dead classic co-penned by Garcia. When Bryan missed a line, a look of embarrassment shot across his face as he turned to Mayer and said, “I told John I wouldn't mess this up, and here we are.” Mayer didn't seem to mind, though, and he didn't miss a beat as he perfectly channeled a Garcia guitar solo. Mayer wasn't Bryan's only guest: He also brought out the War and Treaty to sing “Hey Driver,” a duet from Bryan's 2023 self-titled album. Their appearance was extra special, as the husband-and-wife duo of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Trotter originated in nearby Albion, MI.

	Prior to Mayer's set, Ryan Bingham, backed by the Texas Gentlemen, greeted the crowd with “Y'all ready to boogie?” and played a raucous country-rock set as the sun went down. Keenan O'Meara and Joshua Slone each played solo sets to start the evening.


	Saturday's show marked the end of Bryan's summer stadium and festival tour, which saw him play before crowds of 65,000 on consecutive nights at London's Hyde Park and 80,000 at Notre Dame Stadium as well as shows in Dublin, New York, and San Francisco. Impressive venues to be sure, but the Big House will stay on his mind: He punctuated a rendition of his hit “I Remember Everything” with a heartfelt, “I'll remember this forever, Michigan.”

	That was the day the floodgates opened: the October morning in 2022 that I couldn't hold it down anymore. I'd been up all night sweating my academic future, sweating the New York Yankees' future; trying to sweat anything but my algebra exam, which was scheduled for second period the next morning. All but unslept, I staggered up at 6 a.m … and the ropes in my stomach backflipped. Bolting to the bathroom, I barfed so hard that my eyeballs ached from the pressure. I was loud enough that I woke my sisters down the hall. “Eww, Jack, stop it — you're gross!” they yelled. “I'm gonna go tell Mom!” 


	But Mom already knew, because I'd woken her, too. Loping down the hall, she found me on my knees, spitting yellow bile into the bowl. She asked if I'd caught a bug and needed to go to urgent care. I played it off as a case of nerves and said I'd be late if I didn't get going. But in my friend's car to school, I held a Ziploc to my mouth, gagging into the bag. My throat was scorched, my tongue was swollen — and the acid would not stop coming. Somehow, I pushed my way through the day and even managed to ace the exam. I went home that afternoon famished and faint. I hadn't been able to choke down a bite.

	











	But a snack and a drink would have to wait: My mom was at the door with questions. She asked me how my day had gone — then drilled down about my “nerves.” I hedged, saying it was the first time I'd panicked because of school, omitting the many nights I'd tossed and turned for hours. She pressed me about prior attacks; I confessed that there'd been a few, but nothing quite like this. She opened her laptop, Googled severe anxiety, and landed on the story of my life. Every symptom Google spat out rang bells in my head — sweaty hands, knotted stomach, shaky legs, racing thoughts; there were nights where all I heard was the thump of my boom-boom heart. Then there were the rituals I was enslaved by: the pair of lucky shoes I always wore on test days; my go-to herbal shampoo on midterm mornings. On the one hand, it was a relief to see that others felt these things. On the other hand — man, it was a lot.

	My mom hugged me hard, said she was sorry I was struggling, and asked if I wanted to see someone about it. I balked, saying, “No! I have this handled.” At the time, the idea of therapy felt like admitting defeat, like putting a spotlight on myself when all I wanted was to blend in. I convinced myself that if I just pushed harder, I could muscle through it alone. But two weeks after the last attack, it happened again. I was up till dawn, ran to the bathroom, and dry-heaved en route to school.


	This time, my mom wasn't waiting with questions: She'd booked me an online session for that afternoon. I was shocked and stung by what felt like a betrayal. But as I sat through the Zoom, answering the therapist's questions, the knots in my stomach unwound. My therapist told me straight out that I wasn't alone in my angst. She'd helped a lot of kids learn to manage their symptoms, though anxiety had no “cure,” she said. It would take rigor and practice to get on top of my fears — but I'd see changes if I did the work. Between sessions, she sent me links about other kids living with stress. I learned that one in three teens have chronic anxiety — and a third of those have anxiety so great that it turns to panic disorder. 


	Inspired by those sessions, I searched for tools focused on meditation and mindfulness to help me take full control of my emotions. My school's website had links to breathing techniques and calming, sound-spa music. I tried those things and found them only so helpful: the zen wore off after an hour. 


	One night, my out-of-town uncle came to dinner and saw me picking nervously at my food. “Hey, I meant to tell you,” he said: “A friend of mine uses this app called Headspace. He says it helps a lot with his anxiety.”

	That simple recommendation turned into a revelation. What started as a personal lifeline would eventually grow into a mission to make sure other teens who felt like me could find the same tools. 


	AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT, I opened the Headspace app and was wowed by its options. They were running a free trial at the time; I signed up for their kickoff program, a series called “Managing Stress.” It was divided into a month of one-week courses, with exercises called “Mindful Pushups” and step-by-step how-to's from experts. I learned from those talks that it takes time to master stress, and that, thousands of years ago, stress was our savior, the thing that kept our species alive. It drove us to hunt and gather, tipped us to danger, and pushed us to compete for partners.

	











	After weeks of Mindful Pushups — mini-meditations where you focus on pleasant thoughts while doing cadenced breathing — I awoke one morning and thought to myself: “Whoa! I just slept through the night.” In the following weeks, Headspace asked me about my triggers: the fears underlying the panic. My fear was actually two fears tied together: the fear of failure and the loss of control. I could study till my eyes glazed, pull a week of all-nighters, and still not know I was ready for an exam. Headspace taught me that those fears were pointless: No one controls anything in this world. By the end of that first month, I had a big exam, and didn't wake up running to throw up. And that voice in my head — the one bullying me to work harder — was growing a little fainter by the day.  Clearly, the tools were working for me.


	Months later, when my free trial of Headspace ended, I re-upped as a paying customer. But waking the next morning, it hit me in the head: There were kids at my school — and many other schools — who needed the app but who didn't have $70 to join. The problem is epidemic: In 2024, the sociologist Jonathan Haidt would publish his landmark book, The Anxious Generation, coining a term for my age group. A study that same year in the Journal of Adult Development found that anxiety among Gen-Zers is four times more common than in Baby Boomers, and roughly double the rate in Gen-Xers. Kids my age are profoundly uneasy, and clearly struggling to cope.


	In the spring of '23, I messaged Headspace in hopes of connecting with someone in community outreach. I wrote that I was a high-school freshman who'd been rescued by the app, and wondered if there was a way to make it less pricey for other teens. Shockingly, an executive wrote me back, wanting to get a meeting on the books. Over Zoom with that executive and her aide, I broached an idea I'd been working on, something called Project GenZen. It would strive to help provide low-income teens with access to Headspace and other wellness resources. They loved the idea, saying they'd been looking for a teen to authentically rep the app to school-age kids. Their studies showed that kids who used it for 30 days reported a 32 percent reduction in stress, and long-term improvement in symptoms. 


	That winter, I cold-called public schools in New York City, talking up the merits of the app. The response from school leaders was swift and strong: Within months, students across New York's boroughs had free access to Headspace, available to any teen who wanted it. But I'd held off calling the leaders of my own school, fretting about being judged by the kids next to me. Till one day, the next spring, I saw a girl have a panic attack in the hall before an exam. It was the catalyst I needed to push past shame and speak my truth aloud. The next day, I stood in front of the student government, sharing my stories of pre-test night-sweats and last-second dashes to the bathroom. When I finished talking, there was pin-drop silence; I thought I'd just committed social suicide. Then a hand went up, and another, and another: Kids poured out their own anguished stories. 

	











	After the meeting, a senior administrator at my school approached me and asked to connect her with Headspace. Within weeks, posters appeared on the walls of my school, offering Headspace to kids who clicked a QR code. Hundreds of teens did so — but not my varsity lacrosse teammates. They called the app a sign of weakness. I told my Headspace contacts about the stigma, then did my own homework. I pulled together public clips of athletes talking openly about stress and focus, Chelsea striker Raheem Sterling singing the praises of meditation and basketball legend Sue Bird on staying composed in big moments, and shared them around the team group chat. That started to lower the eye-rolls. A few skeptics even replied with their own examples — Simone Biles, Naomi Osaka, Michael Phelps, Giannis Antetokounmpo, all speaking candidly about mental health. The tone shifted. Project GenZen was beginning to lift off — but I could see it still needed another push.


	THEN SOMEONE TOLD ME about a first-of-its-kind program at the University of Virginia. The school had just opened its Contemplative Sciences Center, a 57,000-square-foot facility on campus that looked like a sanctuary from the future. A steel-and-glass commons that overlooked its own pond, it housed laboratories that scanned the effects of sound and light on human brain-wave patterns; ashtanga yoga studios accessible to the student body; and reflection rooms that mirrored the sensations of nature. I wrote to UVA in the spring of 2024, telling them a bit about Project GenZen and conveying my interest in their program. They wrote back, offering a summer internship; I very gladly accepted. 


	When I showed up on campus last July, the CSC was staging a soft opening. Touring its commons, I walked into a room that illuminated sound and color. Hundreds of crystal blocks made up its walls: The lower ones channeled the green of the lilies on the surface of the pond outside. The upper blocks throbbed and pulsed a deep blue, reflecting the pond's windblown currents. I felt, rather than heard, the whoosh of water through the sensors in those blocks: I was fully immersed without getting wet. I sat on a bench and let the ripples wash through me, drifting like a lily in the breeze.


	I met a couple of CSC instructors that day and asked them about their Compassionate Schools Project. They explained that it was a syllabus for grade-school students, derived from a decade of working with public schools in Louisville, Kentucky. Its aims were threefold: to teach kids social and emotional skills from kindergarten through fifth grade; give them mindfulness tools and breathing techniques to manage stress and setbacks; and ingrain good habits around diet and exercise as a passport to healthy lives. CSC was in the process of adapting the program and offering it to thousands of school kids in other states.

	











	And what did clinicians learn from the data they collected? That the students in those schools gained focus and confidence, learning to problem-solve in and out of class. Those effects were especially strong in “high-poverty schools,” where kids made big strides in “emotional resilience,” a key predictor of positive outcomes in life. Here was the last piece of the puzzle I'd been assembling: data-driven practices that could be adapted for older students and boiled down to five-page pamphlets.


	Working with an instructor, I spent weeks at CSC compressing years of learnings to four booklets: Testing Anxiety; General Anxiety; Depression; and Fear of Missing Out. Each of those pamphlets had instructions for spotting symptoms; for learning how those symptoms spiral — and techniques to head them off before they do. The work I did at UVA carried over into my school year. I finished designing the pamphlets in February of this year, and sent printable PDFs to schools and organizations in New York, Kansas, and Kentucky that are preparing to roll out the programming this fall. By the time I graduate next June, I'll have data to report on how those booklets, and Headspace, helped stressed-out schoolkids self-soothe. 


	IN THE MEANTIME, I have my own data to report: After years of meditation and Mindful Pushups, I've never felt more relaxed. I just wrapped a pressure-packed junior year and didn't have a single panic attack or a pre-dawn dash to the bathroom. Yes, I still get tense before exams, and yes, I occasionally feel nauseous. But instead of fighting my body and losing, now my body and I fight together against our enemy, anxiety.

	At the first sign of tension, I go into my bag and pull out the Square Breathing tool. I inhale for five seconds; hold for five seconds; exhale for five seconds; and wait for five seconds. I repeat as needed till the tension ebbs — while thinking about as little as possible. If scary thoughts come, I don't spiral, I re-center — focusing on my breath, not the fear. At bedtime, I do something called the Body Scan: a limb-by-limb lullaby to my parts. I start with my head, relaxing my eyelids while recounting how much my eyes saw today. Then my nose, feeling air go in and out and smelling the aroma of my room. Next, my jaw: I clench, and let it go. Then shoulders: Flex, release… and feel them sink into the bed.


	By the time I've gotten to my arms and legs, I've usually dropped off to sleep. I'm so chilled out that I float through the bed, and oversleep through the alarm the next morning. What began as survival became activism, activism became research — and research, if we keep at it, might become resilience for a whole generation.

	Last December, the former al Qaeda leader, Ahmed al-Shara, made history as he led a loose coalition of rebels into downtown Damascus. The Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, promptly fled in a helicopter. In January, al-Shara appointed himself the country's new president. Lately, he's been having earnest sit downs with David Patraeus in New York, addressing the U.N. General Assembly, and rocking a $50,000 Patek Philippe watch.


	Before all this, I was his prisoner. In October of 2012, I slipped into Syria in order to carry out some freelance reporting. I was arrested almost right away. After about a week of being shuttled around in the trunk of a car, my captors brought me to the Aleppo eye hospital, which al-Shara was using as a prison. His men installed me in Cell One, formerly a toilet, in a line of basement cells. Somewhere above me, a civil war was laying Aleppo to waste


	My time in that prison gave me some insights into al-Shara's world view. I sincerely doubt the passage of time or victory in the Syrian civil war has changed any of his more extreme beliefs.

	











	Down in that basement, the commanders liked to exhibit their readiness for martyrdom by strolling the corridor of this prison with their suicide pouches half open, so that red wires and little packets of putty, packed away in translucent envelopes, poked out over their bellies. 


	All day long, every day, most of the men lounged on their sofas. They watched a lot of TV. As far as I could tell, these soldiers of God were in it for the feasts (platters of rice, chicken) and the choral singing (sample lyric: “We destroyed America, with civilian airplanes we did it/Reduced them to dust”), which occurred every evening in a prayer room across the hall from my cell. 

	











	At the time, this prison also functioned as a GHQ for the Syrian phase of the International jihad. Down in the basement, this band of daytime TV watchers had kitted up an internet-equipped office, a many-pillowed meeting room, an industrial-scale kitchen, a torture suite, and a mosque. The other boss of this establishment, a character I knew as Abu Taha, eventually achieved a degree of fame as the director of the on-camera immolation of Jordanian pilot Moaz Kassabe, and as the organizer of the beheadings of three American prisoners: James Foley, Stephen Sotloff, and Peter Kassig. Eventually, under the name Mohammed Adnani, he presided over the ISIS caliphate as the sheikh of general affairs. In those early days, I knew next to nothing about these two men.

	Even then, Adnani and al-Shara were famous. Among their admirers, it was understood that their devotion to Islam had forced them underground at an early age, and that, as they fomented revolution in the darkness, they learned to see — particularly into the will of God — as few men ever do. It was understood that the American authorities in Iraq had been aware of their extraordinary affinity for the world beyond our senses, had locked them away in their prisons for this reason, and that, during their years in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca, as the Americans did everything imaginable to shut out the light, their powers grew. 


	During those early months in prison, I was aware in the dim, unconscious way a prisoner who is frightened out of his mind and doesn't want to know a thing will eventually become aware, that Adnani and al-Shara wanted everyone in Syria to see just as they did. They were focused on sharpening the vision of their brothers in arms. In particular, the little society of revolutionaries that was coming to life in this basement was meant to see that shadowy powers abroad had been trying to destroy Islam in Syria for a thousand years, that lately these powers had been sending in CIA agents to get the job done, that the 3 million members of Syria's Alawite sect were in on the plot, as were the 800,000 Druze and the 500,000 Christians, and that some portion of the nation's 16 million Sunni Muslims had likewise given their hearts and minds to the international enemies of Islam.

	According to the foreign fighters and the former students from the Aleppo university who delivered food to my cell every day, there was no sense in throwing oneself at the government machine guns, at least not for the time being, because the real enemies in Syria were the foreign powers. Who were their local agents? Everyone understood that Bashar al-Assad was one such agent, that thousands of his fellow agents had been doing evil in Syria, in secret, for generations, that a great rounding up was underway, and that now, these agents were being punished according to the law of God. What had they done, exactly? Which laws applied to them? Provided I had broken none of the sacred laws, these jihadis seemed to believe, I wouldn't be killed. 

	











	It took me about six weeks of listening at the heavy wooden door of my cell to guess that al-Shara, who was the cooler, more level-headed of the two eye hospital commanders, determined who had done what during processes, known in the hospital as “investigations,” and that he staged his investigations nearly every night in the hospital boiler room, a few doors down from my cell. 


	At that time of night, the city electricity had long since been cut. The war outside had all but died away. We could have been on our own little planet. During the course of one of the proceedings for which I was present, my blindfold fell off. Such light as there was in that room, I discovered, came from candles and camping lanterns that had been scattered across the floor. A white plastic garden table, which sat just behind the room's double doors, had been set with an arrangement of bullets, a few pairs of handcuffs, and a handgun. 


	On the nights when the important commanders were present, an audience of 20-odd spectators would gather in the shadows. Foreign fighters interspersed themselves among teenagers from the neighborhood. Watery-eyed old grandfathers held the hands of school-age children. Everyone over the age of eight was covered in guns. 


	There were times when the commanders hanged two or three people at once — by their wrists, from pipes beneath the ceiling. The guards would attach car battery cables to the prisoners' limbs. In their first moments in the air, the prisoners' feet would bicycle away. Yes, they confessed, they despised Islam. Yes, the Syrian government had sent them to kill the Muslims of Aleppo. Yes, they would do it again if they could.


	Naturally, the confessions made matters worse. “You have been lying every moment of your life,” the interrogators would say. The guards would then bludgeon the prisoners. An insane kind of scream would make the room ring. When this subsided, the commanders would conclude: “You have no idea who we are, do you?” And then, almost always, they would deliver a warning: “Prepare yourself. For we've only just begun.” Eventually, the hanging people would withdraw from the conversation. “Oh God, Oh God,” they would shout. “Please, dearest God. I'm begging you.”


	It usually took about 20 minutes for the strength in the prisoners' voices to give out. As those men were surrendering, it would have been impossible for the audience — and everyone else in the room, by the way — not to see and feel and hear that a reckoning was at hand. For those present, it was a reckoning with what comes to people who devote themselves to empty powers, like the Syrian government and the CIA. It was a reckoning with the interrogators' extraordinary capacity to see into the prisoners' secret lives, the inescapability of punishment, and the terrible power of the divine law.

	











During my two years in Syria, I lived in 13 separate prisons. Over time, I must have listened to a hundred such reckonings. Whenever the guards came for a prisoner, they would stand in front of the door of his cell, then fling open the food hatch. A voice would order him to stand. The prisoner would be made to blindfold himself. “Give us your hands, animal,” a voice would say. The prisoner would reach his hands through the food hatch. His wrists would be cuffed. The cell door would swing open. “Come out,” a voice would say. Every time I heard this sequence of sounds it felt to me as though the prisoner was being asked to walk out of the cell, down the hall, then out of this world altogether. 


	“Thank God, I am innocent,” a small-town mayor who happened to occupy a cell next to mine for a time used to say in the evenings as he was drifting off to sleep. He had been accused of helping to conscript the men of his town into the government army. “There isn't a thing upon me. Look all you like,” he would say to himself — or to the eavesdropping guards, or, perhaps, to me. He would sigh, then drift off to sleep. One night, a few hours after he had put himself to sleep in this manner, they killed him. I listened to every second of it. I mopped up his cell afterward. I poured the water out of the tub in which they flung his bloody robe. 


	What does this accomplish? Is it not unpleasant for the killers? When will it stop? These are the questions that come to the listeners in such prisons. Over time, I came to think that when the candlelight was throwing shadows against the walls and the car-battery power was crackling through the air — when prisoners really were being escorted out of this world — the little community that gathered in the shadows was itself drifting away from time and space. The deeper the shock and awe, the more totally the community took leave of planet Earth. Out there, for a little while at least, everything came clear. 


	Not that it matters much now, but the stuff I made up for my captors had to do with my personal depravity. I admitted that I had come to Syria to seduce — or rape, if it came to that — as many Syrian women as I could. I wanted to do this for fun, and because I hoped to poison the women of Syria, and whatever children resulted from our unions, in the American way — that is, through continuous illicit sex. Eventually, I hoped, these Muslim women would all be like me. They would hate Islam. They would wander the Earth as I did, in search of money and sex. So they would appear to be human, but really, on the inside, they would be like the monkeys and the pigs.

	











	The guy who took my rape-the-local-women confession from me wanted it to be true so badly that he typed it up, returned me to the boiler room the following day, read my false confessions out to me, then made me sign them. “If so much as a word you've said here is untrue,” he said to me on that occasion, “we'll put a bullet through your skull.”


	Over time, it dawned on me that my captors much preferred their fictions to the real world. And were their fictions so false? When those men gathered in their candlelit rooms, stood shoulder to shoulder, in that room anything seemed possible. The blood on the floor was certainly real. The prisoners' agony and regret were real. There was holy justice. There was revenge. An unearthly power — electricity, yes, but something else — crackled and danced in the air. It was visible enough. It made the enemies of Islam writhe and jerk in their handcuffs. 


	In the eye hospital, in the early days, everyone understood that al-Shara and Adnani saw further than the other revolutionaries, could produce longer, more appropriate quotations from the sacred texts, and read the will of God more astutely. Only they, I assumed, had the authority to make the realm of clear-sightedness and revenge live. The more blood those men spilled, the more they spread justice and wisdom across the earth. 


Nowadays, I know that as the eye-hospital commanders were learning how to build out their dream for Syria, far away, in the White House, foreign-policy specialists were preparing to inflict their own fantasy on the nation. In a New York Times article that appeared at about the time that I was having my reckoning, an anonymous U.S. official spoke of a “cataract of weaponry” flowing into Syria. I know now that the scheme this person referred to, Operation Timber Sycamore, was directing what would eventually turn out to be a billion dollars' worth of weaponry, that if not sent directly into the hands of my captors then into the hands of their cousins down the street. In the eye hospital, the young men took to carrying their American M-16 style rifles into the cells. They referred to these as “the Americans.” 


	In January 2013, the time-of-justice fantasy emerged from the eye hospital in the form of pickup sized packets of believers. Did those packets belong to ISIS? To al Qaeda? After my release, I discovered that this question interested journalists in the West. But why? It had no relevance to those of us in the way of the pickups. Those pickups were propelled by the power of belief. The pickup drivers who had given themselves to the fantasy most totally were the natural leaders. They moved up quickly through the ranks, as in any cult. The doubters got with the program or disappeared.  

	











	Thanks to the social networks, I have been able to stay in touch with some of the pickup drivers I came to know in the Aleppo eye hospital. The ones with whom I speak most often weren't at all surprised when the Assad government collapsed last December. For them, the event was an act of God — therefore wondrous and unaccountable. 


	The pickup drivers with whom I happen to chat most often no longer have much confidence in the former leader of our grimy Aleppo jail, al-Shara. In their view, in making nice with the Israelis and the Americans, he has frittered away whatever power he once had. They think he might well have gone over to their side altogether, in which case, it would no longer be possible to think of him as a Muslim at all. In which case, he would be an apostate. In which case …


	These pickup drivers are of the opinion that the nationwide awakening to God about which they used to preach to me caused the fall of Bashar al-Assad last December. It caused the collapse of the notorious government prison system, and a new era of political freedom in Syria. In their view, that coming out to God has only just begun. It is likely to unfold in fits and starts, according to God's will, as they see it. In any case, it never had much to do with Adnani or al-Shara. For them, the coming out has always been a matter of learning to see by the light of the Koran. Whenever all the Syrian Muslims learn to see like this, they believe, that's when God will wash away the nation's deeper, hidden problems. 


	The worst of the recent violence in Syria remains the massacres that occurred in March of this year, when a call to jihad which went out over minaret loudspeakers across Syria, summoned as many as 200,000 fighters, according to this report, to a battle in the Syrian Coastal Mountains, the Alawite homeland. They came in columns of pickup trucks. This Reuters investigation shows that a mixture of government-led forces and irregulars killed some 1,500 members of the Alawite sect during those attacks.


The latest round of violence in Syria began on July 13, when a familiar mixture of government forces and irregulars, sometimes operating independently and sometimes in coordination, descended on the Druze capital, Suweyda. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says that some 1,120 Druze were killed during these attacks. Defense and interior ministry personnel, the observatory claims, “executed” 194 of these victims.  

	











	Who are these killers, really? This figure, clad in the ISIS regalia, is announcing that a brigade of monotheism is proceeding to Suweyda in order to “cleanse away the filth” of its Druze inhabitants.


	Perhaps the monotheism brigade was responsible for shooting some hospital workers in Suweyda. Perhaps it was an allied group. In the old Syria, a crime like the massacre of a family of eight people — one of whom, Hosam Suraya, was American — would be murder. But when the pickup trucks are filled with seers, killings of this kind are the will of god.

	For a few brief, alarming moments in 2014 and 2015, Adnani served as the Islamic State's supreme commander for all of Syria, officially the sheikh of general affairs. In those days, his feeling, for whatever it's worth, was that Muslims everywhere, regardless of their local permission structures, should seize the day: “Kill a disbelieving American or European — especially the spiteful and filthy French,” he advised. “Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict. Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for the same ruling applies to them all.…” A drone strike in 2016, probably directed by the Pentagon, sent him to the realm beyond our senses. For his part, al-Shara has prospered. After he let me go in the summer of 2014, he threw himself into the work of a civic administrator in the northern Idlib Province. He — or his middle managers in Jebhat al Nusra, or some combination thereof — appears to have killed most of the people with whom I was in prison. I am in touch with about 20 families who continue to search for news of their missing relatives. 


	On the surface of things, it seems that a new era is dawning in Syria, but in my opinion, the news we've seen lately show that Adnani's spirit, mixed in with the al-Shara of old, is alive and well and calling out from central Damascus. Whether or not we can see what's going on is another matter.

The team behind the Luca Guadagnino thriller, which also stars Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, have embraced the ambiguity and questions posed by the conflicting accounts at the center of the film.


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


Julia Roberts has said she hopes her new movie After the Hunt sparks conversations, and the film's stars have indicated they are happy to embrace the uncertainty and questions provoked by the story's conflicting narratives, many of which remain unanswered.


	Still the team behind the Luca Guadagnino-directed campus thriller, which explores the fallout when promising PhD candidate Maggie (Ayo Edebiri) accuses Andrew Garfield‘s professor character Hank of sexual misconduct and how this affects Maggie's mentor Alma (Julia Roberts), who's also close friends and colleagues with Hank, did answer some questions following After The Hunt‘s New York Film Festival premiere Friday night.

	When asked how much they wanted to know about what was left unresolved for the audience, Garfield, Edebiri and Michael Stuhlbarg all seemed to welcome the film's ambiguity.


	“[It's] fascinating to play with what's conscious, what's unconscious, in terms of what's driving these people, what motives are hidden from ourselves,” Garfield said. “I feel like we all feel like we are the heroes of our own stories. I think there's quite beautiful moments of reckoning, self reckoning, self revelation, that each of our characters have in this film, and in those moments, it's the kind of horrifying staring into the abyss of the kind of horrifying mirror that these characters are faced with at certain points. … I think there is a kind of a reckoning that this person, who believes himself to be a kind of humanist and a kind of great professor … and a guy that's trying to open and unlock all of his students and someone who's daring and trying to get people closer to the edges of their own hearts and the centers of their own hearts, that he's faced with something that he hadn't previously recognized in himself.”

	











	Stuhlbarg, who plays Alma's psychiatrist husband Frederick, added that the word “ambiguity” felt “very appropriate for this experience.”


	“It's like watching a slow motion train wreck,” he said of the film's story. “You don't know what's going to happen, but you feel something's coming. And that was kind of the experience, ambiguous, of playing it is that, you know, there's many layers to this gorgeous text and to these extraordinary performers, and you kind of throw yourself into it to pull out what you think is going to be useful, and then you throw yourself into it and things happen. But being outside of the center of that action, I know something's going on. I don't exactly know what it is, but I'm pressing and I'm watching it, and I think it's a hard place to be and a wonderful place to play, because you're kind of on tenterhooks the whole time. And I never know what it's going to be and having Luca throw extraordinary things at us during the process of being in that unsurety gives you moments of direction and moments of flourishing and moments of silliness and moments of depth, and you just ride it, but it's a very appropriate word for the world we were inhabiting.”


	And Edebiri, in particular, praised the rehearsal period at Roberts' house as giving them license to explore different interpretations.


	“We were just getting to excavate this text together, and I feel like there were just early conversations that we were having with each other, and also that I was having with Luca, where I feel like it was like we were getting permission, in a way, to, like, fill in the blanks where we needed to fill them in, and then where there needed to be space and ambiguity, or in moments with each other, to maybe find things that are more primal, we just got license to do that,” she said. “Being able to have that license to, I don't know, sometimes, like, fool each other, fool ourselves, I think was really freeing.”

	











	And while Roberts wouldn't reveal what she thought truly happened or if she even wanted to know that to play Alma, she did have an answer for what she thinks the film, which has been described as a #MeToo story and one about the world of academia, is truly about and it's found in the film's abundance of music.


	“There's a song that plays in this film seven times … and it's a song about forgiveness. And I think it says so much about these relationships and how Luca asked us to approach them and construct them and what he asked of us as artists to find and articulate in the characters we were portraying,” she said. “I think that he always felt that this beautiful story that [screenwriter] Nora [Garrett] wrote us was about love and forgiveness and trying to understand who we really are deep inside of ourselves and why we posture and do the things that we do.”


	Prior to the screening, Stuhlbarg and Garrett said they were welcoming the questions, conversations and opinions being shared after people saw the film.


	“I think everyone will see this film with their own particular lens,” Stuhlberg told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet ahead of After the Hunt‘s opening night screening. “I think it presents quandaries to an audience, and it's up to them to decide what really happened, and I think it gets conversations going, and I'm delighted that those conversations seem to continue and they seem to be happening after every screening of the film. I'm just as curious to know what people are curious about and I'm looking forward to hearing what people have to say.”

	











	Garrett added, “We all did really hope that people would be able to bring their opinions to this and their ideas to this and you don't get to pick and choose what type of opinions those are. I think as long as people feel very strongly, that's welcome.”


	The first-time screenwriter told THR that while she had been thinking about the ideas and themes of the story for a while, it was the Alma character that really drew her in.


	Specifically, Garrett says, she saw the philosophy professor as “a woman who has such outward success but such inward self-denialism and if there was something that could cause that inward self-denialism to crumble a little bit or fracture a little bit, how that would change her life and how she would live her life.”


	And as for the “unreadable” elements of Alma, as THR‘s review of After the Hunt noted, Garrett said, “She has a lot of internal machinations and because she's not looking fully at herself she's also going to project something which confuses what you might believe to be her internal drive.”


After the Hunt, from Amazon MGM Studios, is set to hit theaters in New York and L.A. on Oct. 10, expanding on Oct. 17. Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody and Allan Mandelbaum produced the film through Imagine's first-look deal with Amazon MGM. 


	The 2025 New York Film Festival runs through Oct. 13.

Lewis Hamilton asked fans for their love and support after his dog Roscoe was placed in a coma. The F1 Driver posted on his Instagram, revealing the news along with sharing numerous photos of him by his dog's side.

“Please keep Roscoe in your thoughts,” Hamilton wrote. “I want to keep you all updated. Roscoe caught pneumonia again and was struggling to breathe. He was admitted into hospital and sedated to calm him while they did checks on him and during the process his heart stopped. They managed to get a heartbeat back and now he's in a coma. 

“We don't know whether he will wake from this. Tomorrow we'll try to wake him up. I'm by his side and want to thank you all for your prayers and support.”

Hamilton was set to participate in Pirelli's testing of 2026 tyres at the Mugello Circuit in Italy on Friday, but Ferrari reserve driver Zhou Guanyu replaced him.

“Sending all my love ❤️‍🩹 please please pull through Roscoe xxx,” Influencer Sophie Hinchliffe wrote.

Lewis Hamilton's dog has his own Instagram account. 

“I'm a vegan bulldog that loves to travel, play ball and get attention from all the girls, especially when they rub my bum. I like frisbee and tennis🌱,” Roscoe's Instagram bio states. 

Roscoe has been by Hamilton's side since 2013 and has even joined him at numerous Grand Prix over the years.

For all she has achieved, you have the sense that Laufey, just 26, is still climbing. 


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Laufey opened a two-night stand at Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles on Friday (Sept. 26) with a show that captured her unique place in pop — her music is rooted in jazz, but her concert has pop-superstar production values.


	The A Matter of Time Tour, the Icelandic singer-songwriter's third tour and her first that consists entirely of arena dates, began on Sept. 15 in Orlando. It will conclude in Kópavogur, Iceland, on March 15, 2026.


	Laufey (it's pronounced LAY-vay, for those still catching up to her) won a Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album in 2024 for her sophomore album, Bewitched, and she could be headed for another win in that category on Feb. 1 for her third album, A Matter of Time. The album entered the Billboard 200 at No. 4. It has topped Billboard's Jazz Albums chart for the past four weeks. (Bewitched logged 102 weeks at No. 1 on that chart.)


	For all she has achieved, you have the sense that, Laufey, just 26, is still climbing. She has some big looks upcoming. She may well land a performance slot on the Grammy telecast – it would be her first star turn on Music's Biggest Night. (She performed “From the Start,” a song from Bewitched, on the 2024 Premiere Ceremony, which is streaming-only, and backed Billy Joel during his show-closing performance on that year's telecast. Also, she is set to play the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival on Apr 19. She has said she would like to record a James Bond theme song, which seems inevitable, which could bring in a performance on the Oscar telecast.  Are we getting ahead of ourselves? Perhaps, but it's pretty clear to see the career trajectory she's on.


	Laufey didn't get where she is by thinking small. In 2023, she told RUSSH that Taylor Swift is her favorite current artist. The reason she gave for that choice spoke to her ambitions: “She has done for pop and country what I hope to do for jazz. She has managed to unite people across the world which is one of my main goals as a musician.”


	Laufey's choice of opening act for her tour's North American leg — English singer/songwriter Suki Waterhouse — also spoke to her pop ambitions. Waterhouse, best known in the U.S. for her hits “Good Looking” and “Supersad,” is right in the pop/rock mainstream.


	In 2022, when Laufey first headlined in L.A., she played the legendary but comparatively tiny Troubadour. Her growth since then can be seen in her bookings: In November 2023, she played two nights at the Theatre at the Ace Hotel. On her return in August 2024, she played the Hollywood Bowl. This time, it was a sold-out, two-night stand at Crypto.


	Here are the six best moments from Laufey's opening night show at Crypto.com Arena.


	The show opened like a vintage film, with the words “Laufey Presents ‘A Matter of Time'” projected onto the screen. It began and ended with scrolling credits on side screens, listing all the musicians, backup dancers and other contributors to the performance.


	“Cuckoo Ballet (Interlude),” a gorgeous instrumental track from A Matter of Time, was highly cinematic, and showed that Laufey might well have a future in film scoring.


	The concert was divided into acts, with the most satisfying being Act II, which was introduced with these words on the screen: “Ready for some jazz?” Laufey was backed by a jazz trio during this segment. “Welcome to my jazz club,” she told the audience. “I want to put a jazz club in the middle of a big space.”


	The segment kicked off with “Seems Like Old Times,” first recorded by Guy Lombardo's orchestra in 1945 and since covered by such jazz greats as Ella Fitzgerald and Rosemary Clooney. It was the only song she didn't write or co-write in the set.


	Laufey performs a surprise song in every show, to make each show a unique experience, she said. Here, she reached back for “Magnolia,” from her 2021 EP, Typical of Me. She said she had recently discovered that the song works better as a duet and brought out a special guest, Hozier, to help her sing it. After they concluded the number, she fangirled: “I'm kind of freaking out because I'm such a big fan.”


	Over the course of the show, Laufey played piano, guitar and cello. Her voice, with a deeper timbre reminiscent of one of her favorite singers, Ella Fitzgerald, was also impressive.


	She also showed a deep knowledge of music history. “Dreamer” had the close-harmony sound of a 1940s song, “Silver Lining” suggested the influence of 1950s-shaded doo-wop. A couple of songs, “Castle in Hollywood” and “Tough Luck” showed the influence of Taylor Swift on her songwriting. “Sabotage,” the final number in the set (before the encore) evoked the aggressive pop-rock of Olivia Rodrigo's “Vampire.”


	Laufey made note of the tonal “ups and downs” in her set, with its mix of happy and sad songs. “That's what it feels like to be a woman,” she explained. “You go through every emotion in a 24-hour cycle.” Far be it from me to correct Laufey, but that's what it feels like to be a human.


	One of her most emotional songs is “Promise” (from Bewitched), which includes what she has called her favorite lyrics that she has written. “It hurts to be something, it's worse to be nothing with you.” She performed the song by herself at the piano.


	Laufey said that since she now lives in L.A., she often comes to Crypto.com Arena to see shows. “I've come to a lot of concerts here this year preparing for this and I thought, ‘There's no way I'm playing here.'”


	The singer remembered the first time she played L.A. at the Troubadour. She nervously peeked out through a window to view the audience and just hoped she would be able to do it again someday. “It was the biggest show I'd played to that point,” she said. “I was so scared it would slip away.”


	She needn't have worried.

Nothing can get between country superstar Luke Bryan and his beloved Georgia Bulldogs. On September 27, 2025, the “American Idol” judge — and proud Georgia native — appeared live with fellow country star Jason Aldean on “SEC Nation” for a pepfest ahead of the University of Georgia's matchup against the University of Alabama. 

Bryan was so amped up for the big game, leading the crowd in one of the team's popular chants, that he kissed the Bulldogs' mascot on the mouth after declaring that he'd never do the same with his own dogs back home. 

It's electric in Athens ⚡️ #lukebryan #jasonaldean #collegefootball #music 

Bryan and Aldean, who also grew up in Georgia, appeared on “SEC Nation” as the show broadcast from outside Sanford Stadium early in the day, with a sea of red-clad fans packed around the stage. Video of Bryan and Aldean leading the audience in its “Who's that coming down the track” chant quickly went viral, with 1.2 million views racked up on TikTok within hours. 

In another video from the show, which Bryan shared in his Instagram Stories, he shouted, “In my household, we have a chocolate lab that's the love of my life and an English cocker that's the love of my life. They sleep at the foot of my bed every night, and I don't kiss 'em on the mouth. There's only one dog that I'd kiss on the mouth, and it is this one. Go Dawgs!” 

Nobody loves Uga like @Luke Bryan loves Uga ❤️🖤 #GoDawgs #lukebryan #uga #mascot #secnation 

Bryan then planted two kisses on the real-life bulldog that serves as a mascot for the team, before wiping his mouth as the crowd — and football great Tim Tebow — went wild behind him. The Bulldogs' social media account wrote, “Nobody loves Uga like @Luke Bryan loves Uga ❤️🖤”

Bryan and Aldean, who are longtime friends, appeared on “SEC Nation” not only to cheer on the Bulldogs, but to announce that in 2026, they'll perform the first concert at Sanford Stadium since 2013. 

According to press materials, the first-ever “Live Between The Hedges” concert will take place on April 25, 2026, headlined by Bryan and Aldean, and also featuring Zach Top and former “American Idol” runner-up Lauren Alaina. 

Pre-sale tickets for members of Bryan and Aldean's fan clubs will go on sale on September 29, while tickets for the general public go on sale at 10 a.m. local time on October 3 via three different sites: LukeBryan.com, JasonAldean.com and GeorgiaDogs.com.  

The only other concert ever held at Sanford Stadium featured Bryan and Aldean in 2013, as part of Aldean's “Night Train” tour. 

“Growing up going to Sanford Stadium was always a highlight of the year for me, and I can't believe I get to go back as a co-headliner with one of my best friends and play this iconic place,” Bryan said in a statement. “Aldean and I have been talking about putting on a unique show together for a few years and to be able to do that in our home turf is incredible. I am so grateful to continue to have these opportunities and to keep being able to have so much fun at this life. This is going to be way up there on the list for me!”

Season 19 of “The Real Housewives of Orange County” has been a whirlwind, leaving fans wondering about the historic RHOC season 20. Katie Ginella found herself feuding with nearly everyone, Tamra Judge briefly quit before returning, and Gretchen Rossi shocked fans by making a comeback after 12 years to stir up drama with Tamra. Now, with season 20 on the horizon, reports suggest Bravo is gearing up for one of the most pivotal cast shake-ups in franchise history.

According to Bravo and Cocktails sources, Bravo plans to retain all current housewives for the milestone season. “If someone doesn't return, it'll be on their own accord,” the outlet reported. As of now, Judge, Heather Dubrow, Gina Kirschenheiter, Emily Simpson, Jennifer Pedranti, and Ginella are expected to hold full-time orange status.

Producers are also looking to add two new women with genuine ties to the group. Among those rumored are Heather Amin, actress Noureen DeWulf, and another woman from Rossi or Dubrow's social circles. Another possibility is “The Valley” star Jesse Lally's girlfriend, Lacy Nicole. 

OG favorites are also expected to make appearances. Shannon Beador, Vicki Gunvalson, and Rossi are reportedly slated for “friend of” roles, alongside cameos from franchise alums including Jeana Keough, Lauri Peterson, Jo De La Rosa, Lizzie Rovsek, and Meghan King.

One of the biggest questions is whether Alexis Bellino will be back full-time. Bellino was last featured in season 18, where she clashed with Beador after beginning a relationship — and later an engagement — with John Janssen, Beador's ex-boyfriend. The drama escalated when Janssen sued Beador for $75,000, and Bellino eventually claimed she “was not asked back.”

Bravo and Cocktails also reported that producers are reconsidering that decision. “Producers have begun eyeing a full-time return for Alexis Bellino to spotlight her pre- and post-marital journey with John Janssen,” the outlet claimed, adding that executives may regret choosing Beador over Bellino. Sources also alleged Beador has been “increasingly difficult to film with, refusing to reconcile with certain castmates and experiencing frequent emotional meltdowns.”

If rumors are true, Bellino could return as a full-time housewife, while Beador would be offered a reduced “friend” role. Rossi would also return as a friend — but only if she exits season 19 “on a decent note.” Ginella, meanwhile, is reportedly expected to leave the show altogether.

With Bellino recently celebrating her bridal shower — an event attended by Judge and alum De La Rosa — it seems Bravo may be laying the groundwork for her big return.

RHOC season 20 is expected to begin filming in February 2026 and air later in the year on Bravo.

‘90s star Danielle Fishel is showing everyone how dedicated she is to performing on “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34, as evidenced by her willingness to push through intense pain to deliver memorable performances. 

A post shared by Danielle Fishel Karp (@daniellefishel)

Next Tuesday, September 30, marks the start of Week 3 of the show, and the competition is intensifying as celebrities and their professional partners vie for the Mirrorball Trophy. We have already said goodbye to Corey Feldman and his pro partner Jenna Johnson, as well as to Britt Stewart and retired athlete Baron Davis. If Fishel is next, and many people hope she won't be, it's not going to be because she didn't try her best. 

For Week 2, Fishel and her pro partner, Pasha Pashkov, performed a Cha Cha routine. She suffered a hamstring tear during practice. The actress discussed the injury in an interview with People after her performance, saying, “I snapped a tendon in my hamstring. I had a meeting with a surgeon, and I don't need surgery, so it's just a matter of rehabbing it and taking care of it.”

She and Pashkov are working together to ensure her leg has time to heal, and she told the outlet that he would be choreographing “around that right leg for a week to give me a little bit of a rest, and I'll be fine.” Nothing is going to stop her, and she has a fighting spirit, as she added, “I was only going to leave here because of an injury if they brought me out on a stretcher.” 

A post shared by Danielle Fishel Karp (@daniellefishel)

Fishel loves the performance part of the show, and despite her pain, she managed to put on a good show, ultimately earning a respectable 19/30 on her Week 2 routine. “I'm good under pressure,” she said. “And I'm a performer. I haven't been in front of the camera performing for a very long time. I didn't know if I was going to feel rusty or if I was going to know what to do anymore.”

She continued, “But literally, the minute the audience loads in and I get that feeling, it's 1994 again, and there's an audience of 250 people on the set of Boy Meets World and it's live show night — I just come alive from the inside.” 

Pashkov seems like one of the nicest pros to be partnered with, and he has been supportive and full of praise for Fishel. The pair has also shared updates about Fishel's injury and their preparation on Instagram. This includes a new video of them dancing, and a closer look at her leg, which is black and blue. Fishel posted a video on Instagram on September 26, and fans were horrified. The comment section has been flooded with messages of support and well-wishes for her speedy recovery.

It has become increasingly clear, over the last few years of internet life, that no basic survival skill can trump the ability to smell horseshit in all its many and various forms. It is, after all, everywhere these days: Flooding social media, seeping into occasional Hollywood projects, and most especially spouting, in colorful and creative arcs, from the mouths of people working to make money off of the gold rush fad occurring around generative artificial intelligence. You have to learn to sniff it out, or risk spending the rest of your life stuck as a gormless chump.

Take, for instance, a panel that went down this weekend at the Zurich Summit—the industry-focused sidebar of the currently running Zurich Film Festival. The participants were Eline Van Der Velden, head of AI video-production company Particle6, and Verena Puhm, who runs the similarly focused Luma AI. The pair were being interviewed by Deadline about their current spate of products, when Van Der Velden made a really weird statement: That her company Xicoia's new “virtual actress,” a collection of AI video and voice that the firm calls “Tilly Norwood,” would soon be signed by a Hollywood agency. Van Der Velden, who describes Xicoia as a “virtual talent studio,” didn't give any specifics about who'd step up to perform this alleged act of big-money deal-making, but was happy to use the untested assertion as part of a narrative she and Puhm were pushing, suggesting that filmmakers are softening, sometimes secretly, on the use of AI in making movies and TV.

And, let us be clear: The signing thing may actually happen. Hollywood talent agencies like a faddish publicity stunt as much as the next people, and the raw PR value of “First agency to sign an AI ‘actor'!” could easily lure people into embarrassing territory. (A couple of weeks ago, a little-known record label called Hallwood Media got itself some headlines by signing an AI user named Telisha “Nikki” Jones, who's used genAI tools to create music and visuals for a fake musician called “Xania Monet.”) But it's just as clear that the narrative that Van Der Velden and Puhm are selling—buoyed along with headlines like Deadline‘s guileless “Talent agents circle AI actress Tilly Norwood”—are so strident precisely because the whole system only works if people buy into the horseshit. That's how fads work: A tiny amount of flash, backed up by a rocket engine of FOMO, pushing people past the bounds of commons sense—because heaven forfend you wind up as the last agency to sign their first AI actor, right?

For what it's worth, you can evaluate “Tilly's” “performance” for yourself: Van Der Velden has been soft-launching the model in various little avenues of social media, including an Instagram “comedy sketch” that—and we can only speak for ourselves—produces such a hideous uncanny valley effect in its attempt to replicate the way human bodies and mouths move that it gave us a full-on case of the screaming fantods. Will “Tilly Norwood” be signed by these “circling” Hollywood agents? It never pays to underestimate people who think they can find money by digging into copious mounds of horseshit because, as we've said, it seems to be our last remaining renewable resource. Even so—you don't necessarily want to shake their hands in the aftermath, yeah?

The COVID-19 pandemic was a devastating global event, killing more than seven million people, straining the fabric of societies, and shaking the foundations of the world economy. And yet, as horrifying as the experience was, COVID-19 was not “The Big One” — the dreaded pandemic that haunts the nightmares of epidemiologists and public health officials everywhere. That far deadlier outbreak is still ahead of us, and it will reshape life across the planet unless we're ready for it.

In this episode, Dr. Michael Osterholm, one of the world's leading infectious disease experts, explains what we got wrong, what we got right, and what it all reveals about our preparedness for the next great pandemic.

Michael Osterholm is Regents Professor and McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota, where he founded and directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP). An internationally renowned epidemiologist with fifty years of experience, he's led major outbreak investigations worldwide and authored over 350 papers. He served as a U.S. State Department science envoy from 2017-2019. His new book is The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics.

ByZachary Folk,

Forbes Staff.

President Donald Trump shared and then deleted a seemingly AI-generated video in which he was seen promising Americans access to “medbeds,” a fictional technology popular with some far-right conspiracy theorists who believe they secretly exist and hold miracle cures for every illness.

The video, which was posted Saturday evening on his Truth Social account, featured an apparently AI generated video of the president promising “medbed cards” for Americans, which would grant access to hospitals “designed to restore every citizen to full health and strength.”

It is unclear why the president's account posted the video, which was taken down hours later, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes.

The video, which appears to show an AI-generated Lara Trump conducting an interview on Fox News, never aired, the network confirmed to multiple outlets.

Proponents of the “medbed” conspiracy theory believe the government is hiding advanced healing technology to treat a variety of illnesses or diseases—a claim that has appealed to people suffering from chronic pain, The New York Times reported.

The medbed conspiracy theory grew in recent years among splinter groups from the wider Qanon conspiracy theory, which promised Trump during his first term in office was working behind the scenes to prosecute accused child traffickers in the government and bring down the so-called deep state. In the years since, several splinter groups have fixated on medbeds. One group, led by now-deceased Qanon influencer Michael “Negative 48” Protzman, believed the technology was being used to keep former President John F. Kennedy alive, the Daily Beast reported in 2022. Protzman, whose faction was sometimes described as a cult, died in 2023.

A Mystery That Refuses to Die



Some mysteries fade away with time. But others, like the tale of D.B. Cooper, grow bigger, stranger, and more fascinating as the years pass. On November 24, 1971, an anonymous man hijacked a plane, secured $200,000 in ransom, parachuted into the night sky—and then disappeared forever.



For over five decades, the world has been asking the same questions: Who was he? Did he survive? Where did the money go? And why has no trace of him ever been found?﻿



The Beginning: A Calm Passenger



On the afternoon of November 24, a man who looked like an ordinary businessman bought a one-way ticket at Portland International Airport. He paid cash and signed the name “Dan Cooper.”



Eyewitnesses later described him as:



Around 40–50 years old



6 feet tall



Olive or dark skin tone



Wearing a dark suit, white shirt, and black tie with a tie pin



Polite, soft-spoken, and strangely calm

﻿

He boarded Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 bound for Seattle.



He ordered a bourbon and soda, smoked a cigarette (common in 1971), and blended in like any other traveler. Nothing about him suggested that he was about to write himself into history.

﻿



The Hijacking Unfolds



Shortly after takeoff, Cooper handed flight attendant Florence Schaffner a folded note. She assumed it was his phone number and slipped it into her purse. Cooper leaned closer and whispered:



> “Miss, you'd better read that note. I have a bomb.”

﻿

The note demanded:



$200,000 in cash in twenty-dollar bills



Four parachutes



A fuel truck ready in Seattle



To prove he wasn't bluffing, Cooper opened his briefcase slightly, showing what looked like red sticks of dynamite wired to a battery.

﻿

Negotiation and Landing in Seattle



The pilots informed air traffic control, and soon the FBI was involved. Authorities made a critical decision: to comply with Cooper's demands to ensure the safety of passengers.



For two tense hours, Flight 305 circled Seattle while agents gathered the ransom and parachutes.



At 5:45 PM, the plane landed. Cooper's instructions were precise: the aircraft should park away from the main terminal, with runway lights dimmed. FBI agents delivered the ransom—10,000 $20 bills with recorded serial numbers—along with parachutes.



Cooper released all 36 passengers but kept the flight crew as hostages.﻿



The Escape Into the Storm



After refueling, Cooper ordered the plane to head toward Mexico City. His instructions were unusual:



Fly at 10,000 feet or lower



Maintain a slow speed of about 200 knots



Keep the cabin unpressurized



Rear stairway unlocked

﻿

These settings were perfect for parachuting.



At 8:13 PM, somewhere over the rugged forests of Washington State, a warning light in the cockpit signaled that the rear stairway had been deployed. The crew felt a sudden jolt, and the air pressure shifted.



D.B. Cooper had jumped.﻿



The Search Begins



The plane landed safely in Reno, Nevada. But Cooper—and the money—were gone.



The FBI launched one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history. For weeks, soldiers, helicopters, and ground teams searched the dense forests, rivers, and mountains where Cooper might have landed. Nothing was found.﻿



Pieces of the Puzzle



Over the years, a few clues surfaced:



1978: A deer hunter found a placard from the Boeing 727's rear stairs in the woods.



1980: An 8-year-old boy named Brian Ingram discovered $5,800 of the ransom money buried along the Columbia River. The serial numbers matched. But why was only a fraction of the money there? How did it get so far from the drop zone?



Never found: Cooper's parachute, briefcase, or body.



The recovered money only deepened the mystery.

﻿

FBI's 45-Year Hunt



The FBI investigated thousands of suspects. Among them were:



1. Richard Floyd McCoy (1972 hijacker): He hijacked another 727 in a nearly identical way but was later caught. Some believed he was Cooper, but differences in appearance and evidence ruled him out.

﻿

2. Kenneth Christiansen (flight attendant): A former airline employee with parachuting experience. A book accused him of being Cooper, but the FBI found no solid proof.

﻿

3. L.D. Cooper (a military veteran): A relative claimed he confessed, but evidence was thin.﻿



Despite endless tips, none of the suspects were ever confirmed.



In 2016, after 45 years, the FBI officially closed the case, stating that resources were better used elsewhere.

﻿



Theories That Keep the Legend Alive



1. He Survived and Escaped

Supporters of this theory argue that Cooper was highly skilled, possibly ex-military. He may have landed safely, buried the money, and lived the rest of his life under a new identity.



2. He Died in the Jump

Skeptics point out the stormy weather, rough terrain, and darkness. Cooper wore only a business suit and loafers—not survival gear. They believe he perished, and his body was never recovered.



3. Inside Job

Some suspect Cooper had inside knowledge of the Boeing 727's stair system, suggesting he could have been a disgruntled airline worker or technician.



4. Mythic Outlaw

For many, Cooper represents more than a criminal. He became a modern outlaw figure—polite, calm, and fearless. Unlike most hijackers, he didn't hurt anyone. Some Americans almost admired him.

﻿



Cultural Impact: The Legend of Cooper



D.B. Cooper has become a cultural icon. His story inspired:



Documentaries and true crime podcasts



Movies like Without a Paddle



References in TV shows like Loki, Prison Break, and Unsolved Mysteries



A place in American folklore as the “gentleman hijacker”

﻿

He remains the only person to successfully hijack a plane in the U.S. and escape without a trace.

﻿

Conclusion: A Ghost in the Skies



More than half a century later, the world still wonders: Who was D.B. Cooper? A daring mastermind who pulled off the perfect crime, or a reckless man who gambled with his life and lost?



The FBI may have closed the file, but the legend will never be closed. D.B. Cooper remains America's greatest unsolved mystery—a ghost who jumped into the storm and into history.

Introduction



On March 27, 1977, a small airport on the Spanish island of Tenerife became the site of the deadliest disaster in aviation history. Two Boeing 747 jumbo jets—giants of the skies—collided on a fog-covered runway, killing 583 people.

Defense cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia has long been a cornerstone of their bilateral relationship. The recent developments in their defense partnership—ranging from joint military exercises to strategic agreements on arms production, intelligence sharing, and security cooperation—have reignited global debates about its impact on regional politics. This evolving alliance carries deep implications for countries like Israel and India, both of which see Pakistan as a security concern and view Saudi Arabia as a potential player in shaping Middle Eastern geopolitics. At the same time, this defense deal holds promising opportunities for strengthening Muslim unity, advancing Pakistan's defense industry, and revitalizing its struggling economy.

The year 1803 brought a new turn in American history. That year, the United States purchased a vast territory from France called the "Louisiana Purchase." This land covered almost half of the United States, but no one knew much about it. It was at this point that President Thomas Jefferson selected two brave explorers and adventurers to write a new chapter in the history of the fledgling nation. These two men were Merriweather Lewis and William Clark. Their goal was to map the unknown West, establish contact with the native tribes, and find out if there was a waterway that led to the Pacific Ocean.

Tom Hapgood's book is a lot of things. It has history, both twentieth century and prior; it has youth and the coming-of-age; it has, through its characters' situations, a discussion of the health concerns that can encroach as life continues inexorably towards death; and it has the secrets that lurk in the family vault, just waiting to be uncovered and brought to the surface.

Ghost Adventures is returning just in time for Halloween. The series will be available on Discovery+ in mid-October, before airing on the Discovery Channel later in the month. There is no word on when it will be available on HBO.



The new season will follow Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley, and Jay Wasley on new paranormal adventures. Discovery+ shared the following about the upcoming season:

Dark forces dominate an all-new season of GHOST ADVENTURES, premiering Wednesday, October 15 with an exclusive early debut on discovery+, as paranormal investigators Zak Bagans, Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley and Jay Wasley unearth menacing ghostly activity in their most chilling lockdowns yet. Venturing into the shadows of abandoned buildings, a former military base and even a haunted amusement park, the intrepid team face off against malicious spirits and eerie supernatural phenomena as they pursue answers to terrifying hauntings.

In each lockdown investigation, Bagans and the team employ the latest scientific gadgets and technology to document physical evidence of the paranormal and deepen their understanding of the afterlife. Journeying into the unexplained, the crew confronts some of the most malevolent, evil activity they have ever encountered. In the upcoming season, they'll investigate sinister forces overtaking a shuttered hospital, explore strange manifestations haunting a beloved San Diego amusement park, grapple with deeply disturbing activity invading an abandoned medical complex, delve into reports of alien sightings and portals atop a Wyoming mountain, and more. Episodes will air on Discovery Channel beginning Wednesday, October 29 at 11pm ET/PT.

“This season we were inundated by an overwhelming amount of dark energy,” said Bagans. “No question, these are some of the most intense, jarring and disturbing investigations we have ever experienced. Every location is a paranormal powder keg, and many of them are breeding grounds for evil. We've encountered a lot in our years of doing this, but this is unlike anything we have seen or captured before.”

In the gripping two-hour season premiere, Bagans and the team travel to Casper, Wyoming, a supernatural hotspot, to investigate reports of UFO sightings, alien abductions and eerie hauntings shrouding the area's ominous mountain and abandoned military base. As the team navigate their way to the mountaintop and through the compound's deserted buildings, they unravel mysterious findings at every turn. Exploring otherworldly sightings and a history of witches on the land, their investigation leads to a haunted forest where rituals may have opened a portal to another dimension.

A trailer and poster for the new season are below.

Speaker Mike Johnson happily reeled off not one but two major conspiracy theories as he defended Donald Trump's targeting of his political enemies. Kevin McCarthy's replacement spoke with host Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday and debated the president's public call outs for enemies to be indicted. Johnson was quick to turn to two popular MAGA theories as arguments against Trump's actions counting as a weaponization of the Department of Justice. The speaker countered these overreach allegations by claiming both that a former FBI director had called for Trump's murder, and that the agency might be to blame for the Jan. 6 riots.

The CW's hit Supernatural was the network's longest series. After it ended, it received a prequel series that is finding new life on the streaming charts after being canceled far too soon.

Per Flix Patrol, The Winchesters has broken through to the top 10 list of the most popular streaming programs available on HBO Max via Amazon channels. As of the time of writing, The Winchesters debuted at the number 10 spot on the list on Sept. 27, and was already at No. 8 the following day, overtaking competition like Assassin's Creed and Walker Independence.

Developed by Robbie Thompson as a prequel to Eric Kripke's long-running hit series Supernatural, The Winchesters premiered in 2022 to the delight of fans everywhere. Its release came two years after Supernatural wrapped Season 15 in 2020. The series starred Meg Donnelly and Drake Rodger as Mary Campbell and John Winchester, a young woman who serves as the leader of the "Monster Club" and a young Marine who hails from a long line of monster hunters.

The series' core cast was rounded out by Nida Khurshid, Jojo Fleites, Demetria McKinney, Bianca Kajlich, Tom Welling, Andrea Londo, and Ryan McCartan. The Winchesters also saw Supernatural star Jensen Ackles return to serve as the series' largely unseen narrator as Dean Winchester. Other Supernatural stars included Gil McKinney as Henry Winchester, Rob Benedict as Tango (God in the original series), Richard Speight Jr. as Loki, reprising the same role, Ruth Connell as Rowena, Jim Beaver as Bobby Singer, and Alexander Calvert as Jack.

Although The Winchesters proved to be a smashing success with critics to the point of achieving a perfect 100% "Fresh" rating via review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series didn't maintain nearly the viewership averages The CW was looking for when it came time for the Season 1 finale. It also fully divided the critics and audiences, as the latter gave the show an unfortunate 44% rating.

This, coupled with ownership changes at The CW and the subsequent shifts in personnel, meant that The Winchesters simply never stood a real chance of landing a Season 2 order. In May 2023, it was confirmed that The Winchesters had been officially canceled by The CW, while the year that followed saw the series fail to find a new home on another network.

 Back in 2023, Jensen Ackles opened up about what the initial plan for The Winchesters would have entailed, should the series have been renewed for further seasons. Ackles noted that showrunner Robbie Thompson had charted a five-season plan for the prequel series, stating at the time, "I just think that there's a way to keep this alive and it would be a shame to let that go."

Ackles went on to say of the Supernatural fans who supported the series, "They are fired up. I love that about this fandom. I love that they are so passionate about this world and this universe and these characters that they are willing to go to the mat for a show like this. I think that speaks volumes, especially to those who are willing to listen and have the power to do something about it."

The Winchesters is currently available for streaming on HBO Max.

   09:02 EDT 28 Sep 2025, updated  09:32 EDT 28 Sep 2025    By CHRIS MELORE, US ASSISTANT SCIENCE EDITOR  

A respected congressman has claimed that advanced alien beings could be hiding out in 'five or six' underwater UFO bases right off the US coast.

Tennessee congressman Tim Burchett, a member of the House Oversight Committee overseeing UFO reports, drew massive attention on social media after saying that he believed there were alien 'entities' currently living in deep-water areas on Earth.

The September 17 clip posted on X has already been viewed more than 1.9 million times.

During the sidewalk interview with a UFO researcher and documentary filmmaker who goes by the pseudonym Red Panda Koala, Burchett suggested that advanced alien beings or civilizations may have been hiding in Earth's oceans for generations.

He added that there have been frequent sightings of unidentified craft around five or six specific deep-sea areas, which he found significant given how little is known about the ocean compared to the moon's surface.

The congressman also noted that US Navy personnel have reported chasing these underwater craft that move at extraordinary speeds and far surpass the abilities of current US military technology.

Despite these claims, no verifiable physical evidence, such as artifacts or clear footage of these underwater craft, has been publicly presented to confirm the existence of alien bases.

Skeptics have argued that the reliance on anecdotal reports from naval personnel and the lack of peer-reviewed scientific data casts significant doubt on the claims made during recent congressional hearings on UFO phenomena.

Following the explosive revelations, Dr Michael Salla, an author and researcher focused on extraterrestrial phenomena, revealed where it's believed these UFO bases may be, singling out a region of the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.

He added that he's also spoken to credible whistleblowers, including senior military and executive branch officials, who confirm the existence of underwater bases and advanced craft.

Dr Salla highlighted that the US Navy operates a top-secret underwater facility he likened to Area 51 called AUTEC, which stands for the Atlantic Undersea Testing and Evaluation Center, right in this region of the Atlantic.

'Just to the right of it is Tongue of the Ocean, which is a very deep part of the ocean there in the Bahamas. It drops off immediately around 3,000 feet,' Salla said while appearing on the Redacted podcast on September 19.

'So that's ideal for a submarine, but it's also a place where people have seen many UFOs, many underwater craft coming into and leaving the water. So, there have been a lot of UFO sightings in that area,' he revealed.

The UFO researcher noted that he had interviewed two eyewitnesses who claimed that they had visited these secret bases, including one who was a US Army whistleblower who used the pseudonym 'JP.'

The whistleblower claimed he was on a mission where he was taken by a Blackhawk helicopter to an ocean platform, then boarded a high-tech submarine crewed by tall, Nordic-looking extraterrestrials.

The submarine, capable of space travel, took him to an underwater city under a dome, resembling Dubai, with a large white pyramid. The mission involved retrieving an artifact, but no physical evidence of this mission has ever been produced.

Despite Burchett and Salla's lack of tangible evidence, there has been growing interest and testimony from credible sources, including military personnel at congressional hearings, suggesting that UFOs and extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth. 

A recent congressional hearing on September 9 featured new whistleblowers who shared their experiences with UFOs, including a video showing an orb-like object surviving a missile strike and splitting into four parts they kept flying.

'We have naval personnel telling me we have these sightings, these underwater craft they're chasing that go hundreds of miles an hour, and the best we got is something that does maybe a little under forty miles an hour,' Burchett said in the interview posted on X.

'So I got a lot of questions about that stuff.'

Yorkshire may be swiftly becoming Britain's 'UFO' hotspot.

Several remarkable new photos reveal a flurry of so-called 'unidentified flying objects' in Headingley in Leeds, West Yorkshire. 

Local resident and photographer Jesse Gallagher snapped the strange collection of unearthly bodies over several months using his iPhone.

The snaps, shared exclusively with the Daily Mail, were all taken after dark around midnight, making their ghostly light easier for the camera to detect. 

And they certainly form an eerie motely crew of strange shapes and sizes, several deviating a lot from traditional depictions of a UFO. 

'When zooming in, the orbs are either white or multi-coloured and can be seen pulsating,' Mr Gallagher told the Daily Mail. 

'One recording has the moon as a backdrop which provides some interesting perspective.

'I have seen other videos of similar objects around the world.'  

Mr Gallagher said his footage was captured around midnight in Headingley between August 2021 and November 2023. 

Bizarrely, one of the UFOs with a ghostly slivery-blue tint resembles a spoon or a spade – with a narrow stream of light connecting a fainter circle.

Another entity in an even deeper shade of blue seems to form a very rough sphere or orb and be emitting a faint beams of light. 

Meanwhile, the third snap shows a bright white ball of brilliant light, almost perfectly circular, with the moon as a tiny blob in the background. 

But perhaps most intriguing photo shows a textured grey object with an unusual level of detail – a possible cone or horn, with what seems to be a hole in the middle. 

Clues from its appearance suggest it could be a discarded piece of machinery or a fragment of disused spacecraft.

But, in such an instance, rules of physics surely dictate that it would hit the ground. 

Philip Mantle, a British UFO researcher, said the images show some kind of 'distant light source that is out of focus'. 

'The out of focus image makes the light look very different from what the naked eye would see,' he told the Daily Mail. 

'They could well be simple lens flares as seen in the photo of the moon.' 

But Mr Mantle stopped short of calling them 'UFOs' – a term that may or may not describe an object thought to have an extraterrestrial origin.

Only last week, another Yorkshire resident revealed  photos of a bizarre saucer-shaped object just outside of Skipton. 

John Tunnah took about 10 or 12 photographs from his vantage point near the hills, but the object only appeared in one of them.

The object is remarkably similar to the classic UFO saucer shape depicted in popular culture, with a distinctive round and elongated shape. 

Nick Pope, a UFO expert formerly with the UK's Ministry of Defence, offered a number of explanations for Mr Tunnah's photo. 

'When photos show an anomaly that wasn't seen at the time, I suspect either a glitch with the camera, or a fast-moving object like a bird or an insect, close to the lens,' Mr Pope told the Daily Mail. 

UFOs became a major subject of interest after World War II and were thought by some researchers to be intelligent extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. 

In the US, the government's Department of Defense, commonly known as the Pentagon, now refrains from using the term UFO at all.

This is largely because it is commonly associated with wind up conspiracy theories and paranoia.

Instead, the Pentagon uses UAP – 'unidentified aerial phenomenon' – although in most places this has low usage and is yet to enter common parlance.

Clear and startling images of what appears to be a UFO were captured over Los Angeles, sparking fresh debate about what's flying over America's biggest cities.

A pair of Los Angeles residents were on their balcony when they spotted a black, V-shaped craft covered in lights moving slowly over the city on August 28.

The sighting went on for roughly 25 minutes, with the UFO flying south until the witnesses eventually lost sight of it around 11:38pm local time (2:38am ET).

The pair was able to capture both pictures and clear videos with a cellphone camera, zooming in to see nine white lights along the UFO's hull.

UFO researcher and filmmaker Mark Christopher Lee told the Daily Mail he believes the craft was not an alien spaceship, instead offering some alternate theories.
