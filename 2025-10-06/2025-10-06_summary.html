The Israeli army has declared a temporary pause in its military operation “Gideon's Chariots 2,” which had primarily focused on occupying Gaza City. This decision came after the Israeli political leadership recommended scaling down offensive operations and restricting them to defensive measures in an attempt to create a suitable atmosphere for negotiations — particularly following Hamas's positive response to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal regarding Gaza.

In the past days, Israeli forces had expanded military operations in the city, encircling it completely from all sides and seizing control of entire neighborhoods in the heart of Gaza City, such as Sheikh Radwan, Sabra, and Tal al-Hawa. They relied on a scorched-earth policy, using intensive artillery, aerial, and naval bombardments, in addition to deploying old armored personnel carriers loaded with tons of explosives used to demolish entire residential neighborhoods and clear the way for ground forces.

The Israeli military operation displaced more than 600,000 of the city's residents and carried out systematic destruction that Gaza City had not witnessed since October 2023.

Before the war began, Gaza City had always been the most vibrant and prosperous area in the Gaza Strip. Known as the beating heart of the Strip and an inseparable part of it, the city had long been celebrated for its picturesque streets, green gardens, and remarkable historical landmarks, as well as for hosting several universities and distinguished educational institutions.

The destruction of Gaza City and displacement of its residents once again is deliberate and highly calculated. Israel fully understands how precious Gaza City is to the Palestinian people and how much they have already suffered living without it during 16 months of forced displacement in the south.

Most of Gaza City's residents are refugees who were forced to abandon their lands under the threat of massacres carried out by Zionist militias in 1948. Among them were my grandparents, displaced from the small village of Beit Daras, only 32 kilometers from Gaza City. For my grandparents and thousands of other refugees, Gaza City became the nearest refuge from the horrors they had experienced at the hands of the Zionist forces that attacked their villages. They thought they would remain in the city only for a short time and then be allowed to return to their homelands. However, days turned into years, and that glimmer of hope began to vanish. This pushed them to rebuild their lives in Gaza City, which they came to consider their second home.

Our grandparents' love and attachment to Gaza City were passed down through generations to us. We loved it as if it were our original homeland — the place that holds our memories and everything we hold dear in life. We believed we would live happily in Gaza City forever, never imagining that the Israelis would displace us from it, just as they did to our grandparents in 1948.

Leaving the city for the second time and heading south — the area that Israeli forces claim to be “safe” — was an agonizing decision for Gazans. We knew all too well that remaining in the city was impossible, as Israeli forces were carrying out a systematic plan of gradual occupation and “cleansing” of Gaza City's neighborhoods, killing anyone who refused to leave. At the same time, we also knew that life in tents — stripped of the most basic necessities and overshadowed by the uncertainty of whether we would ever return home — was simply another form of death.

Most Gazans believe that this displacement is the worst thing that has happened to them since the beginning of the war, as Israeli forces have used new and more aggressive methods to expel us — such as detonating explosives-laden robots in residential neighborhoods and using quadcopters to plant landmines on the roofs of homes to demolish them. Added to this are the heavy financial burdens we have never faced in any of our previous displacements: a single tent costs $1,000; renting a piece of land to set it up costs $200; hiring a truck to transport belongings can reach $1,000 due to soaring fuel prices and vehicle maintenance costs; and building a makeshift bathroom can cost $300.

The idea of paying such staggering amounts to leave your beloved home and live in a tent in exile reflects the depth of the oppression and pain we endure — as if our lives are meaningless, as if we are no longer seen as human beings with the right to live with dignity.

The despair we are living through keeps us clinging to the news, scanning for any headlines containing the word “ceasefire.” Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza and the Hamas-Israel agreement have become the only things that help us endure the hell of life in tents in the south. We hope that this time the war will truly end forever, that our stay in the south will not last too long like the last time, and that we will be able to return to our homes and live normally — free from bombardment, starvation, and daily killing — like anyone else in the world deserves.

Solaf Saim, 44, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City and now lives in a tent in Deir al-Balah, said, “Leaving my home was like taking my soul away from my body. I never imagined such a horrible scenario.” Saim mentioned that she and her children are eagerly waiting for the announcement of a possible ceasefire so they can return to Gaza City, even though their home may be destroyed. “Just end the war and return me to my neighborhood. If my home is destroyed, I will set up a tent over its rubble, and I will be happy just because I am in the place I belong, surrounded by neighbors. I cannot live in the south. I do not know anyone there. The area is overcrowded, my tent is full of flies and insects, and I cannot stay inside it because of the heat of the sun. I am dying slowly here.”

Shorok Akilah, 30, said she had been determined not to leave the city, unwilling to relive the horrific experience of spending 16 months in a small tent in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis. However, she changed her mind: “The bombardment in my neighborhood intensified, and quadcopters began dropping bombs randomly near my home. Most of my neighbors had already fled south. My children were terrified and constantly crying. I could no longer endure it. I was forced to leave to protect my children — I couldn't let them die.”

She continued, “Gaza City is part of my heart. I cannot imagine living without it. My only wish is to return and never leave again. I hope Trump's plan will truly end the war because we are exhausted. This war has destroyed us in every way and taken us back to the days of the Nakba. Enough is enough.”

Project 2025 architect Russell Vought wants to seize the shutdown to further slash spending with mass federal layoffs.

As crucial services grind to a halt and federal workers go without pay, Donald Trump is using the ongoing government shutdown to do what he does best: grab more power.

Last week, as the shutdown loomed, Trump gloated that his administration would use it as an excuse to shutter “Democrat agencies,” whatever that means. It was, the MAGA leader said, an “unprecedented opportunity” that had been gifted to him by “Radical Left Democrats.” Meanwhile, Russell Vought, an intellectual architect of Project 2025 and the current head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made it clear that the shutdown was an opportunity to simply axe congressionally approved spending mandates, especially if they involved money that disproportionately flowed to blue states. In a memo sent out to all government departments in the days leading up to the shutdown, Vought's OMB ordered agencies come up with reduction in force plans for projects, programs, and activities that aren't “consistent with the President's priorities.” With that directive, the OMB furthered the mission of its head, long a supporter of an unbound presidency, to free up Trump to ignore Congress at his pleasure. 

The administration then proceeded to pull $8 billion in clean energy grants from 16 blue states and suspend payments on $18 billion for federal transport infrastructure projects in the New York region. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also announced it would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of FEMA disaster-preparedness grants from states until they recalculated their populations to reflect the recent mass deportations undertaken by the administration — a naked ploy to revise downwards the populations of large Democratic states such as California, New York, and Illinois — in a likely effort to reduce the number of congressional representatives that they are allotted.

By Friday, as the Senate voted on (and failed to pass) several bills to fund the government, the administration let it be known, through a series of announcements from White House spokespeople and surrogates appearing on right-wing media outlets, that it would soon begin implementing plans to permanently fire thousands of additional federal workers. Ever-pliant House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's egregious overreach, arguing that with the shutdown, Senate Democrats had handed “the keys to the kingdom to the president.” While the White House again talked about eviscerating agencies that “don't align with the administration's values,” Johnson blamed Democrats for the failure to pass a funding bill and said that they “have now effectively turned off the legislative branch … and they've turned it over to the executive,” arguing that mass firings are within Trump's authority.

Those mass firings have largely not happened yet. On October 1, the first full day of the shutdown, Federal News Network reported that only the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had followed through on the demand to reduce its capacity, firing 1 percent of its workers in order to “focus on mission-critical operations.” In the days since, no additional mass firings have taken place. But the White House has stressed that thousands of other jobs could be on the chopping block. Given Trump's desire to shrink the federal workforce and to kill off programs and agencies and entire departments that he doesn't like, the shutdown seems simply a convenient excuse to implement harsh cuts the administration would likely have embarked upon anyway in the coming months.

That they hadn't begun the chopping by this past weekend seemingly reflects internal divisions in the GOP ranks, with many GOP congressmembers and senators deeply uncomfortable with the sort of across-the-board government reductions that Vought has been championing. But the longer the shutdown continues, and the more that Trump believes he can frame the cuts as being caused by Democratic intransigence during the budget fight, the more the administration could lean into Vought's take-no-prisoners strategy. In fact, over the weekend Trump began framing potential firings as “Democrat layoffs.”

The list of agencies where most employees have already been furloughed, compared to the list of services deemed “essential” and of “national security” value, may offer clues about where the Trump administration wants to target its culling efforts in the weeks to come. There's nothing inevitable about how these lists are populated: In a shutdown, the administration ultimately has tremendous discretion as to which employees and agencies it considers “essential” and can mandate to work through the shutdown, and which it views as disposable and can send home.

Turns out — no surprise — that this administration values its hard power federal employees: those whose jobs involve coercion, incarceration, and security. The rest, as they have repeatedly stressed, can be put “in trauma,” in Vought's unpleasant-but-honest phrasing, or at least made to feel perennially vulnerable.

Ahead of the shutdown, the administration laid out plans to furlough only about one-quarter of the federal workforce, people who would be sent home during the shutdown and wouldn't be expected to return to work until the government reopened. This represents a lower percentage than in previous shutdowns. The majority of federal employees would still be expected to show up at their jobs, and to work without pay for the duration of the shutdown. Demanding those employees work without paychecks, while simultaneously hanging over the federal workforce the Damocletian sword of potential mass firings, seems like a strategy designed to make employees feel perennially insecure. It makes it harder for them to protest being asked to work without pay or being furloughed from an agency deemed non-critical to the national well-being, since it presents an even more unpalatable alternative: If you don't like it, the argument goes, we can always simply fire you instead. It's somewhat akin to a theory of foreign policy associated with Richard Nixon, who believed that adversaries were more likely to comply if they feared him lashing out unpredictably.

The vast majority of employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Labor Department, the Education Department, and other soft-power agencies have been placed on leave for the duration of the shutdown. The shutdown offered the Trump administration a convenient workaround for a recent court order to keep Voice of America functioning and to stop the firing of 500 employees. National Parks have been closed to visitors. At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), offices working on climate change issues have gone dark, while divisions reconfigured to work on rolling back climate change regulations remain open for business. Meanwhile, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, immigration courts, and the rest of the deportation-machine agencies are humming along as if it's still September 2025; only 5 percent of Homeland Security personnel are being furloughed, compared to 89 percent at the EPA and 87 percent at the beleaguered Department of Education. Meanwhile, ICE has announced that because of the huge influx of cash it received under the recent Budget Reconciliation Act, it will have no problems continuing operations through the shutdown.

Making all of this worse, many furloughed workers report that, without their knowledge, their emails began sending out automatic replies blaming Democrats for the shutdown and for the fact they aren't at their computers and able to respond to the public's questions. Government agency websites have subjected visitors to similar messages. Open up the Housing Department's website, and you are greeted with the following message, which flashes up first in blue, with a red banner across the entire page: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.” Click onto the Department of Agriculture website, and you can read “Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

All of this naked propaganda is a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the civil service from being used for partisan purposes. Yet, the longer the shutdown continues, the more one can expect this lawless administration to ratchet up the political stunts, using every tool in its arsenal to frame the message that it has the interests of the American people at heart while Democrats hold the country hostage to an “extremist” agenda. If the administration does ultimately start firing thousands of federal employees, expect that vindictive measure, too, to be pitched as simply being an unfortunate but necessary response to the “Radical Left's” efforts to shutter basic government services.

This despite the fact that the GOP controls the presidency, both houses of Congress, and is buttressed by a hard-right majority on the Supreme Court; this, too, despite the fact that what Democrats have asked for is for funding to be restored to insurance subsidies so that millions of families can continue to afford to access health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, and that it is GOP intransigence on this fundamental issue that is standing in the way of a vote to fund government.

This is a shutdown the GOP should have to own. Democrats aren't responsible for the furloughing of workers, and they certainly won't be responsible if Trump decides to fire thousands of additional employees in the days to come.

TBILISI, October 6. /TASS/. Organizations directly financed by the European Union took part in the October 4 attempt to overthrow the government of Georgia, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said.

"Over the past four years, five attempted revolutions financed from abroad have taken place. Right now, organizations directly financed by the European Union participated in the attempt to seize power," he told the Rustavi-2 television.

Kobakhidze went on to say that despite such incidents, Georgia has maintained "one-sided friendship" with the EU, and was ready to reboot relations at any moment.

"There is no place for grudge in politics," the premier added.

On October 4, the day of the municipal elections, an opposition demonstration took place in Tbilisi. The organizers, who announced plans to oust the government, called from the stage to "take the keys to the presidential palace," after which some protesters moved toward the residence. The crowd tore down the fence, but riot police dispersed them using water cannons and tear gas.

In the early hours of October 5, police detained five organizers of the rally, including former Prosecutor General Murtaz Zodelava and opera singer Paata Burchuladze for calls to overthrow the government and organizing mass violence. They could face up to nine years behind bars if found guilty.

Ghislaine Maxwell has vowed to fight on after her appeal to overturn her sex trafficking conviction was rejected by the US Supreme Court.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence in a minimum security prison in Texas for trafficking underage women to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.

On Monday, Supreme Court judges rejected Maxwell's appeal. They did not give a reason for refusing to hear her case, as is customary.

In theory, the decision by the US' highest court of appeal means her only hope of an early release is through a pardon by Donald Trump, the US president.

However, Maxwell's family denied they had run out of legal road and said the disgraced socialite had been preparing a “Habeas petition”, which is used to challenge the lawfulness of an individual's detention.

“This fight isn't over,” David Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said.

“Serious legal and factual issues remain and we will continue to pursue every avenue available to ensure that justice is done.”

Maxwell has “been engaged for many months in preparing – and will shortly file – a Habeas petition” in the Southern District of New York, where she was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022, her family said in a statement.

Among their claims are that the 63-year-old was deprived of an impartial jury, seemingly referring to the fact that a juror failed to disclose a childhood history of sexual abuse in a pre-trial questionnaire.

However, they conceded the decision by the Supreme Court was “disappointing”.

In July, Mr Markus said: “We are appealing not only to the Supreme Court but to the president himself to recognise how profoundly unjust it is to scapegoat Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's crimes, especially when the government promised she would not be prosecuted.”

Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify before Congress in July, but her deposition was delayed because she insisted she could not speak freely while the Supreme Court weighed her appeal.

Her lawyer said she would plead the Fifth Amendment under questioning if she was not granted immunity for future convictions. He also demanded she be sent the questions in advance.

Congress has so far rejected the conditions.

Maxwell said she would testify freely before Congress if Donald Trump freed her from prison.

Mr Trump, who has faced a backlash from supporters for his own association with Epstein, could look favourably on her if she publicly exonerates him from wrongdoing during committee questioning.

It could even endear the president to pardon her. He has previously refused to rule out granting clemency to the disgraced British socialite in exchange for her testimony.

Asked by a reporter on Monday if he would consider pardoning Maxwell after her appeal was rejected, Mr Trump said he would “take a look at it” and speak to the justice department about her case.

“I haven't heard the name in so long – I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it,” the president said.

He added: “I will speak to the DoJ [department of justice]. I wouldn't consider it or not consider it... a lot of people have asked me for a pardon.”

Mr Trump was friends with Maxwell in the 1990s, when they were both fixtures on New York's social scene, until at least 2004 when he fell out with Epstein, reportedly over a Florida real estate deal.

According to Steven Hoffenberg, a former business associate of Epstein's, the president “liked Epstein” but was “crazy about Maxwell, a very charming lady”.

When asked about Maxwell's sex trafficking prosecution in 2020, Mr Trump responded: “I just wish her well, frankly”, adding that he had met her “numerous times over the years”.

Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer of Mr Trump, met with Maxwell as the US president sought to quell criticism over his government's failure to publish all of the documentation it holds on Epstein.

Maxwell told Mr Blanche that she was not aware of any “client list” belonging to Epstein and never saw Mr Trump behave inappropriately.

A week after the interview, Maxwell was moved from a low-security prison facility in Florida to a less-restrictive prison camp in Texas.

Inmates at minimum security institutions, also known as federal prison camps, benefit from a low prison guard-to-inmate ratio and limited to no perimeter fencing.

Maxwell's transfer to the prison, just a week after she was interviewed by Mr Blanche, was condemned by her victims.

The US Justice Department closed the case on Epstein earlier this year, ruling there was “no incriminating client list” or any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.

Maxwell's lawyers argue that her conviction is invalid, saying a plea agreement made with Epstein in Florida in 2007, which shields his associates, should have barred her criminal prosecution in New York.

That agreement stated that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”.

Maxwell's lawyers said that in its reference to co-conspirators, the agreement placed no geographic limit on where the non-prosecution commitment could be enforced.

Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted the following year after being accused of recruiting and grooming girls for sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.

The Epstein case has long been the subject of conspiracy theories, with many believing the disgraced financier sex trafficked underage women to a circle of high-profile associates.

Conspiracy theorists think the financier, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was murdered to stop his so-called “client list” from becoming public.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, said in congressional testimony on Sept 16 that there was no credible information that Epstein trafficked women and underage girls to anyone but himself.

Maxwell failed to convince a trial judge and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out her conviction based on the 2007 non-prosecution agreement.

            A judge at the Tirana appeals court was shot dead on Monday by a man involved in a trial, police in Albania said. The gunman fled the scene but was later arrested.
    


            Judge Astrit Kalaja was shot inside the courtroom by a 30-year-old suspect with the initials E. Sh., according to police. Kalaja died while being taken to a hospital.
    


            The gunman also shot two other people involved in the hearing, police said. Their injuries weren't life-threatening.
    


            Authorities haven't provided details about the motive, or the nature of the case being heard. The case found at the court's website referred to a property.
    


            Police later arrested the suspect, who ran away after the shooting, and also found the alleged revolver he used.
    


            Following sweeping judicial reforms launched in 2016 with support from the European Union and US, tens of thousands of cases have been delayed for years.

Israeli authorities said on Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

Israel's Foreign Ministry posted on X that “the deportees were citizens of Greece, Italy, France, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Denmark, Slovakia, Switzerland, Norway, the U.K., Serbia, and the United States.” The post included photos of Thunberg and other activists wearing white T-shirts and grey sweatpants.

Thunberg was among dozens of deportees to land in Athens, Greece, on Monday afternoon. Crowds of supporters gathered at the Eleftherios Venizelos international airport and chanted “Free free Palestine!” as activists disembarked.

“That this mission has to exist, it's a shame! It is a shame!” Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly after arriving. “I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story,” she added.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their “complicity” with the “genocide” being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.

“This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,” Thunberg said. “We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza.”

Ottawa says Israel will release three Canadians it detained for attempting to reach the Gaza Strip through the Mediterranean Sea.

Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand wrote on the platform X today that “Canada is aware of three Canadians who were detained off the coast of Israel.”

She says Global Affairs Canada has offered consular assistance and “all three are in the process of being released.”

Her department said Sunday that Canada was aware of two detained citizens and had asked Israel to release them.

The group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East says another six Canadians are set to reach the region by mid-week.

The interception of the flotilla led to large-scale demonstrations in cities across the world.

Israeli authorities again rejected mistreatment accusations that have emerged in interviews with activists who were deported to Turkey, Spain and Italy over the weekend. Israel's government has also vehemently denied claims that its offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide, despite a growing number of experts denouncing it as such.

Lubna Tuma, a lawyer with the Adalah association representing more than 470 Global Sumud Flotilla participants who were detained last week as they attempted to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, said 150 people were still held in Israel's Ktziot prison, including Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela. Forty of them were on hunger strike, including many Tunisians.

“Some stated that they prefer that their food go to the people in Gaza,” Tuma said during a briefing on Monday that was broadcast on Adalah's and the flotilla's Instagram accounts. Others were also refusing to drink water “until medical treatment is given to all detainees,” she said.

The association's legal team said the remainder of the activists – including those from countries that don't maintain diplomatic relations with Israel – were expected to be deported on Tuesday.

Israeli authorities said Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including Greta Thunberg.

Adalah lawyers have seen most, but not all, of the activists. Tuma said Israeli authorities have repeatedly violated activists' rights. Tuma said it started with their interception in international waters and continued with their transfer to Israel and detention in a maximum-security prison, where Tuma said activists were subject to physical violence and humiliation.

Israeli authorities have strongly rejected the claims, reiterating that the detainees' rights had been respected throughout their detention. Israel's Foreign Ministry accused one activist of biting a female medical staff member.

Several activists have given testimonies alleging mistreatment by Israeli authorities.

“There was some dehumanizing and violence and shouting,” Roos Ykema, a Dutch member of the flotilla who was deported to Madrid on Sunday, told The Associated Press. “But we got the European treatment,” she added.

North African nationals who were detained told the AP they faced harsher treatment than their European counterparts.

“When I showed my Belgian passport their behaviour toward me changed completely,” said Houssem Eddine Rmedi, a dual Tunisian-Belgian citizen.

Others said they weren't so lucky.

“The moment you show your Tunisian, Algerian or Moroccan passport, they start beating you,” said Moroccan activist Ayoub Habraoui, who added that he and others were kept kneeling under the sun for nearly six hours.

South Africa's government said Monday that its citizens would be released and repatriated on Tuesday via Jordan. Several other governments that had citizens taking part in the flotilla have said their embassies in Israel were working closely with Israeli authorities to make sure activists were released and sent home as swiftly as possible.

Israel's blockade of Gaza and its interception of an aid flotilla are both illegal, maritime law expert Douglas Guilfoyle suggested on Thursday.

Key developments on Oct. 6: 

Ukrainian drones struck Russian-occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 6, hitting the Feodosia oil terminal, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

The terminal, located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, is the largest oil storage facility in Crimea. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

Pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind said the explosion sparked a fire visible from tens of kilometers away, while additional blasts were reported near the Saki and Kacha airfields.

According to the General Staff, the terminal serves as a multifunctional facility for transferring oil and petroleum products between rail, sea, and road transport.

Ukrainian forces also struck an ammunition depot belonging to a logistics battalion of Russia's 18th Combined Arms Army in Crimea, though the results of that strike are still being assessed.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had intercepted 251 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 40 over the occupied peninsula.

Separately, Ukraine also claimed to have struck Russia's state-owned Sverdlov Plant overnight on Oct. 6, one of the country's main producers of explosives and ammunition.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

A Ukrainian attack damaged energy facilities and disrupted power supplies in the Russian city of Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Oct. 5.

The attack follows weeks of intensified Russian strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Nearly 40,000 Belgorod residents were left without electricity after the strike, which caused significant damage across seven municipalities, according to Gladkov.

"We listened to a report from energy officials on the nature of the damage caused by the nighttime shelling of Belgorod. We have significant damage," he said. "Scope of work will be significant."

Emergency crews were deployed to the affected areas, and hospitals in Belgorod have switched to backup power. Local authorities are coordinating school operations amid the outages, Gladkov said.

On the morning of Oct. 6, Gladkov reported that partial power outages continued in 24 settlements, affecting 5,400 residents. He did not indicate when full power restoration was expected.

"Restoration work is continuing, and we hope that it will be completed in the very near future," he said.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) released an alleged intercepted phone call, in which a Belgorod Oblast resident described widespread blackouts and internet outages following the attack.

"All of Shchebekino was without power," a woman can be heard saying. "The streets were all dark."

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio.

Ukraine is investigating evidence that Russian forces executed at least 322 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), the Prosecutor General's Office reported on Oct. 6 in response to a request from Ukrinform.

According to the statement, 263 Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the battlefield, while 59 others were killed in the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian POWs held in Russian captivity often face torture, abuse, and inhumane treatment, according to Ukrainian officials and human rights groups.

Many former POWs have reported beatings, starvation, and psychological pressure.

To date, 80 criminal proceedings have been opened, the Prosecutor General's Office said.

Nine Russian servicemen have been formally charged, while indictments against six of them have already been submitted to court. Two have been convicted, and two more cases remain under judicial review.

Up to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable seen by the outlet.

"After North Korea, Cuba is the largest contributor of foreign troops to Russia's aggression, with an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans fighting in Ukraine," the cable said.

The U.S. circulated an unclassified cable, sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, as part of its campaign to counter a United Nations resolution calling for Washington to lift its embargo on the Caribbean nation, which has been in place since 1960.

The Oct. 2 unclassified cable, sent to dozens of U.S. missions, directs diplomats to urge foreign governments to oppose the resolution, which has passed the U.N. General Assembly every year since 1992.

The U.N. resolution holds symbolic value, only the U.S. Congress can ultimately lift the decades-long embargo.

According to Reuters, the U.S. State Department declined to provide additional details on the Cuban fighters, but said it was aware of reports that they were serving alongside Russian troops.

Fox Sports analyst and former New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the late-night incident in a downtown Indianapolis alleyWade Payne/The Associated Press

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is now facing a felony battery charge for what authorities said Monday was a fight over parking, in addition to the misdemeanour charges that the Fox Sports analyst was already facing from the weekend incident in Indianapolis.

Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears announced the felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury, which carries a potential sentence of one to six years in prison, during a news conference with Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Chris Bailey. Mears said the investigation is ongoing and that additional charges are possible.

“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” the prosecutor told reporters.

A police affidavit alleges the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted a 69-year-old truck driver who backed into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis, leading to a confrontation early Saturday outside the vehicle that prompted the driver to pull out a knife to defend himself.

The former New York Jets quarterback was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the altercation, according to court records filed Sunday.

It became clear after investigators learned more about the victim's medical condition that the more serious felony charge was warranted, Mears said.

“This was a situation that did not need to occur,” the prosecutor said. “The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries as a result of that altercation.”

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, the initial affidavit signed by a police detective said. The truck driver, identified as P.T., had a cut to his left cheek, it said.

Authorities have not said whether the truck driver might also faces charges, but Mears noted that Indiana “has some of the most robust self-defence laws in the nation.”

Sanchez had been scheduled for a hearing Tuesday on the original misdemeanour charges but that was rescheduled to Nov. 4. Sanchez remained hospitalized and was listed in stable condition Monday morning.

One of Sanchez's attorneys, James Voyles, declined to comment on the case.

“This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days,” Sanchez's brother, Nick, said in a statement released Monday. “Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.”

Mark Sanchez was in Indianapolis for the network's coverage of Sunday's game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

The prosecutor said police are still gathering information and have several outstanding search warrants. He also said surveillance video captured the incident from multiple angles.

“I don't care who you are. I don't care what you do for a living. I don't care where you live,” the police chief said. “If you come into our city, commit violence, we will use all the tools at our disposal to hold you accountable.”

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

            A rare, monstrous EF5 tornado that struck the United States more than three months ago was the first of its kind in more than a decade, experts announced Monday.
    


            A tornado that roared through part of eastern North Dakota in June and killed three people was upgraded Monday to an EF5 with winds greater than 210 mph, the National Weather Service in Grand Forks, North Dakota, confirmed.
    


            EF5 tornadoes pack winds of at least 201 mph and are the highest level of the Enhanced Fujita Scale, the scale used to determine tornado strength. Tornadoes this strong are rare. Only 60 tornadoes of EF5 strength – including this one – have been recorded since 1950, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center.
    


            The tornado first hit near Enderlin, North Dakota – located about 40 miles southwest of Fargo – and tracked north for nearly 20 minutes and about 12 miles before ending near Alice.
    


            Tornadoes are rated after they've occurred based on the degree of damage they cause. The Enderlin tornado was originally rated an EF3 with winds of 160 mph.
    


            Additional investigation by weather service meteorologists in consultation with other scientists led to the upgrade, mainly based on the damage the tornado did to a freight train.
    


            The violent tornado tossed one empty train car nearly 500 feet off the track and knocked over several fully loaded grain hopper cars, according to the report. Its raging winds also ripped large trees down to stubs and inflicted “complete destruction” on one farmstead.
    


            The last EF5 tornado in the US roared through Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2013. Twenty-four people were killed and more than 200 were injured after the tornado turned the city to rubble in a matter of moments.
    


            Despite the rarity of such a monster, the fact that there hadn't been an EF5 tornado in more than a decade didn't sit right with some scientists.
    


            A study released in August dove into this so-called EF5 tornado “drought” and posited the lack of these high-end ratings had more to do with a potentially imbalanced damage rating scale than the power of the twisters themselves.
    


            Tornadoes are assigned ratings based on the type of damage that they do and that damage level is tied to a wind speed. A tornado that rips apart a single family home down to its foundation is given winds of 200 mph, making it an EF4. However, before the scale was changed in 2007, that type of damage was considered the most extreme level.
    


            The August study argued that adjusting the definition of an EF5 tornado down slightly to 190 mph would result in an EF5 frequency that's more consistent with decades past.
    


            That area of discussion will continue for years to come, but one thing is certain: The EF5 counter has reset and the clock is ticking again.

			Man viewed as inspiring leader faces deportation after being arrested by ICE agents in Iowa

An illegal migrant with a criminal history who was in charge of overseeing the running of a number of schools in Iowa is now facing deportation.

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines School Board, was arrested by ICE agents after he was found to be an undocumented migrant with a final order for deportation.

The arrest of the popular superintendent sparked a backlash in the state leading his supporters to protest for his release.

In addition to him being in the US illegally, inconsistencies in his CV and previous run-ins with the law, which allegedly involved Mr Roberts carrying a gun through an airport, have since emerged.

Mr Roberts was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers on Sept 26 after he was found hiding, dressed in a suit, near a trailer park.

Investigators said he had fled in a Jeep owned by the school district, where a loaded handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash were later recovered.

When he was selected to run the public school district in 2023, he was viewed as the sort of inspiring leader who could turn around the district after the Covid-19 pandemic.

The former Olympic athlete had a compelling life story, having immigrated from Guyana, allegedly earned degrees from impressive universities and spent most of his career in urban school systems building a reputation for his hands-on approach.

“I believe deeply in the promise of public education being the most important opportunity gap closer for youth, particularly with a focus on diverse populations,” Mr Roberts wrote in his cover letter, according to The New York Times.

Despite a past brush with the law and an inconsistency about where he obtained his doctorate, the school board moved ahead with hiring him after two outside vetting companies confirmed he was a US citizen.

For two years, Mr Roberts oversaw the education of 30,000 children in the public system and ushered in improvements in academic standards.

Even after a Texas judge ordered him to be deported last year, Mr Roberts allegedly continued to drop into classrooms and encouraged voters to approve more funds for the district.

Mr Roberts had arrived in the US from South America in his 20s and attended Coppin State University in Baltimore, where he competed in the athletics team.

He went on to represent Guyana, running in the 800m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

According to ICE, Mr Roberts entered the US on a visitors' visa in 1994 when he was in his twenties and had arrests in New York in 1996 for drug charges and in 1998 on a charge of using an unauthorised vehicle, which was later dismissed.

After receiving a five-year student visa in 1999, the year after obtaining a bachelor's degree from Coppin State, he undertook a master's in education at St John's University in New York.

In 2001, he unsuccessfully applied to become a permanent US resident and went on to work as a teacher in Baltimore for five years before becoming a principal.

A former public school official who once interviewed Mr Roberts praised his “incredible energy” and the “tremendous rapport” he had with kids, according to The New York Times.

Throughout the subsequent years, the teacher's immigration status remained unclear, though ICE indicated to the newspaper that he had legal status in the country from 2018 to 2020.

During this time, he led a struggling high school in Washington, DC and a district office in St Louis, Missouri, specialising in turning around underperforming urban public schools.

In 2020, he was hired as a superintendent at a school district in Pennsylvania, telling the school system he was an American citizen when he applied, district leaders said.

Months later, his authorisation to work in the country is alleged to have expired.

Following his arrest, Mr Roberts was first placed on paid leave, then unpaid leave before the school board accepted his resignation.

Further holes have since emerged in the educator's CV. Mr Roberts claimed on his application in Iowa and Pennsylvania that he had a doctorate from Morgan State University. However, university officials said he never received his degree.

An article on the Des Moines Public Schools site said that Mr Roberts received a Master's degree from MIT, but the university said it had no record of him attending.

While Des Moines School Board officials were aware of a citation against Mr Roberts for having a loaded gun in a vehicle in Pennsylvania, they were unaware of a separate alleged arrest in 2020 for carrying a gun through an airport.

In the now-sealed case in New York, Mr Roberts was allegedly arrested for carrying a gun in his bag at LaGuardia Airport, an official told The New York Times. It is not clear if he was charged.

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said he “should have never been able to work around children”.

Jackie Norris, the chairwoman of the Des Moines School Board, said the district had followed the law and relied on an outside firm, JG Consulting, to assess Mr Roberts's credentials.

On Friday, the school district sued JG consulting, accusing it of failing to vet Mr Roberts properly. A lawyer for the consulting firm defended its work and said that the teacher “provided the documents necessary to show that he was eligible for the position”.

Mr Roberts's lawyer said that the Department of Homeland Security was attempting to “demonise” his client.

“It is a disturbing pattern that will fail,” Mr Parrish told The New York Times, adding that “the public will see that Dr. Roberts is a good man whose main interest was inspiring and educating young people”.

The Department of Homeland Security, Des Moines School Board, JG Consulting and representatives for Mr Roberts were approached for comment.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who is a high-profile Democrat, spoke alongside Ontario Premier Doug Ford at a joint press conference in Quebec City with Quebec Premier François Legault on Monday.Jacques Boissinot/The Canadian Press

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Ontario Premier Doug Ford say they don't want Donald Trump to bully Prime Minister Mark Carney during a White House meeting on Tuesday and urged the U.S. President to strike a trade deal with Canada that benefits both countries.

Mr. Carney is returning to Washington to meet with Mr. Trump for a second time on Tuesday, although Canadian officials are cautioning not to expect any breakthroughs.

Mr. Shapiro, who is a high-profile Democrat, spoke alongside Mr. Ford at a joint news conference in Quebec City on Monday after a meeting between Great Lakes governors and other U.S. officials and the premiers of Ontario and Quebec.

Carney has large and risky job ahead of him on Washington visit, former officials say

Mr. Shapiro, who could be in the running to become a 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, said he's “very concerned” about the Trump administration's policies and that “dangerous” tariffs have caused costs to skyrocket in his state, including for farmers, small businesses and manufacturers.

He said he respects Canada's sovereignty and it is against the United States' long-term interest to fight with Canada.

“I hope the President of the United States has re-evaluated his tough guy approach to Canada,” Mr. Shapiro said on Monday.

“Instead of coming in and trying to bully the Prime Minister, actually sit down and work to hammer out a deal that lifts everyone up. This is not a zero-sum game. I don't believe that if a Canadian does well, a Pennsylvanian has to be worse off.”

Pennsylvania has a balanced trade policy with Canada of roughly US$14-billion in imports and exports, with more than 10,000 people in his state working for Canadian-based companies, Mr. Shapiro said.

LeBlanc hopes to make progress on steel, aluminum tariff relief before USMCA review

Mr. Ford, meanwhile, said dealing with the U.S. President is unpredictable, but he hopes Canada can achieve certainty with a fair trade deal for both sides of the border.

“I don't want the Prime Minister in there getting bullied,” the Premier said.

“Hopefully we'll come out with positive results. And I'm confident that the Prime Minister is going to go in there and do a great job. He's a smart, smart businessperson. So let's see what happens.”

Mr. Ford also criticized the President for abandoning a constructive relationship with Canada in favour of other countries. “It seems like he's given more love to China and Russia than he is his closet ally in the entire world,” the Premier said.

He added that Canada has critical minerals that the U.S. needs, and that it would be beneficial for both countries to see some tariff relief, including on steel.

The Ontario Premier also repeated his threat to pull Crown Royal whiskey from the shelves of the LCBO, after Diageo – one of the world's largest alcohol producers – said it would be closing a bottling plant in Southwestern Ontario next year. Mr. Ford also mused Monday about possibly taking down other alcohol products owned by U.K.-based Diageo, such as Smirnoff vodka.

Opinion: Without a deal with Trump, Carney rolls out responses for an economic rupture

Since returning to the White House earlier this year, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a string of tariffs: 50 per cent on steel and aluminum, 25 per cent on autos – with a carve-out for U.S. parts – and 35 per cent on any goods traded outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with the exception of oil, gas and potash, which are subject to 10-per-cent tariffs.

On Sept. 30, Mr. Trump imposed a new 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber shipments, raising the total levy on softwood to more than 45 per cent.

Mr. Trump on Monday said he and Mr. Carney would discuss tariffs, which the U.S. President claimed were causing companies to leave Canada for the U.S.

“Well, I guess he's going to ask about tariffs, because a lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States, you know, everybody's moving back,” he told reporters in the Oval Office when asked what would be on the agenda for his meeting with the Prime Minister. “They're losing a lot of companies in Canada.”

Mr. Trump did not specify which companies he was referring to, but insisted these were companies that “left here 20 years ago” because “presidents that sat here right at this desk weren't doing their job.”

The President said his tariffs have been “effective.” 

When asked if he would be open to changing his position on tariffs in his talks with Mr. Carney, Mr. Trump replied by talking up the amount of money tariffs have raised for the U.S. treasury.

“Everybody has said I'm right. They find billions of dollars that they didn't even know they had. Recently, they said they found billions of dollars and they couldn't understand it. I said ‘check the tariffs shelf,' and they come in the next hour and they say ‘sir, you're right, it's from the tariffs,'” Mr. Trump said.

The tariffs are paid by importers bringing Canadian and other foreign products into the U.S, with the cost typically passed on to American consumers.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also characterized Mr. Carney's visit as a “working meeting” and said trade would be on the agenda.

“I'm sure trade will be a topic of discussion tomorrow and all of the other issues that are facing both Canada and the United States. I know that the President looks forward to having that discussion with Carney in the Oval Office,” she said at a Monday press briefing.

Quebec Premier François Legault said on Monday that he did not want to set expectations for the Carney-Trump meeting too high, but that certainty is needed.

“What will happen next week? What will happen with the renegotiation of the USMCA next year?” Mr. Legault said.

“The most important thing is to have a long-term forecast about the market, and right now it's total uncertainty. So, we can see that private investments are really on pause everywhere in Canada.”

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, also a Democrat, added that the uncertainty in Washington “is a problem, and it shouldn't be a problem.”

Meanwhile, Official Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre challenged Mr. Carney to bring home results from his meeting with Mr. Trump.

In an open letter to Mr. Carney released Monday, Mr. Poilievre remarked that former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper struck a truce in the long-running Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute within 80 days of taking office.

“If you only return with excuses, broken promises and photo ops, you will have failed our workers, our businesses and our country,” the Conservative leader wrote.

“Get the tariffs off Canadian softwood lumber,” he continued, noting that softwood levies have “more than doubled since you took office. Time for the promised win for suffering lumber workers, mills and towns.”

Mr. Poilievre urged Mr. Carney to persuade Mr. Trump to remove U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and autos.

“Time for your promised win to reverse the damage.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use spyware “threatens Americans' freedom of movement and freedom of speech.”

Today, federal lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) demanding information on any plans Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has to use Graphite, a spyware program that can access — without the owner's knowledge or consent — a phone's location data, photos, and encrypted applications, including WhatsApp and Signal.

Last year, the Biden administration paused the contract with Paragon Solutions, which operates Graphite, while it conducted a review to ensure it complied with an executive order issued in 2023 which limits the government's use of spyware. In August, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, news that was first reported by All-Source Intelligence.

The letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was signed by Democratic Reps. Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Shontel Brown (Ohio), and Yassamin Ansari (Arizona).

The lawmakers asked Noem to provide information on the government's use of surveillance technology by October 14, including “a comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE's strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use to spyware “threatens Americans' freedom of movement and freedom of speech.” 

“Given the Trump Administration's disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE's repeated attacks on the rule of law,” they wrote. 

Paragon was founded in 2019 by former Israeli military intelligence officers who worked in the Israeli military's Unit 8200. Last year, the Florida-based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, bought Paragon.

Recently, Microsoft blocked Unit 8200's access to its cloud software after an investigation published in The Guardian revealed that the unit was using the cloud to store information on Palestinians — information that was then used to plan deadly attacks on Gaza. 

Paragon has been repeatedly accused of violating people's human rights. Earlier this year, the company was embroiled in a scandal after investigations revealed that the software had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Europe.

“There's no link to click, attachment to download, file to open or mistake to make,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the Associated Press of Graphite. “One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.

Researchers with The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, conducted a forensic analysis of two reporters' phones — “a prominent European journalist” who asked to remain anonymous, and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino. Both journalists' phones were targeted with Graphite, according to the researchers' report released in June.  

Amnesty International says Graphite “can never be human rights compliant and should be banned.”

“Paragon's Graphite spyware product is a form of highly invasive spyware capable of covertly accessing the most intimate and sensitive data on an individual's phone, and cannot be independently audited,” the group said in March.

The letter to Noem comes as the Trump administration has targeted anyone it perceives as an enemy, including pro-Palestine activists, anti-ICE protesters, and Democratic elected officials. On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.

In comments to Truthout on Monday, Lee said that she will “not allow ICE to operate in the shadows.”

“Once that kind of surveillance is allowed, it rarely stays limited to whatever the government claims it is for,” she said. “History shows what happens when governments are given this kind of unchecked access. It leads to intimidation, to silence, to control. And too often, it is immigrants, organizers, and people speaking out for justice who feel it first. Our responsibility is to protect civil liberties, not surrender them.”

More than 100,000 Western-made components were discovered in drones and missiles launched by Russia against Ukraine overnight on Oct. 5, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a day after.

This revelation highlights the continued presence of Western technology in Moscow's weapons, despite years of sanctions.

Russian troops launched around 500 drones and more than 50 missiles in a large-scale attack on Ukraine, targeting settlements across the country, including those far from the front lines in the west. The strike killed at least six people, including an entire family of four, and left 18 others injured.

According to Zelensky, the attack drones contained 100,688 foreign-made components. Around 1,500 were found in Iskander missiles, 192 in Kinzhal ballistic missiles, and 405 in Kalibr cruise missiles.

These components were reportedly manufactured by companies based in the U.S., China, Taiwan, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

Ukraine's partners already have detailed information on every company and every product involved, Zelensky said. He added that Kyiv is also working on new sanctions targeting individuals and entities aiding Russia.

"It is crucial to shut down every scheme that circumvents sanctions, because Russia uses each one to keep killing. The world has the power to stop this," Zelensky said. 

While Western countries have banned the export of many dual-use components to Russia, Moscow has adapted to sanctions by relying on smuggling networks and other schemes to obtain restricted goods.

Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, previously said that most foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield in Ukraine originate from China.

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 6 that he has "sort of made a decision" on whether to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles. 

Officials from Russia's Tyumen Oblast claimed on Telegram that three Ukrainian drones were shot down over an "industrial facility" in the city, adding that no fire, casualties, or explosions occurred amid the attack. 





The CDU-6 unit has a capacity of 160,000 barrels per day — around 40% of the refinery's total output. According to Reuters, repairs may take around a month.



According to the statement, 263 Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the battlefield, while 59 others were killed in the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Over the last few weeks, drones have violated the airspace of at least eight European countries.

The components were reportedly manufactured by companies based in the U.S., China, Taiwan, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

Everyone managed to take shelter in time, and no casualties were reported. The fire has since been extinguished by first responders.

The facility produces a wide range of munitions, including aircraft and artillery shells, guided air bombs, anti-tank missile warheads, and ammunition for air defense and engineering units.

Both leaders began their trips by honoring fallen Ukrainian soldiers at Kyiv's Wall of Remembrance. 

The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

"We are using all tools," Danish Industry and Trade Minister Morten Bodskov said.

"We have significant damage. The scope of work will be significant," Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

Sikorski added that the Polish consul had concluded meetings with the country's citizens held in Israel. “They are expected to return to Poland shortly,” he said, urging Polish nationals to follow the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' guidance and avoid travelling to areas considered dangerous.

Konsul RP właśnie zakończył widzenie z naszymi obywatelami zatrzymanymi w Izraelu.Mimo, że odmówili dobrowolnego wyjazdu, powinni w najbliższych dniach wrócić na łono ojczyzny.Jeszcze raz apeluję o przestrzeganie przestróg @MSZ_RP.

Those detained by Israel in international waters included MP Franciszek Sterczewski, Omar Farris, president of the Polish Palestinian Socio-Cultural Association, and Karolina “Nina” Ptak, president of the Nomada Association, who has begun a hunger strike in protest against her detention, Polish media report.

Journalist and activist Ewa Jasiewicz, who also holds British citizenship, was part of the same humanitarian mission to Gaza.

According to the latest information from the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the Polish citizens were among 171 people deported from Israel on Monday, 6 October.

Slovakia seeks a swift end to the war in Ukraine rather than Russia's defeat, Prime Minister Robert Fico said during a televised debate on Slovak public broadcaster STVR on Oct. 5.

“The goal of the foreign policy of the Slovak Republic, of the government of the Slovak Republic, of which I am the prime minister, is not the defeat of the Russian Federation. Our goal is to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible. These are Slavs killing each other. War is not a solution,” Fico said.

Fico criticized the European Union's approach to Russia's war against Ukraine and accused the bloc of focusing on military aid instead of peace initiatives.

“If the EU spent as much energy on peace as it does on supporting the war in Ukraine, the war could have been over long ago. I will never be a wartime prime minister,” he said.

Since returning to office in 2023, Fico has ended military aid to Ukraine from Slovak army stocks and questioned EU sanctions on Russia. In the past, Fico has also vowed to block Kyiv's entry into NATO — a move that requires the agreement of all 32 members, including Slovakia.

Fico visited Moscow in December 2024 and has been fostering closer ties with Moscow, both diplomatically and economically.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 6 that he has "sort of made a decision" on whether to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles. 

Officials from Russia's Tyumen Oblast claimed on Telegram that three Ukrainian drones were shot down over an "industrial facility" in the city, adding that no fire, casualties, or explosions occurred amid the attack. 





The CDU-6 unit has a capacity of 160,000 barrels per day — around 40% of the refinery's total output. According to Reuters, repairs may take around a month.



According to the statement, 263 Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the battlefield, while 59 others were killed in the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Over the last few weeks, drones have violated the airspace of at least eight European countries.

The components were reportedly manufactured by companies based in the U.S., China, Taiwan, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

Everyone managed to take shelter in time, and no casualties were reported. The fire has since been extinguished by first responders.

The facility produces a wide range of munitions, including aircraft and artillery shells, guided air bombs, anti-tank missile warheads, and ammunition for air defense and engineering units.

Both leaders began their trips by honoring fallen Ukrainian soldiers at Kyiv's Wall of Remembrance. 

The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

"We are using all tools," Danish Industry and Trade Minister Morten Bodskov said.

"We have significant damage. The scope of work will be significant," Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.

DONETSK, October 6. /TASS/. The Ukrainian Armed Forces carried out 10 attacks on settlements in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) over the past 24 hours, firing a total of 11 munitions. One civilian was injured, according to the Office for the Documentation of Ukraine's War Crimes under the Administration of the Head and Government of the DPR.

"Ten incidents of armed attacks by Ukrainian formations [were recorded over the past day]. Information has been received regarding the injury of a civilian," the statement said.

It was specified that in total, the Ukrainian Armed Forces fired 11 munitions at settlements in the region, as a result of which two civilian infrastructure facilities were damaged.

U.S. Israel Education Association Chair Bruce Pearl weighs in on the Israeli-Hamas peace talks and reacts to being called ‘divisive' on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Bruce Pearl stepped down as the Auburn Tigers men's basketball head coach on Monday, and a longtime ESPN host appeared rather pleased about the news.

"Pardon the Interruption" host Michael Wilbon called Pearl a "divisive person" and hoped there was "pressure" to push him out of the program. 

"He had become a divisive person, it seems to me, intentionally. And I hope there was pressure to just get him out," Wilbon said.

Pearl appeared on "The Will Cain Show" on Monday and offered a response to Wilbon, who he said he "loves," adding that a "dear friend" of Wilbon reached out and said Wilbon's sentiments were "probably political" and "not antisemitic."

"I was a regular on ‘Pardon the Interruption.' And I love Tony and Mike and have had great relationships with them… If there's anything I'm not, that is divisive. I've tried to bring people together my entire life. Maybe it's an example of why we can't agree to disagree about saying things politically," Pearl said.

"I was not forced out. I love Auburn. I love the opportunity now to be able to do some things for faith and family and our country, to be an advocate for Israel, an advocate for education. I'm looking forward to being able to do those things while my son is winning basketball games."

Pearl, who is Jewish, has expressed his fervent support for Israel in the face of rising antisemitism in the U.S. since the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel. He's been a supporter of how President Donald Trump has handled the conflicts in the Middle East as well.

NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “Diddy” Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.

In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to “strongly recommend” that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.

FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs “to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,” Combs lawyer Teny Geragos wrote.

Also Monday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname “Puff Daddy,” did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Trump's remarks was left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team.

Combs' sentencing Friday on charges he transported people across state lines for sexual encounters capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called “freak-offs,” and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.

The “I'll Be Missing You” singer was convicted in July under the federal Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.

Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.




In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a “spiritual reset” in jail and is “committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.” 

“I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,” he wrote.

Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.

Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.

FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles (103 kilometers) southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.

Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.

His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.

FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.

In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.

In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.

During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones.

A mother in Connecticut allegedly poisoned her husband with antifreeze while the two were fighting for custody of their child.

Kristen Hogan, a 33-year-old Ridgefield resident, was arrested by the Connecticut State Police on Friday and charged with two counts of attempted murder and a charge of interfering with an officer, according to documents released by the agency.

Her husband, who's not named in court documents, went to a court hearing regarding their child on Aug. 7, but Hogan wasn't there. Authorities said that while he was in court waiting for Hogan, he got a notification that she was uploading data to the Wi-Fi router at his home. When he returned home, she was not there.

That same day, Hogan's husband drank a "small amount" of wine that was in his fridge, but woke up in the "middle of the night" and became "increasingly ill." At 6 a.m., his mother came to help him, only to find he was "slurring his words, staggering and vomiting," and was taken to the hospital.

After ruling out a stroke, doctors believed he was poisoned by ethylene glycol, the ingredient used in antifreeze, according to court documents.

The husband told detectives that Hogan had access to his home and was "the last person other than himself to be in the residence prior to him drinking the already opened wine."

The wine tested positive for ethylene glycol when it was taken for testing by authorities.

When detectives seized Hogan's phone, they allegedly found searches for several chemical compounds, including monoethylene glycol, according to court documents, which detailed how she also searched how much of the substances "would kill you."

"Hogan was confused about the chemicals and then stated she recognized the word cyanide from the television show ‘Psych,'" authorities wrote in court documents.

While Hogan initially denied poisoning her husband with antifreeze, she eventually admitted to putting ethylene glycol in her husband's wine bottle but "never intended to kill him, but just wanted to make him sick as payback for him being mentally abusive," according to authorities.

Authorities said that Hogan put ethylene glycol in a bottle of tea on a separate occasion, adding she was trying to make her husband sick. Their child was also hospitalized in September and presented similar symptoms as the husband, according to authorities.

"Hogan stated it was only the wine and the iced tea, and nobody else knew she was tampering with [the victim's] drinks," according to the arrest affidavit.

When her husband was asked why Hogan would poison the wine, he "believed that a motive for him being poisoned is the fact that Hogan would become the full owner of the residence and would gain full-time custody of their child," according to the arrest affidavit.

Hogan is being held on a $1 million bond.

            Top Virginia Democrats have sharply criticized attorney general nominee Jay Jones but are stopping short of calling on him to leave the race after newly revealed text messages showed he suggested that a colleague be shot.
    


            Gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi called Jones' texts inexcusable, as did Virginia's two Democratic senators.
    


            US Sen. Tim Kaine was asked Monday by CNN's Manu Raju if he still supports Jones, who apologized after the texts were revealed. “I do,” Kaine responded.
    


            “The comments are completely indefensible. I've known Jay Jones for 25 years, and those comments are very much out of character for him. So if I put the comments, which are clearly beyond the pale, against knowing this guy for 25 years, I'm still supporting Jay Jones,” he said.
    


            The decision to scold but not abandon Jones speaks to the party's overall desire to beat a prominent state-level incumbent – and, as some Democrats said Monday, a belief that President Donald Trump has changed traditional standards of decorum. Jones is running against Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, whom Trump has backed for reelection.
    


            It also points to political reality. Early voting began in Virginia late last month, and it's too late to remove a name or add a replacement to the physical ballot, Brian Tynes, a spokesman for the state Department of Elections, told CNN in an email.
    


            Republicans seeing GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears trailing Spanberger are hoping to hold onto Miyares' office and energize other campaigns. Miyares announced Monday that his campaign is spending $1.5 million on a pair of ads highlighting Jones' texts and a previous reckless driving charge.
    


            “The Democratic Party has to make this decision,” Miyares said when CNN's Kasie Hunt asked him if Jones should drop out. “Think about this: If somebody was applying to be a line attorney in the attorney general's office or a criminal deputy or even serving in a governor's cabinet, and it turned out these messages came out, they would not be hired.”
    


            In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages first reported by the National Review and obtained by CNN.
    


            “Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” the text reads in part, referring to Gilbert and the two dictators.
    


            The National Review reported that Jones tried to call Coyner after she objected to his language. He went on to say in the text messages that Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists” in reference to Gilbert's children, the National Review reported.
    


            Republicans were heavily invested in Miyares before the current news cycle. The incumbent raised $11.2 million for his reelection bid between January 1 and August 31, including $4 million from the Republican Attorney General Association, according to campaign finance data from the Virginia Public Access Project.
    


            Jones raised just $8 million over the same period, including $2.1 million from the committee that backs Democratic attorney general candidates.
    


            A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted September 25-29, before Jones texts were revealed, showed the Democrat leading Miyares by just 6 percentage points, within the margin of error. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 12 points in the same poll.
    


            The Jones text controversy comes as Republicans are attempting to portray Democrats as extremists in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last month.
    


            Democrats have pushed back on that framing, noting the president's own past suggestions of responding to political opponents and protesters with violence.
    


            Virginia state Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, a longtime Jones ally, said she condemns political violence and that both sides need to tone down their rhetoric. But she argued Republican calls for Jones to drop out were hypocritical.
    


            “Donald Trump said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot anybody and still be elected. And guess what? He said it, and he still got elected,” Graves said. “But because I stand behind somebody I've known all his life, there's something wrong with that? He's the Democratic nominee. There was a process.”
    


            And the Virginia Beach Democratic Committee issued a statement saying it was “lined up, ten toes down—ready to organize, mobilize, and deliver voters for Jay and our entire Democratic ticket.”
    


            “Recent press may have spotlighted past mistakes. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized, and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows,” the statement added.
    


            Democrats view the contest as part of a larger effort to push back on controversial Trump policies, arguing that a Democratic attorney general would join colleagues in other states to block Trump policies they deem harmful.
    


            For some Democrats, the possibility of depriving the president of an ally in the state is enough to overcome their revulsion with Jones' comments – at least for now.
    


            Chris Graham, the editor of the Augusta Free Press, a progressive news outlet located in a conservative part of the state, endorsed Jones in the June primary in which the candidate narrowly defeated Henrico Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor.
    


            Now, he's conflicted. Miyares, Graham said, would be a “rubber stamp” for the president. But he is uncomfortable with Jones, arguing he not only sent the texts but decided to run for office knowing the messages could hurt Democrats' chances of flipping the seat.
    


            Last week Graham wrote a column calling on Jones to drop out “immediately, if not sooner.” Still, he plans to vote for Jones and hope he gets replaced after the election.
    


            “I would not have endorsed him, and I'm sure lots of other folks wouldn't have voted for him, if we had known that those texts were out there,” Graham said.

Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Johnson County Republicans in an August meeting that she'll hold town hall meetings “when hell freezes over.”
    


            The Republican, who represents one of the nation's most competitive House districts in southeastern Iowa, has faced questions for months over when she'll hold a public town hall after promising to do so in April.
    


            And in the meeting with the Johnson County Republicans of Iowa — which was later posted on YouTube by the county party, where it went largely unnoticed at the time — she was blunt, saying she's already being hounded over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's massive government funding and policy bill.
    


            “You know, I don't have to hold a town hall so you can come and yell at me,” said Miller-Meeks, who won by 799 votes in 2024 and faces a likely rematch next year with Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan.
    


            “You can yell at me at the county fair — and you did! And you did. They did,” she said. “You know, you yell at me in church, you yell at me at the county fair, I'm out in public all the damn time. Someone yelled at me at the speedway.”
    


            Miller-Meeks added: “You have plenty of opportunities to yell at me and tell me I should be ashamed of myself, and by the way, I am not.”
    


            Miller-Meeks' comments came amid scrutiny over her and many other House Republicans refusing to hold public, in-person town halls. Party leaders, including the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, have advised against town halls after strong opposition to the GOP's spending cuts burst into view at some town halls this spring.

            Miller-Meeks pointed to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg criticizing her and other swing district Republicans over their votes for President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
    


            “We took the hard votes on reconciliation. We've been beat to crap over what we did on Medicaid. You know because you all have seen it,” she said.
    


            Miller-Meeks told the Johnson County Republicans that she was being pressed on when she'd hold a town hall by Tom Barton, a politics reporter for The Gazette newspaper in Cedar Rapids. “When hell freezes over,” she said.
    


            Miller-Meeks did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on her August remarks to Johnson County Republicans. But she did defend herself last week, telling the Gazette's Barton, “Every time I walk around Iowa — every meeting that I go to, every rotary I attend, every county fair I go to — I am out in the public. I am out in the open, and I can answer anyone's questions they have,” Miller-Meeks said.
    


            She told Barton that Democrats pressing GOP incumbents to hold town halls just want “other people like-minded to scream and yell at people so they can videotape screaming and yelling at people.”
    


            “And even when we were doing our press conference at the State Fair, people screamed and yelled and videotaped their screaming and yelling,” she told the newspaper. “And then other people had, you know, reasonable questions that they wanted answers to, and we were able to do that. So more than happy to meet with individuals, as I do always when I'm in district.”

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.

The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S. 

Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store. 

In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to “enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.”

Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.

In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. “The changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users' ability to safely download apps,” Google warned.




Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.

In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals. 

Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.

Those commissions were the focal point of an antitrust lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games filed against Google in 2020, setting up a month-long trial in San Francisco federal court that culminated in the jury's monopoly verdict.

Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.

In a post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney applauded the Supreme Court for clearing the way for consumers to choose alternative app payment choices “without fees, scare screens, and friction.”

Although the Play Store changes will likely dent Google's profit, the company makes most of its money from a digital ad network that's anchored by its dominant search engine — the pillars of an internet empire that has been under attack on other legal fronts.

As part of cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department, both Google's search engine and parts of its advertising technology were declared illegal monopolies, too.

A federal judge in the search engine case earlier this year rejected a proposed break-up outlined by the Justice Department i n a decision that was widely seen as a reprieve for Google. The government is now seeking to break up Google in the advertising technology case during proceedings that are scheduled to wrap up with closing arguments on Nov. 17 in Alexandria, Virginia.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., discusses shutdown negotiations, the sentencing of Kavanaugh's would-be assassin and his new book, 'How to Test Negative for Stupid' on 'America's Newsroom.'

A weekend away from Washington did little to soften Senate Democrats' resolve as they again blocked Republicans' effort to reopen the government, ensuring the shutdown will last at least a week.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and most of his caucus are adamant that unless a deal is struck on expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, commonly known as ObamaCare subsidies, they will not provide the votes needed to fund the government.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., needs at least eight Democrats to cross the aisle and support the GOP's bill, which would reopen the government until Nov. 21.

However, only Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, have broken with their caucus to end the shutdown. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., remains the lone Republican to buck his party.

Senate Democrats have remained steadfast in their demand that a deal must be reached to extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They argue that unless Congress acts, Americans who rely on the tax credits will see their healthcare premiums skyrocket.

Both Senate leaders are encouraging talks among rank-and-file members to find a solution, but neither side can agree on when exactly the subsidies should be dealt with.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENTERS 3RD DAY AS SENATE STALEMATE OVER OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES DRAGS ON

When asked what the appetite for tackling the expiring subsidies was within the Senate GOP, Thune said it was "a mixed bag." 

"But like I said, you know, there may be a path forward," he said. "I think a lot of it would come down to what the White House lands on that, but certainly not without reforms. And we all know the program is broken, it needs to be fixed, so that would be certainly a starting place."

Schumer wants an additional bulwark added to a deal: President Donald Trump has to sign off on it, given that there may be resistance among House Republicans to extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies.

"Look, the bottom line on that is we need the president to be involved. [House Speaker Mike] Johnson and a whole lot of his caucus don't like the ACA, don't want to do the extensions," he said. "A lot of Republican senators in the Senate do, but they're not enough. Good is not enough."

"You need Johnson and you need Trump to get it done," he continued. "So that's the bottom line."

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that "we're talking to the Democrats." When asked if he would work to make a deal with them on ObamaCare subsidies to reopen the government, he said, "Yeah." 

"I'd like to see a deal made for great healthcare," Trump said. "I want to see great healthcare, I'm a Republican, but I want to see healthcare much more so than the Democrats." 

Schumer fired back in a statement that Trump's "claim isn't true — but if he's finally ready to work with Democrats, we'll be at the table."

And Fetterman, who has routinely voted against shutting the government down regardless of which party controlled the Senate, recognized that without Trump's greenlight, a deal would go nowhere.

He gave the example of a bipartisan border deal negotiated between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate in 2023 that was sidelined under orders from Trump.

"It got tanked. Trump tanked that, and he wasn't the president, and he didn't have to sign that thing," Fetterman said. "So what I'm saying, where's the leverage? Because ultimately, doesn't he have to sign off on any of it anyway?"

Chicago FOP President John Catanzara and former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discuss the CPD's conduct as anti-ICE protests occur in Chicago on ‘America Reports.' 

A far-left professor at the University of Chicago was arrested Friday and charged with violent felonies stemming from riots at an ICE facility in the suburbs of the city. 

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital.

Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday. 

A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school.

Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests. 

Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. In her last post at 8:52 a.m., she took a photo of a line of Illinois State Police officers, and accused the state of "enforcing Trump's agenda of terrorizing our community with abductions."

She has not posted since.

A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called "Movement Memos," which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility.

"These people are terrorizing our communities and they're setting up shop," she said, referring to federal immigration officials. "I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard."

She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals. 

"There's no center left," she said. "You're either resisting or you're complicit."

Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025.

"F--- the University of Chicago, it's evil, you know it's a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that," she said. 

However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power. 

"Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That's possible structural leverage," she said.

Socialism 2025 described itself as a "a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today." 

ANTI-ISRAEL PROFESSOR CURSES OUT EMPLOYER UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, SAYS SHE TEACHES TO BUILD POWER

The professor spoke on a panel called "Revolutionary Accompaniment: Holding Each Other When Things Fall Apart." 

According to the Truthout interview, she also organizes with Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at the University of Chicago, and has referred to the war in Gaza as a "genocide." 

"This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don't have power… what we don't have is power… the question I'm asking myself, and I'm asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?'" she said at Socialism 2025. 

Much of her X feed consists of resharing posts that are critical of Israel, but she shares some posts of her own.

"Do you see that fight for Palestine is the fight for the whole world? A world where no one is disposable, where no one is disappeared—not by ICE or the IDF, where the will of the people of the world matters more than the will of profit and empire. Do you see it?" she recently wrote.

Abdelhadi did not return a request for comment.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday asked a judge to immediately put on hold his order that would require elections officials to verify the citizenship of all 3.6 million registered Wisconsin voters before the next statewide election in February.

The state justice department, which represents the Wisconsin Elections Commission, is seeking the stay of Friday's ruling pending an appeal.

Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Maxwell scheduled a hearing on the request for Oct. 31, saying issuing an immediate stay would violate due process. He did temporarily block a section of his order that prohibits the commission from accepting any request to register as a voter without verification that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.

The fight over verifying the citizenship status of voters in battleground Wisconsin comes as President Donald Trump's Department of Justice has sought voter records from at least 26 states, including Wisconsin. Trump's Justice Department is taking steps to crack down on voter fraud and noncitizen voting, both of which are rare but have been the subject of years of false claims from Trump and his allies.

The Wisconsin lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the lead-up to the November presidential election by two suburban Milwaukee voters, including a longtime critic of how elections are run in the state.

They sought a court order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission and state Department of Transportation to verify the citizenship of all applicants registering to vote. They argued that the state elections commission is failing to investigate unlawful voter registrations and not taking steps to ensure that noncitizens are not voting.

The state justice department argued that there is no requirement or duty under Wisconsin law for the elections commission and transportation department to share and match data to remove non-citizens from the statewide voter list.




Wisconsin law requires voters to certify that they are U.S. citizens but does not require election officials to obtain proof or require voters to present any.

Maxwell ruled Friday that the elections commission is “violating state and federal statutes by maintaining an election system that potentially allows individuals on to the voter rolls who may not be lawfully entitled to cast a vote in Wisconsin.”

The Wisconsin Elections Commission “is failing in the most basic task of ensuring that only lawful voters make it to the voter roll from where lawful votes are cast,” the judge ruled.

He ordered the elections commission to review the voter rolls before the Feb. 18 spring primary election to determine if anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is registered to vote. He also prohibited accepting any new voter registration request “without verification that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.”

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat who is considering running for governor, argued Monday that the court's order would “require a massive overhaul of Wisconsin's voter registration system and the creation of new verification requirements not otherwise provided for by statute.”

Further, the judge's order does not explain what it would entail to verify that an applicant is a U.S. citizen. Requiring additional documents, like a U.S. passport, will take time to implement, Kaul argued.

“A major modification to Wisconsin's electronic voter registration process will require months of development and testing before the changes may be deployed,” he said in the request for a stay of the ruling.

Any disabling of the voter registration system while those changes are implemented would violate the rights of others who are trying to register, Kaul argued. The state receives an average of 200 online voter registrations each day, he said.

Kevin Scott, an attorney for the voters who brought the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday that he hoped the state elections commission “does the right thing” and works to implement the judge's ruling.

A spokeswoman for the state elections commission did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

The White House blasted a federal judge who temporarily blocked the Trump administration twice from dispatching National Guard troops to Oregon in October, asserting that President Donald Trump has "undisputed authority" to deploy troops to Portland amid ongoing immigration protests there. 

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a ruling late Sunday blocking the Trump administration from sending California National Guard troops to Oregon — or any other state as Trump advances his quest to deploy troops to major U.S. cities to tackle crime and to keep watch on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discredited Immergut's ruling Monday and said that the Trump administration was appealing the decision. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

"I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law," Leavitt told reporters at a White House press briefing. "The president is using his authority as commander in chief, U.S. code 12 406, which clearly states that the president has the right to call up the National Guard and in cases where he deems it's appropriate. … The ICE facility has been really under siege. And, by these anarchists outside, they have been, disrespecting law enforcement. They've been inciting violence."

Earlier Monday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said that Immergut, a Trump appointee, has no authority to bar the president from sending troops to Oregon, and blasted the decision as one of the most "egregious" orders he's ever seen. 

"A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property," Miller said in a Monday X post. "Today's judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat."

"Remember: all of this is about preventing the removal of illegal alien trespassers from the United States at any cost," Miller said. 

The Sunday temporary restraining order came just hours after Trump signed off on mobilizing California National Guard troops to Portland, despite Immergut's initial restraining order Saturday blocking the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to the city.

"How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention to the temporary restraining order I issued yesterday?" Immergut said during a telephone hearing Sunday. 

"Aren't defendants simply circumventing my order?" Immergut said later. "Why is this appropriate?"

The Trump administration has argued that the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, is necessary to defend ICE officers amid ongoing protests at an ICE facility there. 

Miller previously railed against Immergut's first restraining order barring the Trump administration from sending troops to Portland, Oregon, and said Saturday the deployment is "an absolute necessity to defend our personnel, our laws, our government, public order and the Republic itself." 

Miller's posts come amid recent scrutiny for denouncing judges. For example, Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York singled out Miller and the "extreme right" for "threatening judges" who rule against Trump after a fire broke out at a South Carolina Circuit Court judge's property Saturday. 

Trump's effort to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities comes just after he told military leaders in September that they could be tasked with neutralizing the "enemy within" and that Democratic-led cities where he's sending troops could serve as "training grounds."

"We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military," Trump said Tuesday to top military leaders in Quantico, Virginia. 

The effort is controversial, given that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 puts restrictions on deploying U.S. troops to enforce domestic law. 

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and typically are overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from states to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.

Newsom responded to Immegut's order late Sunday, and said: "We just won in court — again." 

"Trump's abuse of power won't stand," Newsom said in a post on X.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI in 2023 analyzed phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators.

The records enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of the calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the certification of the election results.

The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Trump and allies took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump was indicted in August 2023 with conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.

The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the document memorializing the “preliminary toll analysis” was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said.

Grassley called it a “violation of personal property and people's rights and the law and their constitutional rights.”




That document was dated Sept. 27, 2023, and lists the following Republican lawmakers as people whose records were apparently scrutinized: Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. 

The document suggests the analysis was conducted by an FBI special agent whose name was redacted and it was authorized by two supervisory agents. It does not say how or why those lawmakers were identified or whether any meaningful tips or leads emerged from that investigative work.

Most of the lawmakers were part of a group of Republicans who planned to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, some voted to certify the results, while others still voted against certification.

The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino — both Trump loyalists — to review the matter. Grassley suggested that more people at the FBI would be fired over the investigation, saying, “If heads don't roll in this town, nothing changes.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on social media that he had “grave concerns” about the incident.

“I fully support Senate committees getting to the bottom of this outrageous abuse of power and weaponization of the government,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump's aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

Speaking with reporters, President Trump was asked if he would invoke the Insurrection Act.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”




Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump's attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. 

Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor's objections. Otherwise, it's up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He's called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America's long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I'd do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer. 

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,'” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it's typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy's move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it's more symbolic than helpful.”

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge's decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it's the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump's immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump's orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump's opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power. 

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That's our backstop. That's what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump's attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge's weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting is playing out in state capitals, in courtrooms and on the ballot. 

The efforts to redraw U.S. House districts for partisan advantage got jump-started when President Donald Trump called upon Republican-led Texas to reshape districts so that the GOP could win more seats in next year's elections. 

Since then, lawmakers in Democratic-led California and Republican-led Missouri have approved revised districts, and officials in more states are considering it. Utah's Republican-led Legislature endorsed an altered congressional map Monday — though in response to a court order, not Trump's demands. 




U.S. House districts typically are redrawn once a decade, immediately after a census. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.

The stakes are high, because Democrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House, which would allow them to impede Trump's agenda. The president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, a fate Trump is trying to avoid. 

Federal judges in Texas are considering a legal challenge to new congressional districts passed at Trump's urging during a special legislative session in August. Civil rights groups and dozens of Black and Hispanic voters contend the new map intentionally reduces minority voters' influence in violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. They want to prevent the new districts from being used. 

Republicans hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats in Texas. The revised map could give Republicans a shot at picking up five additional seats in next year's elections. 




Voting began Monday in California in advance of a Nov. 4 election that will determine whether new congressional districts are implemented. 

Democrats already hold 43 of California's 52 seats. But after Texas undertook redistricting, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged California lawmakers to reciprocate. They did so by passing a revised U.S. House map that could give Democrats a chance to gain five additional seats.

Unlike Texas, California has an independent citizens' commission that handles redistricting after the census. So any changes to the map need voter approval. 

After Texas and California took action, Missouri lawmakers joined the redistricting battle by passing a revised U.S. House map designed to give Republicans a shot at winning seven of the state's eight districts — one more than they currently hold. The map targets a seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by stretching the Kansas City-based district into rural Republican areas and reducing the number of minority voters.

Opponents are pursuing a referendum petition that, if successful, would force a statewide vote on the new map. Opponents also have filed several lawsuits asserting that mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the state constitution. 

Utah's Republican-led Legislature passed a revised U.S. House map Monday that could give Democrats an improved chance at competing for a seat. Republicans currently hold all four of the state's seats. 

The revised map would place Democratic-leaning Salt Lake City in a single district that stretches into rural areas, instead of splitting the city among multiple districts. But the revision still must be reviewed by a judge, who is expected to approve a new map by November. 

A Utah judge in August struck down the House districts adopted after the 2020 census because the Republican-led Legislature circumvented an independent redistricting commission established by voters. 

Republican lawmakers who hold a supermajority in the Kansas Legislature have been gathering petition signatures from colleagues in an attempt to call a special session on congressional redistricting in November. They are taking that route because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is unlikely to call a special session.

Republicans already hold three of the state's four congressional districts. A revised map would target the suburban Kansas City district held by Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said that a legislative session on redistricting probably will happen, potentially as soon as November. Republican legislative leaders have met privately with Trump. But Braun has been waiting to call a special session until he is confident it will succeed. 

Republicans hold a 7-2 edge over Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation. The GOP likely would target a northwest Indiana seat held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. They also could attempt to slice up an Indianapolis district held by a Democrat, but that could stir opposition by diluting minority voters' influence.

Ohio will have new U.S. House districts for the 2026 elections, though their shape remains to be determined. Republicans currently hold 10 of the state's 15 congressional seats. 

Ohio's constitution requires new U.S. House districts because the ones adopted by Republican officials after the 2020 census didn't have sufficient bipartisan support. If bipartisan consensus remains elusive, Republican lawmakers in November could adopt revised districts without need of any Democratic votes.

Some Democratic state lawmakers have said they will file redistricting legislation for the 2026 session, and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore also has expressed support.

“If we are going to have states in mid-cycle, in mid-decade, determining whether or not they have fair maps or not, then so will Maryland. Then, we should have that conversation, too,” Moore said last week.

Democrats control seven of the state's eight U.S. House seats and could target an eastern Maryland district held by Republican Rep. Andy Harris.

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 15 in a legal challenge to Louisiana's U.S. House districts, currently held by four white Republicans and two Black Democrats. A lawsuit contends state lawmakers wrongly used racial demographics when redrawing districts in response to a previous court ruling to give Black voters a better chance at electing the representative of their choice in two districts instead of one. 

State lawmakers have been told to keep their calendars open between Oct. 23 and Nov. 13 in case the Supreme Court rules quickly and lawmakers could return for a special session on redistricting. 

Officials Florida, Illinois and New York all have raised the possibility of redrawing U.S. House districts. 

Republican Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez has created a special committee to look into redistricting. Republicans currently hold 20 of the state's 28 seats.

Democrats already hold 14 of the 17 U.S. House seats in Illinois. But Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said it's possible to redraw even more districts favoring Democrats. 

New York has an independent commission that redraws districts after every census. State Democrats have introduced legislation to allow mid-decade redistricting, but the soonest new maps could be in place would be for the 2028 elections. That is because the proposal would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the Legislature twice and be approved by voters.

            Around 2 p.m. Saturday, top White House adviser Stephen Miller took to X to warn of a “growing movement of leftwing terrorism” that is “shielded by far-left Democrat judges.”
    


            Mere hours later, President Donald Trump's attempts to use the military on US soil to combat this supposed threat suffered their biggest blow to date.
    


            But it didn't come from a “Democrat judge”; it came from someone Trump himself had nominated in 2018, US District Judge Karin Immergut.
    


            By the end of the weekend, Immergut had ruled against Trump twice. She did so both for the administration's initial attempted National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon, and then again after suggesting it had defied her initial order by attempting to send in California troops. She even floated the idea that Trump was effectively trying to illegally implement “martial law.”
    


            It was a dizzying series of events. But it was an instructive one.
    


            Despite the administration's claims of what Miller has labeled a left-wing “legal insurrection,” the list of judges ruling against the president includes a fast-growing number of Republican- and even Trump-appointed ones.
    


            To date, GOP-appointed judges have ruled against the administration in more than a dozen high-profile cases. And their ranks include at least eight Trump-appointed judges.
    


            They've also often used strong language that suggested Trump and his administration were blatantly violating the law.
    


            The rhetoric around these cases is getting increasingly ugly, with some Trump allies taking Miller's cue and calling for impeaching judges or disregarding their rulings. Elon Musk has even called efforts to thwart Trump's actions “treason.”
    


            But the legal paper trail suggests something else entirely: that Trump is simply trying to do lots of illegal things — so much so that it forces even GOP- and Trump-appointed judges to call that out.
    


            Let's recap the big ones so far.
    


The case: Trump has sought to use the troops to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has faced protests, which the administration has cast as violent.
    


Judge: US District Judge Karin Immergut
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.” Read the filing here.
    


            The administration's action “does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order,” she said.

Judge: US District Court Judge Thomas Cullen
    


Nominated by: Trump (2020)

The cases: A series of cases has dealt with the administration's attempts to rapidly deport migrants without due process, often by using a centuries-old law called the Alien Enemies Act , which had previously been reserved for wartime. In some instances, this has led to migrants being deported to places they weren't supposed to be sent, like the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III (leading a three-judge panel)
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1984)
    


In the judge's words: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Timothy J. Kelly
    


Nominated by: Trump (2017)
    


In the judge's words: The administration's claims that parents in Guatemala had asked to be reunited with their children “crumbled like a house of cards about a week later. There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr.
    


Nominated by: Trump (2018)
    


In the judge's words: “The Court concludes that the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “Defendants have provided no evidence, or even any specific allegations, as to how Cristian, or any other Class Member, poses a threat to public safety.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge Leslie H. Southwick (leading a 2-1 panel)
    


Nominated by: George W. Bush (2007)
    


In the judge's words: “A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt or to otherwise harm the United States.” Read the filing here.
    


Judges: Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh (as part of a majority whose size was unclear)
    


Nominated by: Trump (2018)
    


In the court's words: “Notice [for immigrants] roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.” Read the ruling here.
    


The cases: Trump has sought to expand a president's authority to unilaterally levy taxes on imports and use them to negotiate concessions from other countries.
    


Judges: US Court of International Trade Judges Timothy Reif and Jane Restani (as part of a three-judge panel)
    


Nominated by: Reif by Trump (2019), Restani by Reagan (1983)
    


In the judges' words: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act “does not authorize any of the worldwide, retaliatory, or trafficking tariff orders. The worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge Alan David Lourie (as part of a 7-4 decision)
    


Nominated by: George H.W. Bush (1990)

The case: The White House barred the Associated Press from access to the Oval Office, Mar-a-Lago and Air Force One after the outlet declined to use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico, the “Gulf of America.”
    


Judge: US District Judge Trevor N. McFadden
    


Nominated by: Trump (2017)
    


In the judge's words: “Indeed, the Government has been brazen about this.”
    


            “If there is a benign explanation for the Government's decision, it has not been presented here. At the evidentiary hearing, the Government conceded that the record reveals viewpoint-discriminatory motives, so all indicators point to retaliation.”
    


The case: Several academic institutions sued, arguing that the administration has carried out an ideological deportation policy aimed at pro-Palestinian viewpoints that chills the speech of others who would support that cause.
    


Judge: US District Judge William G. Young
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1985)
    


In the judge's words: “The facts prove that the President himself approves truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech.”
    


            “The President's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech.” Read the filing here.
    


The case: The administration sought to ban race-based considerations in schools and universities as part of its anti-diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
    


Judge: Gallagher
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “The law does not countenance the government's hasty and summary treatment of these significant issues.” Read the filing here.

Judge: US District Judge John C. Coughenour
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1981)
    


In the judge's words: “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.”
    


            “It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals. The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain.” Read the judge's comments here.
    


The case: The administration has attempted to claw back $11 billion in congressionally appropriate funding that was earmarked to states for the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


Judge: US District Judge Mary S. McElroy

A man accused of murdering six people in California was deported several times previously, according to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Norberto Celerino, 53, faces six counts of murder in relation to a Sept. 7 crash while allegedly driving under the influence in Napa County, California, according to the district attorney, who said this would be Celerino's fourth DUI charge.

The district attorney's office said that Celerino – who also goes by the names Norberto (Beto) Celerino Villalva, Grabien Martinez, and Roberto Savaringo-Diabla – was allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol when he crashed the car into a tree, killing six passengers and severely injuring another.

An ICE spokesperson told KRON4 that Celerino has been deported several times.

"Beto Cerillo-Bialva … is a criminal alien from Mexico who first entered the United States in 1995. Since his first illegal entry, he has been arrested several times for possession of cocaine, multiple DUIs, and removed multiple times from the United States," the spokesperson said.

His "continued disregard for the laws within the United States, and California's sanctuary laws, has led to this tragic incident. Sanctuary laws continue to place the American public in danger and only protect the criminal aliens," the ICE spokesperson said.

Former Democratic FBI Director James Comey denied any knowledge of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to letters reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

Based on his responses, the House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) withdrew his subpoena to appear in person for a deposition to Congress regarding the ongoing investigation of Epstein and associate Ghislaine Maxwell and the release of the criminal files. 

The decision comes after Comey was indicted last month on two of three counts sought by prosecutors, one of making false statements and one of obstruction of justice. The indictment stemmed from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his role in the bureau's handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Comey was initially subpoenaed in August to testify behind closed doors on Tuesday as part of an effort to bring in a broad group of former Department of Justice and FBI leaders to speaking on the handling of the criminal case. However, Comer withdrew the demand after Comey and former Justice Department leaders provided written statements.

“Given that I do not possess knowledge and information relevant to the Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and related matters, I offer this letter in lieu of a deposition that would unproductively consume the committee's scarce time and resources,” Comey wrote in a letter. 

Trump allies have long accused Comey, an Obama-era official, of misleading Congress and authorizing politically motivated leaks about the FBI's probe into Trump campaign associates in 2016. Just earlier this month, Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to move “without delay” in pursuing charges against several former Obama-era officials. Comey's indictment claims he obstructed a congressional investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information in violation of 18 USC 1505. It also alleges that Comey made a false statement in violation of 18 USC 1001. 

The former FBI director is set to appear before a court later this week for his arraignment. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, is set to preside over the case. Comey responded on Bluesky, saying he is innocent.

Comey is not the first subpoena in the Epstein investigation to be withdrawn. Former Attorneys General Merrick Garland and Eric Holder told the House Oversight Committee they have no knowledge of files related to Epstein. The committee also backed off compelling in-person interviews with Attorneys General Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales last month. The committee also withdrew a subpoena for former FBI Director Robert Mueller, citing his declining health.

President Donald Trump, House GOP leadership, and the DOJ have sought to move past the Epstein files following the public fallout from the department's announcement in July that it had no plans to make any further documents available and affirmed that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges related to the sex trafficking of minors.

The Trump administration insisted there was no “client list” that would have implicated famous and powerful people involved in Epstein's alleged sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. Responding to public demands for more information, the House Oversight Committee issued various subpoenas to seek the DOJ files and interviews with witnesses.

The committee originally issued 10 subpoenas for depositions earlier this year, including former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, from August through October. The other eight subpoenaed individuals were Comey and Mueller, and former Attorneys General Bill Barr, Loretta Lynch, Sessions, Gonzales, Holder, and Garland, although not all were required to appear in person. Barr's transcript from his testimony was released earlier this month.

Alexander Acosta, former Department of Labor secretary and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, testified before the committee last month after a separate subpoena. Acosta granted Epstein what many believe was a “sweetheart deal.”

The committee has released multiple batches of documents related to the DOJ files, many of which came from the committee's subpoena to Epstein's estate.

GRAND JURY INDICTS FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY 

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced a discharge petition to try to force a vote for a full release of the Epstein files. However, it was one signature short of forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to put Massie's Epstein transparency bill on the House floor for a vote.

After Democrats won a recent special election in Arizona, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva is expected to sign the Epstein discharge petition and reach 218 necessary signatures to compel floor action. Johnson has delayed the swearing-in of Grijalva as the House continued to be in recess amid the government shutdown, a move some Democrats have said is due to her support of the petition to release files related to Epstein.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Republicans are seizing on recently unearthed violent rhetoric from Virginia's Democratic candidate for attorney general in a push to re-shape the state's governor's race — and tarnish the Democratic Party nationally — less than a month before Election Day.

President Donald Trump, like Republicans across Virginia, called for Democratic state attorney general candidate Jay Jones to quit the race over the weekend. The Republican president described Jones as a “radical left lunatic” and sought to link him to former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia's Democratic candidate for governor. 

“Abigail Spanberger, who is running for Governor, is weak and ineffective, and refuses to acknowledge what this Lunatic has done,” Trump wrote on social media. 

The clash over Jones' violent rhetoric, shared in a 2022 private text message exchange published on Friday, comes just four weeks before voters in Virginia and New Jersey choose new state leaders. History suggests that the party that holds the White House — Trump's Republican Party in this case — struggles in off-year elections, but Republicans hope the scandal might tilt next month's elections in their direction.

It was too early on Monday to say what impact the evolving situation may have on the high-stakes governor's races, if any, but Democrats privately acknowledged that the scandal is at least an unwelcome distraction, in Virginia and beyond — especially as Trump escalates his campaign to cast his political opponents as violent extremists.

Experts say damage from the scandal could spread beyond Jones' race and boost what has been a lackluster campaign for Republicans.




“The plain fact is that the damage for Democrats will not be contained only to the campaign for attorney general,” said Mark J. Rozell, dean of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. 

“Between now and Election Day, the Republicans are not going to let up on this issue, nor should they. It is their opportunity now to drive much of the narrative of the campaign and take the Democratic candidates off their message,” he said. “The GOP campaign overall had looked divided, uninspiring, and faltering, but now the party's candidates have a cause to rally around.”

Spanberger's campaign did not respond Monday when asked whether Jones should leave the race. In a statement released on Friday, the Democrat said she “spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted. I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words.”

She promised to ”always condemn violent language in our politics.”

That wasn't good enough for Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who released a new ad on Monday highlighting Spanberger's recent support for Jones. 

“Jay Jones dreamed of murdering two young kids and their dad over politics—and Abigail Spanberger wants him to be attorney general,” Earle-Sears wrote in a social media post sharing the ad. 

Spanberger and Earle-Sears are scheduled to face off in a debate on Thursday.

Jones has apologized repeatedly in recent days for the violent rhetoric he used in text messages he sent to a Republican lawmaker in 2022 about former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert. The text exchange was published on Friday by the National Review. 

In the texts, Jones wrote: “Three people two bullets ... Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot ... Gilbert gets two bullets to the head.” Pol Pot was the leader of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.

Jones did not hold elected office when he sent the messages. He had formerly served as a state legislator and stepped down in 2021, before launching his bid for state attorney general. 

Trump seized on the issue over the weekend even as he continued to distance himself from Republican Earle-Sears in the governor's race. His allies have long feared that she may struggle to defeat Spanberger next month despite her strong support for Trump. 

Trump ignored Earle-Sears during a Sunday rally-like speech to Navy soldiers in Virginia, even as he ticked off a list of prominent Republicans in the state. In a social media post, he went after Spanberger without naming Earle-Sears.

The comment fit a pattern of escalation from Trump, who repeatedly has cast Democratic activists as violent extremists.

In a speech to the military generals last week, Trump proposed using U.S. cities as training grounds for the armed forces and spoke of needing military might to combat what he called the “invasion from within.” He continued his rhetoric in Sunday's speech to the Navy. 

“We have to take care of this little gnat that's on our shoulder called the Democrats,” he said.

The president has faced little, if any, Republican pushback for his rhetoric. But he and his allies lashed out at Jones and his Democratic allies on Monday. 

“What does it say about Virginia when presumably millions of Democrats will go out and vote for the murder of their Republican neighbors' children?” conservative media figure Benny Johnson asked Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, in a Monday interview.

Miyares said Virginians are “good and decent people,” before charging that Democrats, including Spanberger” have not been held accountable for Jones' rhetoric. 

“She's still willing to campaign with him, he said of Spanberger, noting that she has not asked him to quit the race and is “perfectly happy for him to be the top prosecutor in the state.” 

“That is an amazing lack of judgment,” Miyares said.

            Just a couple of years ago, America's auto industry had visions of an all-electric future. It has since abandoned that talk after the Trump administration eliminated the federal government's incentives for the technology.
    


            The near future isn't looking too pretty. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs is expected to send sales plunging in the coming quarters and perhaps years. 



            But the global auto industry hasn't given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it's not all-electric, as they had expected. The auto industry remains uncertain about the regulatory future of gas-powered cars in large parts of the United States as well as other markets around the globe. And they don't want to fall too far behind China's massive EV surge.
    


            “They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. But they're more carefully going down the path than they were a few years ago.”
    


            The end of a $7,500 federal tax credit a week ago caused an EV sales surge during the third quarter as interested buyers rushed to grab a car before the discount expired. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla's sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers.
    


Goodbye to the $7,500 EV tax credit. What's that mean for EV prices?



            But after the sharp rise, EV sales for the rest of the year will likely come back to Earth with a heavy thud. And it's unlikely they'll get back up for a long time afterwards.
    


            While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that his company also expects that “EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously.”  



            But despite the gloomy outlook, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, a move it called its “next Model T moment,” a reference to the Ford car that helped introduce internal combustion vehicles to the mass market more than a century ago.
    


            “I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event.
    


            Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia.
    


            But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny's plan.
    


            Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn't hit the target.
    


            Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July.
    


            California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales.
    


            But Congress recently moved to end California and the other states' abilities to impose their own, stricter, emissions rules. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases.
    


            Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. That has been the case for years, even before CEO Elon Musk and the company's fans on Wall Street started talking about its ambitious-but-yet-to-be-realized plans about robotaxis and robots driving up the value of the company in the future.
    


            Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid-vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).
    


            “There's still an aggressive push for EVs. But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. “They're going back to their roots.”
    


            And America's car companies are saying they didn't see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline.
    


            The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn't have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM's investors presentation last month.
    


            He said that, despite those regulations and support for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit, “customers weren't adopting at the rate that the government wanted.”
    


            But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand.
    


            “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That's going to take a little bit of time. We'll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.”
    


            Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars.
    


            And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology.
    


            As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said  it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month.
    


            And Ford still thinks the world is changing, even if it's changing more slowly than people originally thought.
    


            “We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford's chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in Chiles v. Salazar, a case challenging Colorado's ban on certain forms of counseling for youth experiencing gender dysphoria. The stakes couldn't be higher for vulnerable young people and their families.

We make unlikely co-authors. Tyler Deaton leads American Unity Fund, which advocates for LGBT rights within conservative circles. Ryan T. Anderson leads the Ethics and Public Policy Center, applying Judeo-Christian moral tradition to law and culture. We've frequently disagreed — sometimes profoundly — on questions of marriage, sexuality, and religious liberty.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE IF GOP CANDIDATE CAN SUE OVER ILLINOIS MAIL BALLOT LAW

Yet we've joined forces to file an amicus brief in this case because we share a fundamental conviction: Children struggling with gender dysphoria deserve compassion, individualized attention, and comprehensive mental healthcare, not a system that pushes only one predetermined outcome.

Colorado's 2019 law — versions of which have been passed by over 20 other states — prohibits mental health professionals from providing any counseling that doesn't “affirm” a minor's stated “gender identity.” In practice, this means therapists can only validate a child's desire to pursue sex change interventions, whether social, medical, or surgical; they cannot explore underlying issues, address co-occurring mental health conditions, or help children find ways to understand themselves that don't include medically or surgically modifying their developing bodies.

The law's defenders have labeled therapy that doesn't “affirm” as “conversion therapy,” deliberately invoking a different and emotionally fraught topic. However, helping children work through distress about puberty — a universally difficult time — bears no resemblance to the coercive practices many gay and lesbian adults condemn.

This law isn't protecting children from harmful therapies. It's guiding them onto a medical conveyor belt that itself exposes them to serious risks of fundamentally experimental interventions that carry serious risks: impaired cognitive function, infertility, reduced bone density, and other lifelong health consequences.

It also tramples on the First Amendment rights of the therapists. Censorship has lately been a potent tool of far-left and far-right activism as censors embrace the illiberal impulse to silence or “cancel” any viewpoint they find objectionable. As an illuminating example, one of the authors of this piece published a book several years ago questioning the efficacy of medicalized treatments. It was met with outrage, but instead of this being followed by sober conversations about the evidence presented, Amazon pulled the book from its website, backing down instead of defending the author's right to free speech and the value that serious, evidence-based, public discourse could bring to this debate.

But the Colorado law has backfired in tangible ways that are hurting the very population it's claiming to protect; many of the therapists being silenced are themselves part of the LGBT community whose professional goal is to help the next generation of LGBT youth grow into healthy and successful adults. Instead, their businesses are being put under a microscope and damaged, ultimately resulting in fewer children having access to help and guidance when they most need it.

International evidence is mounting that there is no reliable benefit from medical sex-change interventions for minors. Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have all reversed course on so-called “gender-affirming care” after systematic reviews found the evidence weak or nonexistent, and instead recommend psychotherapy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently concluded that “the best available evidence indicates that puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery have not been shown to improve mental health outcomes” for youth with gender dysphoria. 

This isn't a new phenomenon. Detransitioners — young adults who medically “transitioned” as minors and later regretted it — consistently report that their gender dysphoria stemmed from other issues that went ignored or unexplored and that they were fast-tracked toward permanent bodily modifications when what they needed was mental health support.

SUPREME COURT TAKES UP CHALLENGE TO HAWAII HANDGUN RESTRICTIONS

The First Amendment protects many things, but at its core, it safeguards the marketplace of ideas and public debate — including professional discussions about the best ways to help struggling youth. Colorado's law doesn't just violate counselors' free speech rights; it abandons vulnerable children to an experimental medical pathway that increasingly looks like malpractice.

Whatever one's views on LGBT issues, surely we can agree that children deserve protection, not politics. As the Supreme Court considers this case, we hope the justices will recognize what's really at stake: the freedom of mental health professionals to provide ethical, evidence-based care and the right of children to receive it.

Ryan T. Anderson is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Tyler Deaton is a senior advisor at American Unity Fund. They filed an amicus brief in Chiles v. Salazar supporting the petitioner.

Venezuela warned the U.S. government that the American Embassy in Caracas could be targeted in a “false-flag” operation, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez said on Sunday.

Rodríguez said the United States and an unspecified European embassy had been warned in three separate channels that “extremist sectors of the local Venezuelan right” are looking to plant explosives at their locations.

A “false flag” operation is when a perpetrator tries to make an incident look like another party was responsible.

Rodríguez did not specify which extremist group would try to carry out the attack, who would be framed, or the motivation for such a plan.

The U.S. Embassy in Caracas employs 150 locals and spends more than $6 million annually for upkeep of the embassy and other diplomatic properties in the Venezuelan capital, according to a September 2025 report from the State Department's Office of Inspector General.

The State Department suspended operations at its embassy in Caracas and evacuated all diplomats in March 2019, during President Donald Trump's first administration.

Trump's second administration has taken a very aggressive posture toward Venezuela and its president, Nicholás Maduro, whom the U.S. does not recognize as the legitimate leader of the country. The administration has accused Maduro of being the head of the Cartel of the Suns and being directly involved in the cartel's drug smuggling operations.

The U.S. military has significantly increased its presence in the western hemisphere around Central America as the Department of War has taken a much larger role in stopping drug trafficking under Trump.

U.S. forces have carried out at least four strikes on vessels in international waters that U.S. officials have said were cartel members smuggling drugs that would end up in the U.S. Traditionally, the U.S. Coast Guard would interdict these vessels, search them, and, if needed, arrest those on board and give them due process.

These strikes have raised legal questions about the military's use of lethal force, while Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said they would continue as needed.

After the most recently announced strike on a Venezuelan boat, Hegseth said U.S. intelligence confirmed “without a doubt” that the vessel “was trafficking narcotics, the people on board were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.” He did not share what intelligence confirmed those conclusions.

US STRIKES VESSEL OFF VENEZUELAN COAST KILLING FOUR, HEGETH SAYS

Trump informed Congress last week that the U.S. is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, declaring some cartels to be terrorist organizations and their members “unlawful combatants.”

Trump has also publicly said the U.S. military could carry out operations on Venezuelan soil, which would be an escalation in its operations.

Sprawling regulations backed by the Left are discouraging development across the country, critics say, as Democratic agendas play out in the public arena.

In California, the bully pulpit of environmentalism, “green” regulations under the state's sweeping Environmental Quality Act have been critiqued for stalling construction and contributing to the state's housing crisis.

In states such as Maryland, the role diversity, equity, and inclusion-like policies embedded in federal contract requirements are playing in discouraging development has come into focus as efforts begin to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.

Nationwide, and in the country's most populous blue cities, builders have expressed concern over a slew of labor, environmental, and safety mandates instituted under Democrats, which they argue have suppressed companies' ability to operate competitively. These include a 2022 order creating project labor union requirements, requirements on “prevailing wages,” and a 2024 rule listing two chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

“You do have that confluence of kind of interest groups, so that we need union labor, the architects have to have a certain minority component. And environmental concerns — are there spaces that we can't build, or do you need to do a huge study to make sure that there's some sort of plan because there's a five-eyed caterpillar that lives within the range?” said Wayne Winegarden, senior fellow of business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute.

“All of those types of regulations absolutely decrease the efficiency of what's happening, cause delays, drive up costs,” he added.

The 2024 rule expanding requirements around PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” was spearheaded by the Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency before trickling down to affect billions of dollars in development and thousands of workers.

The CERCLA regulations, backed by liberals, have put a stranglehold not just on small businesses but also on the “big, sophisticated contractors” looking to get involved in major infrastructure projects, as they have broadened the costly liabilities they could face, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.

“That liability is what's going to prevent contractors from bidding on major infrastructure projects where there might be PFAs contamination,” said AGC regulatory counsel Spencer Phillips, whose organization represents over 33,000 firms in the construction industry. “Members have told us that they're declining a bid on those types of projects, particularly airport projects, because PFAs contamination is pretty ubiquitous.”

“Even if a contractor doesn't know that there's PFAs on their site, it was totally by happenstance,” Phillips added, “all of a sudden, the contractor is on the hook for the entire dollar figure for the cleanup and remediation.”

The Biden administration's prevailing wage rule has also raised concerns that snaking requirements backed by Big Labor are throttling the industry. Projected to affect $217 billion in federally assisted construction spending annually for more than a million workers, the rule requires companies to pay wages equivalent to those paid to at least 30% of workers in a particular locality instead of the previously required 50%.

The rule added “really complicated compliance requirements to construction work that was historically not covered by the Davis-Bacon Act,” Phillips argued. He said he believes smaller and traditionally nonfederal contractors lack the resources to navigate payroll and recordkeeping requirements associated with the regulation.

Phillips suggested the prevailing wage rule acts as a deterrent for smaller firms to pursue certain contracts, which could reduce the quality of projects because it shrinks the applicant pool and the competitiveness of the bid process. The bigger the pool of applicants or eligible contractors is, “the better bids you'll get, the better work you'll get,” he said.

Prevailing wage regulations have sparked extensive debate in New York City, the country's largest metropolis, and contributed to criticism that they have contributed to the Big Apple's housing affordability crisis. 

Residents faced a housing crisis of record proportions as construction ground to a halt over the summer, largely due to the end of crucial tax incentives for developers, the renewal of which was blocked by liberals partly because of concerns that they needed an update to expand prevailing wage regulations.

Democratic City Comptroller Brad Lander and Big Labor groups opposed the renewal of the state's 421-a property tax exemption for the construction of affordable housing in 2022. They advocated a replacement measure that mandated prevailing wage laws apply to projects built under the tax exemption, which was previously exempt from such requirements. 

The new 485-x tax provision has not yet proven effective in motivating New York City developers, leading to stalled projects and fewer affordable options as the city faces a vacancy rate of 1.4%, the lowest since 1968.

By November 2024, former President Joe Biden's marquee 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act awarded $568 billion in federal funding to over 66,000 projects across the country, with a catch: Most projects awarded IIJA funding must comply with various federal regulations, including the prevailing wage rule and requirements set by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. The Transportation Department program requires recipients of DOT funds to award 10% of federally assisted contracts to DBEs, defined as firms at least 51% owned by women or minorities.

States such as Maryland have added regulations on top of the federal diversity requirements for many infrastructure projects, with critics arguing they have contributed to delays on multiple high-level developments. DBE requirements, currently being battled in court, have affected contracts involving projects ranging from the Golden State's high-speed rail project and the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore to the Brent Spence Bridge Project, all of which have faced delays and escalating costs.

The $3.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge recently faced a lawsuit alleging that the project's lead contractor reneged on an agreement to use a more diverse set of subcontractors, as 9%, or about $320 million, of the construction project's funds, was set to go to DBEs.

“We appreciate the need to attract new people into this industry,” said Brian Turmail, who leads strategic initiatives at AGC. “But for 50 years, at some level or another, public owners, at the state and local level, sometimes at the federal level, have been putting in place, sort of set aside for minority firms, and they haven't measurably increased the percentage of minority ownership of construction firms in this country. So we found that they don't actually work. They don't meet their policy objective while needlessly raising the cost of projects.”

Turmail pointed to the Brent Spence Bridge's paralyzed development as a prime example of regulations, including permitting requirements, impeding progress. The plan was first proposed in 2004. A decade later, taxpayers had spent more than $100 million on plans for a new bridge, years before the project was given the federal green light to proceed with construction in 2022. A design was unveiled earlier this year, with construction projected to begin in 2026 after environmental advocates sued the project last year, alleging that health and environmental effects were overlooked. 

“We've created a permitting process that essentially it's like a bad case that shoots in ladders,” Turmail said. “Anytime you fail one step of the process, you almost have to go back to the start. And not only can you fail the federal level, but the process is designed to make it really easy for special interest parties to get involved, litigate, and send the project back to square one.”

The permitting process in some of the country's largest blue cities has been similarly accused of preventing construction on housing and other priorities.

The process of getting building permits in Los Angeles can take one to two years, while the number issued is down 18.5% since 2022, according to the Pacific Research Institute. On the other hand, the permitting process in Republican-run cities, such as Dallas, often takes less than three months.

One recent example in Los Angeles showcased the obstacles contractors often face: Developer Cityview became one of only six large apartment developments under construction in the nation's second-most populous city after going through a three-year process to get approval, according to CoStar. The project survived an environmental appeal, required a legal settlement, and ultimately advanced only after qualifying for streamlined review under state law.

Overall, the cost of building new multifamily housing is 2.3 times higher in California than in Texas, according to a RAND analysis. Stringent energy efficiency standards add about 7% to construction costs, according to Cal Matters, while government-subsidized apartment projects that are often mandated to pay union-level wages carry labor expenses accounting for up to 35% of the total difference in costs between California and Texas.

COX ANNOUNCES $200 MILLION EFFORT TO STAVE OFF SALINE FAILURE IN GREAT SALT LAKE

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) eased some CEQA standards to help Los Angeles rebuild after the fires in January. However, he has faced criticism over his rationale for allowing such regulations to restrict development elsewhere.

“Certainly, any type of moves like that is helpful,” Winegarden said. “But is it enough? Is the question, and right now, no, it's not.”

Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET

In this article

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday explained why he's bullish on Take-Two Interactive, saying it's set to dominate the video game space now that its top competitor is going private.

"This was an industry with three major players, but now, with Activision gone and EA going private, Take-Two's now the only major publicly-traded American video game company that's a pure play," Cramer said. "I think this is huge. Not only were some very sophisticated investors willing to pay a premium for EA, but Take-Two has real scarcity value now."

Take-Two is known for a number of popular video game series, namely the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The company is gearing up for a May 2026 release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," the latest iteration of the series, which gamers have been anticipating for more than a decade. Its predecessor, "Grand Theft Auto V," is one of the best-selling video games ever, having sold more than 200 million copies since it came out in 2013.

Take-Two's stock has climbed over the last few months, and shares are currently up 39.6% year-to-date.

Last week, the company's peer Electronic Arts announced it would be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in a deal worth $55 billion. The take-private deal will be the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history. Cramer noted that Electronic Arts' takeover comes two years after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, another major American video game publisher.

According to Cramer, those who want to invest in a traditional video game company now need to enter the Japanese market or "bet on Take-Two." He also said that while Microsoft and Sony have large gaming divisions, most of their sales come from other businesses.

Cramer also pointed to several aspects of Take-Two's business he finds impressive, including results from its most recent quarter. The company beat Wall Street's estimates and raised its full-year forecast for net bookings. Take-Two said new player accounts for GTA Online have grown more than 50% year-over-year, Cramer noted. He also said the company has other successful franchises beyond GTA, including sports game NBA 2K. The 2025 iteration of the game has already sold more than 11.5 million units, the company said, and daily active users climbed 30% year-over-year. While most of Take-Two's games are played on Playstation, Xbox and PC, Cramer noted its mobile business is growing nicely.

"GTA VI" is likely to be a success, Cramer continued, even if the release date is delayed. If the game is delayed, and the stock takes a hit, he suggested investors use the decline as a buying opportunity.

"Just keep in mind, if you're taking the plunge into Take-Two here, you have to be able to stomach any delays to 'GTA VI,'" he said. "In fact, you should expect delays — video games aren't like movies, which come out on a regular schedule."

Take-Two did not immediately respond to request for comment.

OpenAI told the world about its internal workplace tools last week, and since then, the market has been freaking out about whether the AI startup will someday compete with the SaaS industry with its own software tools.

So, at OpenAI's big DevDay conference on Monday, I headed straight to a presentation by Scotty Huhn, who is part of a team that builds tools that help OpenAI's Sales, Customer Success, and Operations teams do their jobs more effectively.

Huhn walked a packed crowd through three OpenAI software tools: GTM Assistant, OpenHouse, and Support Agent.

He made clear these are internal tools at the moment, but after the presentation he was asked whether OpenAI would ever release them as software products in the future. He mostly the dodged the question by saying it is still very early days.

OpenAI wouldn't be the first company to start selling the internal tools it develops to other businesses. Famously, workplace chat giant Slack used to be a game developer called Tiny Speck, and spun out its messaging tool into a full-fledged business (Salesforce bought Slack for nearly $30 billion in 2020).

Huhn also noted in his presentation, and in comments afterwards, that OpenAI is open-minded about build-versus-buy decisions when it comes to workplace software. If there are better tools out there to buy, OpenAI will do that, he said.

Huhn also noted that OpenAI uses Sales Cloud, Salesforce's customer-relationship-management software, as a "source of truth" for the startup's sales teams. OpenAI also uses Workday for HR information, Slack for internal communication, and Databricks for a key data warehousing service, according to his presentation and comments. 

The first internal tool Huhn described was OpenAI's GTM Assistant, which helps the startup's go-to-market sales team work more efficiently. 

He said some of the skills that were distilled for this tool came from a talented human sales employee called Sophie. 

The tool helps staff with planning for meeting potential clients, customer demos, and follow-ups after these touchpoints. 

Another real human employee at OpenAI had developed about 100 customer demos, and the startup used these to train its GTM Assistant tool to create better demos. Now, this knowledge has been spread among the broader team, which numbers more than 400, Huhn explained. 

Any missing stuff can be called out by employees and fed back into the system, constantly improving it, he added. 

Next up was OpenHouse, an internal HR tool that taps into existing workplace software, such as Slack and Workday, to help employees connect with each other better and keep up with company policies and other information.

In one example, Huhn shared a recent sales trip to New York. He used OpenHouse to ask if any colleagues there knew about customers and topic areas relevant to his upcoming meetings. 

OpenHouse suggested four or five staffers, and Huhn reached out to a specific person who helped him prepare better. 

The final tool Huhn discussed was Support Agent, which makes OpenAI's customer support operation more efficient. 

He showed a chart of customer support tickets over the past year or so, with a huge spike in the spring when OpenAI introduced a new image-generation tool, and usage spiked. Interestingly, there was another huge spike in recent weeks, per the chart. 

The tool has improved OpenAI's support ticket deflection rate, which measures how many customer requests are dealt with quickly and easily. 

More customer questions have been solved, and positive reviews are way up, according to data Huhn shared during the presentation. 

The tool has helped OpenAI bake standards and knowledge into its customer support operation, partly by taking interactions and feeding them back into evaluation processes at the end, which improves the system over time. 

Huhn finished by pitching the audience on using AI in general to improve their own operations. 

Rather than selling these specific internal tools, he encouraged developers to use OpenAI's AgentKit service to build their own agents.

He stressed that the skills OpenAI distilled into its own AI tools ultimately came from the startup's employees, including that talented sales staffer, Sophie. 

"Find your Sophie," Huhn said.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to halt key parts of a judge's order requiring Alphabet's Google to make major changes to its app store Play, as the company prepares to appeal a decision in a lawsuit brought by "Fortnite" maker Epic Games.

The justices turned down Google's request to temporarily freeze parts of the injunction won by Epic in its lawsuit accusing the tech giant of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and pay for transactions within apps.

A federal appeals court in July upheld the judge's sweeping order against Google.

The injunction issued last year by U.S. District Judge James Donato requires Google to allow users to download rival app stores within its Play store and make Play's app catalog available to competitors. Those provisions do not take effect until July 2026.

The judge also said Google must allow developers to include external links in apps, enabling users to bypass Google's billing system. That part of the injunction is due to take effect later this month.

Donato issued his order in a lawsuit that Epic filed in 2020 against Google, alleging its restrictive app store rules violated antitrust law. Epic won a jury trial in San Francisco in 2023. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

Google has called Donato's order unprecedented, and said it would cause reputational harm, safety and security risks and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if allowed to take effect.

Google in its Supreme Court filing said the changes would have enormous consequences for more than 100 million U.S. Android users and 500,000 developers. Google said it plans to file a full appeal to the Supreme Court by October 27, which could allow the justices to take up the case during their nine-month term that began on Monday.

Epic has said Google is relying on what it called "flawed security claims" to justify its control over Android devices. Epic had urged the justices to allow Donato's injunction to take effect "so consumers and developers can benefit from competition, choices and lower prices."

In July, a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, ruling that the record in Epic's lawsuit was "replete with evidence that Google's anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance."

Google faces other lawsuits from government, consumer and commercial plaintiffs challenging its search and advertising business practices.

Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned Monday that OpenAI's deals with Nvidia and AMD are purely announcements, not deployments. 

"Now we will see what gets delivered," the Altimeter Capital founder told CNBC. "Ultimately, the best chips will win."

OpenAI's megadeal with AMD and its relentless push to expand artificial intelligence capabilities underscores the intensifying competitive landscape. 

Gerstner said the deals provide "more evidence that the world will remain compute-constrained despite best efforts to bring massive supply online."

Experts say it's also another validation of the AI arms race heating up, with AI a key element in the geopolitical race between the U.S. and China.

OpenAI's Chinese rival DeepSeek sent shockwaves last year when it claimed to have a lower-cost AI model than its U.S. peer. And Deepseek has continued to innovate, delivering new open-sourced models using domestically made AI chips.

Last week, the U.S. government issued a report warning of DeepSeek's national security concerns, Axios reported.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation said DeepSeek provides Chinese Communist Party views more frequently than U.S. models, according to Axios.

OpenAI's partnership with AMD is raising hopes that it is taking the right steps to increase production and  build more complex AI models.

"What we're really seeing is a world where there's going to be absolute compute scarcity, because there's going to be so much demand for AI services, and not just from OpenAI, really from the whole ecosystem," OpenAI President told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Monday. "And so that's why it's just so important for this whole industry to come together."

A top federal prosecutor in Virginia is resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to seek a criminal indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime antagonist of Trump, MSNBC reported Monday.

The prosecutor, Elizabeth Yusi, works in the U.S. Attorney's Office  Eastern District of Virginia, which recently obtained an indictment of another target of Trump's ire, former FBI Director James Comey.

"Yusi, who oversees major criminal prosecutions in the Norfolk office of the Eastern District of Virginia, has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC," according to MSNBC's report.

"Yusi plans to present her conclusion to the president's new interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, in the coming weeks, they said," MSNBC reported.

Halligan was installed in that job by Trump after her predecessor,  Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from Trump after opposing the filing of charges against Comey. 

Halligan soon afterward got a grand jury to indict Comey on charges of lying during testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020.

Comey denies the allegations.

Trump over the weekend called James "SCUM" in a social media post that urged her removal as attorney general.

In an earlier social media post, on Sept. 20, Trump called on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute James, Comey, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Bill Pulte, whom Trump appointed to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has suggested that James committed mortgage fraud in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home, where her niece lives.

James's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has denied the suggestion that James said the home was her primary residence to obtain a more favorable loan rate.

"Lowell noted that a power-of-attorney form had mistakenly listed the house as a primary residence, but that James herself checked 'no' on the loan application when asked if the house was her primary home," MSNBC reported. "In addition, according to Lowell, James also sent an email to her mortgage broker stating the house 'WILL NOT be my primary residence.' "

James, in early September, appealed an intermediate appellate court's decision tossing out a $500 million penalty  on Trump and his company in connection with business fraud.  The appellate court said the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of excessive fines.

The court upheld a trial court judge's finding that Trump and others had committed business fraud.

He has denied wrongdoing in that case, which stemmed from a lawsuit that James filed against him.

AppLovin shares plummeted on Monday after Bloomberg reported that the SEC has been probing the mobile advertising company over its data-collection practices.

The agency has been looking into whether the company violated agreements on pushing targeted ads to consumers, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report said that the SEC is responding to a whistleblower complained filed this year along with multiple short-seller reports, and added that neither the company nor its officials have been accused of wrongdoing.

An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn't typically comment on the "existence or non-existence" of regulatory matters.

"That said, as a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course," the spokesperson said in a statement. "Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels."

The stock dropped 14% in regular trading after the report, which landed shortly before market close. It fell another 5% in extended trading. 

AppLovin's stock has been on a tear, jumping about 80% this year after soaring more than 700% in 2024. The surge has been driven by the company's artificial intelligence technology that's allowed it to provide better ad targeting capabilities to brands.

Last month, AppLovin was added to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings, at the same time that Robinhood joined the index in place of Caesars Entertainment.

AppLovin made the move into the benchmark despite a short-seller's effort to keep it out.

In March, Fuzzy Panda Research advised the committee for the large-cap U.S. index to keep AppLovin from becoming a constituent. AppLovin shares dropped 15% in December, when the committee picked Workday to join the S&P 500.

Three notable short-seller firms, including Fuzzy Panda, have slammed AppLovin of late. The latest was Muddy Waters Research, which in March said the company's ad tactics "systematically" violate app stores' terms of service by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, Google, and others." In so doing, AppLovin is funneling targeted ads to users without their consent, Muddy Waters said.

Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research put out reports the prior month, taking aim at AppLovin's AXON software, which drove its earnings growth and stock surge. The shares dropped 12% on Feb. 26, the day of the short reports.

After those reports were published, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote a blog post, defending his company's technology and practices, and taking aim at the short sellers trying to profit from AppLovin's decline.

Figma shares jumped 7% on Monday after the design software vendor's technology was promoted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in an onstage demo at his company's annual DevDay conference in San Francisco.

Altman discussed Figma's integration into ChatGPT, which has more than 800 million monthly users. He showed how third-party applications could plug in with OpenAI's Apps SDK, or software development framework.

"When someone's using ChatGPT, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name," Altman said. "For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChatGPT and then say, Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram. The Figma app will take over respond and complete the action."

In addition to asking for Figma's help by name in ChatGPT, the assistant can also suggest Figma when it's relevant, Figma product manager Luke Zhang said in a blog post.

The rally for Figma, at its high point, was the steepest since the day of the company's public market debut on the New York Stock Exchange in July.

Figma has been ramping up its own tools for working on app and website designs using generative AI models from OpenAI and other providers.

Subscribers to products that connect to the Apps SDK will be able to log in without leaving their ChatGPT conversations, Altman said. He said people working on products in Figma can also launch the FigJam tool to keep working on development ideas. Apps SDK is based on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that OpenAI rival Anthropic introduced last year.

Software developers will be able to submit apps for review later in 2025, Altman said.

Over time, OpenAI will offer many ways to generate revenue through third-party integrations, Altman said. Last week, OpenAI announced a feature allowing people to buy products listed on Etsy through ChatGPT.

The Senate on Monday for a fifth time did not pass a House bill that would temporarily fund the U.S. government, deepening the government funding stalemate.

Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, and Democrats remained at loggerheads over the terms of a funding deal as the government shutdown dragged on to its sixth day.

The 52-42 vote fell largely along party lines, as was the case during the four previous votes on the same measure.

The measure would have funded the government through Nov. 21. The Senate on Monday also rejected House Democrats' plan to temporarily fund the government, as had been expected.

Republican senators need at least eight votes from members of the Democratic caucus to meet the 60-vote threshold required to advance the legislation.

The only senators from the Democratic caucus so far to vote for the House resolution have been John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, as well as Angus King of Maine, one of two independents in the caucus.

Those three senators again voted with Republicans on Monday evening, while Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted with Democrats to oppose the measure.

The Trump administration reiterated its threat of mass layoffs of government workers if the shutdown persists beyond Monday.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that President Donald Trump could "start taking sharp measures" if the Senate does not approve the funding bill.

Hassett said Democrats would be to blame for "any government worker that loses their job" due to reduction-in-force orders.

Federal employees normally are furloughed during government shutdowns, not laid off.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune can now tee up another vote for Tuesday, Punchbowl News reported.

Deloitte has agreed to partially refund an Australian government department after errors were discovered in a report completed partly using the technology.

The Big Four firm had been contracted to conduct an assurance review of the country's Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF), part of the IT system that administers welfare and benefits payments. The firm completed the seven-month project, which was worth 440,000 Australian dollars, around $290,000, in June.

But the final report, published in July, was found to contain multiple errors, including academic references to people who didn't exist and a made-up quote from a Federal Court judgment, the Australian Financial Review first reported.

The errors were noticed by the Australian welfare academic Chris Rudge.

An updated version of the report was published on the website of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations on Friday. The new copy deletes more than a dozen nonexistent references and footnotes, rewrites the reference list, and corrects multiple typographic errors, the AFR reported.

In the updated report, Deloitte also disclosed that its methodology "included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT — 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR's Azure tenancy."

The detail that AI was used was not part of the report published in July, according to AFR.

Deloitte "confirmed some footnotes and references were incorrect" on the review and has agreed to repay the final installment under its contract, a DEWR spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.

The spokesperson added that the changes did not change the review's substance or overall recommendations on the TCF system.

Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about whether AI caused the errors.

Deloitte on Monday announced a deal to bring Anthropic's artificial intelligence assistant Claude to its more than 470,000 employees around the globe. 

The rollout will be Anthropic's largest enterprise deployment ever, building on a partnership the two companies first unveiled last year.

Deloitte, which offers consulting, tax and audit services, is one of the 300,000 business customers Anthropic has amassed in the four years since the startup's founding. 

"We are both investing a significant amount in this partnership, whether that's financial or whether it is just simply the engineering resource that we're going to put into this as well," Paul Smith, Anthropic's chief commercial officer, told CNBC in an interview.  

The companies declined to disclose the financial details of the deal.

Deloitte will build out and deploy different Claude "personas" for different groups of employees, ranging from accountants to software developers, over the next several months. Staffers can also get support from specialists within Deloitte's Claude Center of Excellence, which is designed to help teams deploy and benefit from the technology more quickly.

Ideally, exposing Deloitte employees to AI will help them reap the personal benefits like productivity gains, while also inspiring them to think about how the technology could be used to transform other industries and sectors, said Ranjit Bawa, Deloitte's U.S. chief strategy and technology officer.

"Our clients obviously want to know: 'Are you using it as well?' So we can advise them better, we can be more credible," Bawa said. "That's why we said we got to start with ourselves as we continue to have our clients reimagine their future."

Deloitte's Claude deployment, which will take place across more than 150 countries, comes as Anthropic has been working to beef up its global presence.

The startup said in September that it would triple its international workforce this year, and brought on a new executive, Chris Ciauri, to spearhead that expansion.

That same month, Anthropic announced its latest AI model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and that it closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation. The Amazon-backed startup has had to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google for customers.

"We're still pretty busy," Smith said. "But it's good busy."

Companies like Starbucks, Paramount and Microsoft are among the latest to issue new return-to-office requirements, but mass RTO has been a years-long push across Corporate America. Getting workers back in hasn't been so easy.

People are spending about 25% of their days working from home, and that share hasn't budged since spring 2023, says Nick Bloom, a Stanford professor and leading researcher on remote work trends, and based on a recurring survey of 10,000 Americans from his team at WFH Research.

Work-from-home rates have persisted, Bloom tells CNBC Make It, even as the labor market sours, people cling to their jobs and leverage swings back in the direction of CEOs making RTO calls.

What gives?

Bloom points to a few factors. First is a "growing compliance gap."

"Firms are announcing RTOs," he says. "It just does not look like employees are following through on the ground."

He thinks of it as passive resistance: CEOs make a big announcement, but the middle managers tasked with enforcing the rule don't want to follow it themselves, much less make direct reports do so.

Managers are typically assessed on the performance of their team, and if they're performing well enough, they're unlikely to see the benefit of an increased attendance rule, Bloom says. Senior leaders may overlook any rule-bending too.

Many businesses are also shrinking their layers of middle management. This can lead to burnout among the bosses who remain, which in turn can result in less enforcement of these RTO mandates.

Then, there's the issue of tracking whether people are in for the actual number of days required by company policy.

Take a company that has a four-day office policy, but most people only go in for three. It can be hard to track exactly why someone didn't meet the attendance requirement for a given week. They could be out taking client meetings, at a conference, at an appointment, taking a sick day or just on vacation, Bloom says.

One Fortune 100 company Bloom spoke with has a three-day attendance policy, but over an eight-week rolling average, they only flag if someone is in fewer than one-and-a-half days per week. The company's HR chief chalked up the missing in-office time to people being out on business travel, Bloom says.

Other workers are showing up for the required number of days, but experimenting with how long they actually have to be there. Some 43% of hybrid workers partake in coffee badging, or going to the office for a few hours just to show their faces, and 12% want to give it a try, according to Owl Labs' recent survey of 2,000 full-time workers. Among those who've been caught, more than half say their employer didn't mind the practice.

Coffee badging is down from 2023 levels, but consistent with last year.

The majority of hybrid workers go into the office three to four days a week, which is up from last year, says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. At the same time, they're finding ways to maintain flexibility by coffee badging, scheduling personal appointments during the day, or trying what he calls "micro-shifting" —working in short, non-linear blocks not bound by a 9-to-5 and instead based on personal energy, responsibilities or productivity patterns.

As far as flexibility goes, "they're finding it wherever they can," Weishaupt says.

Workers quit when they don't get the flexibility they want, or see it being clawed back by their employers, experts say. That could be by design.

"RTO is being used as a bit of a cheap way to reduce headcount" by avoiding layoffs and paying out severance, Bloom says. Quitters could be scooped up by younger, smaller firms that offer flexibility as a perk when they can't compete with big-company salaries. That could be another reason why work-from-home rates have, on the whole, remained the same.

The problem with using RTO to shrink headcount is "you don't get to choose who leaves," Bloom says.

Previous research from the University of Pittsburgh found that women, senior and skilled employees were most likely to leave companies that enacted new RTO policies.

Businesses say offering remote and hybrid work improves their ability to hire, especially for hard-to-fill roles or in so-called "talent deserts" in certain areas of the country, says ZipRecruiter economist Nicole Bachaud.

Around 20% of employers say they're looking to hire fully remote workers this year, and a similar share are on the hunt to hire candidates in a hybrid role, according to ZipRecruiter data.

"There is still demand for these types of roles within companies," Bachaud says, "but a smaller share than we've seen in the past, for sure."

Bari Weiss is now the top editor at CBS News, and she's starting day one with an "open mind" and a sense of urgency, according to a memo she sent to the newsroom on Monday.

Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who founded the anti-establishment media company, "The Free Press," just sold her company to CBS News owner Paramount for roughly $150 million, a source familiar with the deal said. As part of the deal, Weiss is now editor-in-chief of CBS News, while "The Free Press" will continue to operate separately.

In her introductory memo, obtained by Business Insider, Weiss listed 10 core journalistic values she would champion at CBS News, including remaining "fair, fearless, and factual" and holding "both American political parties to equal scrutiny."

Some current and former CBS News employees told Business Insider they were wary of Weiss taking charge of the nearly 100-year-old newsroom. A former CBS News staffer said they wondered how Weiss, who has a commentary background and history of taking stances on hot-button issues, would approach managing a straight-news operation.

Weiss said in a statement that the deal would allow The Free Press' "ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience."

"We honor the extraordinary legacy of CBS News by committing ourselves to a singular mission: building the most trusted news organization of the 21st Century," she said.

Paramount CEO David Ellison said Weiss "is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News."

Read the full memo that Weiss sent to CBS News employees below:

Dear Colleagues:

I am thrilled and humbled to be writing to you as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.

Growing up, CBS was a deep family tradition. Whenever I hear that tick, tick, tick or that trumpet fanfare, it sends me right back to our den in Pittsburgh. The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege.

Right now, I imagine you have some questions. I do, too.

My goal in the coming days and weeks is to get to know you. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. I'll approach it the way any reporter would—with an open mind, a fresh notebook, and an urgent deadline.

What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you:

I look forward to meeting many of you in the days ahead and to listening and learning from you. I am profoundly honored to join you—and I can't wait to get started.

With gratitude and excitement,

Bari

Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries challenged Speaker Mike Johnson to a live public debate about the government shutdown, which entered its sixth day on Monday with no off-ramp in sight.

But the Republican leader quickly brushed off Jeffries' request, accusing the New York lawmaker of making "desperate pleas for attention."

In a letter to Johnson, Jeffries told the Louisiana Republican that he is game to debate on the House floor "any day this week in primetime, broadcast live to the American people."

"Given the urgency of the moment and the Republican refusal to negotiate a bipartisan agreement, a debate on the House Floor will provide the American people with the transparency they deserve," Jeffries wrote.

"It will also give you an opportunity to explain your my way or the highway approach to shutting the government down, when Democratic votes are needed to resolve the impasse that exists," he wrote.

Johnson, at a news conference later Monday morning, accused Jeffries of issuing the debate challenge in desperation because of unfavorable polling on Democrats' shutdown messaging.

But multiple recent polls show Americans are more likely to blame the shutdown on President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, than on Democrats.

Johnson said lawmakers previously debated on the House floor before passing a Republican-proposed stopgap funding measure, which has so far failed to pass in the Senate.

"I'm not going to let Hakeem try to pretend for these theatrics," Johnson said, adding, "We all know what he's trying to do."

The House is out of session this week.

The Senate is set to vote again on Republicans' stopgap, which would resume funding at current levels through Nov. 21, and Democrats' alternative, which includes additional health-care funding and other measures, after 5:30 p.m. ET.

Those same funding bills have already failed multiple times to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome the Senate filibuster. The latest attempts are also expected not to succeed.

Nike's turnaround plan is showing early signs of progress, but it will "take a while" for the company to return to profitable growth, CEO Elliott Hill said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen aired Monday.

"When we come to work we think about three brands, and then multiple sports under each brand and then 190 countries that roll up to our four geographies," Hill said in a sit-down interview from the company's headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. "Each brand times sport, and each [geography] times country, they're at different stages of the evolution." 

When asked when investors can expect Nike to get back to mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth with strong margins, Hill acknowledged that "it'll take time." But he said the company has "the path" to get there. 

"It's going to take a while," said Hill. "It's not linear. But it is a portfolio, and ultimately the goal is to have the entire portfolio all working together to drive the revenue and the profit that we hope to deliver for all of our investors." 

The comments come nearly a year into Hill's tenure as CEO. Investors are looking for more clarity into how well his strategy to turn around the company is working as quarterly sales and profits have declined for much of the last year.

The struggles have shown in Nike's stock, which has fallen about 12% in the last year. While Wall Street knows how Hill plans to fix the company, it is still unclear how long it will take.

Since Hill took over last October, he's worked to reverse many of the strategies implemented by his predecessor, former eBay CEO John Donahoe, who tried to sell more shoes and apparel directly to shoppers. Instead of focusing on sales only through Nike's website and stores, Hill is moving back to wholesalers and working to win back shelf space that competitors have taken over. 

During his interview with Eisen, Hill said Donahoe's focus on digital sales made sense during the Covid pandemic, but that changed when the world started to open up again. 

"When Covid hit, supply got constrained, demand goes up and I think the team did what I think anybody would do. Shift product over to digital commerce and all of a sudden that takes off. Double revenue, double margins and it's a winning strategy," said Hill.

"Then of course everything normalized," he said. "Physical retail started to open back up and we continued on with that strategy … and I think over time it ended up hurting the brand because there's a certain set of consumers that want to shop choice, and they want to shop across each of the different channels of distribution." 

Hill said the company has made strides toward taking back the shelf space it lost. Nike is also trying fresh partners, such as Aritzia, to win over new, female shoppers. 

Hill is also changing the way the business is segmented and returning it to its historical roots. Instead of dividing the company into women's, men's and kid's, Donahoe's strategy to drive lifestyle sales, Hill is reworking the corporate structure so the company's departments are focused on individual sports. 

"They have small cross-functional teams in each of those segments, if you will, of business and the idea is that the consumers in each of those segments and the competition in each of those segments is different and so by having these small cross-functional teams … that's really helped us get sharp in a couple of areas," said Hill.

Under Donahoe, Nike faced criticism for falling behind on innovation and losing market share because it was so focused on driving sales of classic styles, like the Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. Changing the company structure is one of the ways Hill plans to reignite innovation because the teams will be squarely focused on the individual needs of different athletes, allowing them to create and deliver better products for those consumers. 

Many industry insiders expect Nike to make a complete recovery, but larger macroeconomic challenges will make a tough turnaround that much harder. 

When reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings last week, Nike warned that it now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion in its current fiscal year, up from the $1 billion it projected in June. Those costs are expected to impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year, up from the 0.75 percentage point it originally forecast. 

Hill told Eisen the company is working to offset the cost of tariffs by leaning on its suppliers, factories and retail partners. Nike also recently implemented certain price increases, which could help blunt the impact of the new duties.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones believes the conditions are set for a powerful surge in stock prices before the bull market tops out.

"My guess is that I think all the ingredients are in place for some kind of a blow off," Jones said Monday on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "History rhymes a lot, so I would think some version of it is going to happen again. If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999."

The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said today's market is reminiscent of the setup leading up to the burst of the dot-com bubble in late 1999, with dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones said the circular deals or vendor financing happening in the artificial intelligence space today also made him "nervous."

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. The rally has been driven by megacap tech giants, which have invested billions in AI and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era.

The difference between now and 1999 is the U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, Jones noted. The Federal Reserve had just begun a new easing cycle, whereas rate hikes were on the way before the market top in 2000. The U.S. is now running a 6% budget deficit, while in 1999, there was a budget surplus of $99,000, Jones said.

"That fiscal monetary combination is a brew that we haven't seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early '50s," he said.

The longtime investor highlighted the tension at the heart of every late-stage bull market — the eagerness to capture outsized gains and the inevitability of a painful correction.

"You have to get on and off the train pretty quick. If you just think about bull markets, the greatest price appreciations always [occurs] the 12 months preceding the top," Jones said. "It kind of doubles whatever the annual averages, and before then, if you don't play it, you're missing out on the juice; if you do play it, you have to have really happy feet, because there will be a really, really bad end to it."

To be sure, Jones isn't predicting an immediate downturn. He believes the bull market still has room to run before it reaches its final phase.

"It will take a speculative frenzy for us to elevate those prices. It will take more retail buying. It'll take more recruitment from a variety of others from long short hedge funds, from real money, etc.," he said.

He said he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year to take advantage of the rally fueled by the fear of missing out.

Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the co-founder of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.

Correction: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. A previous version misstated the percentage.

The tech hiring market is being pulled in two directions: a flood of candidates for certain roles and stark shortages in others.

New survey data from Indeed highlights the unevenness of the tech talent landscape and the profound impact of AI on reshaping the skills employers need most.

While many tech jobs attract an oversupply of applicants, the study found that key areas, such as cloud computing, data analytics, and AI development, are still starved for qualified professionals.

"What began as a cyclical downturn in tech hiring may now be entering a new phase — one shaped by the rise of AI, increased requirements, and less demand for entry-level talent," Indeed wrote in a report released on Monday.

The study analyzed data from Indeed and Glassdoor on tech jobs, in combination with a commissioned survey of 1,035 tech workers in the US conducted by YouGov. Participants, primarily working in software and IT, answered an online questionnaire between late May and early June.

Generative AI is reshaping career paths. The Indeed study identified tech jobs that have been axed the most when companies adjust their operations to embrace generative AI.

Here are the top four roles that got cut in AI-inspired reorganizations:

Indeed found that after such reorganizations, companies often reallocated resources to new tech roles. Here are the top three areas that benefited:

The top skills requested in tech job listings posted in the first half of 2025 include Python, SQL, and Amazon Web Services, according to Indeed data.

Indeed also looked at which areas of tech exhibited the largest increases in job listings. Fields that stood out included AI, Python, Google Cloud Platform, and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), a process for integrating and releasing software changes more quickly.

Employers are beginning to think less about individual tools and more about clusters of tech skills packaged together, according to the study by Indeed.

Python, machine learning, and data analysis are increasingly inseparable, while AWS, DevOps, and CI/CD often appear in tandem, according to the data.

These clusters reflect how technical professionals are expected not only to master a language or technology, but also to possess capabilities across different technologies.

Generative AI is accelerating this shift. Roles that once centered on traditional coding are being redefined to include prompt engineering, AI integration, and the responsible deployment of AI systems, according to Indeed. Professionals are now expected to partner with AI tools to drive efficiency, strengthen data analysis, and more.

The gap between some tech job postings and available talent is widening, leaving employers scrambling to compete for a limited pool of specialists, according to Indeed. To bridge the gap, Indeed suggested that companies sharpen recruitment campaigns around what highly sought-after candidates actually value, from career growth to cutting-edge project opportunities.

At the same time, learning new skills has become a necessity rather than a perk. Identifying employees with adjacent skill sets and providing them with pathways into high-demand roles is increasingly viewed as one of the few sustainable ways to keep pace with market needs, according to Indeed.

Tech talent shortages aren't going away. They're shifting toward the skills that define the AI era.

UPDATE, October 6, 2025: This article was originally published on October 4, 2025. It has been updated after AMD announced it had entered into a multi-year deal to provide chips to OpenAI.

Lisa Su is the engineer behind one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds in the tech industry.

The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia.

On Monday, the company announced that it had agreed to a massive multi-year deal to provide its AI chips to OpenAI. The announcement sent AMD's stock soaring as much as 27% in premarket trading.

When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025.

But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing.

Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation:

Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City.

As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986.

Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s.

Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies.

After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor.

As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research.

Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion.

At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming.

AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market.

In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD.

In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel.

In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles.

The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips.

In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60.

By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion.

Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event.

"I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility.

In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building.

Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology.

Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together.

Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends.

Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title.

Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother.

Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers.

AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia.

When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because "the market is humongous" and she sees plenty of opportunities.

On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware.

In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential.

But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out.

"Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem."

Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips.

In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market.

"We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. "They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation."

In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses.

On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead."

The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations.

On Monday, AMD announced it had agreed to a multi-billion-dollar partnership to supply its artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI.

The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia.

The multi-year deal, announced Monday, will see OpenAI deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first 1 gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026.

It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets.

"This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said.

Robotaxis are becoming common in some big US cities, but they're still novelties in many.

In Atlanta and Austin, for instance, companies like Uber and Lyft started offering rides in driverless cars earlier this year, but some riders have told me they've had to go out of their way to hail one. Where I live, in Washington, DC, you can spot self-driving cars on the road — Google's Waymo, for one, is testing them in the market — but they're not yet available to customers.

In San Francisco, meanwhile, self-driving cars are everywhere.

On a trip there last week, I couldn't walk around the areas like Union Square and Market Street in the city center without seeing a car drive by without anyone at the wheel.

It was a strange sight for me, but I shouldn't have been surprised. Waymo has been operating driverless rides in San Francisco since 2022, and the company opened the service up to anyone who downloads its app in the city last year.

After days of seeing robotaxis pass me on the street, I decided to hail a Waymo car and see what it's like to ride one in a city where they've become so ubiquitous. Here's what I found.

I wanted to get from my hotel near Union Square to a meeting about 12 minutes away, so I pulled out my phone to check availability and prices.

I was traveling close to 9:30 a.m., so I expected to hit rush-hour traffic and see higher prices than if I had waited until later in the day.

Despite not having a human driver to pay, Waymo charged me more than Uber or Lyft would have for the same trip.

After booking with Waymo, I pulled up the two other ride-hailing services to compare prices. An UberX ride would have cost around $13, while Lyft, which was running a discount when I checked, would have charged about $10.

With a 20% tip, the Uber ride would have cost about the same as Waymo, but the Lyft ride would've been a few dollars cheaper.

A Waymo spokesperson said that the company looks at multiple factors when pricing rides, such as the trip's duration and distance. "During busier times, such as morning rush hour and weekends, prices may be higher," the spokesperson said.

Self-driving cars, especially ones operated by Waymo, are everywhere in the center of San Francisco.

During the six-minute wait for my ride, I noticed at least a half-dozen other Waymo vehicles drive by, including two right next to each other. Going around town over the previous couple of days, I found out how hard it was to even walk around a city block without seeing at least one or two self-driving cars.

I initially missed the notification that my car had arrived. As I looked around my pickup location, though, I couldn't see a Waymo stopped near me.

After checking the map, I realized that it had stopped down the block and up another street. While it took less than a minute to walk there, I wondered why the car had not navigated to my designated pick-up point.

Waymo uses several factors, such as zoning, traffic, and walking distance, to determine where its vehicles pick up and drop off passengers, with the goal of "balancing safety and convenience," the Waymo spokesperson said.

I knew that this was my car from the license plate, which was on-screen in the Waymo app. My initials were also visible on the console that was on the roof.

The street where my car stopped wasn't as busy as the one I waited on, which might explain why it was there.

I found it funny that there were three other Waymo cars stopped behind it.

I had to slide this button forward in the Waymo app to indicate I was ready to leave.

Sitting in the back of the electric Jaguar I-Pace, I noticed a screen on the console between the two front seats.

As the car started moving, a safety video started playing. It reminded me to buckle my seatbelt and said that I shouldn't touch the steering wheel or the pedals.

Some people I know swear that they'll never get in one of these cars because no one is behind the wheel. I didn't find it that strange, in part because I was traveling along city streets at low speeds.

Still, I couldn't help but take a video of the empty driver's seat, especially as the car made a turn and the wheel rotated without anyone present.

At one point, the car stopped in the middle of an intersection.

As I tried to look ahead and see what was happening, I noticed that the screen in the front of the car laid out the situation for me: Someone was crossing the street one vehicle ahead, and the car I was in had noticed and stopped.

The screen between the front seats also allowed me to call support if there was an issue.

Fortunately, my destination was on a less-busy street than the one where I hailed the car, so it was able to pull up directly in front of my destination.

As I got out, the Waymo app prompted me to leave a review and offered walking directions to my destination (which I didn't need, in this case).

I felt safe riding in Waymo's vehicle, and with the company's expansion to other cities, I would try one again.

But I probably won't pay a premium to ride in a Waymo again. If Uber and Lyft are cheaper, I'd likely take a ride with one of those services.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance.

Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections.

This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world.



After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch.

Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy."

He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion.

Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on.

Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said.

After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward."

Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors.

"I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider.

She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk.

"I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to."

Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave.

Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving.

She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked.

As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible.

Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee.

That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds.

Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities.

Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said.

Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl.

He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said.

Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business.

"Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions."

Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities.

She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own."

Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas."

She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023.

Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles."

In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history.

It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record.

Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys.

Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets."

At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business.

"For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees."

From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak.

It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider.

As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group.

Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda.

Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said.

Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens."

Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn't the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen.

Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum.

The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street.

Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector.

The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen.

And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion.

Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors.

In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals.

Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs.

"The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also."

Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks."

"I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities."

A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry.

As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said.

Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year.

Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began.

Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings.

Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries.

When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career.

"It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said.

Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity.

Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas.

Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion.

The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert.

Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession.

"The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said.

Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity.

"All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said.

Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on.

After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team.

The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines.

"I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said.

In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo.

"We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic.

Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers.

"We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company."

The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets.

Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook.

O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider.

"Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said.

O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said.

The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower.

A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows.

"Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said.

In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand.

At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said.

A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015.

When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business.

"The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week."

Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments.

The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position.

"I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said.

He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said.

Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries.

His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air.

"There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said.

And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said.

"We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said.

Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year.

"It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said.

The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like."

That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions.

Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted.

Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship.

In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions."

When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider.

Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies.

UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path."

He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction."

He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees.

In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds.

In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets.

This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations.

Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators.

About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change.

"My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said.

So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?"

He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up.

His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world."

His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us."

Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry.

"I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said.

​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves.

Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans.

As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!"

He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia.

"He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market.

Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said.

Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team.

Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades.

"He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said.

Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview.

Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers.

Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders.

She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real.

Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said.

A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing.

She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career.

A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs.

Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour.

From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite.

It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place.

After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked."

A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year.

He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data.

Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often.

Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing."

From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews.

When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson.

"You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said.

A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career.

Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment.

He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium.

Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said.

"You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte.

Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.)

"When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added.

Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics.

Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires.

Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund.

There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies.

He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year.

Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics.

Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant.

Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders.

Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning.

Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago.

Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading.

He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said.

He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious."

In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others.

Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times.

It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out.

Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him.

After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors.

He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld.

Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager.

Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets.

Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity.

Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently.

The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client.

"I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said.

One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions.

One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities.

Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals.

The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said.

Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets.

"Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient.

Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management.

"I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident."

Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver.

Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

In a recent South Park episode, Randy Marsh urges his daughter to learn hands-on skills because AI will automate many knowledge-based jobs.

"AI can do everything better than we can, except for stuff that requires arms," he says.

It's funny, but also true. AI models are getting really good at digital skills such as coding. Beyond bits, though — in the physical world — AI is nowhere near matching the ability of humans to perform many different tasks.

A big reason for this yawning capability gap is data. In the digital world, the internet provides a readymade mountain of information that machines can learn from. In the world of atoms, there's no equivalent.

This physical-world data mountain must be built from scratch. It's a herculean task. I recently met an unassuming startup founder who's hacking away at this problem in an interesting way.

Ali Agha spent seven years at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, developing autonomous multi-robot systems for exploring different environments, including Mars. He started FieldAI in early 2023 and has a team of robotics and AI experts from companies including Google, DeepMind, Waymo, Tesla, Nvidia, Boston Dynamics, and Amazon.

In the race to amass all this physical world data, some big tech companies have a natural advantage. Tesla has huge vehicle and battery factories. Amazon runs hundreds of massive warehouses. Foxconn assembles millions of iPhones and servers in gigantic plants. If you don't have such assets, you have to get more practical and inventive. And this is exactly what FieldAI has done.

Its AI models are designed to get many different types of robots out into real-world situations as quickly and safely as possible. Once there, they perform relatively simple but valuable tasks. While doing this, these machines constantly collect new data, which is fed back into the startup's AI models, which helps them improve. This, in turn, helps FieldAI release more robots into new situations, where, again, they gather even more data and learn all over again.

This is a contrast to some other AI robotics players, which are working on much more ambitious capabilities before getting their machines out in the wild.

"You're deploying more, you're getting more data, and that data makes the model better, which helps you deploy even more, and even more data is starting to be collected," Agha told me in a recent interview. "This flywheel has started spinning faster and faster."

In the six months of 2025, FieldAI contracted 10 times more robots than in the first half of 2024. This is helping to drive that flywheel of real world data collection.

This has caught the eye of major investors. In August, FieldAI raised $405 million, one of the largest startup funding rounds this year. Backers include Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Vinod Khosla, Intel, Samsung, and Laurene Powell Jobs.

"Enabling autonomy solutions at scale is an extremely difficult problem, but the deep expertise of the FieldAI team and their unique approach to embodied intelligence reflects a pragmatic path forward," said Khosla, who was one of the first investors in OpenAI.

The new money will pay for new hires and a major push to "productize" FieldAI's novel approach, according to Agha. That means getting a heck of a lot more data-collecting robots out into the world.

The startup's AI models are designed to control many different types of robots, from quadrupeds to humanoids, wheeled robots, and passenger-scale vehicles. The machines are already deployed in Japan, Europe, and the US, in industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, urban delivery, and inspection.

Agha took me through a practical example from the construction industry to show how FieldAI's approach is working.

Building Information Modeling, or BIM, is an established way to create a detailed digital copy of a construction project, so progress and issues can be tracked accurately.

Usually, BIMs are maintained and updated by human employees walking around construction sites, recording details manually by taking photos and writing notes.

Instead, FieldAI deploys robots to conduct these site tours and update BIMs automatically. This helps construction companies keep better track of the projects, and it's more thorough and cheaper than hiring human workers to walk around for hours doing this task, according to Agha.

A key task is taking photos regularly so you can go back over time and see a project's progress, or a lack of progress. Was the drywall put in before all the piping was finished? If there's a disagreement between the contractor and the insurer, for instance, having an extremely detailed photographic record of the project over time is key.

A robot can walk around these huge sites non-stop, 24/7, while a human can't, which makes these automated BIMs much more detailed and accurate, Agha noted.

As FieldAI machines tour these sites, they constantly collect new data, which gets fed back to improve the AI models that power the robots. Then, next time, the robots can add more tasks.

"A huge benefit of these platforms is that they compound future use cases," Agha said. So one month, a FieldAI robot is taking site photos. The next month, it might also check that the safety barriers are in the correct place. The following month, it might add inventory tracking. There were 100 copper pipes on the second floor yesterday so why are there only 25 now?

The end result is that construction projects can be monitored more closely for less cost, increasing customers' return on investment, according to Agha.

"The key for ROIs, is that the person who was previously walking six hours a day around these massive sites — this person now spends most of their time checking the incoming data from our robots and is analyzing where there's progress and why these other things haven't happened," he said.

Recently, FieldAI had to pull one of these robots from a construction site, due to a paperwork issue. The project superintendent kept calling to ask when the robot was coming back, because they'd gotten so used to an automated system patrolling the site and reporting back so often, according to Agha.

"That was a signal for us," he said. "It was a validation that helped to convince us that this is the right time to grow."

Business Insider Edition 

South Africa has dispatched a team of investigators to France following the sudden death of its ambassador, Nathi Mthethwa, who was found dead in his Paris hotel room earlier this week.


        South Africa is sending a team of top investigators to Paris to assist with the probe into the death of Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa, whose body was discovered in the inner courtyard of the Hyatt Regency hotel after an apparent fall from the 22nd floor.
    


        French authorities have launched an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his passing, while Pretoria has called for a thorough investigation to determine the cause of death.
    


        National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five seasoned police officers will work alongside French authorities to ensure a thorough and transparent inquest.
    


        Ambassador Emmanuel Nkosinathi “Nathi” Mthethwa, 58, was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday, September 30, at the Hyatt Regency in western Paris.
    


        The South African diplomat had been reported missing the day before after his wife said she received a distressing message from him, in which he apologized and suggested he intended to take his life.
    


        French prosecutors said the room was on the 22nd floor and that the window's safety mechanism had been tampered with. They found no immediate signs of struggle, nor traces of drugs or foul play in initial examinations.



        President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed sorrow over the incident, calling Mthethwa's passing “tragic” and offering condolences to his family.
    


        His appointment as ambassador to France began in December 2023, following a long political career in which he served as Minister of Police and Minister of Sports, Arts & Culture.
    


        Complicating matters, Mthethwa had in recent weeks been mentioned during testimony at a judicial commission investigating political interference and corruption in South Africa's criminal justice system.
    


        Some reports suggest he faced allegations of obstructing investigations while serving as police minister, though he was never formally charged.
    


        A close ally of former South African President Jacob Zuma, who is himself facing corruption charges, Mthethwa's career was marked by controversy.
    


        His tenure as police minister remains indelibly linked to the 2012 Marikana massacre, one of South Africa's darkest post-apartheid tragedies, when police opened fire on striking miners, killing 34.
    


        National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five officers have been deployed to Paris to work with French authorities on the probe into Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa's death.
    


        He said the officers' role is to “support a thorough and transparent inquest.”
    


        French prosecutors stated that initial investigations suggest the death may have been a deliberate act, citing a message the ambassador sent to his wife indicating his intention to end his life.
    


        They added that no immediate signs of foul play were found at the scene, but the investigation remains ongoing.

Prince William says his parents' failed relationship taught him what kind of partner and parent he wants to be.

During an appearance on Canadian actor Eugene Levy's Apple TV+ series "The Reluctant Traveler," the Prince of Wales said he wanted to give his children as normal a home life as possible. The episode aired on Friday.

"I think it's really important that that atmosphere is created at home. You have to have that warmth, that feeling of safety, security, love," William told Levy. "That all has to be there, and that was certainly part of my childhood."

However, since his parents got divorced when he was 14, that sense of stability "lasted a short period of time," William said.

"But you take that and you learn from it and you try and make sure you don't do the same mistakes as your parents," he said. "I think we all try and do that. I just want to do what's best for my children, but I know that the drama and the stress when you're small really affects you when you're older."

William also shared that one of the ways his family bonds is by sitting down at the dinner table together.

"So, we sit and chat, it's really important. None of our children have any phones, which we're very strict about," William said.

Williams's parents, Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles, wed on July 29, 1981. Their marriage was troubled from the beginning, overshadowed by Charles's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana and Charles separated in 1992 and finalized their divorce in 1996. The following year, Diana died in a car crash.

Reflecting on the "insatiable" media scrutiny that followed his parents' marriage, and his mother in particular, William said that it made him more protective of his own family.

"They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they'd be everywhere. If you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family," William said.

A representative for William did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

William isn't the only public figure to reflect on how their parents' relationship shaped their own approach to family and marriage.

During a March appearance on the "Sibling Revelry" podcast, Macaulay Culkin said his strained relationship with his father taught him what not to do as a parent.

"It's one of my earliest memories of him was, 'When I grew up, this is how I'm not gonna be with my kids,'" Culkin told podcast hosts Kate and Oliver Hudson.

In July, Tracee Ellis Ross said her mother, Diana Ross, inspired her to find joy and meaning in being alone.

"[My mom] didn't build the wealth she has, she didn't build the career she made because of a man. The example that was set for me [was] that I didn't need a man to build the life I wanted. It wasn't, 'Look at me,' it was, 'This is me.' And that informed something very important for me foundationally," Ross told Self Magazine.

Harvey's CEO told Business Insider he's growing his $5 billion legal AI startup by focusing on two things: regular calendar audits and hands-on hiring.

Winston Weinberg, who cofounded Harvey three years ago, said in an interview on the sidelines of TechLaw.Fest in Singapore in September that as Harvey doubles revenue roughly every six months, the demands of running the company change just as quickly.

"When that happens structurally, you just get all of this pressure as the CEO," he told Business Insider. "The only way to relieve that pressure is to completely level up and change how you operate," he added.

To keep up, he said he conducts what he calls a "calendar audit," combing through how he spends his time and deciding what to drop, what to delegate, and what to take on personally.

Weinberg said his aim is to automate himself out of daily operations so he can focus on what he sees as a CEO's three core jobs: recruiting, product, and customers.

"Every founder wants this — you're trying to automate yourself away," he said.

"I want to be able to feel that when something goes wrong or something is the No. 1 priority, that I can focus all of my time on that, and the rest of the company is humming," he added.

Hiring is the one area Weinberg won't delegate, especially in new offices. He said he wants to be involved with the first hires whenever Harvey opens a new office.

The company said its APAC office in Sydney opened last month. It will hire about 15 people there this year, with plans to increase its head count further after that.

Those first hires really matter because they are "going to go out and hire more people," he said.

He added that in some cases, he has tapped existing Harvey employees with local roots to lead new offices — like the company's head of Australia, who was born and raised there.

While larger AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic can outspend him, Weinberg said Harvey's edge comes from empowering leaders early.

"What we can do is we definitely promote junior talent, and you will have just way more ownership at our company," he said of the 350-person company.

"There are folks that have never managed people in their entire careers that are now managing 20 people," he added.

Some tech leaders have also echoed that it's wiser to work for startups over big companies.

Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham said on X last year that while working for big companies might be "safer," the connections forged with startup colleagues can cue up future success.

"In 10 years they'll be running everything," Graham wrote of startup employees, "even if the startup tanks."

Government officials from India and Nigeria both made statements on crypto today, but they took surprisingly different directions. Both explicitly acknowledged pros and cons, yet their speeches have many key differences.

India's Minister of Commerce and Industry focused on the negatives of Web3, although he alluded to a CBDC. Nigeria, meanwhile, is forming a Committee to profitably engage with this risky yet lucrative industry. 

As the Web3 industry keeps growing and growing, jurisdictions around the world are forced to grapple with the questions of crypto regulation. 

Today, two major regional economies, Nigeria and India, both saw high-level government officials make statements on crypto regulation, but they went in two different directions.

Piyush Goyal, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, made a few statements during trade negotiations in Doha, capital of Qatar. He claimed that India has not been encouraging the crypto industry, levying “very heavy” taxes on its users. 

Apparently, he instead alluded to launching an Indian CBDC:

“India has also announced that we will be coming out with a digital currency, which will be backed by a Reserve Bank of India guarantee. We don't encourage [crypto] because we don't want anybody to be stuck…with a [token] that has no backing and nobody at the backend,” Goyal claimed. 

It's a little unclear what he meant by this. Strictly speaking, India already has its own crypto, launching the digital rupee in 2022. However, this CBDC has been criticized for its lack of popular appeal, reaching a total circulation of $114.5 million after three years. 

This may seem impressive, but it really isn't for a country with over 1 billion people. To put this in perspective, India is a regional leader in terms of crypto adoption, with over $300 billion in on-chain transactions last year. $100 million is practically nothing compared to this. 

Goyal may be alluding to resurrecting the digital rupee, or he may be announcing a new project. Either way, his statements seemed overtly hostile. 

Nigeria, meanwhile, is no stranger to prominent crypto scams, but the nation still seems interested in friendly regulation. Abbas Tajudeen, Nigeria's Speaker of the House, recently inaugurated a Committee on cryptocurrency. 

Despite addressing fears of criminal activity, he gestured towards the industry's economic benefits:

“We have been entrusted with a task of national significance: to review the economic, regulatory and security implications of cryptocurrency. Across the world, financial systems are being reshaped by technology. In Nigeria, cryptocurrency and POS operations have grown rapidly, creating new opportunities for commerce, financial inclusion, and innovation,” Tajudeen said. 

In other words, although Tajudeen acknowledged the risks, he focused on the benefits that crypto has brought to Nigeria. So far, his nation's crypto industry is less developed than India's, but positive engagement may change this paradigm. 

This “reserved, yet bullish” perspective may prove more fruitful than begrudging participation.

It just goes to show, a successful Web3 industry takes a lot of work. It'll be interesting to see how India and Nigeria both evolve in the crypto space, if these government representatives have their say in policy implementation.

"Uptober," the wordplay on crypto's historically bullish month of October, is so far living up to its name as bitcoin BTC$124,704.72 pushed towards new all-time highs and altcoins also caught a bid.

After briefly spiking above $125,000 and retreating on Sunday, BTC followed through on Monday, surging to a fresh record of $126,223 during the U.S. trading session. BTC changed hands around $125,200 recently, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

While the dollar's weakness has helped the rally to new highs, the largest crypto now has clinched to new highs in euro terms crossing 106,000 EUR and surpassing its January peak, while breaking its mid-August peak in Swiss franc (99,642 CHF), TradingView data shows.

Bitcoin's strength extended across the crypto market. Ethereum's ether ETH$4,677.76 advanced 4% to hit $4,700, its strongest price in more than three weeks, leading the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index higher. Popular memecoin DOGE$0.2657 and the native token of layer-1 network BNB BNB$1,216.51, closely linked to exchange giant Binance, gained 6%-6%.

Crypto stocks posted mixed results on Monday, with retail trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) falling 3% after Galaxy Digital unveiled GalaxyOne, a new crypto trading platform that mirrors Robinhood's core offering. The announcement sent Galaxy Digital (GLXY) shares up 7%, as investors bet on the firm's move to compete directly in the crypto brokerage space.

Elsewhere, crypto-linked companies including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL) and Michael Saylor's parent company Strategy (MTSR) all closed roughly 2% higher. Their performance aligned with broader gains in the crypto market, where the CoinDesk 20 Index showed most cryptos saw modest upward moves.

The biggest gains came from mining stocks, which surged on news that OpenAI struck a deal to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of AI chips from AMD. The deal could give OpenAI up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker, a move that sent ripples through other AI-exposed sectors.

Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) each gained around 10%, driven by optimism around data center demand and possibly boosted further by bitcoin's rally earlier in the day.

Bitcoin's rally is "fueled by a perfect storm of macroeconomic tailwinds," said Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of Deribit, the options trading venue that was recently acquired by Coinbase (COIN).

The U.S. government shutdown is driving debasement trades into perceived hard assets such as gold and BTC, strong inflows into BTC ETFs coupled with dwindling spot supplies on exchanges are feeding a "self-reinforcing bull cycle," he said in a Monday update.

The technicals also point higher, he added, with BTC's double-bottom breakout pointing to short-term targets of $128,000–$130,000, with possible upside to $138,000. However, he also warned of currently overbought conditions, suggesting that a brief shakeout to $118,000–$120,000 remains possible.

"From here, watch for volatility spikes and any shift in put volume as a red flag for near-term corrections," Péquignot said. "Bulls have their eyes on $130K+, and bears might find opportunities in overbought squeezes."

Bitcoin's price hit new records Monday, as the so-called debasement trade has become more attractive. But Bitcoin mining company stocks rose even quicker, furthering sizable gains seen across the industry in recent weeks.

Top public companies in the mining space—including the Nasdaq-listed HIVE Digital, MARA, and CleanSpark—all shot up on Monday ahead of the closing bell.

HIVE Digital led the pack with a 25% jump to nearly $6 a share by the close of trading, with IREN up more than 14% on the day to $57.75.

MARA finished Monday priced at $21 per share after jumping more than 9%; CleanSpark rose by the same amount and was trading for $17. And Riot Platforms climbed nearly 11% on the day to $21.56.

Mining stocks are also becoming more attractive as companies look to high-powered computing to increase profits. Google last month announced it was backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher, giving Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher.

“Miners are winning because they're flexing optionality: power, infrastructure, AI revenue, and leveraged exposure to Bitcoin rallies, all packaged in stocks," Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher told Decrypt. "That's giving them an edge over crypto companies whose exposure is narrower or more operationally constrained."

Bratcher added that some miners are holding onto their mined BTC rather than selling it, giving them a benefit akin to crypto treasury firms, particularly as Bitcoin continues to rise.

"Investors are increasingly viewing miners not just as Bitcoin proxies, but as owners of scarce infrastructure: power contracts, land, grid access, and cooling capacity," said Bratcher. "When crypto is hot, that infrastructure becomes more valuable, especially if grid demand becomes tight.”

Bitcoin was recently up a little over 2% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko, after hitting a new all-time high of $126,080 earlier Monday. It had dropped down slightly to $125,191—still a 9.5% jump over the past week. 

U.S. investors last week plunged a record amount of investment into Bitcoin ETFs to get exposure to the biggest and oldest digital coin. Crypto investment products received $5.95 billion in fresh cash, with the most amount of money ever hitting Bitcoin funds in a single week: $3.55 billion in total.

A report from European asset manager CoinShares said that the lion's share of that investment was directed at Bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S.

Over the past seven days, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and an expected October interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve has led the price of Bitcoin, gold, and other cryptocurrencies and precious metals to rally.

Experts dub that kind of move the "debasement trade"—when investors try to hedge against weakening currencies and geopolitical headwinds.

The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against major world currencies, suffered its worst first half of the year since the early 1970s as President Donald Trump went full steam ahead with his trade war.

Switzerland's gambling regulator is looking into whether "right-to-buy" tokens sold by global soccer organizing body FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup tournament comply with rules that govern gambling, Bloomberg reported. No wrongdoing has been alleged.

Gespa is assessing whether the tokens, which can be bought, sold and traded on FIFA's non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, are gambling-like or represent conditional purchase rights. FIFA stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association.

The authority has not alleged wrongdoing nor had it received any reports of wrongdoing, and is gathering facts to determine whether any action is warranted, director Manuel Richard told Bloomberg on Monday.

According to FIFA's website, RTB tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that reserve a dedicated purchase window for a specific match. They aren't tickets, but they allow holders to buy tickets at face value if conditions are met. 

FIFA first rolled out “Right-to-Buy” (RTB) tokens for the World Cup Final in 2024, announcing 1,000 RTB opportunities for fans. Team-linked RTBs activate only if the chosen team qualifies, and they can be sold on the secondary market via FIFA's native marketplace powered by its Web3 partner, Modex.

For the 2026 World Cup hosted by the US, Canada,and Mexico, “Right to Final” tokens range from $299 to $999, depending on the team. Many tokens are already sold out, with prices determined by odds — long shots are cheaper, while favorites such as Argentina, Brazil and England are at the higher end. 

FIFA said RTBs were created to address extreme demand for tickets at specific matches and tournaments. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, for example, there were 3.4 million tickets available for around 23 million requests, according to FIFA.

Cointelegraph reached out to FIFA for comment, but had not received a response at time of publication.

FIFA's bet on NFT technology

NFTs are unique blockchain tokens that verify ownership and authenticity of a specific asset. While the wider NFT boom peaked in 2021–22, FIFA has continued using NFT technology for digital collectibles, ticket-access rights, and gaming.

Soccer's world governing federation first began experimenting with Web3 and NFTs back in 2022, when it announced plans to launch its native platform, FIFA Collect, on the Algorand blockchain.

In Dec. 2023, before the Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, FIFA and Modex launched 1,000 NFTs — 100 offering a chance to win tickets to the 2026 World Cup finals and 900 additional collectibles minted on Polygon.

FIFA also moved into Web3 gaming in 2024 with FIFA Rivals, built with Web3 gaming studio Mythical Games. The free-to-play mobile title that launched in June 2025 lets players run clubs, compete, and trade NFT player cards on the Mythos blockchain.

In May, FIFA decided to leave Algorand and migrate its NFT marketplace and collection to Avalanche, which it would use to power its own layer-1 blockchain.

Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect, said AvaCloud's EVM-compatible stack makes connecting FIFA Collect with mainstream wallets and DApps easier.

With an estimated fan base of over five billion globally, Avalanche Subnets will let FIFA run a dedicated, tunable chain that can be adjusted independently of the Avalanche network to handle event-driven surges, such as the World Cup.

San Francisco, CA – October 6, 2025 – Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: OPEN) shares experienced a significant surge today, with the stock jumping a remarkable 13.9% in afternoon trading and closing the day up 14.6%. This substantial uptick was ignited by a positive signal from CEO Kaz Nejatian, hinting at the iBuying giant's imminent foray into accepting cryptocurrency payments for home purchases. The announcement has sent a clear message to investors: Opendoor is positioning itself at the forefront of integrating digital assets into the mainstream real estate market, boosting investor confidence and setting the stage for a potential paradigm shift in property transactions.

The immediate implications of Nejatian's statement are profound. It signals not just a technological upgrade for Opendoor but a strategic pivot that could unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market for digital currencies in real estate. The market's enthusiastic reaction reflects a growing appetite for innovation in an industry traditionally slow to adapt. For Opendoor, this move could solidify its reputation as a forward-thinking leader, attracting a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially reshaping the competitive landscape for years to come.

The catalyst for today's market excitement was a concise yet impactful declaration from Opendoor's CEO, Kaz Nejatian. Responding to a query on X (formerly Twitter) about enabling home buying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets, Nejatian unequivocally stated, "We will. Just need to prioritize it." This brief message was enough to spark a buying frenzy, as investors quickly grasped the potential of a major real estate platform embracing digital currency transactions. The company's stock had already seen a remarkable year-to-date performance, skyrocketing over 415% higher in 2025, and this latest news further fueled its upward trajectory.

Opendoor's business model, centered on buying, renovating, and reselling homes directly, uniquely positions it to integrate crypto payments. The company plans to convert Bitcoin into U.S. dollars internally during property transactions, effectively shielding individual home sellers from the complexities and volatility of directly accepting digital assets. This approach simplifies compliance and mitigates risk for sellers, making crypto payments a more palatable option for a broader audience. Beyond the crypto announcement, Opendoor has been undergoing a broader transformation under Nejatian, shifting towards an "AI-first, agent-led" platform model dubbed "Key Connections," aimed at improving efficiency and generating higher-margin, capital-light revenue. While these operational improvements are expected to impact financials more significantly in 2026, the CEO's crypto signal on October 6, 2025, provided an immediate and strong boost to investor confidence, highlighting the company's commitment to innovation.

The market's initial reaction was distinctly bullish, characterized by a significant spike in trading volume for Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN). Traders and investors viewed the move as a crucial step towards the mainstream adoption of digital currencies, potentially unlocking a vast, untapped market for real estate transactions. This bold step by Opendoor accelerates the integration of Web3 technologies into everyday life, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in property ownership and exchange.

Opendoor's strategic embrace of cryptocurrency payments is poised to create distinct winners and losers across the real estate and financial sectors, redefining competitive dynamics and market opportunities.

Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN) itself stands as a primary beneficiary. By being an early mover among iBuyers to fully integrate crypto payments, it gains a significant competitive advantage. This move could attract a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers, particularly younger, digital-native generations (Millennials and Gen Z), who are looking to diversify their digital assets into tangible real estate. Opendoor's iBuyer model allows for seamless conversion of crypto to fiat, simplifying the process and mitigating volatility risks for sellers, thus enhancing its appeal and market share.

Beyond Opendoor, several other players are set to win. Cryptocurrency payment processors such as Bitpace, CoinsPaid, Propy, BitPay, WCT Pay, and PassimPay will likely see increased demand for their services. These companies provide the crucial infrastructure for crypto-to-fiat conversions and transaction management. Blockchain technology providers and cryptocurrency custodians (like Coinbase, which Opendoor may partner with) will also benefit from increased adoption and the need for secure digital asset storage and management. Furthermore, crypto-wealthy individuals and investors gain a more direct and efficient avenue to deploy their digital assets into the real estate market, offering diversification opportunities. Forward-thinking real estate developers and agents who embrace crypto payments can also expand their client base globally.

On the other hand, traditional financial institutions and real estate entities that are slow to adapt risk losing market share. Traditional banks and mortgage lenders that do not explore or adopt cryptocurrency integration in real estate may find themselves at a disadvantage as more efficient, crypto-backed alternatives emerge. Similarly, traditional real estate agents and brokerages resistant to technological shifts and crypto transactions might struggle to compete with tech-forward platforms. The inherent speed and efficiency of crypto payments could expose the inefficiencies of traditional, slower transaction methods, pressuring companies reliant on older systems to modernize or face obsolescence. The evolving regulatory landscape and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also pose risks, meaning companies that fail to manage these aspects effectively could face financial or legal challenges.

Opendoor's move to accept cryptocurrency payments is not an isolated event but a significant indicator of broader industry trends converging around the mainstreaming of digital assets and the integration of Web3 technologies into real estate. This decision aligns with the increasing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, with a growing number of investors recognizing their long-term value. Bitcoin, once primarily a speculative asset, is rapidly gaining traction as a viable medium of exchange, with platforms already facilitating multi-million dollar real estate transactions using digital currencies.

This initiative also propels the "Web3" movement in real estate, aiming to leverage blockchain technology for enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency in property transactions. Key aspects include the tokenization of real estate, where physical properties are converted into digital tokens, enabling fractional ownership and increasing liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Smart contracts are set to automate various real estate processes, reducing intermediaries and streamlining complex procedures. The use of decentralized ownership records on a blockchain promises tamper-proof property information, while DeFi (Decentralized Finance) integration could revolutionize real estate lending and borrowing. These advancements promise to lower transaction costs, increase security, and provide global accessibility to real estate investment.

The ripple effects on competitors like Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) and Zillow (NASDAQ: Z) could be substantial. As a major iBuyer, Opendoor's embrace of crypto sets a precedent, potentially compelling other large real estate companies to explore or fast-track their own digital asset strategies to remain competitive. This could spark a new wave of innovation across the proptech sector, driven by the pursuit of faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions, as well as access to a new demographic of crypto-savvy buyers.

However, the integration of cryptocurrency into real estate also presents a complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are grappling with establishing frameworks for taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection in the digital asset space. The IRS currently treats cryptocurrencies as property, which means crypto transactions can trigger capital gains taxes. Stringent AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings are essential to prevent illicit financial activities, as real estate has historically been a target for money laundering. Furthermore, consumer protection in crypto transactions, especially regarding escrow and the absence of traditional banking guarantees, necessitates robust third-party solutions. Legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act in the U.S. House, are underway to establish regulatory structures, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency has begun considering cryptocurrency as an asset for mortgage evaluations.

Historically, the real estate industry has been transformed by disruptive technologies, from the introduction of the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) to the rise of online marketplaces like Zillow and the iBuyer model itself, pioneered by companies like Opendoor. Each shift introduced superior attributes like efficiency, speed, or accessibility, ultimately reshaping the market. Opendoor's adoption of crypto payments is another such wave, promising faster settlements, reduced transaction costs, and increased global access, underscoring the imperative for traditional industries to adapt or risk being left behind.

Opendoor's commitment to integrating cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment, ushering in both short-term adjustments and long-term transformations for the company and the broader real estate market.

In the short term (October 2025 - mid-2027), Opendoor is poised to attract a niche market of crypto-rich buyers and investors, leveraging its iBuyer model to internally convert digital assets to fiat, thereby insulating sellers from volatility. An initial focus on widely recognized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins (e.g., USDC) is likely to mitigate risk. Strategic partnerships with established crypto custodians and payment processors will be crucial for building the necessary technical and financial infrastructure. This move also aligns with Opendoor's ongoing "AI-first, agent-led" pivot, enhancing its technology-driven efficiency and potentially bolstering offerings like its "Key Agent" app. However, navigating the still-evolving regulatory landscape will be a significant challenge, requiring careful compliance and adaptation.

Looking further ahead (beyond mid-2027), Opendoor's crypto adoption could lead to more profound changes. Enhanced liquidity and global accessibility, facilitated by faster cross-border transactions and lower fees, could significantly expand Opendoor's market reach, particularly with international buyers. The company might eventually explore tokenized real estate, dividing property ownership into digital tokens for fractional ownership and broader investor access. The development of crypto-backed financial products, such as mortgages or lending where digital assets serve as collateral, could attract a new segment of buyers. Ultimately, successful integration could establish Opendoor as a leader in crypto-enabled real estate, driving down transaction costs and increasing security through blockchain technology, thereby compelling competitors to follow suit.

Market opportunities include tapping into new buyer demographics (tech-savvy Millennials, Gen Z, and international investors), increasing transaction speed and efficiency, and spurring innovation in real estate finance. However, significant challenges persist, including the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies, ongoing regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions, and consumer distrust or education gaps. The complexity of integrating blockchain technology with legacy systems and the tax implications of crypto transactions will also require robust solutions. Despite growing interest, the mainstream adoption of crypto in real estate is still nascent, with many sellers preferring traditional fiat transactions dueposing a barrier to widespread acceptance.

Potential scenarios range from gradual integration and niche success, where Opendoor gains a competitive edge with tech-savvy buyers but broader adoption remains slow due to regulatory hurdles, to a transformative disruption where Opendoor becomes a catalyst for widespread crypto adoption, leading to integral blockchain use in property registries and financing. A third scenario involves significant hurdles, where volatility, regulatory complexities, and consumer distrust limit the impact of crypto payments on Opendoor's transaction volume. Given the current date, October 6, 2025, and the recent nature of the CEO's comments, the market is in an anticipatory phase. Opendoor's execution, the evolution of crypto regulation, and broader market acceptance will determine the long-term trajectory.

Opendoor's (NASDAQ: OPEN) bold announcement regarding cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment for the real estate industry, signaling a decisive step into the digital asset era. The significant stock jump on October 6, 2025, underscores investor confidence in CEO Kaz Nejatian's vision to integrate cutting-edge technology into traditional property transactions. This move is more than just a new payment option; it's a strategic embrace of Web3 principles, promising enhanced efficiency, security, and global accessibility for home buying and selling.

The key takeaway is that Opendoor is positioning itself as an innovator, aiming to capture a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially redefine the competitive landscape. While the path ahead is fraught with challenges—including navigating regulatory complexities, managing crypto volatility, and overcoming consumer skepticism—the potential rewards are immense. Opendoor's internal conversion mechanism for crypto to fiat offers a smart solution to mitigate risks for sellers, making the process more palatable for mainstream adoption.

Moving forward, the market will be keenly watching several developments. Investors should monitor Opendoor's progress in implementing its crypto payment system, including details on which cryptocurrencies will be accepted, the underlying technological infrastructure, and initial transaction volumes. The evolution of cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning real estate transactions, will also be critical. Any clarity or new frameworks from government bodies could either accelerate or hinder widespread adoption. Finally, observing the reactions and strategies of Opendoor's competitors, such as Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) and Zillow (NASDAQ: Z), will indicate how quickly the rest of the industry adapts to this digital frontier. Opendoor's digital leap has irrevocably altered the market's trajectory, and its lasting impact will be measured by its ability to turn this ambitious vision into a seamless reality for homebuyers and sellers alike.

While the United States has turned away from the concept of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), other jurisdictions, such as Europe and China, have embraced it. As has been reported, a digital Euro is in the works with the European Central Bank (ECB) targeting a potential rollout for mid-2029. China has already been testing a digital Yuan live and in the wild.

However, while some European policymakers view a CBDC as beneficial for the European Union (EU) and its citizens, some are expressing concerns about the potential for abuse, including privacy concerns and government intervention. While declarations of commitment not to abuse a digital Euro have been issued by public authorities, concerns persist as governments can change their minds, as the allure of insight and control is simply too strong to resist for a central authority.

On X, Wide Awake Media, an account with over 800,000 followers, has posted a dystopian video about a future where CBDCs are part of a government that seeks authoritarian control by controlling bank accounts and behavior, enabled by CBDCs and digital IDs. It is a scary presentation where a social score guides your existence.

 

 

A glimpse into the kind of nightmarish dystopian future we're sleepwalking into if we ever allow digital ID, CBDCs, social credit scores and personal carbon allowances to get off the ground.pic.twitter.com/WFkg1pOXyh

— Wide Awake Media (@wideawake_media) October 3, 2025



Another commentator, @newstart_2024, who goes by the name Camus, with over 355,000 followers, shares an actual video from the World Economic Forum where the speaker discusses how central governments can use digital currency to guide behavior in an Orwellian example of social engineering. The speaker discusses CBDCs as a conduit for implementing economic policies.

 

They are no longer hiding their plans.

A WEF panelist just laid bare the true, dystopian purpose of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

He admits, on stage, that this isn't about “convenience.” It's about control.

Here's what he's really saying:

Founded in 2023, Resist CBDC pitches its mission as being anti-communist, anti fascist, advocating for being a liberty maximalist. Resist CBDC, with 71,000 followers on X, states that a CBDC is a “global surveillance industrial complex.” The account attacks the “system of surveillance and control,” which is aided by a Digital ID and CBDC.

 

“The digital Euro is on the move”

Christine Lagarde – ECB

“All European intuitions will be involved to make sure that Europe is equipped with the currency of the future … cash and ‘digital cash'.”

October and the CBDC are here. Will you adopt – or will you resist? pic.twitter.com/kPfd5RFlAP

— Resist CBDC (@Resist_CBDC) October 6, 2025



Lagarde, President of the ECB, explains that European citizens will have the choice between cash and digital currency, and both will be easy to use. Lagarde sees the development of a digital Euro as strategically important to the EU. She recently expressed her frustration with the lack of progress on the digital Euro while stating that privately issued stablecoins may risk eroding the power of central banks. Lagarde commented on stablecoins that “I think it risks undermining our capacity to conduct monetary policy.”

Resist CBDC says that a “CBDC is not a ‘digital version of cash. It's a permissioned coupon with purchase restrictions, travel limits, and an expiration date. Combined with Digital, ID becomes a Social Credit System.”

The account also quotes Klaus Schwab, former head of the World Economic Forum, who left the group following allegations of impropriety, as citing China as the model. The WEF has touted China's development of a digital Yuan (e-CNY). The digital Yuan is said to have “controllable anonymity,” as a central bank can access transaction information for regulatory purposes or to deal with illicit activities (whatever that means). It has been noted that a digital Yuan can also be set to expire, thus leveraging it to drive stimulus or other economic objectives.

The US, with the enactment of the GENIUS Act, set out parameters for private issuers of “payment stablecoins.” These digital assets must hold one-to-one reserves in safe assets, such as US Treasuries. While not without risks of privacy breaches, this requirement creates an arms-length relationship with digital dollar issuers. A retail CBDC issued by the US Federal Reserve appears to be dead on arrival.

Several US states have taken it further; Florida, one of the fastest-growing state economies and the fastest-growing by population, has a law that bans CBDCs. In 2023, legislation was signed into law that prohibits the use of any federally issued CBDC within the state. The governor and the state legislature expressed concerns regarding government surveillance and control over financial transactions, which suited the liberty-minded population of Florida. Other states soon followed Florida's example.

The widely popular Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently commented on X that the UK's push for a digital ID and potential for abuse is unraveling.  There is an uproar in the UK over the issuance of a Digital ID, with a petition against the policy garnering over 2.8 million signatures, as both conservatives and some leftists slam the policy.

DeSantis stated:

“Telltale sign that the Digital ID push in the UK is backfiring… They want more control (and to layer a CBDC over it), and the people are rejecting it.”

This past week, the Bank of England softened its stance on stablecoins in response to public pressure and market-driven demand.

Meanwhile, large jurisdictions such as China and the European Union, along with several other countries including Russia, India, and Brazil, are moving forward with plans for a CBDC.

ARK Invest, the asset management firm led by CEO Cathie Wood, is leaning into the tokenization boom by taking a stake in tokenization specialist Securitize as Wall Street races to bring assets onchain.

The ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), ARK's closed-end, actively managed fund that invests in public and private companies, held 3.25% of its assets in Securitize, making the firm the fund's eighth largest position following artificial intelligence (AI) companies X.AI and Anthropic, according to the fund's latest disclosure dated September 30.

Based on the fund's $325.3 million in net assets under management as of September 30, Ark's stake in Securitize should be valued at roughly $10 million, according to CoinDesk's calculation.

ARK's investment comes as tokenization emerges as one of the hottest trends in crypto, bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and stocks onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization to cut settlement times, broaden investor access and keep markets open around the clock. 

It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market has grown 112% to $33 billion year-to-date, RWA.xyz data shows, and could swell to $18.9 trillion by 2033, Ripple and BCG projected earlier this year.

Securitize, founded in 2017 and led by CEO Carlos Domingo, is one of the early pioneers of the tokenization space. It issued $4.6 billion in tokenized assets working with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and Apollo. It is also known as the issuer behind BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that's leading the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector with $2.8 billion in assets. 

The firm is also active in equity tokenization, creating on-chain shares of listed wallet provider Exodus in 2022 and entering into an agreement with ether ETH$4,005.03 treasury firm FG Nexus (FGNX) to introduce its common and preferred stock to the Ethereum blockchain.

Ark's investment follows Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year, led by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane (HLNE), with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets (TW) also participating.

	A federal judge recently dismissed a class action lawsuit that alleged Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Apt Yacht Club collection of NFTs, colluded with several celebrities to inflate the prices of its products.


	On October 1, US District Judge Fernando Olguin found the plaintiffs Adonis Real and Adam Titcher failed to show that the digital assets created by Yuga Labs, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and cryptocurrency ApeCoin, were securities. The judge's ruling was first reported by the Courthouse News Service last week.

	The Bored Ape Yacht Club was among the most successful NFT collections, with celebrity endorsements from Justin Bieber, Madonna, Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry, as well as media personality and businesswoman Paris Hilton.


	Real and Titcher filed the class action lawsuit in 2022, claiming that six types of digital assets sold by Yuga Labs are unregistered securities and the celebrities who promoted Yuga Labs' products violated federal and state securities laws. The lawsuit also alleged that Yuga Labs colluded with talent agent Guy Oseary and MoonPay, a platform used to buy and sell cryptocurrency, in order to misleadingly promote and sell the NFTs and cryptocurrencies.


	In addition to Bieber, Madonna, Curry, and Hilton, the lawsuit's list of defendants also included Mike Winkelmann (the American digital artist known as “Beeple“), Reddit founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, NFT collector Amy Wu, Adidas America, Inc., as well as Sotheby's.


	Judge Olguin found that Yuga Labs' products did not meet the Howey test, a legal framework created by the Supreme Court which requires “1) an investment of money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others” in order to label something a security.


	However, the judge did side with Real and Titcher on the issue of whether the profits from the Yuga Labs digital assets would come from the efforts of others.


	“In short, despite satisfying this sub-prong, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the other Howey prongs and therefore fail to allege that any, some, or all of defendants' digital assets are a security,” Judge Olguin wrote.


	Plaintiffs Real and Titcher have until October 10 to file a third amended complaint.




	Representatives for Yuga Labs declined to comment to Courthouse News Service, and representatives for Real and Titcher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oops, something went wrong

Gold (GC=F), silver (SI=F), and bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Monday as investors sought a hedge against rising debt and political uncertainty in developed markets.

Gold futures (GC=F) neared $4,000 per troy ounce on Monday to touch a fresh record, while silver futures (SI=F) also jumped to $48.50 per ounce, less than two dollars away from a 1980 intraday high. Meanwhile, bitcoin jumped about 2% to touch a fresh record north of $125,790 per token.

The market action highlighted the so-called "debasement trade," which refers to investors shifting into assets to guard against what they see as the erosion of fiat currencies' value from inflation, heavy government spending, and mounting debt financed by money creation.

Over the weekend, JPMorgan analysts noted the rise in precious metals and cryptocurrencies against the backdrop of what they called “dollar debasement.” The US dollar index (DX.Y.NYB) is down more than 9% year to date.

Meanwhile, fiscal uncertainty in some developed markets has driven a flight to safe-haven assets. In an unexpected election outcome in Japan over the weekend, Sanae Takaichi was set to become the country's next prime minister. Market analysts view Takaichi as a "fiscal dove," supporting government stimulus to grow the economy.

Takaichi's election indicates "how much of the developed world is pivoting into a 'Run It Hot' fiscal dominance framework, carrying monster deficits in order to try and outgrow debt," Nomura Securities analyst Charlie McElligott said in a note on Monday morning.

"Accordingly, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin are again simultaneously moving to fresh ATH's as the chief winners in this latest escalation of the ... 'Debasement Trade,' alongside equities then too ripping to record highs as well," he added.

Gold and silver have surged more than 50% and 60% year to date, respectively, as expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted the appeal of metals, which tend to perform better when interest rates are lower.

Meanwhile, bitcoin is up roughly 33% year to date as the world's largest cryptocurrency kicked off October, its seasonally strongest month of the year, soaring from $118,000 to $125,000 over the past week.

"The ongoing US government shutdown has amplified Bitcoin's safe haven narrative, with investors increasingly rotating from U.S. related assets like treasuries into assets seen as resilient to political dysfunction and inflationary pressure," Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR, said in a note.

Wall Street sees further gains for the crypto space as stablecoin issuance sends native tokens for blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) higher.

"I believe that the next wave of crypto adoption will come from stablecoin adoption. And that's going to be very positive for crypto overall," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, told Yahoo Finance last week. "This is a trend that might take six months to one year to start to reflect on prices."

Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) are up 115% since the company's IPO in June. Related stocks have also been on a tear in recent weeks. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is up 295% year to date, while Coinbase (COIN) is also up 56% since the start of the year, off its all-time high from July.

Gespa, Switzerland's gambling authority, has begun a preliminary probe into FIFA's new “Right-to-Buy” blockchain collectibles, aiming to determine whether  the soccer governing body has complied with local gambling laws, according to a report from Bloomberg. 

The “right-to-buy” (RTB) collectibles, offered via the FIFA Collect platform, provide users the option to purchase tickets to the upcoming 2026 World Cup to be hosted in North America. The collectibles are initially sold directly by FIFA, but can be resold on the secondary marketplace. 

“Our mission is to bring fans closer to the game they love. By introducing Right-To-Buy on FIFA Collect, we are offering supporters a new and more direct way to be part of FIFA World Cup 26™, turning digital collectibles into real-world opportunities,” said Modex Technologies Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lorenzon at the time of RTB launch in late September. 

Modex is FIFA's exclusive partner and collaborator on its digital collectibles platform. 

According to statements gathered by Bloomberg, Gespa is performing further fact-finding to determine whether or not any regulatory action is necessary. 

FIFA Collect users can find RTB collectibles in surprise packs or purchased directly from the secondary marketplace, with current prices for the option to buy one ticket to a match game in Houston for $149, more than $1,200 for the right to buy tickets to Canada's first match, and as much as $7,000 for the right to buy opening tickets to the first match at Mexico's Azteca Stadium. 

Holding the collectible ensures users are not subject to the general queue of ticket buyers when tickets go live. However, they will still need to pay for the tickets to their respective match, as the collectible merely provides the option to purchase. 

Official tickets to the World Cup are being sold in phases, with the Visa Early Presale taking place in mid-September. The next phase will occur at the end of October, with other draws and sales taking place throughthe end of the tournament. 

A selection of tickets have been set aside specifically for FIFA Collect users. 

FIFA Collect was originally developed on Algorand in 2022, but earlier this year FIFA announced its departure from the proof-of-stake blockchain. 

In May, it announced it would build its own Avalanche layer-1 network to power its platform, enhancing the digital collecting and “immersive fan experiences” it could provide. 

Representatives for Gespa and FIFA Collect did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) hit another record Monday after climbing above the closely watched $125,000 level over the weekend for the first time ever.


 The largest cryptocurrency by market value has rallied as appetite for risk remains strong and as investors use bitcoin (and gold) to hedge their bets against geopolitical uncertainty and high government debt, in what JP Morgan analysts have referred to as the "debasement trade." A growing pool of traders is also buying tokens as more crypto ETFs are launched and cryptocurrencies  become more integrated into financial services. Last week, bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $3.2 billion, the second-highest haul since they launched in January 2024.


 Bitcoin's price has soared 34% since the start of the year, outpacing major stock indexes, but trailing safe-haven gold's 50% return over the same period. The digital currency was trading at $125,500 recently, after hitting an all-time high today of around $125,800.


 Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin's weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out major price levels worth watching out for.


 Bitcoin broke out from a two-month descending channel last week, potentially setting the stage for a continuation move to the upside.


 Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum and sits well below its December peak, providing ample room for the cryptocurrency to move further into price discovery before consolidating.


 Let's forecast how a new move higher might look on bitcoin's chart and also identify major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns.


 Investors can use bars pattern analysis to forecast where bitcoin's trend may be headed next if a new move higher plays out.


 To apply the analysis, we take the uptrend comprising the bars from late April to mid-July and overlay them from the low of last week's breakout bar. This projects a potential bullish move to around $160,000 over a 12-week period if a similar trend occurs on the chart.


 It's worth noting that this earlier trend commenced following a 10% weekly advance from a prior descending channel on the chart, similar in size to last week's breakout from the recent pattern.


 During pullbacks, investors should initially monitor the $107,000 level. This area, currently situated just above the 50-week moving average, could attract buying interest around last month's low and prominent highs that formed on the chart in December and January.


 Selling below this level could see the cryptocurrency's prices test support near $92,000. Investors may look for entry points in this location close to a period of consolidation that developed on chart just below the December and January peaks.


 Finally, a more significant correction in bitcoin's price could trigger a decline to the $74,000 level. The cryptocurrency's price finds a confluence of support in this region from the prominent March 2024 peak and this year's notable April trough.

AtomOne (ATONE) emerged as a community-driven fork of the Cosmos Hub, created after disputes over governance and validator dominance. Its goal is to restore decentralization through a minimal IBC/ICS hub, a written constitution, and a dual-token system that separates governance (ATONE) from transaction utility.

While AtomOne trades near $1.60 with rising volume, its influence comes less from price action and more from its disruptive architecture. XRP Tundra is drawing comparisons for similar reasons. Instead of reinventing Cosmos governance, it introduces a dual-chain model across Solana and XRPL, while giving presale buyers fixed launch prices, staking rights, and audited security guarantees.

AtomOne's core disruption lies in its constitution and governance model. It rejects delegation-heavy voting, empowers individual stakers, and isolates fee volatility from staking security with its two-token design. The project also embraces Interchain Security, promising resilience as a hub that minimizes complexity while maximizing decentralization.

XRP Tundra is not a governance fork, but the logic is similar: create structural separation in token roles to ensure both utility and stability. Where AtomOne splits governance and fees, Tundra splits yield and governance across chains.



Each presale entry gives investors two assets: TUNDRA-S, a Solana-based utility/yield token, and TUNDRA-X, an XRPL governance/reserve token. In Phase 5, TUNDRA-S costs $0.091, buyers receive a 15% bonus, and free TUNDRA-X allocations valued at $0.0455. Launch prices are fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X.

That fixed model echoes AtomOne's separation of functions: governance stability paired with yield capacity. For presale buyers, it also creates measurable ROI. A $500 entry translates into thousands of tokens whose listing value is already defined.

Where AtomOne promotes legitimacy through constitutional governance, Tundra delivers assurance through third-party validation. Its contracts and tokenomics have been audited by Cyberscope, Solidproof, and Freshcoins. Team identity has been verified via Vital Block KYC, with certification published openly.

These steps anchor investor confidence. For a presale environment often criticized for opacity, Tundra's willingness to submit to multiple audits and disclose team credentials is a defining advantage.

AtomOne's innovation is governance, but it does not reward external participants with yield beyond staking ATONE. Tundra expands the value proposition with Cryo Vaults for XRP holders. Vaults lock XRP from 7 to 90 days, with APY boosted via Frost Keys, NFT multipliers that can shorten lock-ups or enhance payouts. Maximum returns reach 30% annually.



Staking is not yet live, but presale participants secure vault slots in advance. This mirrors AtomOne's governance inclusivity: early contributors shape the system's benefits long before broad adoption.

AtomOne minimized governance risk by simplifying its hub role. Tundra minimizes launch risk through Meteora's DAMM V2 pools. Dynamic fees start high (around 50%) and decrease over time, making dumping and bot activity costly. Liquidity positions are NFT-based, giving providers flexibility, while permanent lock options guarantee depth.

Trading fees are redirected into Cryo Vault staking, meaning trading activity funds long-term rewards. This ensures that early volatility reinforces, rather than undermines, investor confidence.

AtomOne's disruption lies in governance reform across the Cosmos ecosystem. XRP Tundra's disruption lies in presale economics: dual tokens across chains, fixed launch valuations, staking rights, and independently verified oversight. Both projects signal that structural innovation — not meme hype — defines the next wave of crypto adoption.

Independent commentators, such as Crypto Goat, frame Tundra's presale as a rare chance to replicate AtomOne-level disruption but with multipliers locked in from the start.



AtomOne's constitution shows how governance innovation can shape ecosystems. XRP Tundra offers investors their own disruptive pathway: Solana + XRPL integration, dual tokens, yield, and fixed multipliers backed by audits and KYC. With Phase 5 allocations nearly exhausted, the presale window is closing fast.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) published its semi annual progress report on the adoption of DLT in capital markets. The report highlights the strong growth in US-led sectors such as stablecoins, repo and tokenized money market funds. By contrast, the report shows a decline in fixed income issuance, especially bonds, and attributes this to the Eurosystem's wholesale DLT settlement trials that ended in November 2024. The trials had accounted for almost a third of 2024's figures. 

Several participants in the European settlement trials were hoping that the European Central Bank would allow the trials to roll on in order to maintain momentum. That didn't happen, although the central bank has announced that Project Pontes will launch in a pilot phase in late 2026, with other trials possible before then. 

Total fixed income issuance was €3.25 billion ($3.8bn) in 2024 according to AFME figures, dropping to €1.7 billion ($2bn) for the first three quarters of 2025. The number of issuances  has declined from 55 to 24 during the same periods.

Oops, something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm, announced Monday that it boosted its total ETH holdings to $13 billion with a sizable purchase last week.

The company acquired 179,251 ETH over the last week, or about $823 million worth at the current price. The firm now holds 2.83 million ETH, valued at around $13 billion as of this writing.

In addition to its ETH treasury, BitMine holds 192 Bitcoin (nearly $24 million worth), a $113 million stake in Eightco Holdings, and cash holdings of $456 million. Its ETH was acquired at an average price of $4,535 per token, or below Ethereum's current price of $4,625. The price of ETH has jumped by nearly 13% over the last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGekco.

BitMine holds the world's largest Ethereum treasury, ranking well ahead of runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which has amassed approximately $3.85 billion worth of ETH. Overall, BitMine is the second-largest crypto treasury behind Bitcoin giant Strategy with $80 billion in BTC.

The price of BMNR shares rose Monday morning following the news, currently up more than 5% to a price of $59.78. BitMine's stock has climbed 37% over the last month, according to data from Yahoo Finance.

In a press release, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee highlighted the company's strategic focus following meetings at Token2049 in Singapore.

“The BitMine team sat down with Ethereum core developers and key ecosystem players and it is clear the community is focused on enabling Wall Street and AI to build the future on Ethereum,” he said. “We remain confident that the two supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto.”

The 7 Largest Publicly Traded Ethereum Treasury Firms

Myriad users are broadly optimistic that BitMine will hold 3 million ETH by October 27, predicting a more than 86% likelihood as of this writing. The mark is up about 2% on the day. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Bitwise's CEO, Matt Hougan, believes that ‘Solana is the new Wall Street', as the ecosystem is quickly becoming an investor favorite for tokenization and stablecoin-related activity.

The statement came during a discussion with Akshay Rajan from Solana Labs, during which Hougan also said that:

And then they (people) wanna ask how they invest. […] And when they evaluate the different blockchains, the speed, the throughput, the finality of Solana makes it seem extraordinarily attractive.

—Matt Hougan, Official interview

For Hougan, Solana's biggest selling point is its unmatched finality speed, set between 400 microseconds and 150 microseconds. This alone makes the Solana ecosystem the best option for institutional investors, who often demand high throughput and ultra-fast finality.

This optimism seeps into top altcoins, too, with fresh contenders like Snorter Token's ($SNORT) experiencing a surge in investor interest in its bid to make meme coin hunting both fun and lucrative.

Solana is already looking bullish for Q4 2025, with several factors contributing to the increase in investor confidence and participation.

The upcoming ETF list awaiting SEC approval is the most impactful one, especially with Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas placing the approval odds at 100%.

But $SOL is also gaining massive ground thanks to Solana's increased appeal to investors. CoinGecko's list of the top Solana treasuries is quite telling in this sense.

The last 30 days have been highly fruitful for the ecosystem, with over $1.7B worth of $SOL moving into treasuries like Forward Industries, DeFi Development, and Upexi.

Forward Industries alone has invested over $1.5B in $SOL, purchasing 6,822,000 tokens, or 1.251% of the total supply.

These factors put $SOL on an upward trajectory for 2025's Q4, which could give us a new ATH by the end of October.

Snorter Token's ($SNORT) Snorter Bot makes coin hunting fun again. This is thanks to its fast reaction speed, ensuring early entry and profit maxing, and its native scam detectors, which ward off suspicious projects.

Snorter Bot automated trading to help retail traders snipe the best coins, safely and effortlessly, before the bots and whales scoop up all the liquidity.

Here are several features that recommend it as an essential trading companion



The Copy Trading feature is a valuable addition, catering to novice traders who need assistance in devising a successful strategy.

The presale has been growing fast since its inception, reaching $4.3M so far, with $SNORT valued at $0.1071.

If you want to invest, this is the best time to do it, as October rolls out and the market's movements promise fat ROIs.

Such a performance would qualify $SNORT as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now, with massive returns expected once it hits the mainstream. The Snorter Token presale just entered its final 14 days, so this may be your last chance to get in before launch.

 Grayscale became the first US crypto fund issuer to feature staking for its Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded products. 

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has introduced staking for its exchange-traded products (ETPs), becoming the first US-based crypto fund issuer to offer staking-based passive income opportunities.

Grayscale said on Monday its Ether (ETH) ETFs — the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) — are now the first US-listed spot crypto funds to offer staking, calling the development “another first-mover milestone.”

Grayscale's Solana (SOL) fund, the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), has also enabled staking and is awaiting regulatory approval for uplisting to an ETP, which would make it one of the first spot Solana ETPs to enable staking, according to the company's Monday X post.

By enabling staking across its Ethereum and Solana products, Grayscale said it aims to give investors exposure to the “long-term value accrual of these networks while maintaining the funds' core objectives.”

“Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver,” said Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors.”

Both ETHE and ETH are exchange-traded products registered under the Securities Act of 1933, not the Investment Company Act of 1940, the latter being the regulatory framework used for traditional mutual funds. 

This makes them structurally different from ETFs governed by the 1940 Act, though they follow the same legal framework used for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether ETFs.

“ETHE and ETH hold digital assets; however, an investment in ETHE and ETH is not a direct investment in digital assets,” Grayscale said.

Grayscale said it will stake via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers and that investors can access the products through standard brokerage accounts

Grayscale reported about $35 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30.

The news comes as the industry awaits US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory approval of the first US-listed Ether staking ETFs.

The approval of the first Ether staking ETF may bring significant new institutional capital for the crypto industry, according to 10x Research's head of research, Markus Thielen.

“This would mark a monumental structural shift in how institutional capital flows into Ethereum, unlocking a new era of yield-driven participation,” Thielen told Cointelegraph.

The development comes three months after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF debuted on the Cboe BZX Exchange, recording $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in inflows on its opening day, Cointelegraph reported on July 3.

Rex-Osprey's fund was the first to launch a Solana staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows crypto ETFs to hold the majority of their spot assets directly and distribute staking rewards where applicable.

More broadly, spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs in the US have been approved through exchange rule filings (Rule 19b-4) and Securities Act registration, not under the 1940 Act. The SEC has also recently permitted in-kind creations and redemptions for some crypto ETPs.

Network Outperformance: This growth outpaced the 16% increase in Bitcoin network difficulty (from 130 trillion to 151 trillion ("T")). These figures are publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.

Record Production: Despite consecutive all-time high Bitcoin network difficulty, HIVE mined 267 BTC in September - a year-to-date high - underscoring its operational strength.

As of today, HIVE's global Bitcoin mining fleet totals 21.8 EH/s, powered entirely by renewable hydroelectric energy. With additional ASICs scheduled to come online in October, HIVE remains on track to scale to 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving, at an average efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.

Management Commentary

Frank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented:

"HIVE's September milestones demonstrate the power of a focused, dual-engine strategy as our global Bitcoin mining fleet now produces over 9 BTC per day. Our executive team was in Paraguay last month and Gabriel Lamas, HIVE's Country President, is doing an outstanding job while Phase 3 Valenzuela continues to advance ahead of schedule. At the same time, BUZZ HPC, under Craig Tavares' leadership, is expanding our AI cloud capabilities and forming strategic partnerships with Bell Canada, Dell Canada, VAST Data and other leading AI companies in Canada to broaden access to enterprise-scale compute. HIVE is a unique Canadian data center company that only sources green hydroelectric energy to power its operations.  With data centers spanning 9 time zones, across Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, we've built a truly global footprint that reflects our commitment to sustainability, capital efficiency, and long-term value creation."

Aydin Kilic, President & CEO, added:

"With construction substantially complete at our Phase 3, 100 MW site in Valenzuela, approximately 50% of the hashrate capacity is now online, with commissioning of the remaining hydro containers well underway. The next wave of ASICs is set for installation next week, keeping us on track for 25 EH/s by American Thanksgiving.  With disciplined energy management and optimized fleet efficiency, our current 9 BTC/day production (at Bitcoin network difficulty of 151T) demonstrates the resilience of our Paraguay-based engineering and technical teams.  As we approach the successful completion of our targets for 2025, HIVE looks ahead to further expansion in global operations for 2026, with our cash flow from the Bitcoin mining business providing funding and growth for our HPC and GPU AI cloud business. As stewards of capital, our goal is to lead the sector in ROIC to provide value for our shareholders. We are always looking for long-term accretive opportunities, and we believe increased sustainable cash flow is the key to long-term success in these industries."

Future Production and Economics

As previously disclosed, all ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded and have shipped.  HIVE expects future growth to follow the economics of its Paraguay operations.  Each additional exahash increases daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable with fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal labor increases.  Power expenses scale with machine usage and align with current cost structures.  Results may vary depending on network difficulty and Bitcoin prices.

This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to three scientists for discovering a class of immune cells that help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. 

Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, Fred Ramsdell, a scientific adviser at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in Bainbridge Island, Washington, and immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, will share the prize of 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million) “for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.

Drug companies flock to supercharged T-cells in fight against autoimmune disease

The trio “have provided fundamental knowledge of how the immune system is regulated”, said Nobel committee member Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference announcing the prize. Their discoveries help to explain “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”. 

The findings led to the development of a range of therapies for autoimmune diseases that are now in early clinical development, says Samantha Bucktrout, an immunologist at Greywolf Therapeutics in Oxford, UK, who has previously worked with Ramsdell. 

“If it wasn't for these initial findings — and all of this whole field that these individuals started — we would never be at this place now where we can talk about cures,” she says. Autoimmune conditions — which include type 1 diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis — affect around one in ten people1.

White blood cells called T cells play a crucial part in the body's immune system by attacking infected or cancerous cells. But in 1995, Sakaguchi and his colleagues discovered a previously unknown subtype of T cells — called regulatory T cells2. These rare cells serve as crucial brake on the immune system — suppressing it and preventing it from over-reacting. Bucktrout likens the cells to an elite police force that represent only 1–2% of all T cells, but are highly effective at “keeping everyone in order”. At the site of immune reaction in the body they arrive and “shut the whole thing down”, she says. “They really mop everything up and dampen inflammation very effectively.”

In experiments using a marker for regulatory T cells, Sakaguchi showed that mice lacking these cells developed autoimmune conditions of the thyroid, pancreas and other organs, and that giving the animals a solution containing regulatory T cells stopped disease progression. Scientists had suspected that the immune system contained its own built-in brake for decades, but had not been able to prove it.

This discovery allowed researchers to isolate and work on regulatory T cells for the first time, and other research teams began to identify different types of regulatory T cell with different kinds of immune-suppressing properties. 

Later, in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered3 a mutation in the gene Foxp3 that caused fatal autoimmune disease in mice. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene caused a rare genetic autoimmune disease4. “It was really a molecular slog to get to that exact mutation, because it was just a very small genetic alteration that results in quite a profound change in the immune system,” said Brunkow in a telephone interview shortly after the prize announcement. “It takes a bunch of different brains all working on it together.” 

In 2003, follow-up studies by Sakaguchi and his colleagues showed that Foxp3 is specifically expressed in regulatory T cells and is required for their development5.

The work “really changed our view of a lot of conditions and is still changing our view”, says Anne Pesenacker, an immunologist at University College London. The discovery of regulatory T cells, and the markers to identify them, “has helped us so much to understand autoimmunity”, she says. “We're starting to look at can we boost this regulation.”

Studies have found that people with some autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, often have too few regulatory T cells in their blood or ones that do not function properly. And even early experiments on mice showed that there was potential to use regulatory T cells in treatments for such conditions, says Pesenacker.

Artificial intelligence models are starting to succeed in science. In the past two years, they have demonstrated that they can analyse data, design experiments and even come up with new hypotheses. The pace of progress has some researchers convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) could compete with science's greatest minds in the next few decades. 

ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI

ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI

In 2016, Hiroaki Kitano, a biologist and chief executive at Sony AI, challenged researchers to accomplish just that: to develop an AI system so advanced that it could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel prize. Calling it the Nobel Turing Challenge, Kitano presented the endeavour as the grand challenge for AI in science1. A machine wins if it can achieve a discovery on a par with top-level human research. 

That's not something current models can do. But by 2050, the Nobel Turing Challenge envisions an AI system that, without human intervention, combines the skills of hypothesis generation, experimental planning and data analysis to make a breakthrough worthy of a Nobel prize.

It might not even take until 2050. Ross King, a chemical-engineering researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an organizer of the challenge, thinks such an ‘AI scientist' might rise to laureate status even sooner. “I think it's almost certain that AI systems will get good enough to win Nobel prizes,” he says. “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.”



But many researchers don't see how current AI systems, which are trained to generate strings of words and ideas on the basis of humankind's existing pool of knowledge, could contribute fresh insights. Accomplishing such a feat might demand drastic changes in how researchers develop AI and what AI funding goes towards. “If tomorrow, you saw a government programme invest a billion dollars in fundamental research, I think it would advance much faster,” says Yolanda Gil, an AI researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Others warn that there are looming risks to introducing AI into the research pipeline2.

The Nobel prizes were created to honour those who “have conferred the greatest benefit” to humankind, as its namesake, Alfred Nobel, wrote in his will. For the science prizes, Bengt Nordén, a chemist and former chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, considers three criteria: a Nobel discovery must be useful, be rich with impact and open a door to further scientific understanding, he says.

Although only living people, organizations and institutions are currently eligible for the prizes, AI has had previous encounters with the Nobel committee. In 2024, the Nobel Prize in Physics went to machine-learning pioneers who laid the groundwork for artificial neural networks. That same year, half of the chemistry prize recognized the researchers behind AlphaFold, an AI system from Google DeepMind in London that predicts the 3D structures of proteins from their amino-acid sequence. But these awards were for the scientific strides behind AI systems — not for ones made by AI.

For an AI scientist to claim its own discovery, the research would need to be performed “fully or highly autonomously”, according to the Nobel Turing Challenge. The AI scientist would need to oversee the scientific process from beginning to end, deciding on questions to answer, experiments to run and data to analyse, according to Gil.

Gil says that she has already seen AI tools assisting scientists in almost every step of the discovery process, which “makes the field very exciting”. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can help to decode the speech of animals, hypothesize on the origins of life in the Universe and predict when spiralling stars might collide. It can forecast lethal dust storms and help to optimize the assembly of future quantum computers.

AI is also beginning to perform experiments by itself. Gabe Gomes, a chemist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues designed a system called Coscientist that relies on large language models (LLMs), the kind behind ChatGPT and similar systems, to plan and execute complex chemical reactions using robotic laboratory equipment3. And an unreleased version of Coscientist can do computational chemistry with remarkable speed, says Gomes.

One of Gomes's students once complained that the software took half an hour to work out a transition state for a reaction. “The problem took me over a year as a graduate student,” he says.

The Tokyo-based company Sakana AI is using LLMs in an attempt to automate machine-learning research4. At the same time, researchers at Google and elsewhere are exploring how chatbots might work in teams to generate scientific ideas. 

Most scientists who are using AI turn to it as an assistant or collaborator of sorts, often appointed to specific tasks. This is the first of three waves of AI in science, says Sam Rodriques, chief executive of FutureHouse — a research lab in San Francisco, California, that debuted an LLM designed to do chemistry tasks earlier this year. It and other ‘reasoning models' learn to mimic step-wise logical thought, using a trial-and-error process that involves training on correct examples.

The existing models are helpful collaborators that can make predictions on the basis of data, and accelerate otherwise painstaking sorts of computation. But they tend to need a human in the loop during at least one stage.

Next, says Rodriques, AI will get better at developing and evaluating its own hypotheses by searching through literature and analysing data. James Zou, a biomedical data scientist at Stanford University in California, has begun moving into this realm. He and his colleagues recently showed that a system built on LLMs can scour biological data to find insights that researchers miss5. For instance, when given a published paper and a data set of RNA sequences associated with it, the system found that certain immune cells in individuals with COVID-19 are more likely to swell up as they die, an idea that hadn't been explored by the paper's authors. It's showing “that the AI agent is beginning to autonomously find new things”, Zou says.

He's also helping to organize a virtual gathering called Agents4Science later this month, which he describes as the first AI-only scientific conference. All papers will be written and reviewed by AI agents, alongside human collaborators. And the one-day meeting will include invited talks and panel discussions (from humans) on the future of AI-generated research. Zou says he hopes that the meeting will help researchers to assess how capable AI is at doing and reviewing innovative research.

There are known challenges to such efforts, including the hallucinations that often plague LLMs, Zou says. But he says these issues could be mostly remedied with human feedback.

Rodriques says that the final stage of AI in science, and what FutureHouse is aiming for, is models that can ask their own questions and design and perform their own experiments — no human necessary. He sees this as inevitable, and says that AI could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel “by 2030 at the latest”.

The most promising areas for a breakthrough — by an AI scientist or otherwise — are in materials science or in treating diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, he says, because these are areas with big open challenges and an unmet need.

In the 1960s, scientists classed chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans as a distinct family (Pongidae), thinking that these great apes had long diverged from humans. Few scholars expected that, in nature, these apes would display strikingly human-like behaviour. Jane Goodall, who has died aged 91, overturned this view with her groundbreaking observations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

Jane Goodall's legacy: three ways she changed science

Her discoveries foreshadowed the genetic evidence showing that chimpanzees, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and humans are more closely related to one another than to gorillas (Gorilla spp.) and orangutans (Pongo spp.). The findings had a major role in shifting perceptions towards recognizing the importance of emotions, personalities and complex cognition, reshaping scientific and public understanding of human evolution. She was a tireless advocate for conservation, the welfare of captive chimpanzees and the protection of habitats — work now carried forwards through the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, DC.

Her fascination with animals began early. Born in north London in 1934, she famously disappeared during a Second World War air raid when she was around six years old, only to be found sitting quietly in a chicken coop, watching a hen lay an egg. She often told this story to illustrate the patience and curiosity that defined her life's work.

In 1957, after working as a secretary for some years, Goodall accepted a friend's invitation to visit Kenya. In Nairobi, she sought out the renowned palaeontologist Louis Leakey, who invited her to join him and his wife Mary on a fossil-hunting expedition in Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, known as the Cradle of Humankind for its rich deposit of early hominid fossils and stone tools. During the trip, she committed to studying chimpanzees in what is now called Gombe National Park in Tanzania — a small, 35-square-kilometre patch of forest that Leakey had long hoped to investigate.

To prepare, she persuaded John Napier, a leading anthropologist, to tutor her privately in primatology. She was dismayed to learn that the main chimpanzee study of the time, conducted in 1929–30, had lasted for only four months and had been done by a large, intrusive expedition operating in classic colonial excess. She was not surprised that it had produced few results.

By contrast, when she arrived in Gombe in July 1960, she spent many months patiently tracking chimpanzees in the hills, sometimes sleeping alone in the park. By her fourth month, she had made her first world-shaking discoveries: chimpanzees not only ate and shared meat but also fashioned tools. The tools were modified grass stems that were then used to extract edible termites from their mounds (J. Goodall Nature 201, 1264–1266; 1964).

Her findings earned her long-term support. In 1961, she began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, under zoologist Robert Hinde, who encouraged her to focus on social relationships, individual personalities and the expression of emotions. She gained intimate access to chimpanzees by providing them with bananas, which allowed her to document their lives in unprecedented detail. She observed their political manoeuvring, deception, coalitional aggression and cooperation outside family groups — behaviours that indicated previously unsuspected levels of social intelligence.

Achieving efficient red and near-infrared (NIR) emission in boron cation-based emitters remains challenging owing to their intrinsic instability, strong electrophilicity of the boron centre and pronounced non-radiative decay governed by the energy gap law. Here we report a family of air- and moisture-stable carbodicarbene (CDC)-borabenzo[c]anthanthrenium ions exhibiting solid-state red-to-NIR luminescence (maximum emission wavelength up to 730 nm) with competitive quantum yields. Crystallographic, photophysical and computational analyses reveal that the CDC ligand plays a dual role by electronically stabilizing the boron centre and directing ion-pair assembly via charge localization, thereby modulating exciton coupling and aggregate-state emission. These cationic π-extended boron frameworks represent rare examples of monoboron-doped luminophores displaying deep-red-to-NIR emission. Our findings highlight that the combination of π-extension, a charge-directing CDC ligand and ion-pair assembly constitutes an effective strategy to access efficient red/NIR emitters, providing guiding principles for the design of functional long-wavelength emitting main-group materials.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed.

First, some exciting space news. According to a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, the ocean of Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules that indicate the environment could potentially support life.

Enceladus is a moon about as wide across as the state of Arizona. Back in 2005 the Cassini spacecraft caught plumes of water vapor and frozen particles shooting up from tiger-stripe-like fissures in the planet's icy crust. Subsequent analysis of gravity measurements captured by Cassini confirmed the presence of a subsurface ocean near the moon's south pole about a decade later.

Cassini's mission ended in 2017, but new analysis of data from a 2008 flyby just yielded additional insights into the frosty moon's watery reservoir. In flying through one of Enceladus's water plumes the spacecraft exposed its Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument to tiny, freshly ejected grains of ice.

After years of studying data from different flyby events to understand how Cassini's instruments behaved under different conditions, scientists were able to apply their findings to old data and find new patterns.

The new study determined that several sophisticated carbon-based structures, including esters and ethers, can be found in the subsurface waters of Enceledus. That's important because these structures are identical to substances considered to be vital chemical building blocks for living organisms on Earth. And that adds to evidence the moon could be a compelling candidate for hosting some kind of life—or at least allowing us to gain a better understanding of how life evolved on our own planet.

Speaking of life as we know it—and how the heck it got here—a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology & Evolution suggests that for hundreds of millions of years before plant life made it onto land, fungi may have dominated the planet.

The delicate filaments of mycelium that typically make up the bodies of fungi don't tend to fossilize well, and the fossils they do leave behind are often microscopic and hard to identify. This new study aimed to overcome that issue with the help of a “molecular clock.” Essentially, scientists can plot out the timeline of one species's divergence from another by tallying up the difference in their respective numbers of genetic mutations, which happen at fairly regular intervals as organisms evolve.

Counting the ticks of a molecular clock is only possible if you have regular anchor points from the fossil record to calibrate them, which is tricky for fungi. The researchers behind the new study got around that by integrating instances of horizontal gene transfer between species, along with mutations passed down from one generation to the next. Tracking when a gene moved from one lineage to another helped the scientists pinpoint which organisms emerged when, which they say has allowed them to tighten up the timeline of fungal evolution. The study suggests that fungi evolved from a common ancestor dating back to roughly 1.4 to 0.9 billion years ago, which is about half a billion years or more before land plants evolved. The researchers argue that fungi may have paved the way for plants by breaking down rocks and cycling nutrients to create the first soils.

Now for some health news. According to a study published last week in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, the risk of children and young adults developing long COVID could be twice as high with a second infection than with the first. Looking at 2022 and 2023 data from about 465,000 children and adolescents , the researchers found an increased risk of chronic symptoms potentially related to the condition such as severe fatigue, headaches, kidney damage, abdominal pain, cognitive issues and abnormal heartbeats after a second COVID infection. Blood clots were more than twice as likely with a repeat COVID case, and the risk of myocarditis—a potentially lethal swelling of the heart—actually more than tripled. The study authors noted that long COVID cases weren't necessarily linked to severe illness during the acute COVID infection. The researchers argue that this highlights the need for ongoing immunization of young people.

In some lighter respiratory infection news a study published last Wednesday in ACS Central Science hints that we might one day have access to an easy, surprisingly tasty method of diagnosing the flu at home. The researchers behind the new study have reportedly created a molecular sensor that reacts to the presence of flu virus by producing a distinct flavor.

The sensor responds to neuraminidase, which is a glycoprotein that the influenza virus uses to infect cells. The synthesized substance used in the sensor is attached to a molecule of thymol, which is found in the herb thyme and produces a strong taste. In lab tests using vials of human saliva the presence of influenza caused the thymol to break off on its own. In a human mouth that reaction should lead to a distinct herbal flavor. The researchers say they hope to conduct human clinical trials of a flu test in roughly the next couple of years.

Speaking of surprisingly delicious things, a study published last Friday in iScience shows how a traditional recipe for yogurt used a rather unusual secret ingredient to kick-start fermentation: ants.

Yogurt forms when microorganisms ferment milk and create lactic acid, which thickens the dairy and gives it a tangy taste. In the early 20th century scientists isolated some of the bacterial strains capable of accomplishing this, and now yogurt production largely relies on just a couple species of bacteria.

A lot of traditional yogurt-making methods fell by the wayside as production became standardized, including a traditional practice from the Balkans and Turkey involving red wood ants. The authors behind the new study decided to take a closer look at that recipe.

Under the guidance of the Bulgarian family of one of the study's co-authors, along with other locals, the researchers placed four ants into a vessel of warm milk and covered the jar with a piece of cheesecloth. The researchers then buried it in an ant mound overnight, where the heat produced by the colony's activity served as an incubator for fermentation. By the next day the sample showed early signs of fermentation, with the milk coagulating, becoming more acidic and taking on a slightly sour taste.

Back in the lab the team confirmed that the red wood ants carry lactic and acetic acid bacteria, including a type similar to one found in commercial sourdough. The scientists also found that the formic acid ants produce as a defense mechanism serves to acidify the milk and , probably helps create a better environment for the microbes.

The researchers even partnered with chefs from a two-star Michelin restaurant to create dishes such as ant-powered ice cream and soft cheese. But don't go digging around in your backyard to find fermentation buddies just yet: the scientists do warn that live ants can carry parasites, while frozen or dehydrated ants come with their own potential risks. That can add an element of danger to the process if you don't have the right equipment and knowledge to confirm the yogurt is safe to consume.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. Tune in on Wednesday to hear how one of the Internet's most famous astronauts is using his experience in spaceflight to write alternate-history thrillers.

The design of folded proteins has advanced substantially in recent years. However, many proteins and protein regions are intrinsically disordered and lack a stable fold, that is, the sequence of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) encodes a vast ensemble of spatial conformations that specify its biological function. This conformational plasticity and heterogeneity makes IDP design challenging. Here we introduce a computational framework for de novo design of IDPs through rational and efficient inversion of molecular simulations that approximate the underlying sequence–ensemble relationship. We highlight the versatility of this approach by designing IDPs with diverse properties and arbitrary sequence constraints. These include IDPs with target ensemble dimensions, loops and linkers, highly sensitive sensors of physicochemical stimuli, and binders to target disordered substrates with distinct conformational biases. Overall, our method provides a general framework for designing sequence–ensemble–function relationships of biological macromolecules.

Key Results

In the Wang Lab, it's not unusual for worms to live for a long time.

HHMI Janelia Research Campus Senior Group Leader Meng Wang and her team study longevity. They've shown that by overexpressing an enzyme in the lysosomes of the roundworm C. elegans, they can extend the worm's life by up to 60 percent.

But surprisingly, the team found the worms' progeny without this genetic modification were still living longer than normal. When they crossed their long-lived worms with "wild-type" worms that weren't overexpressing the enzyme -- a routine lab procedure used to wipe clean any genetic manipulations -- they saw that the offspring also lived longer than normal worms. Somehow, the longevity markers were being transferred from generation to generation, even four generations later.

In new research, Wang and her team uncover how changes in the worm's lysosomes that promote longevity are transferred from cells in its body to its reproductive cells through histones -- proteins that play a key role in organizing and regulating DNA. In reproductive cells, these histone messengers cause modifications in the worm's epigenome -- a collection of chemical tags that regulate gene expression -- enabling the lysosomal changes to be passed from generation to generation without changing the underlying DNA.

The findings have repercussions well beyond longevity. Epigenetic modifications can help organisms cope with many different types of environmental stressors -- from diet changes to pollutant exposure to psychological stress -- and the new work shows how these advantages could be conferred from parents to their offspring.

"You always think that your inheritance is in the nucleus, within the cell, but now we show that the histone can go from one place to another place, and if that histone carries any modification, that means you are going to transfer the epigenetic information from one cell to another," Wang says. "It really provides a mechanism for understanding the transgenerational effect."

Uncovering inheritance

The researchers found that one type of histone modification -- a type of epigenetic change -- was elevated in long-lived worms compared to those with normal lifespans. They wanted to see how this modification related to lysosomal changes that promote longevity.

Using a combination of genetic tools, transcriptomics, and imaging, they found that changes in lysosomal metabolism affecting the worms' longevity activate a series of processes inside the cell. These actions trigger an increase in a specific histone variant, which is transported from the worm's somatic or body tissues to its germline or reproductive cells through proteins that deliver nutrients to developing eggs. In the germline, the histone is modified, allowing the information from the lysosome to enter the germline and be passed from parent to child.

The researchers show that this pathway is activated during fasting, which causes a change in lysosomal metabolism -- providing a link from the physiological phenomenon to the changes in the germline.

The new work adds to a growing body of evidence that lysosomes, once thought to only act as the cell's recycling centers, also function as a signaling hub to control different processes in the cell and now are shown to affect generations.

The new research also unveils a new mechanism for transporting information from somatic to germline cells through histones, which could help explain how other types of inherited information are passed from parent to offspring.

By providing a mechanism for understanding how environmental changes to somatic cells are passed through the germline, the new work could help researchers better understand transgenerational effects that have been previously observed, like the malnutrition of a parent affecting its offspring.

"We now show that the soma and the germline can be connected by the histone and can carry memorable genetic information for generations," Wang says.

This is a sparkling scene of star birth captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. What appears to be a craggy, starlit mountaintop kissed by wispy clouds is actually a cosmic dust-scape being eaten away by the blistering winds and radiation of nearby, massive, infant stars.

Called Pismis 24, this young star cluster resides in the core of the nearby Lobster Nebula, approximately 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve.

At the heart of this glittering cluster is the brilliant Pismis 24-1. It is at the center of a clump of stars above the jagged orange peaks, and the tallest spire is pointing directly toward it. Pismis 24-1 appears as a gigantic single star, and it was once thought to be the most massive known star. Scientists have since learned that it is composed of at least two stars, though they cannot be resolved in this image. At 74 and 66 solar masses, respectively, the two known stars are still among the most massive and luminous stars ever seen.

Captured in infrared light by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. The largest and most brilliant ones with the six-point diffraction spikes are the most massive stars in the cluster. Hundreds to thousands of smaller members of the cluster appear as white, yellow, and red, depending on their stellar type and the amount of dust enshrouding them. Webb also shows us tens of thousands of stars behind the cluster that are part of the Milky Way galaxy.

Super-hot, infant stars -some almost 8 times the temperature of the Sun - blast out scorching radiation and punishing winds that are sculpting a cavity into the wall of the star-forming nebula. That nebula extends far beyond NIRCam's field of view. Only small portions of it are visible at the bottom and top right of the image. Streamers of hot, ionized gas flow off the ridges of the nebula, and wispy veils of gas and dust, illuminated by starlight, float around its towering peaks.

Dramatic spires jut from the glowing wall of gas, resisting the relentless radiation and winds. They are like fingers pointing toward the hot, young stars that have sculpted them. The fierce forces shaping and compressing these spires cause new stars to form within them. The tallest spire spans about 5.4 light-years from its tip to the bottom of the image. More than 200 of our solar systems out to Neptune's orbit could fit into the width its tip, which is 0.14 lightyears.

In this image, the color cyan indicates hot or ionized hydrogen gas being heated up by the massive young stars. Dust molecules similar to smoke here on Earth are represented in orange. Red signifies cooler, denser molecular hydrogen. The darker the red, the denser the gas. Black denotes the densest gas, which is not emitting light. The wispy white features are dust and gas that are scattering starlight.

The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).

The holy grail of personal computing has always been a single, seamless experience that follows you from your pocket to your desk. For decades, this dream has been a graveyard of ambitious failures.

Now, in the fall of 2025, the whispers are growing louder: In partnership with Qualcomm, Google is making a serious play to bring Android-based PCs to the mainstream. Google's effort isn't just another Chromebook; it's a full-fledged effort to scale the world's dominant mobile operating system into the laptop form factor.

Google's Android PC initiative represents a direct assault on the traditional Windows PC market and a strategic challenge to Apple's carefully segregated ecosystem. However, to succeed where others have so spectacularly failed, Google must learn from the ghost of its most notable predecessor: Microsoft's Windows 8. Google's strategy is different — scaling up from the phone rather than down from the desktop — but the potential pitfalls, especially in marketing, look eerily familiar.

Let's talk about the Android PC this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: a new OLED tablet from Wacom that could bring back some excitement into the market.

To understand why Google's new venture has a fighting chance, one must first diagnose the fatal flaws of Microsoft's attempt at a unified OS with Windows 8 and the Windows Phone.

Microsoft's strategy was to take the dominant desktop OS, Windows, and shrink it to fit on a phone, while simultaneously forcing its touch-centric “Metro” interface onto a billion mouse-and-keyboard users. It was a bold, top-down strategy that backfired for two critical reasons.

First and foremost was the catastrophic “app gap.” An operating system is only as good as its software library. Developers for mobile were overwhelmingly focused on iOS and Android, and they had little incentive to rebuild their apps for the sliver of the market using Windows Phone.

The platform became a wasteland of missing apps — no Snapchat, no native Gmail, and a constant stream of major services pulling their support. Without the apps people used every day, the hardware was irrelevant.

Second was the jarring user experience. The Metro UI, with its live tiles, was actually quite innovative for a phone. However, on a 27-inch desktop monitor operated with a mouse, it was an inefficient and confusing mess that alienated a generation of Windows power users.

Microsoft attempted to build a single OS that was a master of two worlds, but ended up being a jack of all trades and a master of none. The failure of the Windows Phone was a brutal lesson that you cannot force a desktop-first paradigm into a mobile-first world.

Google's approach is the inverse of Microsoft's, and that is its greatest strength. Instead of shrinking a desktop OS down, it is scaling a mature, app-rich mobile OS up.

Google's smartphone-first strategy holds a fundamental advantage: It already has absolute victory in the app war. The Google Play Store contains virtually every application and service a consumer could want. The challenge is not attracting developers from scratch but instead encouraging them to optimize their existing Android apps for a larger, landscape-oriented screen with keyboard and mouse input — a far simpler task.

Furthermore, the user base is already trained. Billions of people are intimately familiar with Android's navigation, notification system, and settings menus. There is no steep learning curve. An Android PC would feel like a natural, more powerful extension of the device they already use for hours every day. That familiarity with Android creates a powerful, low-friction pathway for adoption that Microsoft never had.

For all its engineering prowess, Google's history is littered with the corpses of brilliantly engineered products that were crippled by inept marketing and a confusing brand message: Google+, Stadia, Allo, and the convoluted early branding of its Pixel phones. The list is long. Google's marketing problem is a persistent blind spot. It often fails to tell a simple, compelling story about why a consumer should choose its product.

The marketing challenge is where the parallel to Microsoft's failure becomes alarming. Microsoft never articulated a clear, compelling reason for consumers to abandon their iPhones or Android devices for a Windows Phone. Google now faces the same challenge. Why should a consumer buy an Android PC for $700 when they can get a perfectly good Windows PC for the same price or a simpler Chromebook for half of that?

Without a massive, clear, and sustained marketing campaign that highlights a unique value proposition — perhaps seamless app continuity with your phone, unlike anything else — these devices could easily get lost in a crowded market, repeating the mishaps of the past.

If Google can overcome its marketing hurdles, an Android PC could accelerate the inevitable blurring of lines between smartphones and personal computers. The true endgame may not be an “Android PC” at all, but the death of the PC as a separate device. We are nearing the point where the smartphone is the only computer you need — a “primary brain” that docks into various “shells” to suit the context.

Imagine your phone holding all your apps, data, and processing power. At your desk, you place it into a dock connected to a monitor and keyboard, and the UI instantly expands into a full desktop experience. In a hotel, you connect it to a lightweight laptop shell for productivity on the go.

Samsung has been experimenting with this concept for years with its DeX platform, but with Google's full OS-level backing, it could become the standard. A dockable, smartphone-centered form factor would make the separate, dedicated PC obsolete for a vast majority of users, transforming it from a core device into a mere peripheral for the phone.

The rise of Android PCs as a smartphone-first computing platform exposes a strategic vulnerability for Apple, which maintains three largely separate operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, and macOS — on hardware that increasingly uses the same silicon, resulting in redundant development and creating a less-than-seamless user experience. While this separation allows Apple to sell you an iPhone, an iPad, and a MacBook, it is an inefficiency born of a hardware-centric business model.

Google, whose revenue is driven by advertising and services, doesn't care what device you use as long as you are logged into its ecosystem. Its ad-driven business model gives Google the freedom to merge its platforms without cannibalizing its core business.

For Microsoft, the threat is more direct. An army of affordable, capable Android PCs powered by efficient Qualcomm chips directly attacks the heart of the Windows laptop market. To mitigate this, Microsoft must ultimately refine its own Windows on Arm experience, ensuring seamless performance and compatibility with legacy apps.

More importantly, it must lean into its core strengths: the deep integration with enterprise and the unparalleled library of powerful, professional software that will not be coming to Android anytime soon. Windows must become the undisputed OS for serious work, ceding the casual consumer market if necessary.

Google's venture into Android PCs with Qualcomm is the most credible attempt yet at creating a unified computing platform. The smartphone-up strategy is fundamentally sound, leveraging an unbeatable app ecosystem and a user base of billions.

However, the project's success hinges on Google's ability to do something it has historically struggled with: market a product with clarity, passion, and persistence. If it can, this initiative won't just create a new category of laptops; it could fundamentally reshape our concept of a “personal computer,” putting immense pressure on both Apple and Microsoft to adapt or risk being rendered obsolete by the tiny computer in everyone's pocket.



For years, digital artists have been caught in a frustrating compromise. Do you choose the slick, consumer-friendly experience of an Apple iPad, with its beautiful screen but glossy, imprecise drawing surface? Or do you opt for a dedicated Wacom tablet, sacrificing portability for professional-grade pen technology?

With the release of Wacom's MovinkPad 11, that compromise is officially over. This device isn't just another tablet; it's a focused, masterfully engineered tool that sets a new benchmark for portable digital creation.

The star of the show, without question, is the 11-inch OLED display. While Apple's “Liquid Retina” screens are excellent for watching movies, they are fundamentally backlit IPS panels. The MovinkPad's OLED screen is a different class entirely for artists. Because each pixel is its own light source, it can achieve perfect, absolute blacks. This creates a level of contrast and color vibrancy that makes digital paintings pop with a depth and accuracy an iPad simply cannot match. For professionals whose work depends on precise color grading and value control, this isn't a luxury; it's a necessity.

Wacom's legendary industrial design is on full display. The MovinkPad 11 feels less like a fragile media device and more like a durable piece of studio equipment. The back has a comfortable, grippy texture, and the display itself features a subtly etched surface. This isn't the slick, glass-on-glass feeling of an iPad; it provides a satisfying, paper-like resistance that gives artists the tactile feedback needed for precise linework. Paired with Wacom's latest Pro Pen 3, which uses battery-free EMR technology and boasts an imperceptible level of latency, the drawing experience is second to none.

At a retail price of $449.95, the MovinkPad 11 is a serious investment positioned squarely against a mid-tier iPad Air. But the comparison is misleading. An iPad is a general-purpose computer that can also be used for artistic purposes. The MovinkPad is a dedicated professional art tool from the ground up. For that price, you are getting a display technology and a pen experience that far surpasses what Apple offers for creative work.

So, who is this for? The ideal customer is the serious creative professional or the dedicated hobbyist who prioritizes the drawing experience above all else. This is for the digital illustrator who needs perfect color on the go, the comic book artist storyboarding in a cafe, or the animator sketching out keyframes on the train.

While the iPad tries to be everything to everyone, the Wacom MovinkPad 11 is unapologetically for the artist. It is, without a doubt, the ultimate portable canvas. While I'm not an artist, my mother was, and I think she would have loved this tablet, so I'm making it my Product of the Week.

If that is true, it's now wonder that they do not understand all the value that Windows NT has brought, why having a standard on menu structure, a standard for all UI controls etc made sense. And to understand that while Apple's mission is to provide a walled garden, Windows has been and is used in a million different scenarios. Taking away options will ALWAYS hit some of your customers. And there are a gigantic amount of applications where you want local system accounts only. Yes, Dear Microsoft, computers without an Internet connection do exist and are a common thing.For us it's Win10 IoT LTSC so we have updates for a couple of more years, and by then hopefully the last remaining software and hardware we have will be usable with Linux.

Think MS is in for a rough ride on Windows. Short of corporate world - Excel/Sharpoint/AD - there is just no moat. Browsers work fine on all platforms, dev work is better on linux anyway and gaming on linux is rapidly becoming usable. And mac side is obviously competitive on various fronts too.

This is partially why major (effective) anti-cheats have migrated to the Kernel. Windows allows the big-budget games, which are often competitive games, to operate with a higher level of game integrity, which leads to more revenue generation.MacOS is not an attainable gaming support platform in general, as the people who are interested in the AAA games are going to need a Pro series or similar quality device which prices a large part of the current windows gaming audience out.As an example: it's not too expensive to buy a laptop that runs valorant, and then be funneled into the skin shop. You can get a lot more sales that way than you can through the crowd of people who are on MBP, though perhaps the MBP crew is more likely to be a whale.note: Valorant is not supported on MacOS due to the anticheat requirement, but the hypothetical still stands.

On the other hand the anti cheat side has been really ratcheting up with newer releases requiring Win 11 and Secure Boot. I somewhat hope and fear we might get a blessed version of SteamOS for the Deck that is heavily locked down and has kernel/hypervisor level anti cheat functions added to it. Essentially allowing for a boot mode similar to current consoles. While it goes against the open spirit of SteamOS, it might serve as an argument to invest a bit more into the Linux side, potentially improving the ecosystem as a whole.Or all of it might be the usual "year of the Linux desktop" pipe dream.[1] leaving out the Switch which is heavily focused on Nintendo IP and has comparatively weak hardware

The M5's GPU cores are expected to pick up the same 40% performance boost we just saw in the newly released iPhones.AAA games written for the M4 already work just fine, the extra performance is needed when you are also emulating other graphics APIs and CPU instruction sets to run Windows games.Windows on ARM has the same issues, but Prism isn't as good at x86 emulation.

It's also about the market accessibility and penetration. When the base level MBA at it's lowest RAM settings is reliably running AAA games is when you might see more interest in the platform from those studios because much like the iOS market, people running Mac tend to be more readily monetized, especially through things like in-game cosmetics.

We have decades of training in the consumer market for very simple install patterns using UIs, and minimal messing with configurations. The people in gaming who overclock and tweak their settings are a huge minority in gaming. Those people are the ones most likely to be able to grok switching to Linux, but when they get there and find that most of their favorite apps don't work like they are used to, they go back to Windows or Mac.My hypothesis is that for Linux Gaming to truly take off, you'll need a true desktop (not steamdeck which i use weekly) that makes it a handful of "clicks" to get whatever they want installed working. That means you'll need a commercially backed OS where developers maintain all the things needed to support near infinite peripheral connections for a variety of use cases, clear anti-cheat interfaces, and likely clear DRM hooks as well.

After a lifetime of Windows use, I'd even say MacOS is almost on par with Linux for development, while Windows' best feature on this front is WSL so you don't have to use Windows.

reply

IMO the two biggest pains with MacOS is (1) brew is not as good as any other package manager in my experience (mostly in bugs that need manual fixing) and (2) Docker naturally is much worse (not just for performance, but for requiring 'Docker desktop'.) All the other pains are just the myriad niceities I miss from a lifetime of mostly Linux that MacOS just can never have.

I used to run AutoCAD on a 80286 with a maths co-pro with 1 MB RAM.  It has changed somewhat since!Who gives a shit about QB? - you could just run it in a VM and it probably runs under Wine.  You can also just switch accounting vendor - there are quite a few.  Double book keeping is a good 600 years old and can be considered pretty open source these days.You may even do some real good to your business (if you think you need QB) by going old school and really getting to grips with the numbers.  Buy three huge ledgers and label them: "Sales" "Purchase" and "Nominal" or "General".  Also grab an exercise book to act as a cash book and a couple of notebooks to document the system.  Now, you will need to do docs too so you will need a drawing board to design your forms ...Now CAD is not the most common business software in use by anyone which is probably why you went for AutoCAD (which you have heard of), rather than, say, Solidworks or Catia.  Autodesk is a vendor and not a stuff.

I hate Microsoft and Windows just as much as the next self-respecting nerd, but this is no less a lol right now than it was 20 years ago. It's like Linux users all play the same 15 titles that have Linux support and think those 15 games reflect broad ecosystem support.

Microsoft has a strong cycle of "applications run on Windows" -> "device vendors choose to bundle Windows" -> "people use applications on Windows", but that has been eroded, in part thanks to Wine and the work put in by people at Valve.If someone who uses their computer to browse the web and check the email picked up a laptop pre-installed with Ubuntu, they'd likely be perfectly fine with it.

My plan for years has been to install Linux Mint + Cinnamon for my grandma when she next needs a new laptop... but she still hasn't needed one :(. And she's slowly getting too old for any new computerEvery Windows upgrade was a big change again. The UI would change each time, Windows Live Mail got discontinued, Office got ribbons, etc. Why reinvent the wheel each time? I've replaced:- Windows Live Mail with Thunderbird, that has been stable.- Microsoft Office with Libreoffice, that has been stable.- The next item on the list was going to be Windows itself, since Cinnamon hasn't significantly changed since I started using Linux over ten years ago. It still has a start menu, system tray, window list at the bottom (without the windows collapsing and hiding!), everything made for usability and working as you expect.The only exception is (grand)parents that need custom software. E.g. my mom has custom software (from Hema I think? Or Bruna maybe?) for editing photo albums to then send it to a print shop and get a real photo album. That will be web based nowadays I imagine. I should ask her but that could still be a barrier to switchingEdit: Similar issue on Android btw. There isn't one function that my (grand)parents use, that Android 16 has that Android 4 did not. The only thing that keeps changing under them is UI. Sure, developer APIs got nicer, support for dual-frequency GNSS is there, screens got taller... none of that needed to touch the UI. Sadly Google does a phenomenal job of obsoleting old OS versions quickly so you need to keep buying new. EU law for longer device support doesn't even help because you still need to upgrade that OS and can't simply use an LTS with security updates

The people who will have the hardest time switching to Linux are those who need proprietary software products that are unavailable for Linux and whose needs are not met by open-source alternatives.  Microsoft Office is still the standard for office software, and the Adobe Creative Cloud is still the standard for many creatives.If LibreOffice ever reached 100% compatibility and feature parity with Microsoft Office, and if the Adobe Creative Cloud ever got ported to Linux, then this could spell trouble for Windows.

Your computer. Your choice. No cloud accounts/everything being logged on the desktop that people do, no 'requirements' to utilize the new software, and no 'requirements' to connect people to cloud backup systems to later coerce and push people to buy.

Great question! You did configure it that way, so it might be worth asking yourself.

reply

If it has a passcode and you remember the passcode, you should still be able to wipe the device with Apple Configurator?If the situation is that you don't have a passcode, but you do have an iCloud account where you don't remember the password and can't access the email address, and either don't have access to the recovery phone number or never specified one, then yeah. You might need to find your receipt and bring it to an Apple store to be reset.

I wouldn't get too excited about that. That might just be because people are moving off of desktops entirely and now only own mobile devices, a market where Linux may as well not exist (excluding Android). The number goes up, because at large, the portion of people who run Linux desktops are less likely to pivot to using only a mobile phone as they tend to be hobbyists/enthusiasts.

Apple wants you to have a tablet to spend money on apps.You need hardware built outside of that paradigm to have a hope of avoiding a mess of locked down anti consumer nonsense.

nope. only useful for corporate setting. We should be able to run anything we want, however we want, without any arbitrary requirements by MS.

Microsoft's idea of Security is security from me, not security for me. They use this overloaded language because it's so hard to argue against. It's a thought-terminating cliché. Oh you must not care about being secure huh???

reply

My point was, if you dont care about Secure Boot / Bitlocker / TPM2.0, then you probably dont also care about security updates. Not whatever insult you thought I was making.If your thoughts were terminated, that was entirely self inflicted.

Huh? I certainly care about the latter but not the former, and I doubt I'm in the minority.

reply

And how long would you expect Microsoft to write updates for computers with insecure boot chains, and secure boot chains? How much should they spend on mitigations for classes of attack that you can shut down just by updating? Why would they risk being seen to support a platform, that they consider a potential vector of incredibly bad PR, just for end user convenience? They have been browbeaten into being extremely security conscious, especially after the SMB stuff.Personally, my Win 10 laptops are becoming Debian laptops as god intended.

Not only does it allow you to create a local admin account, but you can also skip all the other setup screens that you want by pre-supplying values. Throw this file into your Windows boot media, do a fresh install (which you should be doing when you get a new machine regardless), and away you go. I use this both personally and my work environment. Not only are you then not relying on modifying OS ISO's or compilations, but an XML file is relatively easy to verify that only the settings you have set are the ones being input into the system if you utilize a third party tool like the one available at schneegeas.de

Seriously considering the move to Linux - I've heard it's getting better, but it would cost me a bit of time getting used to it.  The pain is really starting to seem like a lower cost every day.

reply

What makes Linux especially painful to windows users is they basically need to relearn how to solve the same sort of problems they've forgotten they've been solving all the time in windows, but in Linux. Which makes the effort novel and thus especially noticeable.Basically it takes accepting one is going to get smacked with fractal side quests of searching how to fix problems for a bit, but it does get better fairly quickly.

OpenAI's DevDay 2025 featured a major focus on vibe coding. The company, which boasts that it now has more than 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT, announced a variety of new tools for developers during its annual event in San Francisco. Headlining the announcements: the ability to build with apps directly in ChatGPT (including eventually allowing “mature experiences” once age verification is in place) and the introduction of a toolkit that will help users build and deploy their own AI agents.

In OpenAI's apparent effort to turn ChatGPT into a full-on frontend development environment, the company announced its new Apps SDK (Software Development Kit) that will allow devs to pull in supported third-party apps to complete tasks. In a demo, the company showed ChatGPT working with Zillow to generate a map of homes available for sale in Pittsburgh. Zillow created an interactive map based on the prompt, and the user was able to ask additional questions based on the map. The functionality should allow users to create tools using third-party apps, which they can preview directly within ChatGPT.

According to OpenAI, Apps SDK is available immediately for Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans. Support will be available out of the gate for Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow. The company also said that it plans to offer support for DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber in the near future. For now, users will only be able to make and use the apps in preview, but it plans to allow developers to submit apps later this year, with a directory for apps planned so that developers can share their vibe-based creations.

There are lots of details yet to come regarding what comes from Apps SDK. Altman promised monetization guidelines, for instance, are in the pipeline. Also on the way: “mature experiences.” According to OpenAI's App developer guidelines, “Apps must be suitable for general audiences, including users aged 13–17. Apps may not explicitly target children under 13.” But that won't be the case forever. “Support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place,” it reads.

The company recently introduced age verification tools designed to shift underage users into a ChatGPT experience with much stricter guidelines following a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the company by the family of a teenager who died by suicide after extensive conversations with the chatbot. It appears that once it hammers out those details, it'll open the floodgates to more “adult” functions.

In addition to Apps SDK, the company also rolled out its AgentKit API (Application Programming Interface), which will allow users to build their own agentic AI tools. It's a significant expansion of OpenAI's Agent, which it introduced earlier with the promise that the system could navigate the web autonomously to complete tasks assigned to it by the user.

Sticking with the vibe coding theme, AgentKit's primary feature is its Agent Builder, which allows users to program their AI agent's functionality through a visual interface. Altman described it as being like Canva for building agents, making it more accessible to those who are less technical.

The weeklong festival showcased 3D printers both old and new, plus new filaments.

I spent last weekend at Maryland's 3DPrintopia, a celebration of all things 3D printing. The event is an eclectic mix of the latest tech, mixed with homebrew 3D printers, merchants, and geeks showing off their latest projects. Over 3000 visitors and hundreds of exhibitors gathered, from big company CEOs to Cub Scouts racing their first 3D printed (not-a-pinewood) derby car.

Started in 2018 as the East Coast RepRap Festival, the event has outgrown the community college basketball court it called home for the last several years. In 2026, 3DPrintopia will move to the massive Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, with 63,000 square feet of space to spread out on.

Prusa Research CEO Josef Průša was seen at the festival, greeting old friends and checking out new makes, printed by fans of his 3D printers. Ryan Reid had quite the showstopper with his COREBot, a battery-powered CORE One printer mounted on remote-controlled treads that could print while being driven around the festival floor.

Later in the festival, Průša announced a new “space age” filament, PC Space Grade Black, which was developed in cooperation with the Czech space company TRL Space. The material is ESD-safe and has low outgassing properties, and can be printed on a CORE One 3D printer. “We shared the spec sheet with our friends from NASA and their reaction for that it's too good to be true,” he said. Here on Earth, the polycarbonate material is useful for 3D printing electronic cases and, in certain applications, can be used as an alternative to the costly and difficult-to-print PEEK.

 




Not everyone wants the latest 3D printer. Jeff from RainMotorsports started printing in 2021, but found the old, wooden-framed Ultimaker Cupcakes fascinating. He picked up one, then another, until finally he brought a van-load of retro 3D printers to 3DPrintopia. He gives them a bit of love and tuning – and new firmware – in order to get them running again. Keep an eye on his new website, ThisOld3dPrinter.com for more on fixing up old machines with modern firmware.

 




David Tobin, Executive Producer for 3D Printing Nerd YouTube channel, has added a new title to his name: Shoe Designer. David showed off a pair of shoes that he designed and is selling on the Zellerfeld platform, a German company that manufactures 3D-printed shoes with custom TPU pellet-fed FDM printers.

“You've seen 3D printed shoes, they're zany, they're wild. I didn't want any of that," Tobin said. "I wanted to use additive manufacturing for functionality. I wanted these to be shoes that you could wear and no one knows you're wearing 3D printed shoes.” His shoes are designed with skateboarding in mind, have plenty of air flow, and are also machine washable. (Just keep them out of the dryer.)

Unlike other 3D printed shoes we've been seeing around convention halls in 2025, these are professionally 3D printed by Zellerfeld, which also makes the NIKE Air Max 1000. The website has dozens of designs, from sandals to sneakers, all custom printed to fit your foot. Zellerfeld also welcomes new designers to join the platform and gives detailed instructions on how to digitally cobble a perfect pair of TPU shoes.

CookieCAD launched “CookieCAD Cares” at the event, an initiative to support accessibility and inclusion in the 3D printing community. Co-owner Melissa Kaye said CookieCad will kick off 2025 by donating 500 spools of colorful filament to partner organizations like MakeGood, the Controller Project and the Sanjay Mortimer Foundation. She said the company has plans to increase donations as more partners join the program.

Controller Project founder Caleb Kraft said accessibility tools too often look medical and boring. CookieCAD makes PLA, PETG, ABS, and TPU in fun, sparkly colors, which is even more important for MakeGood, which creates kids' mobility devices. Philip Dunham, a designer from MakeGood, said it's amazing how modern 3D printers allow him to print customized adaptive devices for users that would never be commercially viable with injection molding.

At the CookieCad booth, Dunham showed off a fully 3D printed toddler mobility trainer printed in bright pink PETG with a neon yellow TPU seat and wheels.

To apply to become a CookieCAD Cares partner, organizations must be a registered nonprofit, community-based group, or accredited school. For more information, go to Cares.Cookiecad.com.

 




The HueForge team announced a new feature of its amazing “painting with filament” app called “FlatForge”. The $15 plugin will allow uses to unlock the power of multicolor machines and create prints that are smooth to the touch. No longer limited to just stacking layers of filament, the new technique can put several colors on the same layer. It can be used by Bambu AMS-style systems, or tool changers like the Prusa XL and Snapmaker U1.

The new method allows users to print face down on holographic plates or print thin, doubled-sided items like bookmarks. They can also be more easily added to the top of ordinary 3D prints.

 




The Positron Team announced a new 3D printer project dubbed the Proton. The compact foldable printer will have a much larger 300 x 260 x 260 mm build volume. The printer is still under development and will be updated with full nozzle probing, an all-metal heat break, the flexibility to support several brands of boards, and be run from a USB-C power bank.

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. 

Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds.

The Crucial P310 2TB is among the best M.2-2230 SSDs that we've ever tested. Earning a four-star mark from our reviewer for its speed and capacity, the P310 2TB is a great pick at list price, and is a must-consider now that it's nearly 50% off. 

The SN770M, our "portable gaming king" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class.

For those looking for the absolute cheapest upgrade for a Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, or any other handheld PC, the Kingston NV3 is your pick. Down to its lowest-yet price of $65.80, the budget SSD got solid marks from us (in its longer 2280 trim) for its budget stature, and its price somehow matches those of full-sized M.2 SSDs today. 

The Crucial P310 2TB 2230 has hit its lowest-ever price at $121.99, 49% off the list price. If you don't need that much space, the 1TB WD Black SN770M is 39% off ($85.49), and the 1TB Kingston NV3 at an excellent $65.80.

You can read more details about these drives here.

The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale.

The ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is $50 off, featuring competitive 1080p and 1440p gaming performance with its 4,096 shader cores and 16GB of VRAM.

This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface.

The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. That said, the competition between the two cards is brisk. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off.

The 8TB WD_Black SN850X is a beast of an SSD, offering up more than enough storage for the majority of users. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage.

The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. Make sure to add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to get the total saving.

The SN850X wields the PCIe 4.0 interface, not the newer PCIe 5.0, but that serves up more than enough performance for most casual users. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly.

The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty.

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential.

When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP.

Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. 

 




Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere.

For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM.

MSI's Shadow version of the RTX 5050 boasts twin fans, a clean black fan shroud, four display outputs, and a conveniently placed power connector for easy building and a sharp-looking setup. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build.

If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And the SK hynix Tube T31 is the best flash drive we've tested, thanks in large part to the fact that it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD attached to a USB plug. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage.

A full price Intel's Ultra 9 285K CPU is a tough sell, but at just $489 — $110 off — it becomes a much more enticing proposition. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal.

All-time low price 

The Intel Core Ultra 7 285K is at an all-time low price, finally making it a worthy purchase against the competition. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. 

Here's how the 285K stacks up against some of the top processors on the market right now. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that.

Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an "Action Ring" menu. While it's a little heavier than its predecessor, all the signs so far are good, with the MX Master 4 sharing the DNA of the previous model. Imagine our surprise when we woke up and found a $30 discount on this brand new mouse this morning.

A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. 

AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months.

Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. You can peruse the list below and click on the bold blue price text in the table to see the deals:

Taylor Swift once said, “You deserve to own the art you make.” Apparently, that doesn't apply to the millions of artists who have had their works fed into the data wood chipper that is generative AI tools. In the lead-up to the release of the world's biggest pop star's latest album, “Life of a Showgirl,” fans were treated to easter egg videos designed to build hype. Instead, sharp-eyed Swifties started to spot what appeared to be AI-generated imagery within the teaser videos, and launched full Swift-vestigations into the situation.

The alleged generative AI material appeared in a series of short promotional videos. Those videos were accessed via QR codes that were posted on 12 orange doors located in 12 different cities. The videos, originally uploaded via YouTube Shorts, are no longer available, but Gizmodo reviewed purported re-uploads found online. Each video featured letters which, when put together, provided the phrase, “You must remember everything, but mostly this, the crowd is your king.” But the mystery that Taylor's king took more of an interest in seemed to be, “Why do some of these videos look a little off?”

No one from Swift's camp has confirmed in any way the use of generative AI in the promotional videos, but there is certainly enough on-screen to create suspicion. Users have pointed out clipping and disappearing imagery in some videos that suggest that what you're seeing is created with generative AI. The videos appear to be a part of a partnership with Google, according to a report from The Tennessean, which covered the orange door reveal that appeared in Nashville. Gizmodo reached out to Google for comment regarding its involvement in the videos, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

Others have called out some lettering that appears in different shots that have a distinct AI-generated quality to them, in that they are largely nonsense. A treadmill that appears in one video, for instance, has buttons that read “MOP,” “SUOP,” and “NCLINE,” with letters that are curved and blurred in ways that suggest there's something more than just some wear and tear on the buttons. Another image, a notebook, also appears to contain made-up lettering that a human would be unlikely to make, on account of the fact that a human knows what letters are.

this is ai + either taylor is the powerful woman that has power over every aspect of her art (music, promo etc)so she definitely approved this or she doesn't let's not switch narratives only when it benefits taylors ok? pic.twitter.com/mCkplSDuxw

Not a criticism of Taylor herself, moreso her team/company…. the lettering on this treadmill is a very well known indicator of AI generated text. pic.twitter.com/qCDzoCkufW

— katie ❤️‍🔥 (@13poetsdept) October 4, 2025



Generative AI systems are notoriously bad at generating text because, while these systems have been trained on massive sets of data and images containing text, the model has no concept of what it's actually “looking” at. This is why generative AI models can spit out images of watches and clocks, but it's often hard to get them to display specific times, because the model has no idea how to tell time. It just knows clocks have lines that mark time, not what those lines actually indicate.

The inconsistencies were surprisingly common throughout the videos. Viewers pointed out a squirrel that appears to transform into a chipmunk at one point, and a changing number of lamps that appear in another shot. The Swift diehards took particular offense to an AI-generated version of a piano and guitar that was used on Swift's Eras Tour, which shouldn't be surprising given how big a deal was made of those custom-made instruments at the time.

It doesn't appear that generative AI was used in the creation of Swift's music videos for the new album, and there doesn't appear to be an indication that generative AI was used in the feature film released to mark the launch of the record.  Gizmodo reached out to representatives for Taylor Swift, as well as Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of “Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” for comment regarding the potential use of generative AI in the making of these promotional videos, music videos, and the film. No parties responded on the record at the time of publication.

On its face, this appears to be a pretty major blunder. You can't tell your superfans, who think every word you speak and image you post contains secret messages, to look for clues in an AI-generated video and not expect them to spot inconsistencies. But hey, maybe these weird anomalies are just part of another Easter egg reveal, right?

Our latest Startup Radar spotlights Seattle-area companies building software for everything from insurance commissions to leadership training.

This regular series features early stage startups across the Seattle region that are getting off the ground with innovative ideas.

Read on for brief descriptions of each company — and a pitch assessment from GPT-powered “Mean VC,” which we prompt to offer both positive and critical feedback.

Check past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at [email protected] to flag other companies and startup news.

CodeChimp

Founded: 2025

The business: A project management platform that aims to turn vibe coding into a “multiplayer experience” by using multi-agent orchestration and other AI-powered tools. Helps developers with code generation, reviews, and automated testing. Part of a newly coined “agentic swarm coding” trend.  Company was originally known as Bili and just joined the latest Plug and Play cohort in Seattle. 

Leadership: Sylviane Zhao recently graduated from Cornell University. Co-founders Tehani Cabour and Shawn Yang both worked at French software giant Dassault Systèmes.

Mean VC: “Riding the ‘agentic swarm coding' wave with a multiplayer twist could make CodeChimp the darling of dev teams sick of solo LLM prompts and endless PR reviews. But buzzwords and cohorts don't ship stable code — unless you prove clear productivity gains and developer trust, you'll drown in the same hype pool as every other AI-coding startup chasing GitHub's shadow.”

EvolvArts

Founded: 2024

The business: CRM designed for nonprofit arts organizations. Handles donor development, ticketing, marketing, communications, class registration, tuition, and more. Self-described as “Ticketmaster for the performing arts.” The company has about 20 customers and is bootstrapped.

Leadership: CEO Christopher Lin was a principal engineer at Numbers Station AI and a research scientist at Meta. Co-founder Max Thayer was a founding member of Anker US and helped lead business development manager at e-commerce agency Oceanwing.

Mean VC: “Targeting arts organizations with a unified CRM and ticketing platform is smart — this niche is underserved, loyal, and still trapped in spreadsheet purgatory. But calling yourself ‘Ticketmaster for the performing arts' is a dangerous flex unless you plan to match its scale, integrations, and uptime — otherwise, you're just a boutique tool with Broadway dreams and community-theater resources.”

Rem

Founded: 2024

The business: AI-powered operating system for insurance distribution that automates commission tracking and reconciliation. Initially focused agents and carriers in healthcare. The company has raised a pre-seed round from AI2 Incubator and other investors. 

Leadership: CEO Jorge Banuelos was head of core prediction at Opendoor and held managerial roles in data science at Meta and Microsoft. Co-founder and CTO Zhongxia Zhou was an engineering manager at Opendoor and Compass.

Mean VC: “Automating commission tracking and reconciliation in insurance is a rare combination of boring and brilliant — exactly where real enterprise value hides. But insurance tech is a graveyard of integrations and edge cases, so unless Rem nails data accuracy and carrier cooperation, it'll spend years debugging spreadsheets instead of scaling revenue.”

Simsola

Founded: 2024

The business: AI training platform built on a developmental psychology framework to help leaders improve how they communicate, coordinate, and collaborate — both internally and with customers. Also partners with training providers to turn their frameworks into AI simulations and coaching tools. Simsola has raised $1 million and is generating revenue.

Leadership: CEO Tammy Wang held data science leadership roles at Korn Ferry and Riviera Partners, and was a senior director at Zillow. Co-founder Dr. Zachary Van Rossum is an organizational psychologist and and adjunct assistant professor at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Mean VC: “Blending developmental psychology with AI-driven leadership training is a clever way to move beyond generic chatbots and into measurable behavioral change. Still, the corporate training market is littered with ‘transformational' tools that never survive budget season — Simsola will need undeniable ROI data, not just eloquent theory, to stay in the lineup.”

Vergent

Founded: 2025

The business: Developing an SDK for spatial AI reasoning and memory. The idea is to allow LLMs to answer questions about 3D space with high degrees of accuracy. The company is pre-launch and has not generated revenue. Vergent recently won a pitch event at AI House in Seattle.

Leadership: CEO Benjamin Liang and CTO Andrew Liang were founding AI engineers at decentralized deepfake detection startup BitMind. They are also twin brothers and both studied computer science at NYU where they co-authored research in computer vision/graphics together.

Mean VC: “Building an SDK that gives LLMs genuine spatial reasoning is ambitious and could open up massive new verticals — from robotics to AR design to autonomous inspection. But ‘pre-launch, no revenue, won a pitch' is startup bingo for ‘impressive demo, unclear business,' and unless Vergent quickly proves a commercial use case, it'll stay more sci-fi than SDK.”

As part of Best Buy's “Techtober” sales event, I stumbled upon the best laptop deal I've seen in a while. It's for $450 off the Acer Swift 16 AI (8/10, WIRED Recommends), costing $800. Now, I'm not saying $800 qualifies this as a “budget” laptop, but you have to check out the specs on this thing to see why I'm raving about the discount.

The laptop not only comes with 16 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage, but also a 16-inch OLED screen with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. That OLED screen even has a 120-Hz refresh rate. You won't find a 16-inch laptop with a display this gorgeous at this price anywhere else. Importantly, it also comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V CPU, an efficient processor known for getting great battery life and decent performance. Our own testing resulted in 13 hours of YouTube video playback, which isn't quite as long as other laptops with this chip. But as our reviewer put it, it's likely good enough for most users.

Look, the Acer Swift 16 AI wouldn't be my first choice based on looks alone. It's a bit chunkier than I'd prefer at 0.79 inches thick. There are certainly more attractive and portable 16-inch laptops out there, such as the LG Gram Pro 16 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed). Another really solid option I'm seeing is the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $900. It has a slightly smaller 15.3-inch screen, but it's a match with the Acer Swift 16 for specs, including the CPU and OLED display. The advantage is a prettier design and a much thinner chassis, at only 0.55 inches.

Best Buy's Techtober runs through October 12, which just so happens to align with Amazon's October Prime Day sales event, also known as Big Deal Days. That being said, there will be a lot of great laptops on sale during Prime Day, so make sure to check back for the list I curated of all the best laptop deals happening this week.

OpenAI announced on Monday that it will acquire several data centers' worth of chips from AMD in a blockbuster deal that could also give OpenAI the option to acquire a roughly 10 percent stake in the chipmaker.

It's another bold bet from OpenAI that demand for generative artificial intelligence will continue rising—bubble be damned.

“Excited to partner with AMD to use their chips to serve our users!” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on X, adding that the company will also ramp up its investments in Nvidia chips. He added: “The world needs much more compute …”

OpenAI said in a blog post this morning that it would commit to purchasing 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD chips over the next several years. The first deployment of a gigawatt worth of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs will take place in the second half of 2026, the company said.

The deal also involves AMD issuing OpenAI the right to purchase up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock (roughly a 10 percent stake). OpenAI will be able to acquire the stock as it deploys AMD's chips.

"Our view is that we're nowhere near the top of the demand curve as every major enterprise, cloud provider, and sovereign initiative is scaling AI infrastructure in parallel," says Forrest Norrod, an executive vice president at AMD. He added: "we see this as the foundation of a long-term growth cycle for AI infrastructure, not a short-term surge.”

Today's announcement should also help AMD challenge Nvidia in supplying chips for AI training and inference.

“This is a breakthrough achievement for AMD,” Patrick Moorhead, a prominent chip industry analyst, wrote on X in response to today's news. “It will be a strategic supplier for the leading AI company and this will attract even more tier 1 customers."

This deal is just the latest in a string of data center investments involving OpenAI and other tech firms. Shortly after his inauguration in January, US president Donald Trump announced that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle would invest $100 billion in building AI data centers on US soil and would pour up to $500 billion into AI infrastructure over time.

The data center gold rush hinges in part on the idea that models will improve in line with the laws of scaling—so long as they're trained on more data and compute. “There's this basic story that scale is the thing, and that's been true for a while, and it might still be true,” Jonathan Koomey, a visiting professor at UC Berkeley who studies computing and data center efficiency, told WIRED in September, talking about an OpenAI-Oracle deal to create three new data center sites. “That's the bet that many of the US AI companies are making.”

Derek Thompson, a prominent economics reporter, noted in a recent post that the tech industry is projected to spend around $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year—while demand for AI services from US consumers stands at just about $12 billion a year, according to one study.

OpenAI had a strategic relationship with AMD prior to today's announcement. At AMD's Advancing AI event in Silicon Valley in June, Altman briefly joined AMD CEO Lisa Su on stage. Su said that AMD has been getting feedback from customers for a few years as the company has been designing the upcoming MI400 series of chips, and that OpenAI is one of those marquee customers.

Altman noted on stage that the industry's move toward reasoning models has been putting pressure on AI model makers in terms of efficiency and long-context rollouts and that OpenAI needs “tons of compute, tons of memory, and tons of CPUs,” in addition to the Nvidia GPUs that the generative AI industry is so reliant on.

Su, at that event, described Altman as a “great friend” and an “icon in AI.”

Over the past decade, as mass shootings have become depressingly common, school districts have increasingly invested in surveillance systems designed to monitor students' online activity. Recently, one of those systems pinged after a teen in Florida asked ChatGPT for advice about how to kill his friend, local police said.

The episode occurred in Deland, Florida, where an unnamed 13-year-old student attending the city's Southwestern Middle School is alleged to have asked OpenAI's chatbot about “how to kill my friend in the middle of class.” The question immediately set off an alert within a system that was monitoring school-issued computers. That system was run by a company called Gaggle, which provides safety services to school districts throughout the country. Soon, police were interviewing the teen, reports local NBC-affiliate WFLA.

The student told cops that he was “just trolling” a friend who had “annoyed him,” the local outlet reports. Cops, of course, were less than enthused with the little troll. “Another ‘joke' that created an emergency on campus,” the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. “Parents, please talk to your kids so they don't make the same mistake.” The student was ultimately arrested and booked at the county jail, the outlet says. It's unclear what he has been charged with. Gizmodo reached out to the sheriff's office for more information.

Gaggle's website describes itself as a safety solution for K-12 students, and it offers a variety of services. In a blog post, Gaggle describes how it uses web monitoring, which filters for various keywords (presumably “kill” is one of those keywords) to gain “visibility into browser use, including conversations with AI tools such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and other platforms.” The company says that its system is designed to flag “concerning behavior tied to self-harm, violence, bullying, and more, and provides context with screen captures.”

Gaggle clearly prioritizes student safety over all other considerations. On its website, the company dispenses with the subject of student privacy thusly: “Most educators and attorneys will tell you that when your child is using school-provided technology, there should be no expectation of privacy. In fact, your child's school is legally required by federal law (Children's Internet Protection Act) to protect children from accessing obscene or harmful content over the internet.”

Naturally, Gaggle has been criticized by privacy rights activists. “It has routinized law enforcement access and presence in students' lives, including in their home,” Elizabeth Laird, a director at the Center for Democracy and Technology, recently told the Associated Press. The outlet also says that many of the safety alerts issued by Gaggle end up being false alarms.

Increasingly, chatbots like ChatGPT are showing up in criminal cases involving mental health incidents. Episodes of so-called “AI psychosis,” in which people with mental health problems engage with chatbots and seem to have their delusions exacerbated, have been on the rise. Several recent suicides have also been blamed on the chatbot. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for comment.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday announced the launch of AgentKit, a toolkit for building and deploying AI agents, at the firm's Dev Day event.  

“AgentKit is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.  

The launch highlights OpenAI's push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.

AgentKit was one of several announcements at OpenAI's Dev Day, including the launch of the ability to build apps directly inside ChatGPT, which has hit 800 million weekly active users.  

AgentKit includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman described as like Canva for building agents.  

“It's a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. “It's built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.” 

The second capability of AgentKit is ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.  

“You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,” Altman said. 

Evals for Agents introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform. 

Finally, AgentKit includes access to OpenAI's connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an “admin control panel” while maintaining security and control. 

To prove how easy it is to use AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.  

“This is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents,” Altman said, noting that OpenAI has already signed on several launch partners that have already scaled agents using AgentKit.

Xbox Game Pass' painful price hikes aren't tied to a desire by Microsoft to softly exit the gaming hardware market. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has issued a statement reassuring customers that Xbox is, in fact, here to stay. In response to a gust of rumors stemming from Xbox's much-maligned Game Pass Ultimate price hikes, Xbox has confirmed in a statement to Windows Central that a next-generation Xbox powered by AMD hardware will be coming to market after all.

Microsoft offered the following statement to Windows Central concerning its plans to remain within the hardware space: "We are actively investing in our future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered and built by Xbox. For more details, the community can revisit our agreement announcement with AMD." The statement throws cold water on any rumors circulating about a possible Xbox hardware exit, relevant though they may have been.

Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a series of price hikes across the Xbox Game Pass subscription tiers. The tech giant is raising its flagship tier, Game Pass Ultimate, from $19.99 to $29.99 per month, a 50% price increase. The PC Game Pass subscription also saw a 38% price increase from $11.99 to $16.49, with the lower two Game Pass "Premium" and "Essential" (née Core) tiers remaining at $14.99 and $9.99, respectively.

These price hikes were paired with hardly very little in the way of upgrades or improvements in service to warrant the new costs. Ultimate members are now eligible to receive up to $100 in rewards points "simply by gaming," and Xbox Cloud Gaming has exited beta for all Game Pass subscribers. Additionally, the $30 tier now also includes a free Fortnite Crew paid membership, representing a $12 per month value for Fortnite players.

In response, many online speculators began bandying the idea that the Xbox Game Pass price increases were part of a subtle exit strategy for Microsoft, to squeeze every dollar out of the gaming sector before exiting it for good. However, as Microsoft's statement today reaffirms, this ignores the highly publicized Microsoft/AMD deal from June, where the two companies confirmed that the next-generation Xbox, likely to arrive around the holiday season 2026, will be powered by AMD's hardware.

"I am thrilled to share we have established a strategic multi-year partnership with AMD to co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles, in your living room, and in your hands," said Sarah Bond, president of Xbox at the time. AMD has committed to designing a slew of semi-custom processors for both the next standard console for Xbox, as well as an upcoming Xbox handheld offering, that will remain backwards-compatible with the Scarlett SoC powering the Xbox Series line.

Of course, the future of Xbox will not be a hardware-first venture. Microsoft's heavy investments across the last decade into buying up game studios like Bethesda and Activision/Blizzard, as well as its gamble on Xbox Cloud Gaming, have been touted as the primary wings of the Xbox strategy for the upcoming generation.

AMD fans can perhaps breathe a sigh of relief at the recommittment to a new Xbox generation powered by AMD, though perhaps they've grown used to winning today. Earlier this morning, OpenAI and AMD announced a close partnership where AMD will outfit OpenAI's newest data centers with Instinct MI450 accelerators in a deal that will secure "tens of billions of dollars" in revenue for AMD over the next five years, per AMD CEO Lisa Su.

Is Amazon priming little kids for future careers as delivery drivers?

The new, 92-page Amazon holiday gift catalog features a ride-on delivery van suitable for kids ages 2 and up. The blue van with the Prime logo on the side has a seat on top and a handle — perfect for kids to scoot around and deliver packages to other children in the neighborhood.

It does come with three little Amazon boxes which feature wooden toy vehicles inside. The van's cargo area is under the seat. Maybe it can be loaded with books for a real throwback Amazon vibe. Otherwise, pack it with batteries and toilet paper — two of the hottest sellers on the e-commerce site.

The van, by longtime toy wagon maker Radio Flyer, sells for $46 online. Customer reviews average 4.8 out of five stars, with plenty of people commenting about how tickled their kids are while pretending to make deliveries.

Foot power is about as sustainable as it gets, so the vans should help with Amazon's push to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040.

And finally, little 2-year-old delivery drivers are probably still in diapers, so the toy van is unlikely to need one controversial accessory — the alleged (and disputed) driver pee bottles that created such a public relations mess for the company several years ago.

Hat tip to GeekWire contributor Frank Catalano for sharing images and intel from the new catalog.

When it comes to commercial launch providers, the U.S. Space Force clearly has a favorite. On Friday, the military branch assigned the majority of its upcoming national security missions to SpaceX, while Blue Origin fell behind pending the conclusion of a rocket certification process.

The Space Force awarded contracts to SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) worth more than $1 billion as part of its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. SpaceX snagged five of the seven military missions, worth $714 million, while ULA will launch the remaining two, priced at $428 million. Blue Origin, another featured contender, was not eligible to receive missions this time around as the company awaits its New Glenn rocket to become certified.

Earlier in April, the Space Force's Space System Command announced three companies, SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin, as the recipients of its first round of awards for NSSL. The program, meant to procure launch service providers for military missions, includes a total of 54 missions set to launch between 2027 and 2032.

The first batch of missions is scheduled for launch through 2029. Although the majority of payloads on the missions remain classified, the Space Force revealed a few highlights of the upcoming launches. SpaceX's newly assigned missions include launching the 12th Wideband Global Satcom communications satellite, a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), as well as three undisclosed payloads. ULA's upcoming missions include launching a GPS satellite, as well as another NRO payload.

SpaceX is one of the main launch providers for the Space Force, having launched more than a dozen of its payloads over the past few years. Before Elon Musk's space venture came onto the scene, ULA used to be the primary launch provider for national security missions using its Atlas V, Delta VI Heavy, and Vulcan rockets.

Blue Origin, on the other hand, is relatively new to the game. After several delays, the company's New Glenn rocket finally took flight on January 16. Its inaugural launch wasn't a total success; the rocket reached orbit, but its booster was lost during the attempted recovery landing in the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, the rocket is not yet certified to launch Space Force payloads until it completes two successful orbital flights.

New Glenn is scheduled to launch NASA's ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission to Mars later this fall. If all goes well, the company will finally be eligible to enter the running for NSSL launches in the upcoming round in 2027.

SpaceX is expected to receive more than half of the total 54 missions, while ULA is set to launch around 19 of the remaining missions. Blue Origin, pending its certification, can launch up to seven missions.

Mary Brunkow of the Seattle-based Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and Fred Ramsdell of Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which has offices in Seattle and South San Francisco, today were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their research on the immune cells that prevent the human body from attacking itself.

Shimon Sakaguchi of Osaka University in Japan will also share the prize for their work identifying regulatory T cells, dubbed the “immune system's security guards.”

“Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,” Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee, said in a statement.

In 1995, Sakaguchi made the initial discovery of immune cells that protect the body from autoimmune diseases, but many in the field were skeptical of his conclusions. 

Six years later, Brunkow and Ramsdell were working together at Celltech, a biotech company that previously had an R&D facility in Bothell, Wash. They identified a gene they named FOXP3 that, when damaged, caused severe autoimmune illness in mice. They also showed that a mutation in the human version of this gene caused the rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease IPEX.

The research done by the trio solidified the role of regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, and launched a new field in peripheral tolerance research, which is the study of how the body makes the distinction between dangerous invaders and its own cells. Work in this area has led to therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Brunkow earned her bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Washington, and holds a master's degree and PhD in Molecular Biology from Princeton University.

When the Nobel Committee tried to reach Brunkow today to inform her of the award, she ignored the call, the Associated Press reported.

“My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: ‘That's just, that's spam of some sort,'” Brunkow told the AP. 

“When I told Mary she won, she said, ‘Don't be ridiculous,'” said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.

Brunkow worked at Celltech for a decade, until the United Kingdom-based company closed its Bothell facility in 2004. She has been a senior program manager at ISB for more than 16 years.

“ISB congratulates Dr. Brunkow on this extraordinary honor and celebrates her contributions to science and human health,” ISB President Jim Heath said via email.

ISB is a nonprofit studying cancer, aging, infectious disease, chronic illness and other health challenges. Renowned Seattle scientist Dr. Leroy Hood co-founded the organization in 2000 for research into systems biology, an interdisciplinary field that tackles biology from an integrated perspective. ISB is an affiliate of the Providence health care system.

Ramsdell is based on Bainbridge Island, just west of Seattle. In 2019 he helped co-found Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which opened a new R&D center and office space on Seattle's waterfront last year. The company is focused specifically on Treg cells. It has a partnership with Regeneron to co-develop cell therapies for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and two undisclosed conditions.

“Like many great scientists, [Ramsdell] spent years working behind the scenes to identify the gene that caused devastating systemic autoimmune diseases in a little-known strain of mice,” Jeff Bluestone, Sonoma CEO and president said in a statement. “The discovery of the gene, FOXP3, changed our understanding of peripheral tolerance and led to a new field of immunotherapy.”

Ramsdell earned his PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of California, Los Angeles and holds a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and cell biology from the University of California, San Diego. 

His career includes roles at Seattle biotech giants Immunex and Zymogenetics, and he spent six years at Celltech. Ramsdell was previously chief scientific officer at Sonoma, and is now chair of the company's scientific advisory board.

The Seattle area is home to numerous companies and organizations working on autoimmune diseases, a list that includes but is not limited to:

The prize was announced today at the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

Last year, UW biochemist David Baker won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for his research and discoveries about the molecular structure of proteins.

Editor's note: Story updated to correct that Fred Ramsdell is based on Bainbridge Island, Wash., and to add additional information on his career.

The new CEO of Smartsheet is Rajeev “Raj” Singh.

That news elicited a murmur of surprise when it reached the GeekWire newsroom, just as we suspect it might for others familiar with Singh, Smartsheet, and Seattle tech as it's announced this morning.

Singh, the co-founder of Concur, has spent his career doing the heavy lifting of founding and building major enterprise software companies from early stages to massive exits. He most recently served as CEO of Accolade, leading the health benefits tech company through IPO and acquisition.

We didn't peg him as next in line to run a 20-year-old enterprise tech company that has already gone public, been acquired by private equity, and is now navigating its next phase of growth against entrenched competitors and an aggressive slate of AI-native startups. 

But when we expressed as much to him in an interview about his new role, Singh explained that the decision was driven by a combination of several business and personal factors.

First, he pointed to the company's “exceptional bones” — an iconic Seattle company with a large customer base of major businesses, more than $1 billion in revenue, and significant headroom for growth in the field of enterprise work management. 

A self-described product-focused leader, Singh emphasized this point. “I won't work at a company that I don't believe has the capacity to build a great product,” he said, noting the “incredible love and affinity that comes from users.”

As a sentimental bonus, Smartsheet's HQ is across the street from Concur in Bellevue. The expense management company has been part of SAP since its $8.3 billion acquisition in 2014.

Second, Singh was drawn to what he called an “extraordinary” opportunity to implement AI in a tangible way. He believes incumbent companies with established customers, deep integrated workflows, and incredible data sets have a unique advantage in creating AI solutions. 

“The opportunity to get my hands on the wheel of a company that I think can have an incredibly tangible impact on business with AI just seemed like a lot of fun,” Singh said. “I think you know me: I'm looking for work where I can have a great time and enjoy myself.”

Finally, the decision was personal. “I want to work with people that I love,” Singh said, citing his longstanding respect for former Smartsheet CEO Mark Mader and his excitement to partner again with Sunny Gupta, who is the company's executive chair. 

The working relationship between Gupta and Singh includes their time at enterprise tech company Apptio, where Gupta was CEO and Singh was a board member, prior to its acquisition by IBM for $4.6 billion in 2023. Gupta was named to be Smartsheet's acting CEO when the company announced in August that Mader would be retiring at the end of September.

At Smartsheet they're going to “flip the script,” Singh said, explaining that he's “excited about partnering up with Sunny one more time to go after something big.”

They face no shortage of competition. Smartsheet operates in a crowded and rapidly evolving technology landscape. Legacy players such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, along with newer challengers including Asana, Monday.com, Airtable, and ClickUp, are all competing for the same enterprise work-management business.

Singh takes the helm less than a year after Smartsheet was acquired by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone in an $8.4 billion deal that took the company private. Being a CEO under private equity ownership comes with unique pressures and constraints.

However, Singh said he spent a significant amount of time with the board members from Vista and Blackstone and found an “open and receptive audience” for his own hypothesis about the company's path forward. He sees the owners as “like-minded people” aligned on the goal of growing the business into one of the most important companies in enterprise software.

Shortly after Mader's departure, Smartsheet laid off more than 120 employees last week. Smartsheet had grown to more than 3,300 people as of a year ago — tripling its headcount over the previous five years, according to its final quarterly filing as a public company.

When asked about the cutbacks, Singh described them as part of a larger transformation happening across the business world, driven by AI and shifting talent needs. 

“There are no businesses that don't need massive transformation right now,” he said. “Anybody who thinks otherwise is missing the story.” In that context, he added, “smart businesses address that proactively… and do it in a smart and humane way.”

Despite the cuts, he said, Smartsheet is a growing business, and he expects the employee base, customer base, and revenue to continue to grow.

As part of the interview, we had to ask the obvious question: What role will Mike Hilton play? 

We were only partly joking. Longtime friends and business partners, Hilton and Singh have been connected for most of their careers. Singh and his brother, Steve Singh, co-founded Concur back in 1993 with Hilton, who later joined Raj Singh at Accolade. 

More recently, Singh and Hilton backed a new Seattle-area startup called SCALA.AI.

When asked if Hilton would join him at Smartsheet, Singh laughed.

“Trust me when I tell you, I've spent a lot of time talking to Mike about this opportunity and getting his advice on the opportunity,” Singh said. “Whether I can lure him away… I don't know, but I promise you this, he'll be a wise counsel and a dear friend through the entire process.”

Now that Amazon owns James Bond outright after its landmark deal with producers Barbara and Michael G. Wilson, people have been bracing for just what the streamer might have planned for the character beyond Denis Villeneuve's new movie. Endless spinoffs for Prime Video? No… movie posters where the gun-toting spy has had his license to kill revoked by Photoshop.

Last week people began noticing that Prime Video in the UK—now one of the premiere platforms to view the Bond series digitally—had begun updating its assets for the films with new posters, each depicting the relevant Bond posed on a generic colored background with the ‘007' logo on it, and their respective titles. Nothing too exciting, until you looked closer and realized that Amazon had digitally altered some of them to remove Bond's gun.

"Just being disarming, darling"https://t.co/41P6Tkg2PK pic.twitter.com/KQQYif7d0q

— MI6 HQ (@jamesbondlive) October 3, 2025



Not all of the promotional imagery used in the refresh was based on production stills of an armed Bond, but multiple were, and all were digitally manipulated to remove them. As Bond fansite MI6 HQ spotted, Roger Moore's arms were lengthened on the poster for A View to a Kill so his weapon-holding hand was erased from sight. In others, the guns were simply airbrushed out of the Bonds' hands, leaving the awkward imagery of Bond seemingly gripping something that wasn't there anymore, or, in the case of Pierce Brosnan on the poster for Goldeneye, looking like he's in the middle of making a rude gesture at you.

It's a ludicrous idea, given that Bond is a character known for his gunmanship. From the whole concept of the license to kill granted to 00 agents, to the iconic gun barrel title motifs, even to his trademark Walther PPK and P99 in later films, the fact that James Bond shoots people is not an unknown nor a controversial trait. While Bond media has tried to downplay in parts certain aspects of the character over the years (like his drinking, smoking, and general womanizing), you can't really downplay the fact that James Bond kills people, and trying to do so even in such a silly way as photoshopping pistols out of movie posters is only going to get you endlessly mocked.

And endlessly mocked Amazon was, with some decrying that this was a sign of the future of the franchise under the company's complete creative ownership. But it's not the first time recently that a streamer has updated a poster to remove weaponry from sight—when Disney brought Thunderbolts to Disney+ over the summer, it advertised the Marvel movie's arrival with a poster that edited the team's guns (and the character of Taskmaster entirely) out of their hands, leaving them all weirdly pointing trigger fingers at each other.

We'd have to wait until whenever Denis Villeneuve's Bond movie arrives to see if people's worst fears about Amazon will come to light, but again, it's unlikely to the point of absurdity that the new Bond is a pacifist: we recently heard rumors that the movie could focus on a younger Bond's mission to earn that 00 agent status, a process which has historically required killing multiple people. Although Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment from io9 about the new posters, Variety notes that after this weekend's celebration of Bond Day on October 5 (marking the anniversary of Dr. No‘s debut), Prime Video UK quietly updated the key art for the Bond franchise to revert them back to stills from the movies—albeit all with stills where Bond just happens to not actually be carrying a gun this time.

OpenAI just inked another multibillion-dollar deal.

The AI giant is buying 6 gigawatts and billions of dollars worth of Nvidia-rival chipmaker AMD's latest generation chips to power its next-generation AI infrastructure.

AMD unveiled its next-generation Instinct chips at a launch event in July, when CEO Lisa Su took the stage with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to announce that the AI giant would use the new chips.

The first 1 gigawatt of that deployment is set to begin in the second half of 2026. As OpenAI hits deployment targets, it will also gradually receive a total of 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent each, which translates to a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.

Nvidia is still the leader in the global chip industry, but AMD is its closest rival in the U.S., and Thursday's deal gives the company a huge advantage in its efforts to compete.

The financials of the deal were not disclosed, but AMD chief financial officer Jean Hu said in the press release that the partnership was “expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI's AI infrastructure buildout.”

This is only the latest multibillion-dollar deal OpenAI has announced recently.

OpenAI and Nvidia announced a huge addition to their long-lasting partnership last month, with a $100 billion investment by Nvidia in OpenAI to support 10 gigawatts of data center and power capacity deployment. Just a few days prior to that, OpenAI also signed a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle, which became one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. Around the same time, OpenAI also inked a reportedly $10 billion deal with Broadcom to create custom in-house AI chips.

“Building the future of AI requires deep collaboration across every layer of the stack,” co-founder and President of OpenAI Greg Brockman said in a press release on Monday.

“We are in a phase of the build-out where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well,” Altman said, per WSJ. “You'll see this on chips. You'll see this on data centers. You'll see this lower down the supply chain.”

The AI industry is a compact family affair. There are a handful of huge names with overlapping interests that ink a seemingly infinite series of multibillion-dollar investments with each other, injecting more money into the system and creating a self-sustaining network that props itself up… for now.

With each deal, the companies also enjoy a huge boost in share prices. On Monday morning, AMD's shares skyrocketed more than 37% when news of the OpenAI deal hit the market.

The biggest players in AI are currently enjoying a ride on an unprecedented gravy train. Nvidia is the first and only company in the world to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. Oracle's chairman, Larry Ellison, was briefly the richest person in the entire world last month. OpenAI is now worth more on paper than Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance.

But that also creates risk: if one company goes down, they all go down together, and that has only supercharged fears of an AI bubble for skeptics. If there is indeed an AI bubble, then a burst could have catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy.

There have been other UEFI games, but this is the first complete arcade game designed to boot directly as firmware. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Inkbox Software has released a recreation of a beloved isometric arcade game that runs directly from a PC's Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Moreover, they coded their version of Zaxxon (1982) in x86-64 Assembly language, and have generously released it as open source under the GPLv3 license. There have been prior UEFI games and apps, but they are often incomplete or limited demos, and run within the UEFI as payloads, rather than booting directly to the game.

In the above video, Inkbox explains the reason they decided to begin this classic arcade gaming UEFI coding quest. In brief, our assembly coding hero says that they were “so tired of operating systems holding me back,” and that they wanted their hardware to run a classic game as it was meant to be played. That means “Written in assembly, without an operating system,” asserts Inkbox. “This is total freedom from big tech. Reject OS, Return to metal.”

Of course, there are significant hurdles to creating a handsome and responsive Zaxxon port for a PC UEFI. You can learn how Inkbox navigated this difficult path in their extensive and in-depth, yet engrossing video.

As if assembly coding wasn't tricky enough, the developer battled through UEFI limitations regarding timings, keyboard input, and graphic output. For example, the default UEFI keyboard was described as “absolutely garbage for game input,” by Inkbox, as it has a built-in delay, which is terrible for gaming. So a responsive mouse/joystick control was devised. For graphics, an engine had to be coded to replicate a retro console Picture Processing Unit (PPU).

Such wrinkles were eventually ironed out, though, and the video ends with a demo of the assembly-coded OS-less Zaxxon remake running at a buttery-smooth 128FPS. There is no sound in the game, though.

This game “will run on any x86_64 machine,” says Inkbox, as long as it supports UEFI. Further details about getting this Zaxxon game up and running are available on the Space Game for x64 GitHub, alongside the code and other resources.

A landmark deal. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI and AMD have announced a multibillion-dollar partnership that will see the companies collaborate on AI data centers powered by AMD processors. OpenAI has committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, starting with the MI450 next year. That will be done either by purchasing the chips directly from AMD or through cloud computing partners. AMD CEO Lisa Su told the WSJ that the deal would generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD over the next five years.

The two companies are not disclosing the exact financial details of the deals. However, AMD emphasized that each "per gigawatt" of capacity is worth tens of billions of dollars, so it's possible the deal is worth upwards of $60 billion.

In return, OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, approximately 10% of AMD, at a price of $0.01 per share, to be awarded in phases, provided that OpenAI meets deployment milestones. The warrants will only be exercised if AMD's share price increases, although again, the specifics are unclear.

The deal is an enormous win for AMD and stands juxtaposed with Nvidia's groundbreaking Intel partnership announced last month. Under the terms of that deal, Nvidia and Intel are jointly developing Intel x86 RTX SOCs for PCs featuring Nvidia graphics, as well as custom Nvidia data center x86 processors. Nvidia also received $5 billion in Intel stock as part of the deal.

OpenAI will use AMD's chip for inference in order to cope with skyrocketing demand. "It's hard to overstate how difficult it's become... We want it super fast, but it takes some time." OpenAI's Sam Altman said to WSJ.

"We are thrilled to partner with OpenAI to deliver AI compute at massive scale," said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO, AMD. "This partnership brings the best of AMD and OpenAI together to create a true win-win enabling the world's most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem."

The first deployment will be 1 gigawatt worth of MI450 chips, scheduled for the second half of 2026. Altman said the AI buildout has reached a phase "where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well," not only on chips and data centers, but also further down the supply chain too.

OpenAI has also inked a $100 billion deal with Nvidia, and will use Nvidia's investment to secure and deploy 10 gigawatts worth of AI data centers. While that deal isn't finalized, AMD and OpenAI reportedly say this deal is "definitive" and plan to immediately file the requisite details with regulators, a step that has yet to happen in the Nvidia deal.

New research from the University of Cambridge suggests that autism should not be understood as a homogeneous condition with a single cause. Scientists found that people diagnosed in early childhood often have a different genetic profile than those diagnosed later in life, broadening the understanding of how the condition develops.

The study analyzed the behavior of autistic people during childhood and adolescence in the United Kingdom and Australia. It also evaluated genetic data of more than 45,000 patients with the condition from diverse cohorts in Europe and the United States.

By linking genetic information to age at diagnosis, the researchers observed that the profiles of those identified early with the condition differed from those who received confirmation at later stages. They found only a slight overlap between the two groups, indicating that the biological mechanisms associated with autism in childhood may be different from those linked to autism identified in adolescence or adulthood.

The analysis, published last week in the journal Nature, showed that children diagnosed before the age of 6 were more likely to have behavioral difficulties—such as problems with social interaction—from an early age. In contrast, those diagnosed after the age of 10 were more likely to experience social and behavioral difficulties during adolescence. They also had a greater predisposition to mental health conditions, such as depression.

The study adds that the average genetic profile of those diagnosed later was closer to that of ADHD and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder than to that of “classic” autism identified in early childhood.

The study concludes that the timing of diagnosis is not entirely random but reflects underlying genetic differences that, in some cases, coincide with risk for other conditions.

“For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles,” said Varun Warrier, a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the paper, in a press statement. “The term ‘autism' likely describes multiple conditions.”

The researchers stress that their intention is not to create new subtypes of autism, but to understand the different developmental processes of the condition in order to improve therapies. “Some of the genetic influences predispose people to show autism traits from a very young age that may be more easily identified, leading to an earlier diagnosis,” Warrier says. “For others, genetic influences may alter which autism features emerge and when. Some of these children may have features that are not picked up by parents or caregivers until they cause significant distress in late childhood or adolescence.”

While acknowledging their work's limitations, such as the sample size and reliance on caregiver reports rather than clinical assessments, the authors contend that the study expands understanding of how autism characteristics emerge at different stages and their relationship to genetic profiles. This information could improve diagnostic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

“An important next step will be to understand the complex interaction between genetics and social factors that lead to poorer mental health outcomes among later-diagnosed autistic individuals,” says Warrier.

Uta Frith, an emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the great contribution of the research is to demonstrate that autism is not a single condition. “It is time to realize that ‘autism' has become a ragbag of different conditions,” she said in a statement to the Science Media Centre. “If there is talk about an ‘autism epidemic,' a ‘cause of autism,' or a ‘treatment for autism,' the immediate question must be, which kind of autism?”

Cardiovascular-related health problems may occur in as many as 1 out of every 7 pregnancies, even among people who don't already have heart disease, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation.

A review of more than 56,000 pregnancies occurring between 2001 and 2019 within the Mass General Brigham health care system in New England found a steady rise in cardiovascular-related complications during pregnancy. Conditions such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, blood clots, hypertensive disorders, and maternal death affected approximately 15% of pregnancies. The increase was most pronounced among individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, but it was observed across all age groups and even among those without prior health issues.

These increases were impacted by a rise in health risk factors present before and during pregnancy. Among study participants:

Most of these health risk factors can be prevented through lifestyle changes or medication. Yet, many of my patients aren't even aware they have these conditions or that they're at risk. If you're planning to become pregnant, I strongly encourage you to connect with a clinician early to understand your risks and take steps to reduce them. During pregnancy, stay proactive about your health. Listen to your body and your provider to address any concerns that arise. And don't overlook the postpartum period, which also carries important health considerations. Starting before pregnancy and continuing after birth, there are valuable opportunities to make heart-healthy choices that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and support long-term wellness."

New artificial intelligence-generated images that appear to be one thing, but something else entirely when rotated, are helping scientists test the human mind.

The work by Johns Hopkins University perception researchers addresses a longstanding need for uniform stimuli to rigorously study how people mentally process visual information.

"These images are really important because we can use them to study all sorts of effects that scientists previously thought were nearly impossible to study in isolation-everything from size to animacy to emotion," said first author Tal Boger, a PhD student studying visual perception.

"Not to mention how fun they are to look at," adds senior author Chaz Firestone, who runs the university's Perception & Mind Lab.

The team adapted a new AI tool to create "visual anagrams." An anagram is a word that spells something else when its letters are rearranged. Visual anagrams are images that look like something else when rotated. The visual anagrams the team created include a single image that is both a bear and a butterfly, another that is an elephant and a rabbit, and a third that is both a duck and a horse.

This is an important new kind of image for our field. If something looks like a butterfly in one orientation and a bear in another-but it's made of the exact same pixels in both cases-then we can study how people perceive aspects of images in a way that hasn't really been possible before."

Chaz Firestone, senior author

The findings are published today in Current Biology.

The team ran initial experiments exploring how people perceive the real-world size of objects. Real-world size has posed a longstanding puzzle for perception scientists, because one can never be certain if subjects are reacting to an object's size or to some other more subtle visual property like an object's shape, color or fuzziness.

"Let's say we want to know how the brain responds to the size of an object. Past research shows that big things get processed in a different brain region than small things. But if we show people two objects that differ in how big they are-say, a butterfly and a bear-those objects are also going to differ in lots of other ways: their shape, their texture, how bright or colorful they are, and so on," Firestone explained. "That makes it hard to know what's really driving the brain's response. Are people reacting to the fact that bears are big and butterflies are small, or is it that bears are rounder or furrier? The field has really struggled to address this issue."

With the visual anagrams, the team found evidence for many classic real-world size effects, even when the large and small objects used in their studies were just rotated versions of the same image.

For example, previous work has found that people find images more aesthetically pleasing when they are depicted in ways that match their real-world size-preferring, say, pictures of bears to be bigger than pictures of butterflies. Boger and Firestone found that this was also true for visual anagrams: When subjects adjusted the bear image to be its ideal size, they made it bigger than when they adjusted the butterfly image to be its ideal size-even though the butterfly and the bear are the very same image in different orientations.

The team hopes to use visual anagrams to study how people respond to animate and inanimate objects and expects the technique to have many possible uses for future experiments in psychology and neuroscience.

"We used anagrams to study size, but you could use them for just about anything," Firestone said. "Animate and inanimate objects are processed in different areas of the brain too so you could make anagrams that look like a truck in one orientation but a dog in another orientation. The approach is quite general, and we can foresee researchers using it for many different purposes."

Neuroinflammation damages neurons and can contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's. Cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory properties, which suggests that it could combat neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. In a new eNeuro paper, Babak Baban and colleagues, from Augusta University, explored whether CBD can be leveraged as an antiinflammatory treatment in an established Alzheimer's disease mouse model. 

The researchers assessed two distinct mechanisms for shaping immune responses and regulating neuroinflammation in the central nervous system following CBD treatment via inhalation. With several molecular and genetic measures, they discovered that CBD reduced expression of key regulators for neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's mice, which was associated with less proinflammatory molecules. Baban et al. also identified distinct regulators of the immune response and neuroinflammation with which CBD interacted. 

Alzheimer's work has long centered on plaques and tangles. But our study shows that chronic autoinflammation is also a core driver of the disease. What's exciting is that CBD not only calms this immune overactivation but, in earlier work, we've shown it can also help clear plaques and tangles through a different mechanism. Together, this points to a multitarget approach with real therapeutic potential."

Inhalers are the frontline treatment for asthma and COPD, but they come with a steep environmental cost, according to a new UCLA Health study - the largest to date quantifying inhaler-related emissions in the United States.

Researchers found that inhalers have generated over 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually over the past decade, equivalent to the emissions of roughly 530,000 gas-powered cars on the road each year.

The study, published in JAMA, analyzed emissions from the three types of inhalers approved for asthma or COPD from 2014 to 2024. It found that metered-dose inhalers were the most harmful to the environment, accounting for 98 percent of emissions over the ten-year period. Metered-dose inhalers contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which are potent greenhouse gases that were widely used in products such as aerosol sprays. The other types of inhalers, which include dry inhalers and soft powder mist inhalers, are less harmful to the environment as they deliver medication to the lungs without the need for propellants.

Inhalers add to the growing carbon footprint of the US healthcare system, putting many patients with chronic respiratory disease at risk. On the upside, there is tremendous opportunity to make changes that protect both patients and the planet by utilizing lower-emission alternatives."

Dr. William Feldman, pulmonologist and health services researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and study's lead author

Researchers conducted the study using a comprehensive U.S. database capturing inhaler prescriptions at the National Drug Code (NDC) level. Emissions were then estimated using validated academic studies and analyzed by drug type, device type, propellant type, therapeutic class, branded status, manufacturer, payer, and pharmacy benefit manager.

Researchers plan to expand their research to examine inhaler-related emissions in specific patient populations, such as the Medicaid population. They will also compare clinical outcomes between of lower- and higher-emission inhalers in the same therapeutic class and explore pricing and patenting strategies that pharmaceutical companies may use as they roll out lower-emission inhaler technologies. 

"A key first step to driving change is understanding the true scale of the problem," Feldman said. "From there, we can identify what's fueling these emissions and develop targeted strategies to reduce them-benefiting both patients and the environment."

New research investigating health outcomes in NCAA athletes during their first year after leaving college sports found that some health measures were worse than expected, but others actually improved. 

The results varied depending on the athletes' history of contact exposure and the number of years they played their sport.

In athletes that are ending their collegiate careers, those with more concussions reported worse outcomes on certain health measures.

Interestingly, those participating in a higher contact sport reported better mental and symptom health scores than those in noncontact sports. Further, those with increased number of years playing their primary sport reported better mental health scores." 

Reid Syrydiuk, first author on the study and doctoral candidate in kinesiology, University of Michigan Concussion Center

The findings counter the narrative associating concussion with mental health deficits, and suggest that the benefits derived from the team environments seen with contact sports may be somewhat protective, he said. 

The study, which appears in the journal Brain Injury, is also novel in that it explores a period that hasn't been studied much: the time when students are transitioning out of college sport. The research is funded by the NCAA and the U.S. Department of Defense.

Most studies on concussions and health fall into one of two categories: acute (hours or days post-injury) or long term (decades into retirement.) This focus leaves a significant gap in understanding the health of athletes as they undergo the massive life change of exiting competitive sport.

To that end, researchers analyzed health questionnaires completed within one year of leaving college by 3,663 student-athletes in the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium, to assess how concussion history, sport contact exposure and years of participation were associated with their health at the end of their collegiate career, an intermediate time period that has not been studied much. 

Athletes completed eight self-reported health questionnaires spanning factors including cognition, mental health, physical health and neurobehavioral health. Key findings:

Concussion history: Athletes with three or more concussions across a variety of sports reported increased depressive symptoms and worsened neurobehavioral (e.g., irritability, concentration) symptoms compared to those with no concussions.

Benefits of participation: Athletes reporting more years of participation in their primary sport consistently reported better mental health scores.

Sport type comparison: Athletes in contact sports reported better mental health (specifically lower depression scores) and neurobehavioral symptom scores compared to noncontact athletes.

"If I consider why these contact sport athletes report better scores on certain outcomes, I think it could be related to the large-team environments they experience," Syrydiuk said. 

The CARE Consortium is a national concussion research network of NCAA athletes and U.S. military service academy cadets across 30 different institutions. Steven Broglio, director of the Michigan Concussion Center and U-M professor of kinesiology, is a principal investigator on the CARE study. 

An important practical application is identifying groups that could benefit from early intervention and support as they leave their college athletics, Syrydiuk said.

"This time period is important because it hasn't typically been used before in this type of sport medicine research," he said. "It both bridges a gap in literature, which is typically studying concussions in the acute and the long term, and it fosters early support for those leaving sport."

Practical applications could include increased monitoring, such as follow-up mental health screenings for identified at-risk groups postgraduation or targeted resources, such as offering access to counseling or tailored transition support programs for those with significant concussion history.

The change of leaving sport is a critical moment.

"For the majority of these collegiate athletes, their competitive careers end with graduation," Syrydiuk said. "That's a very big change in their lives. We don't want to just ignore them after they've left sport.

"If we can identify groups that are more at risk as they're leaving sport versus decades after they've retired, we can intervene earlier and hopefully increase the likelihood of improving their self-reported health. By identifying who needs support as they transition out of sport, we have a better chance of preventing their health from worsening over time."

Taste is one of our most vital senses, shaping appetite, nutrition, and quality of life. Yet taste buds are fragile, relying heavily on the nerves that connect them to the brain. When those nerves are cut or damaged, taste buds usually deteriorate - but later regenerate as nerves regrow. How this recovery occurs has remained unclear. 

Now, a study led by Dr. Dong-Hoon Kim and Professor Yong Taek Jeong at Korea University College of Medicine, published in the International Journal of Oral Science on September 10, 2025, reveals the key players in this process. The team discovered that sweet-sensing taste cells survive nerve injury thanks to a protein called c-Kit - and that these cells are essential for taste bud regeneration.

Using mouse models and taste bud organoids, the researchers showed that when c-Kit signaling was blocked with the cancer drug imatinib (Gleevec), the surviving sweet cells disappeared. Without these cells, other taste cells failed to regenerate, proving that c-Kit signaling underpins both survival and recovery.

To understand the significance of these findings and what they mean for everyday taste, the researchers spoke about their work in more detail.

Q: What do your findings reveal about taste buds?
Prof. Jeong explained, "Our taste buds are made up of various cells that detect different flavors like sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami. It's long been known that these taste buds are closely connected to our taste nerves, as they are where the initial taste signals are formed before being sent to the brain."

Jeong's team confirmed what scientists have known for decades - that when the nerves to a taste bud are cut, the bud degenerates and later regenerates as the nerves regrow. But their study advanced this understanding by showing that the extent of degeneration and recovery depends on the type of taste cell involved, with sweet-sensing cells proving far more resilient than other types. This helps explain everyday changes in taste - for example, during a common cold, when some taste qualities fade faster than others because the underlying taste cells adapt differently.

Q: How did you test resilience and what else did you discover about recovery?

"We used nerve transection in mice to mimic injury and found that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells consistently survived. In organoid cultures, these cells continued to grow even when survival factors were withdrawn. But when we blocked c-Kit with imatinib, the surviving sweet cells disappeared and regeneration was delayed.

We also discovered that it's not just sweet cells that matter. Some Type III cells acquired stem-like properties, helping repair the epithelial lining around taste buds. This shows that multiple cell types are involved in recovery - c-Kit+ sweet cells lead regeneration, while Type III cells contribute to repair," Prof. Jeong said.

Q: What could this mean for the future of taste research?
"This is the first discovery that allows us to selectively control specific types of taste cells. While it does not immediately translate into treatment, it provides a foundation for future work on taste resilience and recovery. In the long term, this could guide new approaches to improving nutrition, supporting patients with taste disorders, and even advancing flavor science. By identifying c-Kit as a key factor in sweet cell survival, we now have a building block for more precise control over taste," Jeong noted.

This study shows that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells are central to taste bud regeneration after nerve injury, with Type III cells also contributing through repair. By identifying c-Kit as a protective factor, the research explains why some taste qualities persist longer than others and lays the groundwork for future efforts to selectively control taste.

Results from a randomized clinical trial published in Pediatrics show that pediatricians who received targeted educational and clinical decision-support tools were significantly more likely to advise parents to introduce peanut-containing foods early – an approach recommended by national prevention guidelines but often underused in practice.

About 8% of U.S. children have food allergies. Peanut allergy, the most common pediatric food allergy, affects more than 2% of children nationwide.

We found that supporting pediatricians with training, electronic health record prompts, and educational materials for parents significantly improved their ability to counsel families on early peanut introduction."

Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, lead author, pediatrician and researcher at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

"Because pediatric visits at four and six months are so busy, this support is critical to ensure families receive clear guidance," Dr. Gupta added. "Our hope is that these conversations will help parents feel confident introducing peanut products early. We want to reverse the trend of increasing food allergies in the U.S. through prevention."

The randomized trial included 30 pediatric practices in the Chicago and Peoria regions, spanning federally qualified health centers, private clinics, and academic practices. Intervention practices received a clinician training video, an electronic health record (HER)-embedded decision-support tool, and visual aids for parents; control practices did not. The primary outcome was clinician adherence to guidelines, documented in EHR data at the four- or six-month well-child visit. In total, 18,480 infants were seen by 290 clinicians.

Lucy Bilaver, PhD, lead statistician for the study and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, noted the importance of leveraging EHR data for this pragmatic trial. "We were able to measure the primary outcome by making use of the clinical notes and structured data that pediatric clinicians generate during these well-child visits."

Among low-risk infants, guideline adherence was 84% in the intervention group versus 35% in controls. For high-risk infants, adherence was 27% in the intervention group versus 10% in controls.

"While more work is needed, the success of this intervention supports wider dissemination to prevent peanut allergy in children," said Dr. Gupta.

Dr. Gupta holds the Mary Ann and J. Milburn Smith Research Professorship for a Sr. Scientist in Child Health Research at Lurie Children's.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID U01AI138907).

International Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW) takes place globally from October 6-10. The week encourages communities around the world to recognize the vital role of plasma in creating lifesaving medicines and honors those who donate. A new survey has found that 72% of respondents agree that plasma-derived medicines can save lives, yet most have not donated plasma.

The survey asked over 1,000 American adults questions about their understanding of plasma donation and lifesaving plasma-derived medicines. Plasma, a component of blood, is essential in producing treatments for a variety of serious health conditions, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, severe burns, and more. It is also used in everyday health care settings, such as during surgeries, childbirth, and organ transplants. 

The need for plasma-derived medicines continues to rise as science reveals new uses and indications, as advances in standards of care expand their role in treatment. With hundreds of thousands of patients around the world depending on these unique therapies – and because plasma cannot be recreated in a lab – the importance of plasma donation is vital. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) commissioned the poll to better understand Americans' perception of the growing need for plasma-derived medicines.

Notable survey findings include:

Eight in ten survey respondents have never donated plasma.

About half (49%) of Americans who have never donated plasma feel they do not know enough about the donation process.

The survey also revealed a perceived disparity between blood and plasma donation, with 65% of respondents believing there is a greater need for donated blood than plasma, and 60% feeling that blood donation benefits more people.

As the survey results show, there is increasing public awareness of the essential role plasma donation plays in saving lives. However, understanding must continue to advance in order to meet growing patient needs. During IPAW, it's important to recognize plasma donors as everyday heroes because, as the survey shows, Americans know that plasma donation saves lives."

Anita Brikman, President and CEO of the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association

"As a patient who relies on the generosity of plasma donors, I feel optimistic about the survey results," said Lillie Hunnicut, a Seattle-based plasma advocate and common variable immune deficiency patient who shares her journey on social media as @chronically.lils. "Donating plasma helps create medicines that help me and many others thrive! Thanks to my plasma-derived therapy, I can now run, hike, climb, and be active and present in my daily life in a way that I wasn't for several years before my diagnosis and treatment. I am so grateful to the many donors who have given me not just my life back – but have strengthened my sense of hope in humanity."

"An estimated half a million Americans have been diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency (PI), though the actual number is likely much higher due to widespread underdiagnosis," said Jorey Berry, President and CEO of the Immune Deficiency Foundation. "Many individuals with PI depend on life-saving plasma-derived medicines that cannot be manufactured synthetically and can only be produced through the generosity of human donors. It is my hope that this survey and International Plasma Awareness Week will shine a much-needed spotlight on the critical, ongoing need for plasma donation and help raise awareness of these often-overlooked immune system disorders."

For more on the survey and its findings, please reach out to [email protected]. PPTA encourages all healthy adults over the age of 18 to consider giving the gift of life through plasma donation. Visit www.pptaglobal.org/donate to learn more and find a donation center near you.

Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. The recommendations highlight the urgent need for earlier detection and faster intervention – steps that could save the lives of tens of thousands of women each year.

Defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, PPH affects millions of women annually and causes nearly 45 000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma.

Postpartum hemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care. These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited – helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families."

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care

Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the guidelines introduce new objective diagnostic criteria for detecting PPH, based on the largest study on the topic to date – also published today in The Lancet.

Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning early detection and rapid response is critical. Yet in many settings, especially where healthcare resources and labour wards are overstretched, delays in treatment result in devastating consequences.

Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes – simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood – so that they can act immediately when criteria are met.

The guidelines recommend the immediate deployment of the MOTIVE bundle of actions once PPH has been diagnosed. This includes:

In rare cases where bleeding continues, the guidelines recommend effective interventions such as surgery or blood transfusion to safely stabilize a woman's condition until further treatment becomes available.

"Women affected by PPH need care that is fast, feasible, effective and drives progress towards eliminating PPH-related deaths," said Professor Anne Beatrice Kihara, President of FIGO. "These guidelines take a proactive approach of readiness, recognition and response. They are designed to ensure real-world impact – empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts."

The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails.

The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth.

During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort.

"Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum hemorrhage can escalate and cost lives," said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM's Chief Midwife. "These guidelines are a game-changer. But to end preventable deaths from PPH, we need more than evidence and protocols. We call on governments, health systems, donors, and partners to step up, adopt these recommendations, adopt them quickly, and invest in midwives and maternal care so that postpartum hemorrhage becomes a tragedy of the past."

The guidelines are accompanied by a suite of training and implementation resources, developed with partners including UNFPA. These tools consist of practical modules for frontline health workers, national-level guides for introducing new practices, and simulation-based training to strengthen emergency response.

These consolidated guidelines – the first to uniquely focus on PPH – are being launched at the 2025 FIGO World Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. They are a crucial step in the implementation of the Global roadmap to combat postpartum hemorrhage between 2023 and 2030.

A familiar allergy spray may do more than ease sneezing, researchers find azelastine could help block COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, pointing to an accessible new line of defense. 

 Study: Azelastine Nasal Spray for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock.com

Variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, continue to emerge almost six years after its initial emergence. A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine discusses the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to placebo.

Azelastine is a nasal antihistamine spray widely used to manage allergic rhinitis. Recent studies suggest that it exhibits antiviral activity in vitro against several respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2; however, its clinical efficacy remains unclear.

These antiviral effects may arise following previously reported interactions between azelastine and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is primarily used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into cells. Other studies suggest that azelastine treatment inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme, which mediates viral attachment to the host cell. Azelastine also appears to induce changes in the σ-1 receptor and inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression.

Previous small randomized trials suggest that azelastine reduces the viral load in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus suggesting its potential effectiveness as a preventive. The present study explored the effectiveness and safety of azelastine nasal spray for reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The current study was a single-center, phase II randomized controlled trial comparing the use of azelastine nasal spray with placebo in 450 individuals. The mean age of the study participants was 33 years, most of whom were female and White.

Women of reproductive age were included only if they were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding and/or were using reliable contraception. A significant majority of study participants received one or more COVID-19 vaccinations, with the cohort receiving a median of three shots. In most cases, the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered two years before the current study began.

Study participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.1% azelastine or placebo nasal spray three times every day for a total of eight weeks. Notably, this dose of azelastine exceeds the twice daily use that is typically prescribed to manage moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.

Study participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid antigen tests (RAT) twice weekly throughout the study period, and any positive test result was subsequently confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Study participants who experienced respiratory symptoms but tested negative by RAT also underwent a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

The azelastine group was less likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection than controls at 2% and 6.7%, respectively. This observation indicates that azelastine reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by about 70%.

Azelastine treatment also delayed the time to infection by 12 days as compared to the placebo group. Symptomatic COVID-19 infections were less likely in the azelastine group, with azelastine recipients remaining positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 1.7 days less than the control group, as assessed by self-reported RAT.  

Even in times of higher exposure rates, fewer infections per exposure occurred under treatment compared with placebo.”

Aside from COVID-19, rhinovirus infections were the most common infection reported among study participants. Azelastine treatment was similarly found to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections, with 2% of recipients infected as compared to 6% in the placebo group.

Overall, respiratory infections, as detected by PCR, affected 9% of the azelastine group as compared to 22% of controls. Participants who had antibodies indicating prior SARS-CoV-2 infection showed somewhat lower odds of testingpositive again, suggesting that baseline immune status modestly inflenced infection risk.

Importantly, adverse events were similar in overall frequency between groups but more commonly considered treatment-related in the azelastine group. However, most of these reactions were minor and well-known side effects like bitter taste, nosebleeds, and fatigue.

These findings support the potential of azelastine as a safe prophylactic approach warranting confirmation in larger, multicentric trials.”

The overall rate of new viral infections was low, thus indicating that azelastine may have broad antiviral activity. In particular, azelastine conferred protection against symptomatic rhinovirus infection, which may arise due to inhibition of the rhinovirus receptor ICAM-1. The authors noted that this is one of the first clinical trials to show reduced rhinovirus infection rates following a single therapy. 

Azelastine is a safe, easily available, and convenient approach for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be easily used in high-risk settings like public meetings or during travel. Nevertheless, the researchers cautioned that the study's single-center design, modest sample size, and potential unblinding due to azelastine's bitter taste limit generalizability. They also acknowledged that the placebo formulation itself could have had mild protective effects by stabilizing the nasal barrier. 

The study was funded by Ursapharm Arzneimittel GmbH, the manufacturer of azelastine nasal spray, and conducted in collaboration with Saarland University researchers. Despite these promising findings, larger trials must be conducted to validate these observations and explore the potential utility of azelastine for other respiratory viruses.

An analysis of 240,000 Americans reveals that the rise in alone time began long before the smartphone boom. It points to age, life stage, and social change as the real forces behind America's loneliness epidemic.

Study: In-person social isolation in the age of smartphonies: Examining age, period, cohort effects by gender. Image credit: Valebru/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study in PLoS One, researchers examined how birth cohort, time period, and age shape the time that people spend alone when social media and smartphone use are widespread.

Their findings show that social isolation has increased sharply over the past two decades, accelerating since the mid-2010s. However, smartphones alone cannot explain these changes, with generational differences and aging contributing to isolation.

The U.S. Surgeon General described isolation and loneliness as a national epidemic in 2023, pointing to online entertainment, remote work, smartphones, and social media as contributing factors. While these technologies allow new ways to stay connected, critics argue they reduce face-to-face connections and weaken real-world support networks.

Evidence cited for rising isolation often comes from time-trend studies, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which shows a steady rise in the time that people spend alone since 2003. However, these analyses may confuse three separate influences: age (isolation tends to rise later in life), period (broad societal changes such as new technologies), and cohort (differences between generations).

Research shows that age may have a U-shaped effect, with social isolation rising notably after midlife due to retirement, loss of peers, and other life transitions. Cohort effects may also play a role: younger generations who grew up with smart devices may rely more on digital than in-person interactions. In comparison, older generations maintain different social patterns.

Prior evidence on generational differences is mixed, with some studies suggesting younger cohorts are less socially engaged offline, and others showing stability in family and friend connections.

Researchers analyzed ATUS data from 2003 to 2022, covering 240,576 respondents aged 15 to 79. The ATUS, conducted by the Census Bureau, collects nationally representative 24-hour diaries of daily activities through telephone interviews.

Respondents report what they did, how long activities lasted, where they occurred, and with whom. Social isolation was measured as minutes spent alone during non-work activities, since work-related “who” data were inconsistently available before 2010 and could bias comparisons.

Cohort, age, and period groups were created in five-year intervals: age groups (15–19 through 75–79), four periods (2003–2007 through 2018–2022), and sixteen birth cohorts (1924–1932 through 1999–2007). The models also controlled for weekends versus weekdays and holidays, since social contact patterns vary by day type.

The researchers applied the Fosse and Winship age-period-cohort (APC) method to separate the influences of cohort, age, and period. This approach overcomes the statistical challenge that age = period – cohort by distinguishing nonlinear effects and estimating a “canonical solution line” of possible linear effects.

Weighted regression models, adjusted for sampling design and non-response, estimated the net contributions of cohort, age, and period. Analyses were stratified by gender, with results visualized using two-dimensional APC plots.

The researchers found that Americans are spending increasingly more time alone in non-work activities. For men, time spent alone rose from 268 minutes in 2003 to 312 minutes in 2022, while for women it increased from 282 to 297 minutes.

This growth accelerated around 2013–2014. Age patterns followed a U-shaped curve, with social contact highest in the mid-30s before declining steadily into older age. Women's time alone rose sharply to 500 minutes by age 79, while men plateaued at around 451 minutes.

Cohort effects revealed that older cohorts (born before 1940) spent the most time alone, with levels dropping significantly among those born in the 1970s–1980s and rising again for the youngest cohorts.

However, the authors emphasize that it is difficult to fully disentangle cohort effects from age effects in the ATUS data, meaning that some generational differences may reflect life-course patterns rather than actual cohort change.

Advanced APC modeling confirmed that period effects (societal changes such as the spread of smartphones) did contribute to rising isolation, particularly after the mid-2010s. Yet cohort and age effects were much stronger influences. Quantitatively, the age effect was about five times larger than the period effect, roughly a 150-minute difference between mid-30s and late-70s adults, compared to a 30-minute rise over the 2003-2022 period.

Gender differences emerged, with women showing steeper increases in isolation later in life, partly reflecting higher widowhood rates. Sensitivity tests (e.g., weekends vs weekdays, pre-pandemic vs post-pandemic, leisure time vs nonwork time) confirmed the robustness of these patterns.

This study demonstrates that while societal shifts, such as smartphone adoption, have contributed to rising social isolation, age and cohort dynamics are far more influential. The strongest finding is the U-shaped age effect, where isolation is lowest in the mid-30s and peaks in older adulthood, particularly for women.

This suggests that aging processes, including retirement, family changes, and widowhood, drive much of the isolation crisis. Cohort effects also indicate that older generations experience substantially higher isolation than younger ones, although these generational interpretations are tentative, given the overlap between age and cohort influences.

Key strengths include using two decades of nationally representative ATUS data and applying advanced APC modeling, which allows a clearer separation of cohort, age, and period influences.

However, limitations remain, including reliance on cross-sectional data, difficulties distinguishing age from cohort effects, and modest assumptions required in APC modeling. Overall, the findings reinforce the Surgeon General's warning and highlight older adults as a priority group for interventions to reduce social isolation.

Cervical epithelial cells are far from passive bystanders in the body's immune system. New research shows they actually play an active and highly coordinated role in detecting and fighting infections. That's the conclusion of an international research team led by Associate Professor Cindrilla Chumduri from Aarhus University, and now published in the journal Science Advances.

Using patient-derived 3D mini-organs, so-called organoids, and single-cell mapping technologies, the team has, for the first time, shown how distinct epithelial cell types in the cervix detect, respond to, and help neutralize infections. Importantly, the study demonstrates that these organoids faithfully recapitulate native human cervical tissue at single-cell resolution, making them powerful discovery platforms for infections, cancer and regenerative biology.

"We've demonstrated that the cervix is not just a physical barrier but a truly immunocompetent tissue that orchestrates complex defense mechanisms," says Cindrilla Chumduri, associate professor at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University.

The researchers focused particularly on chlamydia, the world's most common bacterial STI. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, they mapped the gene activity of thousands of individual cells in the organoids to reveal their role in immune defense.

The study found that various epithelial cells collaborate in a highly organized defense network. Within each region, specialised epithelial subtypes take on distinct tasks, such as repair, regeneration, or immune amplification. The outer ectocervical squamous cells reinforce the tissue barrier, while deeper endocervical columnar cells act as immune signalers, switching on interferon pathways, antimicrobial defenses, and antigen presentation, triggering alarms. Most surprising was that some of the most immune-active cells were never infected themselves.

"The most striking finding was that uninfected cells became the most immunologically active. They picked up distress signals from neighboring cells and initiated a defense response. It shows how incredibly sophisticated our tissues are," says Postdoc Pon Ganish Prakash, the study's first author.

The team also decoded cellular conversations, revealing how signaling between epithelial subtypes balances defense with repair. Some subtypes acted as hubs, coordinating the activity of their neighbors.

These discoveries open new opportunities for vaccines and treatments that stimulate the cervix's local defense system, rather than relying solely on the systemic immune response. This shift could have major implications for preventing STIs and their complications, such as infertility and cervical cancer.

We see huge potential in developing mucosal vaccines that can activate local immunity right at the infection site."

Cindrilla Chumduri, Associate Professor, Aarhus University 

The patient-derived organoids also offer a powerful new platform to study how infections like HPV and chlamydia affect cervical tissue over time, and how co-infections may increase disease risks.

"Mini-organs are like a window into human tissue. They allow us to test ideas and treatments in highly realistic models, far more accurate than traditional lab methods," explains Postdoc Naveen Kumar Nirchal, co-author of the study.

Senior Reseacher Rajendra Kumar Gurumurthy adds:

"Our findings show that epithelial heterogeneity is essential. Each subtype has its own job in protecting the cervix and preventing spread of infections to upper reproductive organs."

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a new structure determination method using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which shows how different parts of complex molecular machinery like enzymes move while they help catalyze reactions. Focusing on an enzyme in yeast, they demonstrated how contrasts in atomic scale motions impact their function. The method promises unprecedented access to the mechanisms by which biomolecules work, and how they relate to illnesses.

Enzymes are indispensable to the function of all biological organisms, including humans. While snapshots captured using X-ray or cryo-electron microscopy have revealed their intricate molecular structure, they are a constant blur of motion when they are at work. Their atomic scale structure is constantly changing, capturing other biomolecules and helping them react in a carefully choreographed sequence. While clearly important, these rapid motions at the nanometer scale are difficult to capture.

Now, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Teppei Ikeya from Tokyo Metropolitan University have used NMR spectroscopy to capture how different parts of enzymes move. Integrating a combination of different approaches, they successfully captured an accurate "ensemble structure" of a reacting enzyme. Essentially, ensemble structure is the collection of all states a macromolecule can take, and how likely it is to take each.

The team demonstrated their method with yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1 (YUH1), an enzyme in yeast that helps it recycle ubiquitin, a protein that regulates various intracellular events. YUH1 has an analogue in humans called ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCHL1), known to be implicated in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By integrating multiple analytical methods using NMR spectroscopy, they were able to create an ensemble map for YUH1 for dynamics over the millisecond time scale. They discovered that two parts of the enzyme near the active part, where proteins are bound, showed strikingly large movements, a "crossover loop" structure and the N-terminus, one end of the protein-capturing structure of the enzyme. The N-terminus was found to move in and out of the loop, going through a whole range of states before finally capturing a target protein like a lasso before acting as a "gating lid," keeping it in place. This new mechanism was supported by the way in which mutant versions with incomplete "gating lids" failed to show the same enzymatic activity.

The team's findings reveal how the dynamic nature of enzymes plays an important role in how they function. The method can be applied to a vast array of biological structures in their natural environment, promising a new approach for scientists to access underlying mechanisms and potential pathologies.

Demand for World Cup tickets is surging despite sky-high prices. (Carl De Souza / AFP via Getty Images)

FIFA raised ticket prices for at least nine 2026 World Cup games after just one full day of sales, in response to demand that seems undeterred by record-setting price tags.

FIFA officials confirmed last month that the governing body would use a “variable pricing” model for the tournament, which will take place next summer in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

The assumption was that most price adjustments would occur after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when matchups will be set and demand will increase for games involving popular teams. But on Friday, in the second window of the very first lottery phase, fans logged into FIFA's ticketing portal and already saw some prices that were slightly higher than the ones first revealed Wednesday. On Monday, in the third window, there were at least a few more upticks.

For the U.S. men's national team's second group game, for example, the Category 1 ticket price rose from $535 on Wednesday to $565 on Friday; the Category 3 ticket price rose from $185 to $205.

According to screenshots sent by fans to The Athletic, Category 1 prices also increased Friday by a similar amount — roughly 5% — for three of the four quarterfinals; at least three Round of 16 matches; the first Round of 32 match at SoFi Stadium in Southern California; and the USMNT's third group game, also at SoFi.

For the Round of 16 game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the Category 1 price jumped from $895 on Wednesday to $935 on Friday, then to $980 on Monday — at which point the game's entire first-phase allotment sold out.

For the fourth quarterfinal, in Kansas City, the Category 1 price rose from its original $1,125 to $1,180 on Monday; and the Category 2 price rose from $765 to $825.

The adjustments, the availability of tickets after 48 hours of purchasing, and exorbitant price listings on resale sites, suggest that some fans are more than willing to pay the prices that others have deemed “astonishing” and “unacceptable.”

Multiple fans who won the opportunity to purchase tickets on Monday told The Athletic that they ultimately didn't buy any — in some cases because prices were too high, in other cases because, after less than three full days of sales, nearly all coveted tickets were gone. By Monday evening, none were available for the Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals or final.

FIFA made around 1 million tickets — roughly 15% of the total inventory — available in this first “Visa presale” phase. (More will be available for all games in later phases.) From a pool of around 4.5 million entrants, it randomly selected a lucky few for the first of several time slots: Wednesday at 11 a.m. ET to Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. Each buyer was limited to four tickets per match, and up to 40 in total. A second wave of entrants were then selected for a time slot beginning Friday and ending Saturday; a third wave now has a time slot beginning Monday and ending this coming Wednesday.

But within a few hours of the curtain raising last Wednesday, before most fans got through a digital queue, tickets to the final — priced from $2,030 to $6,730 — were no longer available. By Wednesday night, the thousands of tickets made available for Mexico's three group games were also gone.

By the end of that first 24-hour window, nearly all Category 4 allotments and many Category 3 allotments — the cheaper categories — had also sold out. By Monday, hardly any Category 3 tickets were available.

The sales likely confirmed suspicions that, despite the backlash to FIFA's initial prices, they were actually an underestimate of market value and demand.

And that is likely why some prices rose. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said last month. (Humans would make the decisions, he clarified, and prices wouldn't fluctuate every five minutes, but part of the process would involve automation.)

FIFA oversees global soccer and funnels a majority of its revenue back into the sport, and has been capitalizing on that excess World Cup demand in a variety of ways. The price increases were one method, but not the only one.

On Thursday, FIFA also launched its World Cup ticket resale platform, where some of Wednesday's buyers quickly listed tickets for several times the price they'd paid a day earlier. FIFA will take two 15% fees on every transaction on the platform, meaning it will earn $30 for every $100 spent.

Meanwhile, FIFA and its “digital collectibles platform,” FIFA Collect, have continued to promote “Right To Buy” tokens aggressively. As millions of fans were shut out of this first lottery phase, anxiously awaiting acceptance emails that haven't yet come, FIFA has sold many “RTB” tokens for hundreds or thousands of dollars apiece.

The tokens are, essentially, a costly shortcut to 2026 tickets, allowing buyers to bypass lotteries. They promise buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets to a specific match, in an unknown section, for a to-be-determined full price.

“Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarifies on an FAQ page. “It only gives you access to purchase the ticket(s).”

Still, fans have gobbled up the tokens. On Saturday, FIFA Collect went to market with its latest batch of RTBs. There were 12 available for Mexico's third group match, priced at $3,999 each, and they quickly sold out.

FIFA has made tens of millions of dollars selling the tokens. And according to spinoff websites, last week and the mid-September week of ticket lottery applications were FIFA Collect's two most lucrative weeks on record, with over $2 million in primary sales — mostly of RTBs — in each seven-day span.

RTB holders do not yet know when, or at what price, they'll be able to actually purchase tickets.

Any fan, meanwhile, will be able to enter the second 2026 World Cup ticket lottery, the “early ticket draw,” beginning Oct. 27. A third lottery phase will then open after the World Cup draw in December.

In this Visa presale phase, more entrants could be selected for purchasing windows between now and Oct. 21, but supply is waning. FIFA, it seems, will not replenish the inventory available until the opening of the second “early ticket” phase in a month.

As of Monday afternoon, only five of the 16 Round of 32 games had standard tickets available; 50 of the 72 group games — including the U.S. opener, priced at $2,735 in Category 1 and $1,940 in Category 2 — had some availability. And only three matches — two in Kansas City, one in Santa Clara, California (near San Francisco) — had any standard Category 3 availability.

Tim Ream celebrated his 38th birthday as the U.S. Men's National Team reported for October camp on Sunday. Still, he jabbed at his younger teammate Cristian Roldan's age.

“You're 30? Damn, you're old,” Ream said jokingly to Roldan in a media availability with the two veteran leaders on Monday. 

Ream and Roldan, along with goalkeeper Matt Turner, are the only players 30 years or older on the current National Team roster as the USMNT faces Ecuador (Oct. 10 in Austin, Texas) and Australia (Oct. 14 in Commerce City, Colo.).

The players represented the United States in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and carry valuable leadership qualities as the USMNT gears up for the tournament next summer. To round out 2025, the USA will face two more World Cup-bound squads Paraguay and Uruguay in the next window.

“When I think of Tim — I think of poise, I think leadership, I think of control in every aspect,” Roldan said. “He brings a different aura to the team, and he creates a really good environment, a really welcoming environment for a lot of guys, and that's the type of leader that we need.”

During the last FIFA World Cup cycle in 2022, Ream contemplated whether that would be his first — and last — World Cup. At 38 years old and counting, there's no sign of the center back slowing down in the imminent future. 

While he's pondered the sunset of his career on the U.S. Soccer Podcast, playing in a World Cup on home soil is the ultimate dream before any plans of hanging up the cleats for good.

“I've always maintained that I'll push myself to the absolute maximum and bring every ounce of playing time that I can out of my body and my mind,” Ream said. “That's what I'm going to continue to do. I'm going to continue to push to be a starter.” 

Ream has appeared in 11 of the 14 USMNT games in 2025, donning the captain's band in 10. However, he understands the final decision isn't up to him, and he's willing to advance the team's success in any way. 

“If I'm the old guy in the corner handing out orange slices and giving pep talks to these guys, then OK, I've still contributed something to the team environment in the culture,” Ream said. "But my aim and my goal is to be starting games.”

Meanwhile, Roldan looks at Ream as an example for sustaining a National Team career at any age.

Roldan turned 30 years old in June and appeared in a USMNT shirt for the first time since 2023 in the Americans' most recent camp last month. The center midfielder was added to the roster after the initial announcement, and he impressed head coach Mauricio Pochettino enough to earn a second-straight call-up.

“He's revitalized his National Team career at an older age,” Roldan said of Ream. “It provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here with the team, to really believe that I could get here. He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level but sustain that throughout your career.” 

Before earning his first cap under Pochettino, Roldan gained confidence once again playing at the highest level this past summer. He credited his run with the Seattle Sounders FC in the FIFA Club World Cup and Leagues Cup as pivotal. Roldan found his stride against top European squads in PSG and Atlético Madrid in the CWC. Then he helped lift a trophy with a victory over Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF in the tournament featuring MLS and Liga MX squads.

Pochettino utilized the September camp to bring in some different faces and allow the deeper player pool a chance to perform ahead of World Cup roster decisions. Roldan took full advantage of that opportunity with productive minutes in the first match against Korea Republic, which earned him a starting position in the USA's 2-0 win over Japan.

In this October camp, it's about building on that for Roldan and the larger group. The time is now to continue growing winning habits. Having leaders like Roldan and Ream in the locker room who know how to steer the ship alongside the coaching staff is crucial in that development. 

“The mentality is focused,” Roldan said. “I think that we had a good game against Japan, and how can we build off that? How can we establish the formations, the tactics, the ideas that coach Pochettino wants to bring to the team and then show it on Friday against a tough Ecuador side?”

Focus, high-intensity, aggressive — I think those are the styles, the characteristics we want to have on the field come Friday.”

Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi saw a proposed summer transfer to Liverpool fall through at the 11th hour last month. But rather than simply resurrect a deal that would see him switch to Anfield by next summer at the latest, the England international looks set to have a number of other high profile clubs to choose from – including Bayern Munich as they make their own move.

Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has praised Senne Lammens for his composed debut in goal while taking a swipe at Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir for their numerous errors. The former shot-stopper welcomed the Belgian's clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland but urged caution, insisting that true quality will only be revealed when the youngster faces adversity later in the season.

...

This World Cup cycle began for the U.S. men's national soccer team with young holdovers from the Qatar adventure, new players seeking opportunity and, without fanfare, veteran center back Tim Ream, the oldest member of the 2022 squad.

At the time it seemed clear the St. Louis native would remain on the scene to, for all intents and purposes, help bridge the gap and offer stability ahead of soccer's jamboree coming to North America in 2026.

Along the way, however, Ream kept his place — for interim coaches, for Gregg Berhalter's second tenure and now for Mauricio Pochettino.

[Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7]

And with eight months and three training camps remaining before the World Cup squad is set, 38-year-old Tim Ream appears almost certain to not only make Pochettino's roster, but remain in contention to start in the Group D opener June 12, 2026, at SoFi Stadium in greater Los Angeles.

“I know I said after the last World Cup that, OK, it could be my very first and last,” the Charlotte FC player said Monday, one day after celebrating his birthday. “And, you know, here we are.”

The former Fulham standout was among 26 players invited to camp in Austin, Texas, ahead of Friday's friendly against Ecuador. Next comes Australia on Oct. 14 in the Denver suburbs.

Through 14 U.S. matches this year, Ream leads the team in minutes played and is second to left back Max Arfsten in starts. In all 10 starting assignments, Ream has worn the captain's armband.

“When I think of Tim, I think of poise, I think of leadership, I think of control in every aspect,” U.S. midfielder Cristian Roldan said. “He brings a different aura to the team, and he creates a really good environment, a really welcoming environment for a lot of guys. That's the type of leader we need.”

That Ream remains a pivotal piece after playing every minute at the 2022 tournament could be received in different ways. On the positive side, he continues to offer the experience, leadership and wisdom vital to World Cup preparation and the actual competition for a program still finding its way on the international scene.

On the flip side, the lack of positional depth has left Ream almost indispensable — even with his physical limitations. “Listen: We all know I'm not the quickest,” he said with a smile.

At the moment, with World Cup veterans Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson not at full strength, Ream and Crystal Palace's Chris Richards are the only sure bets on a backline that could include two or three center backs. The other central defenders in camp are Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers, Toulouse's Mark McKenzie and FC Cincinnati's Miles Robinson.

Should someone supplant Ream, “I'm the old guy in the corner, handing out orange slices and giving pep talks to these guys,” he said. “Then, OK, I've still contributed something to the team environment, to the culture, but my aim and my goal is to be starting games. Whether that happens or not is obviously down to me, but then also down to other decisions and down to other players and their form, as well.”

Selection to next summer's squad would make Ream the oldest U.S. player at a World Cup since the program began qualifying regularly for the tournament in 1990. In 1994, Fernando Clavijo was 38, but four months younger than Ream would be next summer.

Asked Monday to share tips about career longevity, Ream said, “I don't think we have long enough to sit here and go through everything. To be honest, find a good girl to have your back and settle down with her.”

Kristin, his wife of more than 13 years, is also a former Saint Louis University soccer player.

On the field, Ream stressed the importance of “finding things that work for you,” he said. “What works for me isn't going to work for Christian [Pulisic]. What works for Christian probably wouldn't work for me. It's finding even the small things that help you along in that path. Adaptability is a huge one — being able to adapt to different coaching styles, to different managers, to different leagues.”

Ream adapted last year, when, late in the MLS season, he signed with Charlotte after more than 12 years in England with Bolton Wanderers and Fulham. Under English coach Dean Smith, Charlotte enters the international break in fourth place in the 15-team Eastern Conference and assured of a playoff berth. The Queen City side recently boasted a nine-game winning streak, tying a league record.

Ream's ability to extend his career — both at the club and international level — has inspired his teammates.

“He's essentially revitalized his national team career at an older age, and it provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here, to really believe that I could get here,” said Roldan, 30, a 2022 World Cup player who, until last month, had gone more than two years without a call-up. “He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level, but sustain that throughout your career. And what Tim brings to the team is something that is really hard to replace.”

Cristian Roldan has said that positional stability and the confidence from a standout FIFA Club World Cup has led to him playing the best soccer of his life — and a revival with the U.S. men's national team.

The Seattle Sounders midfielder was a late addition to the USMNT roster for last month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan, his first call-up since the 2023 Gold Cup.

Roldan played the final half hour in a 2-0 defeat against Korea and then went the distance in a 2-0 win over Japan.

Those displays helped the 2022 World Cup veteran earn a recall for this month's matches against Ecuador and Australia.

Roldan has appeared to quickly leapfrog several competitors in central midfield to give himself a real shot to make a second straight World Cup roster.

Amid another standout campaign in MLS, the 30-year-old was asked Monday about how he's managed to revitalize his USMNT career.

"I think establishing myself as a one-position player has helped me a ton," Roldan said on a call with the media.

"I think that I benefited a whole lot from being able to play multiple positions in the last World Cup cycle, being able to fit into different tactical formations and positions. But now I've been able to hone in on being a center midfielder, a deep-lying midfielder and I think that's helped me tremendously — just being able to widen my range of passing, direct traffic, be a leader.

"The game has slowed down quite a bit for me and it's helped me a ton. I feel like I'm playing the best soccer of my life, but I've got to continue in this way."

Roldan said his confidence was boosted by a standout display this summer at the Club World Cup, where he impressed against powerhouse sides Atlético Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Botafogo.

After the tournament ended, Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer was full of praise for Roldan after he went toe-to-toe with some of the world's best.

"We should be talking about this for years to come because these three games …[especially] against Botafogo and Atlético, [Roldan] was the best player on the field," Schmetzer said.

Roldan said that the three matches in June proved to him that he can perform on the biggest stage.

"I think FIFA Club World Cup helped me tremendously," Roldan added. "It really gave me the confidence that I can play against the very best in the world. Holding my own against teams like PSG and Atlético really gave me a lot of confidence.

"I'm playing with a lot of confidence right now. I really believe that I can help this team. I really believe that I can make a World Cup squad."

GOAL US unpacks the main weekend storylines from the Premier League, La Liga and other top competitions in The Euro XI

Thank you, Estevao, for giving us a title race. This needed to happen. Liverpool had to lose. Someone else had to win. Those around them also had to play their part. It has not been a pretty week on Merseyside. The Reds have dropped three in a row. Arsenal and Man City have responded with wins.

But that's kind of what it's all about. You shouldn't be able to walk to the title. This should be hard. The Premier League is on. 

The same goes for La Liga. Barca were good. Madrid were bad. Then the roles reversed. Neither side is particularly convincing, and no one really deserves to be top of the table - which is why Madrid have a two-point lead. The good news? This is now far more compelling. Wins there and losses for Barca all amounted to a fun weekend in Spain, too.

GOAL US presents The Euro XI, with 11 key observations from the weekend.

Bayern Munich sporting director Christoph Freund has directly addressed ongoing transfer speculation about star winger Michael Olise. It comes after fresh rumours that several of the Premier League's leading clubs are hoping to take him back to England and would potentially offer the Bundesliga champions as much as nine figures for the France international.

If you're planning to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup, prepare for sticker shock.

The cheapest ticket to the final is already more than ten times what fans paid in Qatar just four years ago. And that is before prices begin rising through FIFA's controversial new dynamic pricing system.

The cost surge has made this edition of the World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, the most expensive in the tournament's history. Critics have said that it's becoming a competition only for those who can afford it. Final tickets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are now starting around $6,300. On the resale market, some are already listed for more than $25,000.

Supporters and politicians argue FIFA, despite being a nonprofit, is prioritizing revenue over access. Newsweek contacted FIFA for comment on Monday morning.

In September, FIFA confirmed it would introduce dynamic pricing for the first time in World Cup history. The system, familiar to fans of U.S. sports and air travel but largely foreign to European and South American soccer, adjusts ticket prices based on real-time demand. Group-stage tickets start at $60, while top-tier final seats are priced as high as $6,730. In Qatar, the highest price for a final ticket was $1,607.

“This is the first time in history FIFA has used dynamic pricing for a World Cup,” said Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's Chief Operating Officer for 2026, in an interview with ESPN. “Get your tickets early […] because anything could happen.”

That uncertainty has some fans concerned.

Under dynamic pricing, ticket prices rise or fall depending on demand, but few fans know what they're buying when sales begin. With the tournament schedule still incomplete, tickets are sold without team assignments. A $400 seat could land a fan at England versus Brazil or New Zealand against Uzbekistan. Stadium, city and team matchups remain unclear. That uncertainty makes early buying a gamble, but one many are still willing to take.

For some, this World Cup could be the last chance to witness greatness. Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have already qualified. The 2026 tournament may mark the final World Cup appearance for one of the sport's all-time greats. Fans hoping to see Messi on the world's biggest stage are paying now, even without knowing if their tickets will put them in the right place at the right time.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the pricing model, pointing to examples where they have said dynamic pricing has helped fans. At the 2023 Club World Cup, also held in the U.S., tickets for a semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense dropped from $474 to just $13 within days.

“For us, the important element is to fill stadiums to give opportunities to people to come,” Infantino said.

But fan groups say that's little comfort for those who bought early. In East Rutherford, many were frustrated when they paid top dollar for what turned out to be an underwhelming matchup. Others who waited bought tickets for less than the cost of a stadium beer.

“This is not ‘make football truly global,' this is the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all,” said Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, in an interview with The Athletic. “FIFA's leadership seems unable to understand that it needs fans in the stands. It needs life, the atmosphere, the colors, the diversity. None of this exists when you set such prices.”

The backlash has also grown louder with the rollout of FIFA's official resale platform. Unlike past tournaments where resale prices were capped at face value, FIFA is allowing uncapped resale in the U.S. and Canada. Some tickets to the final have already been listed for more than $25,000. FIFA will also collect 15 percent from both the buyer and seller on each transaction, taking 30 percent of every resale. At previous World Cups, combined fees were closer to 10 percent.

FIFA defends the model as aligned with standard ticketing practices in North America. In public statements, the organization has said that revenues from both primary and secondary sales will be reinvested into global soccer development. It has set a $13 billion revenue target for the 2023 to 2026 cycle, up from $7.6 billion during the four years leading to Qatar.

Some economists have argued that the approach, while unpopular, is economically sound.

In a commentary published by the Cato Institute, Ryan Bourne and Nathan Miller described dynamic pricing as a practical way to allocate limited seats in a complex, high-demand global tournament. “FIFA deserves a lot of criticism,” they wrote, “but its pricing proposal at least acknowledges the real-world trade-offs that this complex event must navigate.”

They noted that by allowing prices to move with demand, FIFA ensures that tickets go to those most willing to pay. The system can also work in the fans' favor when interest is low. They cited the example of tickets at the Club World Cup in New Jersey dropping from $474 to $13 in the final hours before kickoff. According to the Cato economists, dynamic pricing is not about targeting individual fans, but responding to market-wide interest.

“Empty stands don't look good, and electric audiences drive food, drink, and merch sales,” they wrote.

They also acknowledged the downsides of the pricing system. Prices for similar seats can vary widely depending on when a ticket is purchased. “Some fans could purchase tickets at vastly different prices to other fans for similar seats,” the economists wrote. For supporters with limited means, that unpredictability could make access less equal.

Democratic New York State Assemblyman and mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has become one of the most vocal political critics of FIFA's strategy. He launched a campaign titled “Game Over Greed,” calling on FIFA to end dynamic pricing, reinstate resale caps and reserve 15 percent of tickets for local residents at discounted prices.

“The biggest sporting event in the world is happening in our backyard,” Mamdani said, “but most New Yorkers will be priced out of watching it live.”

As pressure builds, FIFA has shown no signs of altering course. 

“We're looking at optimizing revenue, but also optimizing attendance,” Schirgi told ESPN. “It's always a balance between different factors.”

Three Men's National Teams (U-20, U-19, U-17) to Train and Play Matches in Spain from Oct. 6-15

LOS ANGELES (Saturday, Oct. 4, 2025) – In a testament to the quality and commitment to excellence of the LA Galaxy Academy, 10 First Team and Academy products have been called up to participate in both international and domestic training camps.

LA Galaxy defenders Riley Dalgado (U-20), Jose ‘Pepe' Magana, Jr. (U-19), Harbor Miller (U-19), midfielders Dylan Vanney (U-19), Vicente Garcia (U-17 2009s), and forwards Ruben Ramos, Jr. (U-19), and Aaron Medina (U-17 2009s), will all be participating in their respective international training camps to be held in Spain during the October FIFA window.

In addition, LA Galaxy Academy defender Enrique Martinez and midfielder Mateo Tsakiris were called up to the U-17 Men's National Team (2008s) domestic camp in Fayetteville, GA from Oct. 6-10. The camp is the team's last gathering before the final 21-player roster is selected for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup this November in Qatar.

These camps are a part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Notably, Alexsander Menedez (U-17 2009s) was also called in to camp with the U-17 Men's El Salvador National Team. The camp will be held in El Salvador in October.

The LA Galaxy Academy passionately believes in whole child development. The club provides a robust enrichment program including nutrition education, cognitive development, and college preparation. All these experiences are intentionally curated by experts who work with the LA Galaxy First Team, so Academy players are exposed to a well-rounded experience as they develop into young adults.

Full rosters for the camps can be found through the U.S. Men's National Team news, here and here. More information on the U-17 El Salvador Men's National Team camp, visit here.

The FIFA Club World Cup concludes this week with the semifinals and final in New Jersey.

Fluminense and Chelsea lock horns on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, before Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain contest the other match a day later at the same venue.

The winners of those semifinals will meet in the final on Sunday. Traditionally, the teams beaten in the last four would play a third-place game the day before. However, in the expanded 2025 competition, things are being done a little differently.

The Sporting News looks at FIFA's decision on a Club World Cup bronze-medal match and what it might mean for the World Cup next year.

There is no third-place playoff game at the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. This is despite the fact that a bronze-medal game was commonplace at the annual seven-team tournament that preceded the new format.

That means this week's beaten semifinalists will not have to stay in the United States to prepare for an additional fixture.

FIFA decided not to include a bronze-medal playoff game at the expanded tournament so that participating clubs could resume their domestic commitments as soon as they had been eliminated.

The sport's governing body said: "For the inaugural edition of the this elite global competition, FIFA decided not to include this match to ensure that clubs and players who do not make the final can transition to their next commitments as soon as possible."

The decision seems entirely sensible and was perhaps motivated by some of the opposition towards the Club World Cup expansion. Certainly, the majority of competing sides would not have wanted to stay in the U.S. for an additional few days after losing a semifinal simply to play in a third-place game: Fluminense are partway through their 2025 season in Brazil, while Chelsea, Real Madrid and PSG all have preseason programmes due to start in the coming week or so.

The men's World Cup in 2026 will include a third-place playoff, despite the decision not to stage such a game at the Club World Cup.

The international tournament, which will be played across the United States, Canada and Mexico, will see an expanded field of 48 national teams compete from June 11 to July 19 next year. The bronze-medal game between the losing semifinalists will take place on July 18 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

NWSL

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. (C. Morgan Engel/Getty Images)

U.S. Soccer says it is “monitoring the situation in Morocco” and “no changes have been made” ahead of the U-17 Women's World Cup later this month, which will feature the U.S. women's national team's youth squad.

The tournament kicks off in 11 days in Morocco, where youth-led, anti-government protests have disrupted major cities across the North African nation.

The U-17 women's World Cup, which features three NWSL players who were called up for Team USA, will be staged in its entirety in the city of Rabat, the nation's capital. However, as some players were saying goodbye to their clubs to join their federations, protests continued to intensify, and Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said by Thursday, at least three were killed.

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. Morocco, Spain and Portugal are jointly hosting the competition.

The protests, inspired by similar youth-led demonstrations in Asia and Latin America, began on Sept. 27 after the loosely organized, anonymous group known as “Gen Z 212” made calls through social media platforms like Discord for better education and healthcare. Protests have since spread to several major cities, and on Sunday continued for the ninth consecutive night.

The U-17 Women's World Cup begins on Oct. 17 with an opening match between Morocco and Brazil at Olympic Stadium in Rabat. In its ninth edition, only five nations have ever lifted the competition's trophy, with North Korea the reigning champions. Twenty-four nations are participating, including the U.S., which has never won the event.

The Athletic asked the federation whether changes were made to travel and security or if it had been in communication with FIFA as a result of the ongoing protests.

“Our security team is aware and is closely monitoring the situation in Morocco,” a U.S. Soccer spokesperson said. “No changes have been made at this time.”

FIFA has not responded to questions for this story as of Monday afternoon.

Morocco has been heavily investing in its efforts to grow as a footballing nation. In addition to the U17 women's World Cup, which ends Nov. 8, Morocco will host the men's Africa Cup of Nations in December. Over the summer, Morocco also hosted a belated edition of the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco was also awarded multi-year hosting rights last year for the U-17 women's World Cup. This year's tournament will mark the first time an African nation will host the competition, with Morocco scheduled to host the event annually through 2029.

“Football in Morocco has gone from strength to strength in recent years,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a news release last year. “While the men's team reached the last four at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the women's team has made such impressive strides, thanks to the support of the government and the Moroccan Football Association, and the talent of the players.

“I believe hosting the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup over five years will inspire so many more girls — and boys — to take up football in the country, and as it is the first time the tournament comes to Africa, that inspiration will spread right across the continent.”

Nine months after that statement, FIFA revealed that Morocco would co-host the men's World Cup in 2030 with Spain and Portugal. The youth-led protests over the 2030 competition have centered around the heavy spending linked to the men's World Cup.

According to The New York Times, police said in a statement they were forced to act in self-defense after protesters tried to storm a police building and seize weapons, during which two people were killed. The authorities did not say how the third person died.

The prime minister said in a televised address on Thursday that his government was ready for a “dialogue and discussion within institutions and public spaces,” The New York Times reported. Demonstrators demanded he step down instead, with Gen Z 212 on social media saying the killings amounted to “a serious human rights violation.”

The group has denounced the violence, Reuters reported on Friday, and called for new, peaceful protests in major cities.

U.S. Soccer says it is “monitoring the situation in Morocco” and “no changes have been made” ahead of the U-17 Women's World Cup later this month, which will feature the U.S. women's national team's youth squad.

The tournament kicks off in 11 days in Morocco, where youth-led, anti-government protests have disrupted major cities across the North African nation.

The U-17 women's World Cup, which features three NWSL players who were called up for Team USA, will be staged in its entirety in the city of Rabat, the nation's capital. However, as some players were saying goodbye to their clubs to join their federations, protests continued to intensify, and Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said by Thursday, at least three were killed.

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. Morocco, Spain and Portugal are jointly hosting the competition.

The protests, inspired by similar youth-led demonstrations in Asia and Latin America, began on Sept. 27 after the loosely organized, anonymous group known as “Gen Z 212” made calls through social media platforms like Discord for better education and healthcare. Protests have since spread to several major cities, and on Sunday continued for the ninth consecutive night.

The U-17 Women's World Cup begins on Oct. 17 with an opening match between Morocco and Brazil at Olympic Stadium in Rabat. In its ninth edition, only five nations have ever lifted the competition's trophy, with North Korea the reigning champions. Twenty-four nations are participating, including the U.S., which has never won the event.

The Athletic asked the federation whether changes were made to travel and security or if it had been in communication with FIFA as a result of the ongoing protests.

“Our security team is aware and is closely monitoring the situation in Morocco,” a U.S. Soccer spokesperson said. “No changes have been made at this time.”

FIFA has not responded to questions for this story as of Monday afternoon.

Morocco has been heavily investing in its efforts to grow as a footballing nation. In addition to the U17 women's World Cup, which ends Nov. 8, Morocco will host the men's Africa Cup of Nations in December. Over the summer, Morocco also hosted a belated edition of the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco was also awarded multi-year hosting rights last year for the U-17 women's World Cup. This year's tournament will mark the first time an African nation will host the competition, with Morocco scheduled to host the event annually through 2029.

“Football in Morocco has gone from strength to strength in recent years,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a news release last year. “While the men's team reached the last four at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the women's team has made such impressive strides, thanks to the support of the government and the Moroccan Football Association, and the talent of the players.

“I believe hosting the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup over five years will inspire so many more girls — and boys — to take up football in the country, and as it is the first time the tournament comes to Africa, that inspiration will spread right across the continent.”

Nine months after that statement, FIFA revealed that Morocco would co-host the men's World Cup in 2030 with Spain and Portugal. The youth-led protests over the 2030 competition have centered around the heavy spending linked to the men's World Cup.

According to The New York Times, police said in a statement they were forced to act in self-defense after protesters tried to storm a police building and seize weapons, during which two people were killed. The authorities did not say how the third person died.

The prime minister said in a televised address on Thursday that his government was ready for a “dialogue and discussion within institutions and public spaces,” The New York Times reported. Demonstrators demanded he step down instead, with Gen Z 212 on social media saying the killings amounted to “a serious human rights violation.”

The group has denounced the violence, Reuters reported on Friday, and called for new, peaceful protests in major cities.

World Cup

World Cup 2026

Countdown

 

The emails arrive, unannounced, around a week before U.S. men's national team camps open. Sent by U.S. Soccer and delivered to players, they bear roster news and trigger contrasting emotions. For the two dozen or so players called up to the USMNT, “it's an amazing feeling,” says midfielder Jack McGlynn. For others, there's disappointment. And month after month, camp after camp, no phone call from Mauricio Pochettino ever comes.

Pochettino, the U.S. coach, never calls players to explain roster decisions. Nor does he communicate with them much, if at all, between camps.

The radio silence is a stark departure from what many U.S. players experienced under their previous coach, Gregg Berhalter, but it cuts to the core of Pochettino's managerial philosophy and USMNT rebuild.

“The players don't need to know,” Pochettino said last week when asked why he doesn't explain his squad decisions. Deep down, he believes, they should already know why they were worthy or unworthy. And they should be “desperate to perform … to grind … to convince us to call again.”

They should compete for their place in the USMNT and shouldn't need a FaceTime chat or WhatsApp message to reassure or inspire them. They should be focused, day after day, on improving at their clubs.

So, whereas Berhalter and his assistants would send players video clips or a simple check-in text regularly, Pochettino did not speak at all with his star, Christian Pulisic, from May until September.

And it's not just Pulisic; it's everyone, and it's calculated.

“We decided that the communication with players shouldn't be (happening) while they are in their clubs — (to) not interfere on the day-to-day processes, their routines, their habits,” Jesús Pérez, Pochettino's top assistant coach, told The Athletic.

The players are, instead, left to interpret Pochettino's choices and public comments on their own. At least 10 USMNT players have confirmed that they hardly speak with Pochettino outside of camps — though many have said they don't have any issues with the lack of communication. When, for example, striker Josh Sargent learned via email that he'd miss out on the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, he “didn't really hear any word from the coaching staff.” In fact, he didn't speak at all with them between March and September.

“But at the same time, I know they don't have to call me,” Sargent said last month. “I understand. I kind of just took it as rest up during the offseason and hit the ground running with Norwich to make sure I'm back into the next camp” — which he was.

The lack of correspondence is not uncommon in international soccer. Across the world, and perhaps across generations, approaches vary. Former French star Thierry Henry experienced what he calls the “old-school” custom: “You speak when you're in your national team.” Former England defender Jamie Carragher, speaking on the same Zoom call with reporters last month, said: “I mean, I didn't even think (then-England manager) Sven-Goran Eriksson knew who I was.”

Tata Martino, who has coached three national teams, told The Athletic that he communicated less with players outside of camps when leading Argentina, but did visit Mexico players personally in the buildup to the 2022 World Cup.

“Everyone can feel whether they need to do it or not,” Martino said.

For most U.S. players, though, the norm was Berhalter. The new norm has, perhaps, required an adjustment.

“Every coach is very different,” Pulisic said on a CBS Sports podcast in June. “I've had coaches who I've communicated with daily, who want to talk and get things off their brain, and talk to their players. And I've always appreciated that, for sure, when people make an effort to care about the player, but also the person, too.”

Pulisic clarified, though, that he “(doesn't) have an issue with” with Pochettino's style. “Has it been slightly different with some of my other national team coaches? Yeah. But that's not something that I'm looking into too much.”

When Berhalter took the U.S. job in late 2018, communication was one of his very first initiatives. He flew to Europe and met with around a dozen players in eight days, he recently told The Athletic. He sat down with Pulisic for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Germany. He established contact with domestic players, too, and kept in touch. There were phone calls and FaceTimes. Having come from club coaching, where he could talk with and teach players daily, virtual communication became crucial — because players only spend around eight weeks per year with their national teams.

“To me, it was about building bonds with these guys, and really supporting them,” Berhalter told The Athletic in an August interview.

When asked about his communication with Pulisic, specifically, he said: “It wasn't that transactional. We would talk, we would catch up. ‘Hey, how you doing? How's life going? You're in a busy stretch, you need anything from us?'”

There were, though, chats about tactics. “They watch every game, they reach out to me after some games,” defender Aaron Long said of Berhalter's staff in 2019. Some of the outreach was: “Hey Aaron, how you feeling? How you doing?” Some of it was: “Hey, do you remember this play? What do you think about that? I was thinking maybe you could do this instead.” Game film, via platforms like Hudl, also featured regularly.

Berhalter's systems of play were often detailed and intricate. Players had specific roles and movements. The goal of the outreach, at times, was to soft-launch on-field ideas, so that they weren't foreign when players arrived at camp on Monday ahead of a Thursday game.

And it was to build trust.

“To me,” Berhalter said, “there's a lot of work that needs to be done with relationships, all the time, whenever you're coaching a team. It's not about just what you're doing on the field.”

Former U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard agrees with that idea. He told The Athletic that, “on a very functional team, your best players, your senior players should be having normal regular conversations with the coach; text messages and calls. So the fact that that's not happening is somewhat eye-opening.”

One criticism of the Berhalter era, though, was that in identifying his core players, others felt overlooked and unable to break in, no matter what they might be doing at club level — and no matter whether those core players were in form at their respective clubs.

When Pochettino took the U.S. job in 2024, he adopted a very different approach. It was, in part, informed by the idea that he needed to “open the window to way more players,” as Pérez said.

In the month after finalizing his contract, before his first training camp last October, Pochettino did not reach out to a single player. “By coincidence,” he recalled last year, while out for dinner at Clap London, a Japanese restaurant near where he lives, he ran into USMNT defender Antonee Robinson, who plays for local club Fulham.

But there were no calls or introductory texts.

“Because we didn't have time,” Pochettino said. “I don't want to call only for the reason to say, ‘Oh, I call some guy, or another.' I think all deserve the same way for us to operate.”

There was another reason, too. Pochettino carried it with him after 15 years coaching clubs. “When we were in clubs,” Pérez told The Athletic, constant communication between players and their national team coaches was “something that we found unfair.”

“So,” Pérez continued, “shall I call Pulisic to comment (on) the great run (against Napoli) and his assist?” Their answer is no. “It's his coach(‘s job),” Pérez said.

Instead, the staff prioritized building relationships with players' coaches and their clubs.

“Why? Because Milan staff knows a lot more about Christian than us, because they are working every day with him,” Pérez explained. And Seattle Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer knows a lot more about Cristian Roldan; Columbus Crew coach Wilfried Nancy knows a lot more about Max Arfsten.

So, when Pérez visited Columbus, he sat down with Nancy for a 90-minute lunch. When Miguel D'Agostino, another assistant coach, visited Seattle, he met Roldan, but spent more time speaking with Schmetzer and his staff.

“He appreciated the thoughts that we were conveying to him about what we did at the club,” Schmetzer said. “All of us have different ways of skinning the cat, or winning, or being successful. … When you spoke to [D'Agostino], you could just feel the passion that they had about what they were trying to develop with the culture of the [U.S. team]. And so I was in. I was drinking the Kool Aid right away.”

Pochettino's assistants have visited most, if not all clubs that employ USMNT candidates, but “when we visit clubs, the less important (thing) is to talk to the players,” Pérez said.

Roldan, meanwhile, never spoke with Pochettino, and told The Athletic last month: “I didn't know if I was even on the radar.” But he kept grinding, proving himself as an unheralded MLS star, and out of nowhere, three days into the September camp, a call finally came. A month later, Roldan is back with the group, because his behavior impressed Pochettino, on the field and off it.

“I didn't know Cristian,” Pochettino said. But in a span of six days, Roldan became a “good example of how you need to want to be involved and defend and fight for your place.”

That, in a nutshell, is the Pochettino archetype. He doesn't need to know players. He essentially doesn't want them to care what he says. He wants them all to feel a constant, healthy pressure to perform.

So the staff keeps a relative distance between camps. The ultimate motive is the one Pochettino outlined in a six-minute manifesto at his news conference last week.

“If you bring in a player and say, ‘Oh, I love you,' but after, he's not performing, and you are not going to call (him, he might) say, ‘Hey, but you told me you love me,'” Pochettino explained. Too much communication, in other words, can send the wrong message and create problems where there doesn't have to be one.

Whereas communication built bonds and helped solidify Berhalter's in-group, Pochettino seems to hope the lack of communication outside camps now makes any player believe he can break into the group — or fall out of it. It simplifies the job, in a way. Play well, perform your best, and there is no talking or explaining necessary.

Arfsten, who confirmed there's “not too much” contact between him and U.S. coaches outside camp, told The Athletic: “For the most part, you just got to talk with your performance.”

But the lack of communication outside of camp doesn't mean the staff doesn't value building bonds during their time together.

When Pochettino arrived last fall, as a $6 million man who'd coached and played at levels most of his players haven't, and who hadn't reached out to break ice, there was, perhaps, some discomfort between them. The early days, defender Tim Ream later said, were “a learning process.”

Pochettino and his staff “kind of come off as intimidating when you first come into camp, because they have such a good CV, and they've coached some of the best players in the world,” defender Chris Richards admitted this summer.

What Richards and others learned throughout the Gold Cup, though, is that, “once you finally get to meet them, you understand that they're all just big teddy bears.” After 36 days together, Richards said, the “coaching staff and players are starting to really understand each other.”

Pochettino's bet, essentially, is that the understanding and bonds can be built in camp, when players and staff are actually together. The building is complicated by inevitable absences and truncated time frames. But it happened this past summer, and perhaps it can happen over the next nine months.

Ream, who has often been Pochettino's captain, heaped praise on the coaches for how they went about building those relationships during the Gold Cup, in their first extended time with the team.

“Whether (a player is) first on the starting 11 or if they haven't played a minute, the treatment of everybody is the exact same,” Ream said.

“I think as camps have gone on, you get a better understanding of them as people,” he later continued. “You get a better understanding of their communication styles, their coaching styles. Their interpersonal relationship that they have with each player is very different. And you start to have those interactions enough, and more and more, you start to get (to a point where) you're not thinking as much. … The interactions off the field have gone a long way in helping guys feel a lot more relaxed.

“Just the way they (the coaches) are, and as the camps have gone on, it has helped a lot of guys calm down and just be themselves more and more.”

Fifa is promising the biggest and best World Cup ever in 2026, but will that really be the case?

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has repeatedly insisted that "the world will be welcome" during next summer's men's World Cup, which will be held mostly by the USA, with some matches in Canada and Mexico.

"We'll bring the world to the United States of America," the Swiss said earlier this year. "The world loves America, whatever some might say."

But the nearer the start of the tournament draws, the more scrutiny is being placed on whether the USA will be quite as welcoming as Infantino insists.

With political violence on the rise, state troops deployed to major cities by President Donald Trump, and a more hardline stance taken on immigration, the tournament's main host nation is in a state of division and disruption.

As ticket sales begin and fans make travel plans, BBC Sport explores some of the issues causing concern.

Last week the first batch of tickets for next summer's matches went on sale, with more than 4.5 million fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them. 

Immediately, Fifa's approach to pricing drew significant backlash.

Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues last week.

General admission tickets are being split into four categories, with those for the first match in the USA costing between $560 (£417) and $2,235 (£1,662). At the last World Cup in Qatar, the opening match was priced between $55 (£41) and $618 (£460).

The cheapest ticket for the 2026 final costs $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive is $6,000 (£4,462). Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher.

Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats.

The Athletic also reports, external that Fifa will also implement 15% charges on both the buyer and seller of tickets resold via its official platform.

Fifa did not respond to questions put forward by the BBC.

"These prices are astonishing - $2,030 for the cheapest final ticket is unacceptable," said Thomas Concannon, who leads the Football Supporters Association's England Fans' Embassy.

"If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 (£2,363) at least. That is more than double what Qatar cost.

"Combined with travel and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for match-going fans we've ever seen by some distance."

Fifa is also adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods.

The system has the potential to benefit Americans while locking out foreign fans.

"Dynamic pricing has really been a thing here for more than a decade," said Scott Friedman, found of the Ticket Talk Network in the USA. "For Fifa, it's supply and demand - they are trying to maximise their revenue.

"The system gives an advantage to American citizens who can maybe buy a resale ticket for a game which has less demand at much less than face value 48 hours before a match. 

"People can't really travel from overseas to do that. The system is not fair for the rest of the world and could definitely price out people from other countries."

During his previous term in office, when the World Cup bid was accepted, Trump signed a letter insisting that "all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination".

Some fans, including those from the UK and EU, will be able to travel to the World Cup without a visa. That is because 42 territories are in the USA's Visa Waiver Program, meanings fans will only need to apply via the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, which is usually approved or rejected within 72 hours.

But citizens of most countries, especially those in Asia, Africa and South America - including plenty who have either already secured qualification for the World Cup or are likely do so - do have to apply for visas.

While Russia and Qatar implemented visa fast-track processes at the previous two editions of the World Cup, the USA has not done so.

Fans hoping to attend matches must apply and enter the same queue as other visitors to the US, and can face delays so long that they may be unable to be approved for a visa in time to attend the tournament.

Applications for US visas usually involve at least one face-to-face interview at an embassy, and the Trump administration has increased its officials' powers to investigate applicants' social media use and public political statements.

As things stand, average wait times for an initial tourist visa interview for some countries are well over a year.

Last week the State Department announced it will increase staffing levels at some embassies in order to try to process applications more quickly, but hasn't revealed which countries or how many staff.

"We have a long way to go before we're ready to welcome the world," said Travis Murphy, a former State Department diplomat and founder of Jetr Global Sports, which helps international athletes access US visas.

"The current administration has been outspoken in terms of limiting international travel, and putting restrictions into some processes to make it more difficult.

"The visa process in the USA has not been very clear or efficient for decades. The regulations really haven't changed that much - how strictly some of the rules are enforced is really what is [important] here.

"You also have this over-arching view that maybe people aren't welcome or are unsafe here. I don't think that's accurate, but I can see why international audiences would have that perception.

"I would hate to see our country put itself in a position where future events might be pulled away because of how we handle this."

The current wait time for a US visa interview, in which applicants have to convince an individual official that their visit should be permitted, is up to 15 months in Colombia

There have been a series of political assassinations in the USA so far in 2025, and there were around 500 mass shootings across the country in 2024.

Forced deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have also increased on the orders of Trump, who has deployed National Guard troops in Democrat-led cities, including Los Angeles, which will host eight matches. 

ICE and National Guard deployments have drawn mass protests from distrustful communities in some cities, and Trump has threatened to force matches to be moved from cities he deems "unsafe".

"There is no question the divisions in the United States are considerable," says Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an American think tank. "On different issues, depending on the day, the president or some of his key people are trying to push a more polarised agenda. There is a lot of anger.

"With the Trump administration, there are lot of 'we don't know' answers in terms of security, because they don't yet have much of a track record for big events.

"There has been a pretty steady dismantling of a lot of the government agencies - cuts at the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. With that comes not only loss of people, but loss of institutional knowledge.

"There are lots of individuals who can be disruptive and dangerous. And the United States, of course, has ready access to firearms in a way that most countries do not."

Who has qualified for FIFA World Cup 2026? Updated list of nations confirmed for tournament in USA, Canada and Mexico originally appeared on The Sporting News

The next FIFA World Cup is just nine months away, with the United States, Canada and Mexico poised to host the 23rd edition in 2026.

Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory with Argentina at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and are leading the way in CONMEBOL qualifying for the next World Cup.

The 2026 tournament will be the first time 48 teams have competed at the World Cup finals, expanding from the 32-team format that was used at seven consecutive tournaments from 1998 to 2022.

That means the equation has changed for teams looking to qualify from the six regional confederations — AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. So, what does the road to the 2026 World Cup look like?

Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five.

CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff.

Of note, Uzbekistan and Jordan both qualified for their first-ever World Cup appearances in the summer of 2025. By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition.

The AFCbegan its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The top two in each of Group A, B and C qualify automatically for the World Cup.

Japan were the first confirmed qualifiers from the Asian section, already assured of a place in the top two of Group C by the middle of the March international break. Iran soon followed them in securing their spot via Group A, and Uzbekistan secured their first-ever World Cup spot by finishing second behind Iran.

The teams placed third and fourth in each group will advance to a fourth round that is split between two groups of three, with each team to face each of the opponents in its group once in October 2025. The two group winners will progress directly to the World Cup, with the runners-up contesting a two-leg playoff in November 2025 to decide which AFC representative will advance to the intercontinental playoff.

Nine groups of six teams play each other home and away in Africa. The winner of each section at the end of the 10 games progresses directly to the World Cup.

The four best runners-up from the initial round-robin phase enter into a playoff, with the winner going forward to the intercontinental playoff as CAF's representative.

CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team will play every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concludes in June 2025.

The top two in each group advance to the 12-team third round, where there will be three groups of four. Beginning in September 2025, the nations in each group play one another home and away. The three group winners advance to the World Cup, with the two best-ranked runners-up going into the intercontinental playoff.

South America has retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format.

The expanded World Cup means qualification is a little easier, with the top six advancing automatically and the seventh-placed team entering the intercontinental playoff, probably as favourite.

Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil.

The 2026 World Cup is the first time the OFC has been guaranteed a representative at the finals. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three.

The top two in each round-two group advanced to a three-match playoff in March 2025. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other.

New Zealand then claimed the automatic qualifying place by winning the OFC final 3-0. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get their, albeit a slim one.

Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots will be taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. The 12 runners-up, along with the four best UEFA Nations League group winners that finished outside of the top two in their World Cup qualifying groups, enter the playoffs.

Those 16 teams will be drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The seeded teams will be at home in the semifinals, with a home nation for the four finals to be drawn prior to the match. The winners from each path advance to the World Cup. UEFA is the only confederation without a representative in the inter-continental playoff.

The two teams in the six-nation playoff with the highest FIFA ranking will be seeded. The four unseeded teams play an effective semifinal, with the two winners progressing to face a seed apiece to decide the final two places at the World Cup.

The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in one or more of the host countries.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, with co-hosts Mexico in action at the Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The overall span of 40 days will make this the longest World Cup in history, with the 48 finalists contesting a total of 104 matches.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw takes place on December 5, 2025 in Washington, D.C.

					Facts Are Stubborn Things				

A coalition of community organizations and documentary filmmaker Billy Corben on Thursday called again on FIFA and Miami-Dade to use their influence to protect soccer fans from federal immigration agents roaming stadiums during next year's World Cup tournament.

At a demonstration in front of FIFA's Coral Gables office, they pressured officials to protect World Cup attendees from “overzealous immigration enforcement” and to reinvest Miami-Dade County tax dollars set aside for the World Cup into the local community. They held a similar protest in June.

“Miami-Dade is a proud county of immigrants, and we are subsidizing the World Cup with over $60 million in public cash and resources,” Corben said during Thursday's press conference. “In a year in which we suffered a $400 million budget deficit, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is failing us all.”

The activists say their fears about immigration agents are warranted, citing last week's New York Times report that revealed “FIFA was alerted to 145 human rights concerns at Club World Cup games, including federal policies and enforcement.”

The Times reported there were complaints of alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at stadiums during the tournament.

“We unequivocally believe that any human rights plan that does not include protections for fans who are immigrants living in the United States or visiting the country is incomplete, and we urge the Miami Host Committee to commit to no immigration enforcement in or near the stadiums during the games,” the activists said in a statement announcing Thursday protest.

They warn that the stakes are too high in a state with an aggressive posture toward immigration.

“The potential for due process abuses, racial profiling, and for fans to lose their liberties and freedoms is far too great,” they said, noting that the backdrop in Florida “includes the reopening of the Everglades [Alligator Alcatraz] facility and news of a Mexican national on a tourist visa who was detained and deported.”

“The Trump Administration's recent immigration policies have affected both staff and fans,” they said. “The time for FIFA to act is now.”

Since the first protest on June 30, activists said an official of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee contacted them, according to Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, Policy Coordinator with American Friends Service Committee. She said no meeting date with FIFA has been set.

“This is an international game. They need to meet with people who deal with immigrants,” Mendez-Zamora told WLRN.

She added: “I want to be in the stadium with my family screaming, but it's not worth it if it means people are going to be taken [into federal custody].”

Amy Morales, director of advocacy and policy for Engage Miami, said community nonprofits had to fight for full funding before county commissioners at the same time the World Cup was getting $46 million in subsidies from the county.

“What we're saying here today is that we do not want our taxpayer dollars funding the separation of families — funding deportations,” Morales said to WLRN.

Luna Plaza, a migrant justice committee member of the Florida Student Power Network attended both protests. The University of Miami student said she was disappointed activists were not able to speak with FIFA after the first demonstration but hopes that the second one will prompt a meeting.

“Sports, in general, shapes all of our lives,” Plaza told WLRN. “It's really saddening to hear that so many safe spaces are being taken away for undocumented folks — including sports. It's just really messed up.”

Nicolai Budkov Kjaer is quickly proving himself as one of the brightest young talents on the ATP Challenger Tour.


On Sunday, the 19-year-old claimed his fourth title of the season at the Open de Vendee in France, where he stormed past American Patrick Kypson 6-0, 6-3 in just 54 minutes. The Norwegian is now level with Borna Coric and Emilio Nava atop the 2025 Challenger-title leaderboard.


“I'm super grateful and super happy to get the trophy here,” said Budkov Kjaer. “It was a great week with a lot of great tennis played and it was a super nice tournament.”


Up two places to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Budkov Kjaer improved his chances of qualifying for his maiden trip to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 20-and-under event will be held 17-21 December.

Coco Gauff used to live and die by the hoodie. Now the World No. 3, who has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in in 2025, has established herself as a bona fide trendsetter.

Over the course of her career, as Coco Gauff's game has evolved, so too has her fashion sense.

She's now regarded as one of the most fashion-forward players on the Hologic WTA Tour, a true trendsetter. It's quite a long way from when she first turned pro back in 2018, when she lived and died by the hoodie.

"I used to be a hoodie connoisseur," the World No. 3 said ahead of her opening-round match at this week's Wuhan Open. "I owned, like, 70-something hoodies and having all those ... it was really bad. My mom had told me I had to stop buying hoodies. And then, when I turned maybe 17 or 18, I just stopped. And now I don't really grab a hoodie unless I go to the airport. But yeah, I didn't know what my fashion was going to be, so I feel like I was just conserving myself.

"Now I'm a lot more expressive of what I wear on and off the court. It's really fun. I like wearing clothes. I'm not very talented in a lot of things, so I think clothes is just a way to express myself."

We'd argue Gauff's lack of talent argument, as she's won two Grand Slam titles and is firmly entrenched in the Top 5 ahead of the year-end WTA Finals in Riyadh, where she's already qualified and is the defending champion.

As for her fashion on court, it's been on point (and very intentional). The American has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in this year, each of which has received rave reviews.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

As for her wardrobe off the court, she doesn't plan much in advance. Gauff takes an organic, in-the-moment approach: How she feels when she gets out of bed dictates her choice for the day.

"It just depends on the mood," the 21-year-old said. "Some days I wake up feeling really feminine and [I want to wear] skirts and stuff. Other days I wake up feeling like a tomboy. It just kind of depends on what my mood is, which is why it's always hard for me to plan outfits in advance. I never know what I'm going to feel like in the moment."

The French Open champion arrives in Wuhan coming off a semifinal showing in Beijing, where she lost in straight sets to eventual champion Amanda Anisimova. 

She received a bye in the first round of Wuhan, the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025, and will play unseeded Moyuka Uchijima in the second round.

A ball kid enjoyed his moment in the sun on Monday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he came to the aid of Felix Auger-Aliassime in the closing stages of the Canadian's clash against Jesper de Jong.

Serving at 6-4, 4-5, 15/30, the No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings put on his running shoes to track down a drop shot from the Dutchman but was unable to make up the ground. After lunging forward to get a racquet on the ball, Auger-Aliassime took a slight tumble and found himself sitting on the hard courts at the ATP Masters 1000 event.

Just as he was preparing to return to his feet, a ball kid made his way onto court and offered his hands to the 25-year-old, who was successfully pulled to his feet, with the ball kid receiving loud cheers from the crowd.

Auger-Aliassime went on to seal a 6-4, 7-5 win and will next play Lorenzo Musetti or Luciano Darderi. Auger-Aliassime is 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is aiming to make his second appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, to be held from 9-16 November. He holds a 36-19 record on the season, according to Infosys ATP Stats and married long-term partner Nina last month.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Max Verstappen had to settle for second between George Russell and Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen shared mixed feelings after a hard-fought run to second position in Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix, having “struggled a lot” behind the wheel of his Red Bull throughout the race.

Red Bull headed to the high-downforce Marina Bay Street Circuit aiming to validate the apparent progress they have made with their RB21, following back-to-back wins for Verstappen in low-downforce conditions at Monza and Baku.

While Verstappen's run to second in Qualifying and the Grand Prix continued that positive trend, the reigning four-time World Champion was made to work harder than he wanted to inside the cockpit.

Verstappen was heard complaining about shift problems in particular, at one stage describing his car as “undriveable” after locking up and narrowly avoiding the barriers at Turn 14, but he survived to come home between George Russell's Mercedes and Lando Norris' McLaren.

“It was a bit more difficult than I would have hoped for, to be honest,” Verstappen reflected afterwards. “For whatever reason in the race I was struggling a lot with the downshifts and upshifts of the car. It was giving me a lot of pushing under braking, which on a street circuit you don't want!

“The car was also not where I wanted it to be, unfortunately. A few things of course to learn from that, I think, from some decisions that we made throughout the weekend in terms of the set-up.

“We didn't do a proper long run [during practice], so that doesn't help. But it's not like it's a mystery why it didn't go so well in the race, so we just need to analyse that.”

Nonetheless, Verstappen added: “Even if the balance would have been perfect, I think second was still the best possible, because you can't pass around here. As you could see, I think for more than an hour I had Lando behind me, and I think he was clearly faster, but you can't pass.

“Of course, we went for a different strategy at the start with the soft [tyre], knowing that the left-hand side grid was very dirty, which we measured over the weekend. We had to take a risk. For me, that first stint was all about just managing to go long enough.”

As for how much encouragement can be taken from the weekend, given that he finished ahead of both McLaren drivers once again despite the higher downforce track characteristics, Verstappen maintained a cautious tone.

“We were more competitive, but I think it's still not our favourite layout, let's say it like that,” the Dutchman commented. “[But] maybe some other tracks will come to us a bit more, so we just have to see it race by race.”

Verstappen's latest result has seen him make further progress in the Drivers' Championship, moving to within 41 points of Norris and 63 points of championship leader Oscar Piastri.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Kimi Antonelli looks back on how his race unfolded for Mercedes at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli was left with mixed feelings after the Singapore Grand Prix, believing more was possible as his Mercedes team mate went on to secure victory around the Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Whilst the youngster was able to join George Russell on the podium in Canada as the latter won in Montreal, he finished fifth in Singapore on a night where the Mercedes car, in the hands of Russell, kept the Red Bull of Max Verstappen at bay with ease to win.

Antonelli was swift to point to two areas where he felt the weekend got away from him. The first was Qualifying, where he felt he did not do quite a good enough job in Q3 as his team mate grabbed pole.

The second area was the start of the race itself, where the youngster lost out to both the McLaren of Lando Norris, and Charles Leclerc's Ferrari.

“The start was difficult, left-hand side of the grid was a bit worse than the right-hand side, [it] was a bit dirtier and a bit more difficult to do a good start,” he explained after the race.

“It was a shame as it defined a bit the race. As we have seen previously, track position is extremely important. [I] lost a couple of places at the start, then [got] stuck behind Leclerc.

“The pace was really good to be honest, I felt really good in the car and just a bit disappointed because the potential was higher. I think with a better Q3, [it] could have been a different story but we'll try to do better next time.”

Antonelli was unable to get past Leclerc in the first stint, despite running within DRS range of the Ferrari for lap after lap. But once both drivers had bolted on the hard tyre, the Mercedes man was able to pull off a pass, one of very few around a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult.

That left him to come home fifth at the flag, to back up his P4 from Azerbaijan. After a tricky time of it in Europe through the summer, with that entire run of races in his home continent yielding just three points, Antonelli seems to have bounced right back into some much better form for the flyaway races.

“It was a tough race physically but I'm happy with how I managed to battle back," he continued. "The pace was good, and I was able to gain a position back with a good move on Leclerc. We could have achieved more tonight but P5 is still okay."

One of the hallmarks of the race in Singapore was how the W16 handled the hot conditions, with Mercedes normally going much better than their rivals when conditions cool off. Toto Wolff has famously joked that his team does well whenever he is forced into wearing a sweater, but that was definitely not the case in Singapore when humidity touched 80% at times.

“Definitely the car is getting stronger and stronger,” agreed Antonelli. “I'm able to really put the car where I want and really play with the car so that is a real positive one and, yeah, just really looking forward to the next few races.

“Congratulations to George for winning the race. He did a great job and maximised the result and also congratulations to McLaren for winning the Constructors' and congratulations to our department as well – they've done an incredible job [going] back-to-back, our engine is winning the Championship so incredible job from them as well.”

BLACKPINK's JISOO has hinted at the release of a surprise duet this month.


	On Monday (Oct. 6), she unveiled a mysterious teaser image on social media, featuring a shadowed male silhouette standing behind her, with the word “EYESCLOSED” written across the frame — suggesting an upcoming collaboration. “A duet is near,” the caption reads. A second post brought the shadowed male closer to the forefront, with the caption: “two voices, one orbit. coming soon.”


	The mysterious collaborator has been revealed to be Zayn Malik, a former member of One Direction.

	In the teaser, JISOO stands in the foreground while the male figure looms behind her — his back turned, adding intrigue to the release.

	











	Zayn was previously seen attending BLACKPINK's New York concert on July 27, accompanied by his daughter, Khai. After the show, he shared a photo from the audience with the caption:“@BLACKPINKOFFICIAL THANK YOU 🙂 ME & KHAI LOVED IT,” sparking curiosity about the connection between the two artists.


	The upcoming duet will mark JISOO's first new music release since her solo EP Amortage in February, which featured tracks like “Earthquake,” “Your Love” and “Hugs & Kisses.”




	JISOO is currently on BLACKPINK's Deadline world tour, which began in Seoul in July and will resume in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on Oct. 18 following a brief break after the group's London shows in August.

It's aliiiiive, and it just screened at Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque! On Sunday night, Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein” had a surprise showing at the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles. Following a marathon screening of his earlier works (“Cronos,” “The Devil's Backbone,” and “Mimic”), the beloved Mexican filmmaker invited stars Mia Goth and Jacob Elordi to help introduce their new movie to a ravenous genre audience.

“They were ecstatic,” said Beyond Fest co-founder Christian Parkes in an interview with IndieWire on Monday. Previously shown at the Venice International Film Festival (where IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio gave it a “B,” and again at a secret screening at Telluride), “Frankenstein” is expected in limited theaters on October 17 and will hit Netflix on November 7.

“We didn't know that was happening, really happening, until that afternoon,”  said Parkes. “The projectionists didn't even know.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






“Guillermo making a move the night before and saying, ‘Hey, I want to show my film!' — that is all him,” said co-founder Grant Moninger. “But he's part of the People's Republic of Beyond Fest by doing that.”

 










“Frankenstein” is among the most anticipated horror releases left in 2025, but Beyond Fest organizers didn't even ask to screen the film. Del Toro offered the West Coast premiere to them the day before during a different block of his retrospective series (“Crimson Peak,” “Nightmare Alley,” and “The Shape of Water” also played the Egyptian), and thanks to the American Cinematheque, they pulled it off.

“He just nonchalantly threw it out to the crowd,” said Parkes. “He was like, ‘Let's just show the movie tomorrow!' And then it was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that's kind of nuts!' You have to ingest the film and make sure it works. It wasn't really until six o'clock — doors were at seven — that we did the tech check and we were like, ‘OK, this can actually happen.'” 

Beyond Fest has been around since 2011, but this year's edition marks unprecedented success for the most popular genre event in Los Angeles. With just two days left, organizers are projecting record attendance with approximately 30,000 festivalgoers coming from across the city and around the world. After a difficult year for Californians, it was an electric homecoming for weirdo cinephiles — and a needed outlet for plenty of local film lovers who, as always, got to see many screenings for free.

 










“It's been gradual growth,” said programmer Evrim Ersoy, who has been with the fest since year two but sat out this year to manage social media from his home in London. “Slowly but surely, we're building the people's trust, and these filmmakers are coming to us,” he said.

Exclusivity can be key to making a movie or event seem “cool,” and the sudden activation of “Frankenstein” was an electric highlight this weekend. But while other genre promoters jockey for access, Beyond Fest insists they don't worry about premiere status. The “pipe dream” event got started on a fake-it-til-you-make-it mentality 14 years ago, and organizers have kept the faith ever since. 

“It's like, who cares? We'll have studios that come to us and say, ‘Look, we're going to go big with you in L.A., but we have opportunities elsewhere,'” said Parkes. “My response is always, ‘Is going elsewhere going to help your film? Then go do it!' Because the people that come to our theater on a Friday night, they want to see the film. They're not coming because it has to be the premiere.”

Beyond Fest is dedicated to expanding how the movie business defines “genre” in a city that, no matter how the rest of the industry fares, still owns awards season. Del Toro's “Frankenstein” has been compared to Robert Eggers' “Nosferatu,” and early spectators for next year's Oscars race could see this premiere as a step on that path.

 










Straddling the divide between fan-facing genre events, like Fantasia Fest in Montreal, and the more prestige international festivals that are always along the path to the Academy Awards, Beyond is bridging a critical divide by commingling the best of the best genre programming — across horror, arthouse, anime, and more — with the fervent excitement of attendees who celebrate it all like a midnight movie.

“We've never paid to advertise,” said Moninger. “There's such a love of these films, and it's a rabid audience. That's why it grows to 16 days every year. It's like, ‘Maybe we'll do nine!' — or, ‘Maybe we'll do eight!' And it always ends up being 16. We want to make sure everyone can go see something.”

From the first 70mm print of Brady Corbet's “The Brutalist,” to the West Coast premiere of Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite,” Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque programming has organically turned into an “overarching umbrella, where all of these films can live through their connective genre tissue,” said Parkes. “Time and time again, filmmakers after their screening, they thank us and they say, ‘That's exactly who I made my film for.'”

“We've had a second screen for a long time,” said Ersoy — shouting out Beyond Fest at American Cinemtheque's shorts programming as well. “It's always been about highlighting films that people wouldn't normally take a chance on. Everyone's heard del Toro's ‘Frankenstein' is coming, but maybe this helped them find something else. We showed this anime that's coming along, ‘100 Meters,' that's absolutely stunning.”

 










Beyond boasted the West Coast premiere of Best Picture winner “Anora” last year, and Sean Baker was back to host a chat with the legendary Japanese actress Meiko Kaji (“Lady Snowblood,” “Blind Woman's Curse”) for her first-ever U.S. appearance in 2025. With the reigning Best Director winner practically popping in just to say hi — and del Toro across town literally tossing out “Frankenstein” t-shirts — Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque has established itself as an award-worthy monster maker capable of winning the fight too many genre lovers feared was finished when “The Substance” lost.

“I look forward to the day when someone else can take this mantle so that we can sleep,” said Parkes. “Until then, we'll just keep doing it.”

	With “Which One,” Drake strings together his fourth No. 1 in a row on the list — all coming in 2025. “Nokia” reigned for two weeks in May, followed by the PARTYNEXTDOOR and Cash Cobain collaboration “Somebody Loves Me” in July for a week and the three-week rule of “What Did I Miss?” beginning in August.

	That run equals Drake's longest streak of rulers on Rhythmic Airplay. He previously went four in a row between 2018 and 2019, albeit largely as a featured act on Bad Bunny's “MIA” and Meek Mill's “Going Bad” and Chris Brown's “No Guidance,” followed by a lead-act reign of his own via “Money in the Grave,” featuring Rick Ross.


	It's also Drake's fourth nonconsecutive calendar year with at least four No. 1s, as well as his first with four or more No. 1s as a lead act since 2016.




	His 43rd No. 1 extends his record for the most Rhythmic Airplay toppers in the chart's 33-year history.


Most No. 1s, Rhythmic Airplay:43, Drake17, Rihanna16, The Weeknd14, Chris Brown13, Bruno Mars13, Lil Wayne13, Usher12, Beyonce12, Nicki Minaj


	As for Central Cee, “Which One” is his first Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 in his eighth appearance on the ranking. His previous best, “Band4Band,” a collaboration with Lil Baby, peaked at No. 2 in 2024.


	“Which One” also jumps to No. 1 on Rap Airplay, Central Cee's first ruler and Drake's record-extending 45th. That's two in a row for Drake, as “What Did I Miss?” reigned for three weeks beginning this August. Central Cee previously reached No. 3 with “Band4Band.”


Most No.1s, Rap Airplay:45, Drake13, Lil Wayne10, Ye9, Jay-Z9, Nicki Minaj8, Cardi B8, Kendrick Lamar7, 50 Cent7, T.I.


	Concurrently, “Which One” also lifts 12-10 on Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and 14-13 on R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. It's Drake's chart-leading 91th top 10 on the former and Central Cee's second.


	“Which One” debuted at No. 23 on the all-format, multimetric Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 9 and ranks at No. 87 on the latest tally via 16.5 million radio audience impressions and 2.4 million official U.S. streams earned in the week ending Oct. 2, according to Luminate.


	The song is expected to be part of Iceman, Drake's ninth studio album, a release date for which has not yet been announced.


	All Billboard charts dated Oct. 11 will update on Billboard.com on Tuesday, Oct. 7.

Whoopi Goldberg had a peculiar suggestion for Super Bowl attendees to troll Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While speaking on The View, the actress suggested people bait her by getting a “Latin accent” and a tan after Noem said that ICE would be “all over” the Super Bowl and she also slammed the NFL over Bad Bunny being booked as the headliner.


	“How's she going to know who's who?” asked Goldberg, to which co-host Joy Behar responded, “Because the Supreme Court has given permission to question anyone who has a Spanish accent or who has dark skin. That's why.”


	“Everybody, get a little cocoa butter, sit in the sun, that's the first thing,” Goldberg said during the episode. “And this is the only time you can probably ever do this: Give yourself a Latin accent, and just see if [Noem] can tell who's who.”

	The comments from Goldberg were in response to Noem saying that ICE will be “all over” the 2026 Super Bowl in a recent The Benny Show video. “I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that's what America's about,” Noem said in the interview. “So yeah, we'll be all over that place. We're going to enforce the law.”

	When asked if she had “any message to the NFL” regarding the organization naming Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime performer, Noem said, “Well, they suck and we'll win, and God will bless us and we'll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day, and they won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe. And they're so weak, we'll fix it.”

	Bad Bunny addressed the right-wing backlash while hosting Saturday Night Live over the weekend, playing a montage of Fox News hosts saying, “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician, and he should be the next president.”


	 “I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” the Grammy winner said before continuing in Spanish. He wrapped up his monologue in English: “And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”

The evolution of artificial intelligence is moving so quickly, even OpenAI‘s policies are already out of date.

Last week, along with the launch of OpenAI's latest hyper-realistic AI video model, Sora 2, the Wall Street Journal reported that the tech company intended to require copyright holders to opt-out if they don't want their creations to appear in the Sora app. The lawyers we spoke to compared it to a burglar saying he had the right to steal everything in your house because you haven't explicitly told him to stop. 

We've long suspected that AI companies were training their models on copyrighted material, with some cut and dry lawsuits that Hollywood studios are battling aggressively, and it suddenly felt like OpenAI was now just daring everyone to get them to stop.

“They've essentially admitted that there's at least a live issue here as to whether creators or owners of copyrights will be able to enforce their rights,” Ray Seilie, an attorney with KHIKS told IndieWire. “They're saying if you own a copyright and you don't want that copyright to be used in our training data, you have to tell us. And by implication, you're saying they have some rights here. We need some level of permission. But then they don't go all the way and ask for a license. You tell us if you're going to go after us. And that's just not the way that any kind of right works.”

 










“It's the equivalent of a begging for forgiveness type of thing. Because I think we all know it has been happening,” added Simon Pulman, an attorney with Pryor Cashman. “What they are effectively saying is as a position, ‘The second you create it, we have the right to use it, unless you affirmatively opt out.'”

That begging for forgiveness came quick on Saturday when, after the Internet was flooded with people using Sora 2 to create custom “South Park” episodes, Pikachu in “Saving Private Ryan,” or police dashcam footage of “Mario Kart,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was changing its tune.

My favorite new trend in the Sora app is putting Pikachu in every movie.This is “Saving Private Pikachu” 👇 pic.twitter.com/pV8JYUb9SZ

“We are hearing from a lot of rights holders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction' and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman wrote in a blog. “We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rights holders decide how to proceed.” 

Altman explained that, rather than an opt-out, the generation of existing characters would instead have rights holders opt-in. It's the same way OpenAI intends to police “likeness,” which the company is treating separately from “copyright.” One of Sora 2's gobsmacking new features is letting people “Cameo” in your AI-generated videos. If you so choose, you can put yourself into an AI video with Sora 2, and your friends can do the same, but you can revoke someone else's privileges to your likeness or to a specific video they're making at any time.

 










We read that as, if Nintendo is cool with people using AI to see Mario speeding away from cops like he's OJ Simpson, then more power to them. We just don't envy the person at Nintendo who has to comb through every video created and determine which ones Nintendo is cool with and which ones it's not.

The trouble with this: OpenAI hasn't brokered a deal with a studio to grant them full permission to do whatever they want, like in the way Runway did with Lionsgate to generate AI models based on their films. When that news broke, we wrote that there's a distant future where Lionsgate and Runway charge people if they want to use AI to put themselves into “John Wick 5” or create their own fan-fic endings. OpenAI has just gone and done it, and your guess as to how any of this will be monetized is as good as ours.

“That's how you would have companies typically act in situations where you need to get permission from a copyright holder,” Seilie said. “This is a strange middle ground where [OpenAI] is saying, well, we acknowledge that you have some rights here, because why else are we asking for your opt-out? But we also don't think we really have to respect your rights unless you opt out.”

Pulman said it's the latest example of a tech company working to get ahead of the law by first trying to normalize and make ubiquitous the thing it's doing. He explains that, if OpenAI can muddy the waters with an enormous amount of people using the Sora app, flood social media with AI slop, and make the process of combatting it so complex and difficult to navigate, the court of public opinion will eventually work out in its favor.

 










After OpenAI along with Google recently lobbied the Trump administration to consider all AI training data “fair use,” it's betting this administration has sympathetic ears to help on legal grounds as well.

But an important distinction that also remains murky is input versus output. Copyright holders may now say they don't want their characters appearing in the Sora 2 app, but it's not clear whether that also precludes that material from being ingested in training data for the Sora model. Sora may bar users from generating Darth Vader, but it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't learn from Darth Vader to create everything else. That means that even if one were to successfully opt out, it could be near impossible to verify whether OpenAI has actually complied.

“You don't, it's a ruse,” said Bryn Mooser, CEO of the AI film studio Asteria. Studios, he believes, shouldn't be asking OpenAI whether Sora 2 can generate their copyright but should ask, was it trained on it? “Just because you can filter it does not mean that it's not in that data set,” he said.

Mooser said it's not hard to imagine a near future where AI-generated likenesses of actors are used to sell junk, and that the 10-second clips that can put your friends' faces into the videos are all about creating content for social media. 

 










This is not the utopian vision of creating an AI model that can cure cancer or democratizing the filmmaking process so that anyone can make their own “Avatar.” And after playing around with everything Sora 2 can do, he said what it can create is “pretty shocking to see how brazen” it is with copyright.

“The release of it is an admission that OpenAI is not interested in Hollywood,” Mooser said. “It's not going to be all the breathless articles that were written about when Sora 1 came out: Hollywood is over. Hollywood's cooked. When Sora 2 comes out it's, ‘We don't care about Hollywood. We don't care about copyright or about artists concerns about being replaced by making viral slop. And we don't care about the needs of Hollywood when it comes to having AI tools that are actually powerful enough to be used for making film and television.' It's a real sign that's not where their interest is, despite probably having a bunch of meetings a year ago to the contrary.”

Asteria, which is the AI company co-founded by Natasha Lyonne and the home of her directorial debut that aims to incorporate AI into the filmmaking process, has designed its AI model such that everything it's trained on is designed by the filmmakers and artists working on the project or licensed directly from other creators. And while using AI in any capacity is already toxic enough in Hollywood without OpenAI's help, Mooser feels making generative AI videos synonymous with viral memes is going to make things even harder for the indie filmmakers who dream of using AI ethically.

 










“Is the industry going to stand in this moment and try to figure out how to build this thing in the right way? Or does the pressure of the new technology just wash over and everybody gives up the fight,” Mooser asked. “We've all been at these points before where technology is going to disrupt how we make things, and I think that the industry has done a good job up until now of ‘we set our standards with the guilds or with our norms.' We don't wait for court cases in Washington D.C. to decide this stuff. But I do think that we're at that crossroads … the rights holders and guilds need to be paying attention, because you can lose that fight if you're not paying attention.”

What could be better than a personalized wedding venue? This is something that HGTV's “Property Brothers” star Drew Scott has discussed creating for his brother, Jonathan Scott, and his fiancée, actress Zooey Deschanel.

A post shared by Jonathan Silver Scott (@jonathanscott)

The couple announced their engagement in August 2023, but they are not in a rush to get married. Their decision to take their time prompted Drew to joke about building their venue for them, but it's a great idea!

“I will offer to build a venue, right?” Drew told People in an interview published on October 6. “I'm going to harass him. You know what? I will tell him that you told me. It's not me pushing, but I was told… People were saying that you need to get this done.”

Drew also gave reassurance to anyone wondering why the couple is taking so long to walk down the aisle, sharing that they are very much in love. “And again, they love each other. They're amazing together. I'm like, ‘You guys, it'll happen when it happens.' And for now, they just love the time together with the kids,” he said. Jonathan and Deschanel have a beautiful blended family as he steps into the role of stepdad to her two children, daughter Elsie, 10, and son Charlie, 8, from her previous marriage to Jacob Pechenik.

A post shared by Zooey Deschanel (@zooeydeschanel)

The couple may not have made much progress in terms of wedding planning, at least, not what they have shared publicly, but they do occasionally give fans a glimpse into their relationship. In an Instagram post on October 2, Deschanel posted a video informing fans of what they can find them doing on “date night.” 

Among the things that you can find them doing is talking about their cats a lot, having a little dance, and discussing leaving events early. It's a hilarious and relatable video, and fans have shared their thoughts in the comment section. 

“The cats talking is real haha,” a fan wrote. “‘Talking about our cats' deserved first billing with you guys,” another fan shared. 

“You better walk that man down aisle,” a third person shared. Other reactions include, “You both found your soulmate! It's great to see. The world needs more love,” and “What a Beautiful, Inspiring couple.” 

Fans adore Scott and Deschanel as a couple, and when they finally get married, it's going to attract a lot of attention because fans feel invested in this relationship at this point.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	WWE vet Dwayne Johnson learned about his Achilles heel at the box office this weekend in Taylor Swift and Leonardo DiCaprio, after his R-rated drama The Smashing Machine, hit the mat as the blockbuster star's lowest opening ever with $5.9M U.S. 


	Indeed, this is quite upsetting for Johnson, for the story of UFC champ Mark Kerr was a passion project; the wrestler-turned actor announcing the movie back at the UFC 244 card weigh-in in November 2019. 


	Upsetting, as Johnson is a tireless promoter who leaves no stone unturned on the PR tour. Like Swift he has a social media reach of a half billion-plus, one which he speaks to directly. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Upsetting as there truly seemed to be an awards glow on The Smashing Machine coming out of its Venice Film Festival World premiere after its 15 1/2 minute standing ovation, Johnson crying on a global stage, Safdie's Silver Lion win and a seemingly good 73% Rotten Tomatoes certified fresh critical score.   


	But it's never a good sign when a movie plummets from its initial projections on tracking. Three weeks ago, Smashing Machine was forecasted to be one of A24‘s highest openings in the high teens to $20M range. 


	What the hell happened? 


	Just like Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party for a Showgirl is a box office case study in its last-minute announcement and thrifty marketing campaign which fueled a $34M opening, so is the fallout here from Smashing Machine.  


	Word began to leak at Smashing Machine‘s Toronto North American premiere that the movie wasn't all that. And, no, not because Johnson was stretching with an edgy dramatic performance, rather Smashing Machine wasn't an underdog sports movie, nor necessarily one about a champ's downfall, rather a very non-traditional, deliberately paced movie about an athlete struggling with drug addiction. The movie's B- CinemaScore is on par with A24's cinematic canon which is known to divide critics and moviegoers. 

	











	Here's the good news before diving into the bad, and that's this movie at a net $50M production cost with tax credits from Vancouver and New Mexico won't lose much, estimates being in the $10M-$15M range. 


	On the low end, that's based on a final domestic between $14M-$20M. How great that loss becomes hinges on how hard A24 wants to push the movie this awards season, insiders telling us that the NYC label continues to support the movie, and stands behind the filmmaker's vision. Smashing Machine‘s budget is propped by foreign sales (which the Rock lobbied for back at Cannes 2024) estimated to be in the $35M range. A24 also has a great pay-one deal in HBO Max. 


Smashing Machine was a project foreign buyers liked in qualitative terms but at the time, sources say there were concerns over its commerciality as a story with an unrecognizable Johnson onscreen and UFC lesser known cultural presence outside the United States. Johnson took a $4M fee, significantly below his historical $20M+ paycheck plus points. Sources say he even gave a portion of his paycheck to Emily Blunt and Kerr. Theatrical P&A is factored at an estimated $15M. 


	While that net $50M might be low for a Rock movie, it's considerably high for a wrestling movie. Reality check: There's a very low ceiling on wrestling movies at the box office and arguably always has been, outside Jared Hess' 2006 Nacho Libre which opened post the director's fanfare of Napoleon Dynamite, when Jack Black original comedies could debut to $28.3M and end their domestic run at $80M. 


	Look back at the grosses of wrestling movies, and Smashing Machine‘s actually seems above average, i.e. A24's 2023 Iron Claw ($4.8M 3-day, $35M domestic), Darren Aronofsky's 2x Oscar nominated The Wrestler (its highest grossing weekend at $3.7M was its 6th with a $26.2M final domestic in 2008) and Bennett Miller's 2014 Foxcatcher ($1M in its widest break, final of $12M). Heck, even the Robert Aldrich directed, Peter Falk starring 1981 nudie comedy, …All the Marbles, about female-wrestling fell outside the ring with $6.1M domestic. 


	In regards to Smashing Machine‘s misfire, some are elbowing A24 and its means of marketing. The hipster specialty cinema brand no doubt wants to graduate to bigger headliner projects, evident in their business with Johnson here and their upcoming Josh Safdie directed movie Marty Supreme with 2x Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet. Criticizes one boutique studio exec, “If A24 wants to make movies at this budget threshold with A list stars they can't just rely on their digital-social media and tastemaker driven campaigns. It's a very a different ballgame.” The misfiring of Smashing Machine comes in the wake of A24 bungling the opening of horror-comedy, Death of a Unicorn, back in the spring, which after a receptive world premiere at SXSW with Wednesday megastar, Jenna Ortega, tanked with a $5.7M opening and final $12.8M domestic. Many believe that A24, particularly with a star like Ortega, could have positioned the movie better. While 64% 18-34 showed up for Smashing Machine, the entire over-35 specialty adult crowd was completely missed.


	Optics you don't expect on a wide release for the Rock had Benny Safdie walking around Manhattan, passing out flyers and promoting the movie with a sandwich board. 

pic.twitter.com/SSFr9QYkcP


	iSpot shows Warner Bros with One Battle After Another outspending Smashing Machine, 13 to 1 on linear. To A24's defense, they did hit up sports programming, it's just that some believe it came too late with spots during MLB playoffs, NFL, college football, ESPN SportsCenter and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Movie marketing execs say it took a lot for Warner Bros' to get One Battle After Another to a $20M+ opening; that DiCaprio-starring, Paul Thomas Anderson-directed movie towering over Smashing Machine in 2nd place with a 2nd weekend of $11M.

	











	UFC CEO Dana White was a definite proponent of Smashing Machine and embraced it early with several screenings for UFC tastemakers as well as signed-off integrations. Fans of the sport at 279 million strong around the globe didn't come out. Why? Again, word of mouth, but also, they're a homebound demo, shelling high priced money to watch fights in their living room. Smashing Machine is the type of movie they're bound to catch on their couch. 


	Despite all the rah-rah coming out of Venice for the film, it also comes as another warning sign for other auteur driven starry movies down the road (who can forget Joker: Folie a Deux) looking to make an awards season world premiere there. If you paddle to the Lido, better have the goods, or else a movie winds up saddled with a critical reaction a month or so before it opens. Some in tracking ponder whether a 76% certified fresh score is a solid indicator when it comes to forecasting opening weekends.


	The eleventh-hour addition of AMC's Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl which won the weekend sans trailers or one-sheets, certainly didn't help Smashing Machine. While there's no overlap in demos between Swift and Rock, essentially she ran away with his movie's higher ticket priced premium large format screens, not to mention, if you're surfing the web over the weekend, you were apt to land on a movie ticket portal for the 14x Grammy winner's movie, not the multi-billion dollar leading man. As we mentioned in our weekend coverage, Swift was able to rally with very little promotion because she was tied to her own cultural event, that being her 12th album drop, not to mention she's in a zone that fans crave to watch her. The latter couldn't be said about Johnson and his fans when it came to Smashing Machine. 


	Johnson has been in this specialty slump before: The $17M-budgeted 2006 gonzo movie Southland Tales grossed under $300K at the domestic B.O. after a Cannes Film Festival world premiere. Not to mention, audiences weren't really in their seats for his last R-rated movie, 2013's Pain & Gain which earned a C+ (despite the Michael Bay bodybuilders and drugs movie opening to $20.2M).


	But there's no need for Johnson to sweat: He'll be back in all victory belt box office glory soon with the openings of Disney's live-action Moana on July 10, 2026 and Sony's Jumanji 3 on Dec. 11 next year as well. 


	Johnson posted three hours before this post, “From deep in my grateful bones, thank you to everyone who has watched The Smashing Machine.”


	“In our storytelling world, you can't control box office results — but what I realized you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. And I will always run to that opportunity,” he continued while summing, “Truth is this film has changed my life.”

This movie should have been made for $10-15M max.! A24 should know better.  Dwayne taking $4M when he doesn't need it. Greedy.  Not smart and they deserve to lose.

Did he not tap into the WWE at all?

What kept me away, aside from apathy, was that I have no desire to see The Rock and Emily Blunt onscreen together again. Their chemistry in Jungle Cruise was passable at best, but no romantic spark at all – to watch them do it again but with no jokes? Negative interest. And I *like* both of these actors.

It's a wonderful movie and a story worth telling. Credit to Dwayne for doing something different as an actor. Cinema attendance in general has been on a drop since the pandemic. Go see the movie yourself and make up your own mind.

There should be bigger consequences for people who back films that lose so much money. But Benny Safdie will continue to work. And so will DJ.

10-15??? Puh. leeeez.

Tori Amos has long spoken out about the world's injustices, and she isn't stopping any time soon. The singer-songwriter announced her 18th studio album, In Times Of Dragons, today, Pitchfork reports. The album presents “a powerful journey of resilience and awakening where the pursuit of freedom meets forces that seek to control and silence,” a press release reads. It also describes the record “a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the ‘Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.”

That's pretty heady stuff, but Amos' work isn't all terror and tyranny. Earlier this year, the artist released an illustrated children's book called Tori And The Muses, as well as a surprise soundtrack album, The Music Of Tori And The Muses, to go with it. The book is a semi-autobiographical tale about a young girl named Tori who's an incredibly talented musician (Amos was something of a child prodigy herself), but wants to make her own music instead of rehearsing for her recital. Maybe we'll see Amos play some of the nine original tracks from The Music Of Tori And The Muses on her upcoming European tour, which Consequence notes is her biggest in a decade. Pre-sale tickets for select dates will be available to fans who pre-order In Times Of Dragons before Tuesday, October 7. You can find more info here.

The KPop Demon Hunters smash extends its run, while McRae earns her third top 10.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-hauling animated film KPop Demon Hunters, tops the Billboard Hot 100 for an eighth week.


	The anthem by the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, in the roles of KPop Demon Hunters characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey, ties for the eighth-longest command for a song from a movie over the Hot 100's 67-year history. It's also now the sole second-longest-leading hit ever by an all-women group.


	Previously, “Golden,” which first ruled the Hot 100 in August, made HUNTR/X the first female group associated with Korean pop to reign. The song is additionally the sole longest-leading hit by an animated group in the chart's archives, while KPop Demon Hunters became the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s.


	For a second week, the song crowns the Hot 100 while the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack is No. 1 on the Billboard 200. They previously doubled up atop the Sept. 20-dated charts.


	Elsewhere, Tate McRae's new single, “Tit for Tat,” launches at No. 3 on the Hot 100, becoming her third top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.






	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 11, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Oct. 7. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 32.3 million official streams (down 4% week-over-week), 38.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 13%) and 6,000 sold (down 13%) in the United States Sept. 26-Oct. 2.


	The track tallies an 11th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; ascends 9-8 on Radio Songs; and rises 2-1 for a third week atop Digital Song Sales.


	With an eighth week pacing the Hot 100, “Golden” ties as the eighth-longest-ruling hit from a movie all-time, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start.


	Here's a look at the longest-leading movie songs in the Hot 100's history (as defined by qualifications used for Billboard's Top 75 Movie Songs of All Time recap, which is based on weekly performance on the chart):




	Plus, “Golden” surpasses TLC's “Waterfalls” to become the sole second-longest-leading Hot 100 hit by an all-female group (of three or more members). It now goes chasing only Destiny's Child's “Independent Women Part I” (11 weeks, 2000-01).


	Here's a recap of the 10 longest-ruling songs in the category:


	Tate McRae's new stand-alone single, “Tit for Tat,” bounds onto the Hot 100 at No. 3. In its first week, following its Sept. 26 release, the song totaled 19.7 million streams, 53,000 airplay impressions and 2,000 sold (boosted by buzz that the song may be about her ex, The Kid LAROI).


	McRae adds her third Hot 100 top 10, with her second adjacent: Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring McRae, holds at No. 4, after it led in its first week in May. (It adds a milestone 20th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.) McRae matches her best Hot 100 rank as a lead artist — “Greedy” hit No. 3 in January 2024. With “Tit for Tat,” she claims both her highest Hot 100 debut and top weekly streaming count in a lead role.


	Notably, “Revolving Door” remains McRae's current promoted radio single; it keeps at its No. 9 best on the Pop Airplay chart. The song, which debuted at its No. 22 Hot 100 peak in March and rises 52-45 on the current list, is from her latest album, So Close to What, which that month blasted in as her first No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2 on the Hot 100, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It posts a 16th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (up 2% to 76.8 million in audience — a new weekly best), tying for the fifth-longest reign in the chart's 35-year history.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” climbs 8-5 on the Hot 100.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which topped the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become last year's No. 1 song, rises 7-6. It logs a record-extending 111th week on the chart overall and a record-padding 80th week in the top 10.


	Also from KPop Demon Hunters, Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” slips to No. 7 from its No. 3 Hot 100 high and their “Your Idol” falls 5-10, after reaching No. 4. (Both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.)


	Additionally in the Hot 100's top 10, Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” rises 11-8, after reaching No. 7, and Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” holds at No. 9, after hitting No. 5.

It can't be overstated how big of a shock to the system Taylor Swift‘s “The Eras Tour” concert film release was back in 2023. The movie was announced just weeks before its release, it set a precedent for a major artist essentially circumventing studio distributors and going directly to theaters, and it disrupted the release calendar so much that we still haven't heard the end of it from rival distributors who got burned and pushed to the sidelines. The film's $261 million worldwide box office was a much needed salve for what would've been a down year in theaters. 

 










Announced again just weeks in advance, Swift's latest surprise theatrical release, a visual album companion for her twelfth album “The Life of a Showgirl,” again topped the box office with an estimated $50 million worldwide. It's less than half of what “Eras Tour” opened to even domestically back in 2023. But there are reasons why “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” was never going to match or beat “The Eras Tour,” and it's an impressive — if not box office shattering — result all the same.

Where “Eras Tour” was a legit concert film documenting what has now become the biggest global tour of all time, “Showgirl” was an album film for songs literally no one had heard yet. That inherently meant the audience for the film was going to be reserved largely for super-fans, many of whom bought tickets in advance and front-loaded the box office. $15.8 million of its total haul came on Friday alone. That it brought in only $34 million domestic  (plus $16 million internationally), speaks to how many Swifties needed to see it as soon as possible on Friday night and then didn't go on Saturday or Sunday. Those ravenous fans still gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore, naturally, which is certainly kinder than some music critics were to the album itself.

Some other factors: “Showgirl” was a one-and-done, single weekend event and won't be held over the way “Eras Tour” hung around in theaters for a few weeks. “Showgirl” was roughly 90 minutes long compared to the three-hour running time of “Eras Tour,” which would've allowed for a few more showtimes, but also didn't have Thursday night previews (the album released at midnight last Friday morning). And perhaps most notably, “Eras Tour” had a premium price tag of $19.89 (we'll call it $20) whereas “Showgirl” was a more traditionally priced movie at an average of $12 a ticket nationwide. Given all that, “Showgirl” has still already surpassed what Beyonce's “Renaissance” concert film, also released in 2023 direct to theaters by AMC, did at the box office with $44 million globally.

 










All of this still had an impact on the box office as a whole. “Showgirl” likely snagged a few premium screens away from Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which managed only $11.1 million domestic in its second weekend and dipped 49 percent from its first weekend, though it did manage to cross $100 million at the global box office. “The Smashing Machine” with Dwayne Johnson also likely took a bit of it on the chin because of Swift's presence, as the film opened to just $6 million domestic. 

Most crucially, the box office for the year is still 4 percent ahead of the pace of 2024 at this same time in the calendar year. We've written about how a few titles have vacated 2025 and put the box office in a precarious spot. But seeing even a more niche Taylor Swift release reach No. 1 is a sign that AMC and other distributors aren't done with these event film experiments.

There are many reasons why good sitcoms are set at work. If the workplace itself is interesting (like a busy, big-city police department or the offices of a late-night show, for example), the challenge of meeting the job's expectations provides fuel for an episode's conflicts and shenanigans. If it's is stultifying and meaningless, characters bond over and chafe under their shared ennui. The paper company of The Office is an ideal version of the latter, the ubiquitous blankness of the product acting as an apt metaphor for the unending white noise of the daily grind. 

DMV, CBS's new sitcom about the perpetually harried denizens of a rundown Hollywood motor-vehicle bureau, faces the unique challenge of finding new ways to make a joke out of a joke. The actual rituals of Americans' dreaded visits to the DMV are such a tattered and trampled punchline of both stand-up and real life that a series set in one had better have something fresh to bring to the party. 

Sadly, the show (created by Dana Klein and inspired by Katherine Heiny's short story “Chicken-Flavored And Lemon-Scented”) traffics in clichés. Old ladies run over forests of driving-test cones. Rich jerks gripe about proper (easily-googleable) Real ID documentation. The office fridge is a crime scene. Irritated customers perform would-be wacky things in line—and so on. Meanwhile, DMV‘s attempt at an Office-style knockabout ensemble piece proves blandly low-wattage, despite the ever-steadying presence of Tim Meadows as Gregg, the longest-serving and least perturbable of the show's put-upon functionaries. 

On the workplace front, the beats come in predictable lockstep, where the nondescript office is divided between the driving testers and the paper-pushers. Behind the wheel are Meadows' Gregg, buoyed by the actor's signature beaming, underplayed cynicism; Tony Cavalero's Vic, whose himbo-oddball schtick includes steering his test-takers through the McDonald's drive-thru (which they pay for); and Harriet Dyer's Colette, whose chipper optimism and fumbling awkwardness mark her out as DMV's nominal lead. Colette's infatuation with new guy on the documents window Noa (The Rings of Power's Alex Tarrant) also signals her position at the head of the ensemble, with brash photo ID jockey Ceci (Gigi Zumbado) and former SNL player Molly Kearney's newly promoted manager Barbara filling out the shift roster. 

It's not an entirely unpromising group. Alongside Meadows, Aussie actor Dyer has already proven her rom-com cred in homeland hit Colin From Accounts, while Kearney's booming presence as the gung-ho but insecure Barbara fits nicely. Cavalero appears to be channeling the Workaholics iteration of his Righteous Gemstones partner Adam Devine at points, but his weird energy offsets some of Vic's abrasiveness.

At the same time, the assembled talents are slotting into a set of types far too diffuse to make much impact. Dyer doesn't lean enough into either Colette's cmishaps or thwarted do-gooder naivete, while Kearney's turn as the blustering Barbara is no Michael Scott, saddled as she is with a running gag about her being too unworldly to recognize, say, a vibrator from the lost and found. (She also keeps referring to the state's capital as “Big Sac,” with all the attendant wordplay that entails.)  



But it's in DMV's efforts to manufacture a Jim/Pam workplace romance that the show labors the most. Dyer's character stammers her way toward the stolidly hunky Noa again and again, ultimately thwarted by wheezy sitcom plotting as much as Colette's rumpled insecurities. The pilot sees her impaled shirtless on a nail while attempting to escape through the communal bathroom window, while another episode forces her to grade calamitous neophyte driver Noa's road test. (She's dubbed “E-Z Pass” by co-workers for never failing anybody.) That surfer-dude Noa is either clever and competent or dim-bulb clueless according to the needs of each of the first four episodes is a genuine worry. As is, Tarrant and Dyer's lukewarm chemistry as they weave toward an inevitable future pairing bumps against manufactured obstacles aplenty without either character being engaging enough to care all that much about.   

The same goes for the running of this particular branch. The pilot brings in a lightly kooky pair of government inspectors, whose revelation to the panicked Barbara that theirs is one of four area DMVs being evaluated for potential closure. That should set off a ticking clock but for the fact that the next three episodes abandon the thread entirely in favor of watching Colette try to fool a judgmental visiting actor friend that she's really a veterinarian.  

This is a resolutely unambitious portrait of lowest-rung bureaucrats lightly peppered with tonally indifferent stabs at character development and overarching purpose. Kearney's Barbara makes an effortful case in the pilot that the DMV's mandatory democratic drudgery despite “what you look like or how much money you make or if you went to college” is somehow meaningful. Meanwhile, the workers' perennial gripes about their roles in “the most despised institution in America” (there's a lot of competition there) give way to the occasional flash of hazy, half-realized idealism. (Meadows' Gregg is much more convincing as he shepherds new hire Noa through hard-won DMV rewards like pantomiming his non-existent cigarette during smoke breaks or “going number zero” to goof off in the bathroom.) 

As with most work-related premises, there's undoubtedly a good sitcom lurking at the DMV. Coupled with the ordinary drudgery of the average office, the added theme of governmental hoop-jumping, and burdensome red tape and expense offers unique layers of employee and customer exasperation to play with. But the glimmers of invention (the driving testers keep track of the number of days since they were almost killed on a whiteboard) are so meager here that this DMV feels as perfunctory and forgettable as re-registering your car.

Beyond the Gates creator Michele Val Jean promised Deadline in July that a “hot male” was about to join the action in her leafy Maryland suburb. She kept her word: Greg Vaughan is joining the CBS sudser in a mystery role later this season.


	Details about his role are expected at a later date. 


	Speculation has been rampant on social media that the Days of Our Lives alum was coming to the sudser. Over the weekend, cast member Trisha Mann Grant posted a video on Instagram to celebrate star Clifton Davis' birthday.

	In July, Val Jean told Deadline that “I can't say who just yet, but I will say longtime soap fans all know and love him!” 

	











	Vaughan departed Days of Our Lives in 2020. He portrayed Eric Brady on the then-NBC daytime drama since 2012, and won a supporting actor Daytime Emmy for the role in 2018.


	This the second major cast addition on the CBS soap since Keith D. Robinson joined in March as a series regular. He took over the role of Dr. Ted Richardson, previously played by Maurice Johnson.


	Just last month, Beyond the Gates killed off its first big character. The role of Doug McBride, who was played byJason Graham, perished in a car crash. Graham, whose previous credits include 911, All-American Homecoming and Sisters, was part of the original cast when the CBS soap debuted in February. 


Beyond the Gates has been renewed for a second season. The sudser is up 67% in multi-platform viewership from last year's time period and beats ABC's General Hospital by 7% among women 25-54 on broadcast, according to Nielsen.

Larry Campbell still remembers the voicemail he received early this spring, and from a familiar voice: “This is Bruce Springsteen. You know, I'm Patti Scialfa's husband.”


	Campbell knew Springsteen's tongue was planted firmly in cheek. The veteran guitarist's résumé includes a seven-year stint in Bob Dylan's band starting in 1997 and studio sessions with Dylan, Paul Simon, Levon Helm, Rosanne Cash, and just about every American music legend of the last half-century. (He's also toured and recorded with his wife, singer Teresa Williams.) His connections to the Springsteen-Scialfa home go back a ways, too. In the Eighties, Campbell met Scialfa when the two sang and played together in bands on the New York club scene, met Springsteen at a birthday party for E Street bassist Garry Tallent, and guested on one of Scialfa's albums. He was even briefly the boss of the Boss: In 2003, Springsteen played guitar on an album Campbell co-produced for their friend Soozie Tyrell.

	











	Even with that background, Campbell was surprised when he returned Springsteen's call and heard what was afoot. Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, the movie about the period of crisis that led into the making of the pared-down Nebraska in 1982, was in the midst of filming. Over the last 40-plus decades, Springsteen has slipped all 10 of its songs into setlists, whether on solo tours and with the E Street Band. But until that call to Campbell, he'd never played the whole record start to finish with the same minimalist accompaniment. And with the movie on the way, now appeared to be the time. “He said the songs had never been performed the way they were recorded, and he needed a second guitar player, and would I be interested and have time to do it?” Campbell recalls. “I said, ‘Gee, let me think about this — yes.'”

	











	Campbell well remembered the arrival of Nebraska and how it stood apart from Springsteen's catalog and the musical landscape at the time. “I'm an old folkie at heart,” he says. “And one guy with a guitar telling a story, if it's done well, I'm in. It was showing a side of Bruce that I certainly didn't know was there, and I really respected what he was doing when that record came out.”

	After signing on and learning that E Street Band keyboardist Charlie Giordano would be the only other musician on the project, Campbell started his prep by relistening to Nebraska and focusing on the subtle overdubs Springsteen added to his voice-and-guitar basics. “I'd listened to that record many times, but I didn't pay attention to what was going on instrumentally, because there wasn't a lot going on instrumentally,” he says. “Bruce asked me to listen to the tracks and stay true to the second guitar stuff going on in there. That took a lot of paying attention to what was going on. His engineer did send me some of those guitar parts separated, because they're not mixed where they're really discernible.”


	With the taping only a few weeks away, Campbell then began playing along with the record, attempting to match the rhythmic punch in “Open All Night,” “Johnny 99,” and “State Trooper,” and delicate folk cadences in “My Father's House” and the album's title track. “It was impossible to get note for note everything that was played, but I wanted to absorb the vibe and the chordal inversions,” he says. “Once I thought I felt it and got it, I moved onto the next song.”


	In what Campbell calls “one of those pinch-yourself moments” he and Giordano, who would contribute synthesizer and celeste to replicate the subtle glockenspiel parts, found themselves at Springsteen's home studio in New Jersey, rehearsing the material the first time as a trio. To recreate Springsteen's mandolin on songs like “Atlantic City,” Campbell brought his own instrument and borrowed one of Springsteen's 12-strings for others.

	Since the Nebraska songs are structurally simple, Campbell says the warm-ups weren't overly difficult. “As far as technical guitar playing, none of that was challenging,” he says. “But what was challenging about it — about all of them — was feeling like I was expressing the mood of each of those songs. I had to really listen to the lyrics and put myself in a place that was empathetic to what Bruce was trying to say. I had to feel like I could see myself inside the songs.”

	











	After only a few days' warmup, the musicians, crew, and director Thom Zimny, who's worked on five Springsteen films (including the one made from the Springsteen on Broadway shows), met up at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in nearby Red Bank, with no audience in attendance. Arriving at the venue, Campbell realized how secretive it was; no fans were milling about. “I wasn't thinking about that or aware of it,” he says. “Any of the intrigue was just superfluous to what we were doing. It was all very low-key.”


	As the musicians set up onstage, facing the empty row of seats, Campbell began to realize the rationale behind that scenario, even if it wasn't fully explained to him. “This may be me projecting, but that sense of emptiness contributed to the vibe of the whole thing,” he says. “I was watching Thom film it, and the starkness of it all, to me, was the proper illustration of the stories on that record. It really captured the landscape of this body of work. It felt to me like Thom wanted to get Bruce's performance on film in a way that really enhanced that darkness.”

	Over the next few hours, the musicians got to work, cutting several takes of each Nebraska song. Campbell recalls the musicians moving efficiently from tune to tune, with what he calls just a “trunkload” of guitars behind him and Springsteen. “It was, ‘Let's do this like you're in a recording studio and do this song and then this song next,'” he says. “It was business. As the filming went on, Campbell watched as Springsteen and Zimny huddled after each take: “Thom would say, ‘Okay, that's great,' and if Bruce was cool with it, we moved on.” According to Campbell, the trio didn't attempt any songs that weren't on the album, but given they played a few versions of each song, this still means there's an alternative live Nebraska now in the vaults.


	When the recording and filming were wrapped up, the project was over almost as quickly as it had started. “Bruce was very courteous and thought it went really well, and then we went our separate ways,” Campbell says. He hasn't yet seen Zimny's completed movie of the concert, which will be included in the Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition box out on Oct. 17. But even given the abbreviated timeframe of the project, Campbell believes he gained an enhanced understanding of the album. “That landscape he created with that record was a real interesting and emotionally moving place to be for a couple of days,” he says. “I very much look forward to the next collaboration, if that ever comes around.”

Tori Amos has announced a new album, In Times of Dragons. The follow-up to 2021's Ocean to Ocean is due out in spring 2026, via Universal's recently relaunched Fontana label. The singer-songwriter has also announced a huge European tour. Check out the dates below.

Amos said in a press release, “In Times of Dragons is a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the ‘Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.”

Early this year, Amos released a soundtrack to the children's book Tori and the Muses.

Toxic, Chappell Roan-belting girlboss… or alien among us sent to annihilate all of living Earth? In Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” his latest film and fourth feature with Emma Stone, you decide. A new trailer offers a fresh glimpse at the movie, coming to theaters in time for Halloween.

In “Bugonia,” Jesse Plemons plays a conspiracy-addled beekeeper who kidnaps a high-powered big pharma CEO (that's Stone), convinced that she is an extraterrestrial intent on destroying the planet. He also ropes fellow and more impressionable conspiracist Don (Aidan Delbis) into the hijack. 

 










Will Tracy (“The Menu”) adapts the script as a remake of the 2004 Korean sci-fi film “Save the Green Planet!,” directed by Jang Joon-hwan. Lanthimos' tenth movie first premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival, with Focus Features releasing the movie after his collaborations with Searchlight Pictures.

More on the film from IndieWire's review: “Imagine if Michael Haneke's ‘Funny Games' were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' ‘Bugonia.' … Lanthimos works from an on-the-nose-for-the-now feature screenplay by ‘Succession' and ‘The Menu' writer Will Tracy, diverting from the droll theater of cruelty present in scripts by Efthimis Filippou (‘Kinds of Kindness') or the florid repartee of Tony McNamara (‘The Favourite,' ‘Poor Things'). ‘Bugonia‘ has all the streak of Tracy's kill-the-rich brand of satire, but with the Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker interrogating the potential performativity of such capitalist-fighting crusades.

 










Also, read Anne Thompson's interview with Jesse Plemons out of Telluride here.

“Bugonia” is Lanthimos' buzziest film since “Poor Things” won Emma Stone the Best Actress Oscar; “Kinds of Kindness” was a creative detour from that film's grandiosity that performed unimpressively at the box office. The sci-fi and comedy elements plus Emma Stone back in the lead should set up “Bugonia” up for success this October.

Focus Features will release “Bugonia” opens in select theaters on Friday, October 24 before expanding everywhere on Friday, October 31. Check out the new trailer below.

John Oliver praised Super Bowl organizers for their bravery last night. “The NFL ‘controversially' gave the Super Bowl Halftime Show to one of the hottest, most commercially successful people alive,” he quipped of the announcement that Bad Bunny would star, per Variety. While Oliver is right that any kerfuffle around this selection is pretty ridiculous, there has been a controversy nonetheless. Previously, Bad Bunny decided that he would not be performing anywhere in the 50 states, partly out of concern that “fucking ICE could be outside [my concert],” as he told i-D magazine last month.

The administration responded, as is its wont, by immediately announcing that ICE agents would be present at the game. Agents will be “all over” the event, as secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem said on The Benny Show podcast this past Friday (via The New York Times). People should not attend the game, she continued, unless they are “law-abiding Americans who love this country.”

Bad Bunny seems to be taking all of this backlash in stride. “I'm doing the Super Bowl halftime show. I'm very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News,” he quipped during his Saturday Night Live monologue last night, before rolling a montage of clips spliced together to make it sound like those hosts thought he should be “the next president.” After thanking his fans in Spanish, he added, “And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”

On his show, Oliver also played a montage of Fox news hosts reacting to Bad Bunny's selection, with one broadcaster asserting that the Puerto Rican artist isn't American, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. After transitioning to a segment of continued ICE raids, Oliver got serious. “But as grim as all of this has been, the one glimmer of hope has been the strength of the pushback from local communities around the country,” he said, concluding that the Trump administration cannot “cover up the ugliness of what they are doing right now, and it deserves to be pushed back on and exposed at every available opportunity.”

Mike Rittberg and Mark Flaherty will lead the initiative's two divisions.

Industry News Editor


HYBE America has unveiled HYBE Label Service (HLS), its first global division dedicated to supporting HYBE artists in international markets. The new unit will unify global operations across distribution, manufacturing, and marketing & promotion (M&P), with the goal of expanding the reach and impact of HYBE's roster.


	To lead HLS, HYBE America has promoted Ryan Hyeong Woo Noh to chief business officer. Formerly the company's chief strategy officer, Noh will oversee core business operations from HYBE's Los Angeles headquarters, reporting to HYBE CEO Jason Jaesang Lee and HYBE America CEO Isaac Lee. Since joining HYBE in 2022, Noh has played a key role in the company's growth, bringing more than 15 years of experience in entertainment and gaming — including senior leadership positions at Nexon US Holdings, where he led international business development and managed post-merger integration.


	HLS is structured into two core divisions: Global Distribution and Global M&P. Mike Rittberg has been appointed president of global distribution, responsible for strategic release planning and catalog management. Rittberg previously served as COO of Big Machine Label Group (BMLG), where he led marketing and streaming initiatives. Mark Flaherty joins as president of Global M&P, tasked with leading global marketing strategies. Flaherty's career spans major labels like Warner Records, Interscope, and Sony Music, as well as entrepreneurial ventures such as Fanatical Music & Marketing, where he helped expand Southeast Asian talent globally, including the girl group Bini.


	HYBE executives emphasized the strategic importance of HLS in expanding global reach and supporting artists, with Lee calling the launch a “pivotal moment” in the company's global strategy. “By centralizing our essential global support functions and bringing in top-tier leaders like Mike Rittberg and Mark Flaherty, we are providing our artists with an unparalleled platform for continued worldwide success,” he said.


	Noh emphasized strengthening connections between HYBE's regional capabilities and “our powerful partners while enabling our artists and labels to more seamlessly reach and engage with audiences across different markets worldwide.”


	Rittberg praised HYBE's innovative approach to global music, saying it is “redefining what's possible in global music,” while Flaherty added he was excited to help “stretch the boundaries of what a global music company can be.”


	The launch of HLS follows the recent departure of Scooter Braun as CEO of HYBE America. Braun had overseen acquisitions including BMLG and Quality Control Music, each purchased for $300 million.


	HYBE plans to expand HLS into additional regions, reallocating resources to reinforce its global presence. The initiative highlights the company's ongoing push toward long-term international artist development. HYBE America, a subsidiary of HYBE Corp., operates a portfolio that includes Scooter Braun Projects, BMLG and Quality Control Music.

	Polly Pocket first launched in 1989 with a series of tiny collectibles. In 2018, Mattel reintroduced the toy with updates to the tiny and mighty doll for a new generation. The line spawned animated TV specials and YouTube content.

	











	Weiss is represented by UTA and Mosaic. Brier is represented by WME, Adventure Media, and Ginsburg Daniels Kallis LLP. Collins is represented by CAA and LBI Entertainment.. Hello Sunshine is repped by CAA and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox. 


	Upcoming for Mattel Studios are Amazon MGM Studios' Masters of the Universe in theaters on June 5, 2026 and Apple Original Films and Skydance's Matchbox movie which is eyeing a fall 2026 release. Mattel Studios with Barbie delivered to Warner Bros their highest grossing movie in the studio's history, that Greta Gerwig directed, Margot Robbie-Ryan Gosling starring movie racking up $1.44 billion worldwide, and eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, with a win for the Billie Eilish-Finneas O'Connell song “What Was I Made For?”

The "Hurricane" singer adds another impressive stat to his career.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



Luke Combs has surpassed Garth Brooks as the highest-certified country artist in history by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).


	Combs has sold and streamed a combined 168 million units (units can be albums or singles), according to RIAA. Brooks stands at 162.5 million and had held the record for more than 20 years.


	“When my team first told me about this, my initial reaction was, ‘Are you sure? There's no way.' It was only 8 years ago that I got my first [RIAA] plaque for ‘Hurricane' going gold,” Combs said in a statement. “I knew then, without a doubt, I had the best fans in the world. The song had gone platinum before they could even give me the gold plaque. I'm super humbled by the fans' belief in me and support of my music today and over the years. I know this does not happen without them. This achievement is more so theirs than it is mine. All I ever hoped and dreamed of from the beginning of this crazy ride was to make music that made people feel something and I can't wait to continue making country music for the rest of my life.”

	Combs already held the record for the most Diamond-certified singles for a country artist with four. Diamond-certified singles have sold/streamed 10 million units, and Combs' four to surpass that tally are “Beautiful Crazy,” “When It Rains It Pours,” “Hurricane” and “She Got the Best of Me.”

	











	The news comes as Combs' current single, “Back in the Saddle,” climbs to No. 8 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart. On Friday, Combs released The Prequel, a three-song set with “My Kinda Saturday Night,” “15 Minutes” and “Days Like These” via Sony Music Nashville.




	It's already been a stellar year for Combs, who is up for three awards at November's CMA Awards, including entertainer of the year, and recently announced that he and wife Nicole are expecting their third child. After his extensive worldwide tour in 2024, Combs has concentrated on playing festivals this year and is the first country artist to headline both Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza. Later this month, he will headline the Austin City Limits Music Festival.


Drake is the RIAA's highest-certified artist across all genres, with 298.5 units sold and streamed, followed by Taylor Swift at 242.5 million units. Combs now stands at ninth among all artists.

Lorde is among the latest wave of artists joining the No Music for Genocide campaign, which urges musicians to geo-block their music in Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Caribou, Hayley Williams, Dry Cleaning, Marina, Caroline, Diiv, Duval Timothy, Idles, Muna, Paloma Faith, Obongjayar, Marc Rebillet, Tokimonsta, 454, Pinegrove, and Skee Mask have also removed or pledged to remove their music from streaming services in the country. Hyperdub is the latest label to pull its catalog, joining Bayonet, 10k, Pan, and more.

Back in 2017, Lorde announced—and swiftly canceled—a concert in Tel Aviv, after proponents of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, including the authors of an article in New Zealand publication The Spinoff, criticized her decision to play in Israel. Lorde wrote at the time, “i pride myself on being an informed young citizen, and i have done a lot of reading and sought a lot of opinions before deciding to book a show in tel aviv, but i'm not proud to admit i didn't make the right call on this one.” An Israeli court ordered the authors of the article in The Spinoff to pay damage to fans who claimed the cancellation caused them “moral and emotional injury.” The article authors said the ruling was designed “to intimidate Israel's critics” and added that, rather than paying the court-ordered fine, they would raise funds for a mental health organization in Gaza.

Today's new additions to the No Music for Genocide streaming embargo join the likes of Massive Attack, Björk, MJ Lenderman, and dozens more who have backed the organizers' stated protest against “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the suppression of pro-Palestine activism.

Massive Attack have also joined a separate but parallel drive to pull music from Spotify altogether; proponents of that movement primarily cite founder Daniel Ek's investment in weapons contractor Helsing, which is not linked to Israel. Music businesses' links to the military industrial complex are also listed as a target of the No Music for Genocide movement, for which more than 1,000 artists and labels have signed up, according to organizers.

The Free Press founder will become editor-in-chief of CBS News, but her role outside the formal org chart is a perplexing question mark for insiders at the network.  


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The first place David Ellison went after closing Skydance's $8 billion deal for Paramount Global on Aug. 7 was the offices of CBS News on the west side of Manhattan. In meetings with the journalists and staff there, he praised the legacy of the TV news division, once the home of Edward R. Murrow, and committed to investing in its future.


	That vision, however, will be put to the test, as a long-rumored deal is now official, and the implications for the future of CBS News are consequential.




	Paramount on Monday said that it has officially acquired The Free Press, the digital publication founded by Bari Weiss, and will bring her into the fold of CBS News. The move, which had been expected for weeks, is nonetheless being greeted with dread inside the news division.

	Weiss will become editor-in-chief of CBS News, but will work outside of the current org chart by reporting directly to Paramount CEO David Ellison.

	“I have to imagine she will be his eyes and ears inside CBS News,” one staffer at the company said.


	“We are thrilled to welcome Bari and The Free Press to Paramount and CBS News. Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News. This move is part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects — directly and passionately — to audiences around the world,” Ellison said in a statement.

	











	“This is an important initiative for our company and Bari will report directly to me — leading the work of The Free Press and collaborating with our CBS News team in the pursuit of making it the most trusted name in news,” he added. “We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.”


	“This is a great moment for The Free Press,” Weiss said. “This partnership allows our ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience. We honor the extraordinary legacy of CBS News by committing ourselves to a singular mission: building the most trusted news organization of the 21st century.”


The Free Press will remain a stand-alone business outside of CBS News.


	According to one source, staff in the news division are more confused than anything by the hire: Weiss does not have TV experience (though her digital chops may be the more important skill given the trajectory of TV news right now), and her positioning of editor-in-chief is a perplexing one, with TV news organizations typically using a different organizational structure than newspapers or magazines where the title is more frequently found.


	While TV news outlets have a central reporting structure, in practice each program is led editorially by the executive producer and anchors.


	And they are perplexed by the hire of the contrarian journalist, given the kind words that Ellison said to CBS News staff the morning that Skydance closed on its acquisition of Paramount, where he pointedly made the newsroom his first stop of the day.

	











	He also told journalists at a press conference later that morning that his intent was to maintain CBS' legacy as a news organization.


	“I think we want to be fact-based and truth-based as a news organization,” Ellison said. “That's what we're about, that's the legacy of CBS. I mean, Edward Murrow founded this place.


	“Fundamentally, we want to be in the trust business, we want to be the truth business, we want to be in the fact business,” he added, saying that they wanted to appeal to the majority of the country that “would define themselves from center left to center right, and really ensure that it's a place that can be true to the legacy that we're inheriting, and we're going to invest behind that.”


	In a note to staff Monday, Ellison wrote that while the media “was founded with the mission of informing the public and fostering discussion on the issues of the day, too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart.


	“I don't pretend to have a solution to this challenge. But I do believe we each have a responsibility to do our part,” he added. “At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better — recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. That is our purpose.”

	











	How that squares with what Weiss will bring to the table remains to be seen given her well-known perspective on a range of issues, unless Ellison has other deals in mind with people who bring their own perspectives.


	Also perplexing some staff is how she will engage with Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News, who remains in his role. That structure leads one high-level news executive outside of CBS to wonder whether Weiss will end up having more direct impact than some people think on CBS News' output, or significantly less impact than people think.


	The argument for her asserting control over CBS News: A powerful title and a direct line to the CEO (effectively bypassing all other executives in the CBS structure) could enable her to do things that Cibrowski can't, or make moves that senior news executives or producers could otherwise block.


	The argument against it: She is effectively cleaved off from the main CBS News org chart. The anchors and executive producers of CBS News programming report into Cibrowski, who reports into Paramount TV chief George Cheeks, who reports to Ellison and Jeff Shell. It may be hard to have meaningful influence on programming unless she can find a way into that reporting structure.


	Still, in a memo of her own to CBS staff, Weiss outlined 10 core principles that she intends to bring to the network, suggesting that she intends to have a meaningful impact.


	CBS News has been in the middle of a political firestorm for almost a year.


	An interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of last year's election sparked a lawsuit from President Trump, a suit that was ultimately settled for $16 million (or something closer to $30 million, according to Trump). And last month CBS changed its interview policy for Face the Nation after facing outrage over an edit made to an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the Sunday show.

	











	It's a situation that has left staff at CBS News anxious about what, if anything, Weiss will do to try and influence CBS News programming, and about the looming cuts that are widely expected in connection with the company-wide Paramount cuts, which are likely to happen next month.


	And inside 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of CBS News, staff are holding their breath. The appointment of Tanya Simon as executive producer drew universal acclaim from employees, but the famously independent program (it has its own correspondents, producers and production crews, and works out of offices in a different building than the rest of CBS News) is gearing up for a fight over that independence.


	Bill Owens, the show's former EP, resigned after CBS named Susan Zirinsky to a role overseeing standards for all of CBS News, including 60 Minutes, in what was seen as an unacceptable change in long-standing protocol.


	But one veteran news executive — someone skeptical of Weiss, it's worth noting — nonetheless thinks that perhaps her addition could end up being a wake-up call that the news division needs. CBS Evening News and CBS Mornings are mired in third place, and have been for years. CBS News digital is in need of a refresh, with many competitors like NBC News and CNN pouring cash into forward-looking digital efforts. In other words, the status quo wasn't good enough.


	Whether Weiss is the one to be the change agent that CBS needs is a whole other story, but the newsroom is holding its collective breath to see what happens next.

	











	You can read Ellison and Weiss' notes to staff at the company below.


Dear Team Paramount:


I think we can all agree that the temperature of our nation's social discourse feels higher than ever. Too often, the space once reserved for thoughtful dialogue has been consumed by partisan division and hostile disputes. If we are to move forward, we must find our way back to the ideals that shaped both our country and civilization itself: open exchange of ideas, vigorous yet respectful debate, and a genuine regard for the beliefs and traditions of others. This challenge extends to the media. 


While it was founded with the mission of informing the public and fostering discussion on the issues of the day, too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart. George Washington warned that the primary danger in politics is partisanship. Today, that danger extends far beyond politics – threatening the fabric of our communities. When we reduce every issue to “us vs. them” or “my way vs. the wrong way,” we close ourselves off from listening, learning, and ultimately growing, both as individuals and as a society.


I don't pretend to have a solution to this challenge. But I do believe we each have a responsibility to do our part. At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better – recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. That is our purpose.


With this in mind, I am excited to share that The Free Press is joining our Company. Since its launch just five years ago, The Free Press, under co-founder Bari Weiss' leadership, has built one of the most dynamic news organizations in the country, one that resonates with audiences of all ages and perspectives. Guided by their core values of truth, balance, and an exchange of ideas, the team has made it their mission to help restore public trust in the news – and they are delivering real results. Their dedication to independent and fearless reporting has won the devotion of some 1.5 million readers – more than 170,000 of who are them now paid subscribers – an extraordinary achievement in such a short time.












As part of this acquisition, Bari will become editor-in-chief of CBS News. She brings a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum. This, combined with her restless desire to build, believe, and innovate, makes her a perfect fit for our storied news division. In these early days working together, I've seen the Bari who you will get to know: a person of incredible energy, judgment, and perception for what will resonate with audiences. Working alongside our exceptionally talented colleagues at CBS News, she will help ensure that our reporting remains relevant, accessible, and – most importantly – trusted in this new era for American media.


I am confident that, in the coming years, CBS News and The Free Press will make big strides and be at the forefront of a much-needed transformation in how news is gathered, reported, and delivered. Our goal is to broaden our reach while solidifying our position as a leading voice in American journalism. Every step of the way, trust and facts will remain our guiding principles as we work every day to strengthen and deepen our connection with our audience. As a news organization, we serve a vital role in the lives of Americans from every background and belief, and we embrace that responsibility with the utmost care, integrity, and purpose. We aim to do our part in helping rebuild a society where our shared humanity unites us, and where our differences become a source of strength rather than division. We are here to achieve great things together. So please join me in extending a warm welcome to Bari and the entire team from The Free Press as they join us on that journey. 


Let's go! 












David


Dear Colleagues: 


I am thrilled and humbled to be writing to you as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Growing up, CBS was a deep family tradition. Whenever I hear that tick, tick, tick or that trumpet fanfare, it sends me right back to our den in Pittsburgh. The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege. 


Right now, I imagine you have some questions. I do, too.


My goal in the coming days and weeks is to get to know you. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. I'll approach it the way any reporter would—with an open mind, a fresh notebook, and an urgent deadline. 


What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you:


I look forward to meeting many of you in the days ahead and to listening and learning from you. I am profoundly honored to join you—and I can't wait to get started. 


With gratitude and excitement, 


Bari

	During an appearance on SiriusXM Hits 1, Taylor Swift opened up about playing the more explicit songs on The Life of a Showgirl for her mother. Based on her response, she must have queued up the clean version of “Wood.” 


	“I think that she thinks that that song is about superstitions, popular superstitions, which it absolutely is,” Swift said. “That's the joy of the double entendre. You could read that song for people and it just goes right over their head. You see in that song what you wanna see in that song.”


	“Wood” isn't particularly vague — “He ah-matized me and opened my еyes/Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see/His love was thе key that opened my thighs” — but maybe it's just easier for her mother to turn a blind eye. There are other moments on the album that opt for profanity over explicit imagery. 


	“If it, to me, improves the intensity of the moment or, in terms of syllables or consonance and vowels, if it pops off more, there are certain lyrics that just bounce more,” Swift said about choosing when to write profanity into her songs. “Or if it feels like it's a part of the vernacular of how that character that I'm kind of cosplaying in that song would speak. There are a lot of different reasons you choose to throw in a swear word or like a certain phrase or a sort of alliteration or whatever. But that's what I love so much about songwriting. Those decisions are fun and oftentimes hilarious to make.”

	











	Elsewhere in the interview, Swift opened up about her muse, Travis Kelce. “He's one of those people where as soon as you meet him, you kind of know he's the best,” she said. “And you kind of know there's no one else on the planet that's ever been even remotely similar to him. He's like one of one.”

	











	Swift also looked back on her Fourth of July post from 2023, where she captioned a carousel of photos, “Happy belated Independence Day from your local neighborhood, independent girlies. See you tonight. Kansas City.” She met Kelce shortly after, and finds the coincidence “deranged.”

	“How deranged is that post? I think back on that, I'm like there's no way,” she said. “If we break it down, I'm in this picture with a bunch of girls, not just me and Selena [Gomez]. A few of the other girls found their person right after that. The fact that it was right before the Kansas City show … and then the next day I go and play in Kansas City not knowing that Travis was gonna come to the show. It's unreal.”


	Gomez tied the knot with Benny Blanco in a ceremony last week. Swift gushed about “how happy I am for my friends when they find happiness,” adding, “Selena was the most beautiful, not just the most beautiful bride — just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Just so happy and she deserves it so much.”

Love, madness, love, and more madness.

Jennifer Lawrence is here with one of the boldest performances of the year in “Die My Love,” directed by Lynne Ramsay. The Oscar-winning actress stars as Grace, a mother living in Montana who begins to show signs of postpartum psychosis, her mental distress unraveling her relationship with Jackson (Robert Pattinson). Written by Ramsay with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch, the 2025 Cannes Film Festival premiere finally hits theaters November 7 courtesy of Mubi. Watch the trailer below.

LaKeith Stanfield co-stars in the film as an alluring stranger who attracts Grace, while Nick Nolte and Sissy Spacek play Pattinson's parents. The official synopsis for the film is slightly more hope-tinged than what you get from seeing the movie, which resembles something between a dark comedy and a psychological horror film: “A hopeful young and loving couple (Grace and Jackson) move from New York to an inherited house in the country. Grace tries to find her Identity with a new baby in the isolated environment. Yet as she begins to unravel, it's not in weakness but imagination, strength and a stunning untamed vivacity that she discovers herself anew.”

“Die My Love” has curiously not been at the fall festivals this season, coming into theatrical play and eventual Mubi streaming straight from Cannes instead. There was chatter that recuts were happening post-Cannes, but the unchanged running time suggests those edits are imperceptible.

 










More on the film from our review: “‘Die My Love' is a two-hour cinematic miasma of what it's like to be in postpartum depression hell and possessed by a sexual appetite that could never possibly be quenched by even someone as hot as Robert Pattinson. As such, it will be a tough sell for even Lawrence's most ardent fans. The story offers little to hook us onto other than Grace's constant flailing through psychosis, visually realized by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey with the feeling of a bad dream you wake up from in a heated, unforgiving sweat. The atmosphere of this fugue-state-turned-panic-attack of a film is never not intoxicating. As Grace spins out in a hothouse countryside beset by ever-buzzing flies — inescapable swelter and tall grass abound — you can all but feel the ticks and Lyme disease consuming you.”

The Smashing Machine will be most people's introduction to Mark Kerr, the soft-spoken mixed martial artist who was brawling back when the Ultimate Fighting Championship wasn't yet a toxic cultural juggernaut, just lurid pay-per-view “human cockfighting,” in the words of John McCain. But the film that Benny Safdie and his star Dwayne Johnson have effectively remade—often shot for shot—is better in every way than the dramatized biopic born from its bruises.

John Hyams' 2002 HBO documentary The Smashing Machine: The Life And Times Of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr lets its subject's aw-shucks personality and the wet, meaty thwack of knee strikes and hammer fists speak for themselves. This lends subtlety to a fall-and-rise arc that could otherwise knock you in the face with its grimdark spin on a pro wrestling narrative. Ambition and acceptance, violence and tenderness, life-affirming pain and the life-threatening drugs that assuage it—these archetypal dualities all reveal themselves naturally during the fly-on-the-wall, backseat observations of a normal man's abnormal job. Kerr's soft voice, little-kid smile, and gentle patience (even when, in simplified English, he's arguing over money with the Japanese middlemen of the Pride Fighting Championships) breezily define The Life And Times‘ contrast between person and profession.

Like Kerr tells an older lady in a doctor's waiting room, he doesn't hate his opponents. Not at all. The idea is almost laughable to him. It's just a job, and they're just his coworkers. It's one of countless moments meticulously reconstructed in The Smashing Machine, replicating the words without the spirit (a little like the clunkier moments of The Room biopic The Disaster Artist). When Kerr has this conversation, it sounds like he's had it a million times, with his parents, with folks in the checkout line, with people on the bus. A familiar refrain trotted out at cocktail parties. The Rock can't help but sound coached, like he's talking down to someone on a red carpet, even when repeating the footage verbatim.

That's one side of Mark Kerr, one side of The Smashing Machine. Then, when the shirts come off and the lights go up, Hyams captures the combat with a similar inimitable clarity. Just as The Life And Times hovers in the corners of Kerr's suburban Southwest life—the perfect vantage to see all the ugly and strange little details poking out of the Americana, like hypodermic needles out of a black Hefty bag—Hyams keeps his camera unflinchingly locked on the thudding collisions between elbows and ribs, knees and skulls, fists and livers. Safdie's film is enamored of the spectacle, of the life-defining gulf between winning and losing. His fights cut away to crowd reactions, overwhelmed by the lights and music. Hyams stares blankly at the bloody damage, scored mainly by the dull sounds of human meat being tenderized.

This could be linked to the movies' respective relationships to the MMA of their eras. Hyams made his film when the sport was still on the relative fringes, its brutality banned across the U.S. and its reputation, as the woman in the doctor's office reminds us, still obscene. The Smashing Machine is set in this era, but was filmed with the knowledge that the sport would rise again, boosted to respectability by an increasingly toxic TV environment (Spike TV was UFC's savior) and the always alluring promise of cash. Colored by this future, The Smashing Machine broadens its approach to the wider audience MMA now commands. Hyams' documentary was entrenched in the grungy, strange, relatively underground indignities of Kerr's career—it simply didn't know any other way to be.

This difference is captured, unassumingly, by a small deviation The Smashing Machine makes from The Life And Times. At the end of The Smashing Machine, when a fight is inter-cut with Kerr getting his chin stitched up in a side room, the doctor attending to him is American, chatting with him nonchalantly in English. In reality, because this tournament was held in Japan, the doctors sewing him up were Japanese, and were speaking to each other in a language Kerr couldn't understand. The latter scene, the real scene, doesn't just juxtapose a competition Kerr has been knocked out of with the toll taken on his body. It spotlights a man who, when outside the ring, is alone and isolated, lost among people who know what to do with his body, but not with him.

These silent insights are also found in what the documentary doesn't show of Kerr's relationships. We get to fill in the intense gaps left by the film—whether they're between Kerr and his girlfriend Dawn, or Kerr and his trainer, or Kerr and his superstitiously sexist colleagues, or Kerr and his college pals who help stage his opioid intervention—while Safdie spells it all out through obvious melodrama. It's another concession to a wider prospective audience that Hyams never conceived of pandering to. It's the small yet potent difference between a fascinating reality and an alienating fiction.

This would not be the last time John Hyams mined melancholy from the edges of action. Son of Peter Hyams (Timecop, Sudden Death), Hyams would make a few more documentaries after Smashing Machine, then take up the family tradition of directing Jean-Claude Van Damme. His final entries in the Universal Soldier franchise turned its super-soldier fantasy into a nightmare of eternal war. Finding the tragedy in the broken-down physiques of bodies built for violence became something of a specialty for Hyams. The hardships endured by Van Damme and Scott Adkins grew naturally from those endured by Mark Kerr. Even as the conflicts in his films escalated, Hyams knew that the vulnerable men at the center, the men who hated that they loved the constant fight, were the real draw.

'Meara & Stiller: Nothing Is Lost,' a NYFF movie about the 'Severance' director's famous mom and dad, could be the humanist doc of the season.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	To an older generation, they were Stiller & Meara, the comedy duo with an endless reserve of gently absurd sketches on The Ed Sullivan Show. To a younger generation, he was the fulminating father of George Costanza on Seinfeld.


	To Ben Stiller, of course, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara were something far more intimate: his lovable but deeply complicated parents.




	The Severance-y Stiller documents his forebears in all their messy glory in Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, a new documentary that world-premiered at the New York Film Festival on Sunday, ahead of its debut in theaters and on Apple TV+ later this month. What starts (and indeed what started out) as an affectionate but membrane-thick portrait of American comedy royalty turns into something unimaginably layered, investigating numerous spousal and parental relationships — and asking tough questions about the price of perfectionism, the pitfalls of parenthood and, really, the ultimate value of an earthly life.

	“Yeah, it's a little personal,” Stiller said before the screening as he described what his family thought of him embarking on this quest. “But it's also, I think, in a way about everyone.” 


	Even to those who know the comedy of the Jewish-American Stiller and Irish-American Meara (they died in 2020 and 2015, respectively), some of the background will surprise — he, an army veteran from an unloving Brooklyn home who urgently sought validation from audiences; she, a nimble comic talent weighted down by her mother's suicide when she was still a girl. 


	Ben Stiller, who does not skimp on his parents' best moments in front of a camera, is also not afraid to expose the dark side they showed to him and his older sister Amy; subjects like Anne's alcoholism and Jerry's work obsession at the expense of his family each get rich treatment. And the elder Stiller's relentless devotion to Meara — he is seen onscreen just once from the recent past, and it's to tout the greatness of his late wife — could blind him to her flaws and the ways her behavior at times might have been hurting the family. 

	











	But it is when Stiller turns the camera on himself — or more specifically on his wife and two kids — that the film clicks into gear, asking how much we repeat the mistakes of our parents and the limits of what we can learn from the past. Ben Stiller sought to avoid the trap of putting his work above his family, but over the course of making the movie touchingly realizes, with his kids nearly grown, he has in fact replicated it. In one of the film's most pointed moments, Stiller's 20-year-old son Quinlin sensitively tells his father he feels he and his sister came second to Ben's work, much as Ben felt he did with Jerry. The look on the director's face in that moment says it all.


	“As a filmmaker, i think ‘this is a good moment for the movie.' Stiller said after the screening of that interaction. “But personally it's ‘oh that sucks.'” (Stiller called out to his kids who were at the screening to ask what they thought of the film and Quinlin yelled back “Terrible,” to laughter, before clarifying that he thought it was great.)


	Apart from the whole famous thing, the title couple also lived exceedingly shared lives, and the film is interested in the impossible tangle of a 24-hour life and work partnership, where, as Anne says, it can be hard to know where the comedy team ends and the marriage begins. Ben Stiller and his wife Christine Taylor also frequently worked together, though with slightly fewer pitfalls; Taylor's voice, it should be said, brings high levels of consideration and insight in a film not lacking for either quality.

	











	Stiller sets the film at the sprawling Upper West Side apartment where Anne and Jerry raised their family and to which Ben and Amy have returned after Jerry's death to go through, pack up and throw out all their parents' stuff to prepare for the sale of the longtime home. And there is so much stuff. Jerry Stiller had a compulsive need to record and save everything, and as we watch Ben Stiller take it all in after his father's death, there is something both humanizing and surreal at the sight of a famous actor undergoing the same heart-wrenching ritual as everyone else.


	At that rummage-y point several years ago, Ben Stiller had no idea where his filmic lark would lead. Because Jerry Stiller had died during COVID there was no memorial, and Ben simply thought of his shoots as a kind of cinematic equivalent of one: important to the family and comedy completists, of little interest to anyone else. 


	But as he showed footage to friends and entertainment colleagues, he began to get a certain kind of feedback: maybe it would work better if you went deeper and even bared your own soul? “I was pushing myself out of it because I didn't want it to be about me,” Stiller said at the screening. “And I realized I had to go the opposite way.”


	If the director comes out of this process feeling, dishearteningly, that parental mistakes have been repeated, he does possess the vulnerability to admit it. While full generational improvement may be a pipe dream, the movie at least suggests the benefits of the modern urge to explore and expose. One can't imagine the subjects of the film ever turning a critical eye on themselves in this way; indeed, Jerry seems uncomfortable whenever Anne discusses even banal details of their relationship on camera. (Ben Stiller after the screening said he thought his mother would like the movie, but his father might be uncomfortable with how much was shared.)

	











	The film is subtitled Nothing Is Lost, and while its melancholy aura in fact contradictorily suggests that so much fades, as the Stillers comb through both artifacts and feelings, the movie also finds much encouragement in the sheer bid, however uncomfortable, to make sure some things are preserved.

Britney Spears sparked concern among fans after revealing a painful leg injury in her latest Instagram video, just days after spending time with her sons, Sean, 20, and Jayden, 19. In the clip, the 43-year-old pop icon danced inside her home wearing a sparkling pink mini dress, accessorized with fingerless gloves and black heels. A white bandage wrapped around her right knee was clearly visible as she moved carefully to the music before briefly sitting at her piano to play a few notes.

“I fell down the stairs, and my leg snaps out now and then,” Spears explained in her caption, adding that she's “not sure if it's broken.”

Fans quickly flooded the comments with messages of concern. “Hope she's getting good care and rest,” one user wrote on X, while another added, “Oh no, that sounds painful!”

The “Toxic” singer's post quickly went viral as fans voiced their concern for her well-being. Spears' followers have long monitored her social media activity for signs of distress following the end of her 13-year conservatorship in 2021.

Later in the day, she shared another video in two new looks — one featuring a plunging cheetah-print swimsuit and another in a glittering gold crop top and shorts. In one clip, her knee bandage was still visible. “As Madonna says, express yourself, don't repress yourself,” she captioned the post.

The video comes shortly after Spears spent time with her sons for the first time in nearly two years. She shares Sean and Jayden with ex-husband Kevin Federline, who now lives in Hawaii.

In June, Spears posted a video celebrating Jayden's new Mercedes AMG SL 63, valued at $187,000. “He's 6'3″ and his hands are so big now! How long am I going to be in shock?” she wrote. “I'm blessed. Just please be careful with my heart too!”

Sources told the Daily Mail that those close to Spears are “wary” that Jayden's new music interests could lead to family tension, fearing he may use her fame and connections for career gain.

Amid ongoing personal struggles, Britney Spears is reportedly facing new professional hurdles. Sources claim that production on her long-awaited biopic — inspired by her 2023 memoir “The Woman in Me” — has stalled, with insiders citing concerns over the singer's “erratic” behavior, leaving Hollywood producers frustrated.

Still, fans remain steadfast in their support. “She's been through so much. I just hope she finds peace,” one person commented under her latest post, echoing the sentiment of many.

Despite recent challenges, Spears' devoted fan base continues to rally behind her, hoping she finds stability, healing, and the creative freedom she has fought for since the end of her conservatorship.

The first music video from Swift's new album premiered in movie theaters, but wasn't available to watch at home until Sunday night.

Taylor Swift‘s “The Fate of Ophelia” music video is now streaming on YouTube, following an exclusive early release to movie theaters in the U.S. on Friday (Oct. 3).

	Written and directed by Swift herself, the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia” made it online Sunday night (Oct. 5). The reference-filled visual has the pop star playing several parts, or showing several sides — among them the once ill-fated Ophelia of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, the lead in a Golden Age Hollywood movie musical, a frontwoman to a 1960s girl group, and the modern Swift showgirl that audiences know and love.

	Of course, Swift's single imagines an Ophelia who makes her way out of a destined tragic ending.


	In the accompanying music video (seen below), Swift crawls out of an on-set version of a Sir John Everett Millais painting circa the 1850s that famously depicts Ophelia's drowning. She performs different iterations of a “Fate of Ophelia” show — in homage to the likenesses of Marilyn Monroe in one scene and Ronnie Spector/The Ronettes in another, and center soundstage in an Anything Goes-inspired ensemble — and ends up soaking in her bathtub by the clip's end. She's presumably exhausted after playing all the parts, but still quite alive.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” music video wraps with the image that became the official album cover for Swift's newly released The Life of a Showgirl.

	











	Earlier on Sunday, Swift's team posted a short interview clip that has the singer-songwriter explaining how the album art came to be.


	“There was this moment in the photo shoot [with photographers Mert Alaş and Marcus Piggott] right at the end of the day, the last setup, I'm in this bathtub in this bedazzled dress,” she said. “They take my picture. I see it on the monitor. I see it pop up. Even though it was at the weirdest angle, and I'm in the bathtub, I'm just like, ‘That's the cover.' And it was.”


	She added, “I went and looked at the picture like, ‘Yeah. That's it.' I think it represents to me that you've done all this work, you've done a three-and-a-half hour show, you've done the lead-up to it, you've done the warm-ups, you've gotten through it. Anything that could've gone wrong, you sidestepped. You finally get back, what do you do? You take a bath.”


	“That's what I do in those situations,” she said. “It's like that moment of relaxation. That moment the cameras are down, the lights are off. What do you have to say? What's your story? Who are you then? That's really the story of this album.”

Opening-day album sales for The Life of a Showgirl, as reported by data tracking firm Luminate, reached 2.7 million on its first day of release (Oct. 3). That tally counts traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album. It marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991; Adele currently holds the largest sales week with 25. Further news of Showgirl‘s first-week building sales and streaming activity will be available in the coming days.

	











	“The Fate of Ophelia” music video was first shown in theaters as part of The Release Party of a Showgirl, Swift's theatrical event that opened at No. 1 at the box office this weekend. The screening featured the music video premiere and behind-the-scenes footage from making it, plus Swift's commentary on all 12 songs from The Life of a Showgirl and a first viewing of each track's lyric video. It also revealed an unexpected co-star appearing in “The Fate of Ophelia” video: a loaf of Swift's homemade sourdough bread.

Despite the extraterrestrial associations often encouraged by paranormal enthusiasts, the term UFO – as well as its modern-day equivalent “UAP” – in no way implies the involvement of alien beings in these phenomena. In fact, the scientific study of these incidents is only hindered by idle speculation surrounding little green men and their intentions. That's why it's a shame that most documentaries about the subject assume that you're already part of the worldwide cult of E.T. truthers, an approach that makes it difficult to take most of these productions seriously.

Thankfully, this isn't always the case, and Small Town Monsters' latest production is a rare example of a UFO documentary willing to make do with historical facts and credible eyewitness reports while skillfully avoiding most of the common pitfalls that plague the genre. Directed by Seth Breedlove (who helmed most of the previous films in the series, including The Mothman Legacy and On The Trail of Bigfoot), Lost Contact: UFOs After Wartime stands out from previous Small Town Monsters projects by focusing more on the tangible and historical aspects of a tragic true story.

In the film, photographs, historical footage, and interviews with surviving witnesses are used to tell the story of World War II fighter pilot Thomas Mantell Jr., an experienced veteran who survived the war only to die in a mysterious crash after being ordered to pursue an unidentified object flying above the skies of his homeland. With the help of expert consultants, the documentary explores the cover-up that allegedly ensued after Mantell's death, with the government denying any strange occurrences despite several details about both the accident and its immediate aftermath not adding up.



This fascinating sequence of bizarre events is sure to keep both general audiences and die-hard Ufologists entertained throughout the majority of the flick's 90-minute runtime. The information is presented in a clear and concise manner, and the story itself is filled with eerie little details suggesting a larger conspiracy (like how Mantell's coffin was supposedly lined with lead as well as claims that the military showed up decades later to collect additional samples from the crash site).

The subject matter does a lot of the heavy lifting here, with the filmmaking itself feeling rather barebones, with the exception of a few stylish projections and the occasional interesting question. Aaron Deese's narration even invokes a monotonous High-School history class at times, though that has more to do with bland writing than the actor himself.

Regardless, the biggest issue here is pacing. Mantell's fateful crash may be the perfect subject for a spooky documentary, but it's clear that Lost Contact could have told the exact same story as an hour-long TV special containing all of the same information in a more easily digestible form.

That being said, repetitive talking heads and familiar archival footage are par for the course when it comes to low-budget documentaries, though the same excuse can't be applied to Breedlove's regrettable (though admittedly brief) inclusion of AI-enhanced imagery in the film. I can understand the instinct to inject some visual variety into the feature by animating old photographs and diagrams, but this kind of cheap digital shortcut only hurts an otherwise credible experience without actually adding any value to it – and I really hope that we don't see more of this in future Small Town Monsters projects.

Thankfully, the rest of the film remains a decidedly human affair, and I especially appreciate the inclusion of interviews about Mantell's family life and who he was as a person. After all, a 25-year-old human being perished because of dangerous orders from a superior officer, so it's refreshing to see Breedlove and his team make an effort to remember the tragedy at the heart of the incident, regardless of the mystery surrounding it.

And while the documentary doesn't present viewers with definitive evidence of the existence of aliens or even a solid theory about what exactly happened up there (though nearly everyone involved with the film rejects the balloon hypothesis), I think these answers are beside the point. Breedlove isn't really trying to make up anyone's mind regarding the incident, but instead attempting to tell a compelling true story that touches on everything from Cold War paranoia to government censorship, and that's where he succeeds.

Ironically enough, Lost Contact is one of the most down-to-earth explorations of an alleged close encounter that I've seen in years, and this sober approach to the subject matter is precisely why I found it so refreshing. Sure, the film's presentation could have used some polish, but the source material is captivating enough to carry the experience through to the finish line.

It's unlikely that we'll ever uncover the complete truth behind what happened to Mantell on that fateful afternoon back in 1948, but Breedlove's latest documentary is a great place to start the investigation.

Lost Contact: UFOs After Wartime releases on VOD on October 7, 2025.

The oldest and possibly “most haunted” hotel in Las Vegas is hosting a contest just in time for spooky season.

Thrill-seekers up for the challenge will have the opportunity to apply to spend a weekend inside the El Cortez Hotel & Casino hunting down ghosts — in the hopes of winning a $5,000 prize.

Only one lucky soul will be chosen to participate.

The legendary El Cortez, the longest-running hotel casino in Vegas, is situated on Fremont Street, often referred to as “the Old Strip” or “Old Vegas.”

This old-school hotel — and many others on Fremont — has seen it all since it first opened its doors in 1041: mobsters, murders and even paranormal activities.

In a hotel that is 84-years-old — it's almost expected for guests to see and hear some creepy things, like phantom footsteps and shadowy figures.

“We're sending you to investigate, fully equipped with ghost-hunting gear, to see if the stories are true!” the contest listing from Casino.org read.

“The chosen ghost hunter will check in to the El Cortez for a haunted weekend stay, where you'll explore the casino's oldest and eeriest corners, searching for signs of ghostly activity.”

The chosen one will be tasked with walking through the hotel's corridors, casino floor and any other areas that are thought to be haunted using ghost-hunting equipment such as EMF meters, EVP recorders and thermal sensors to detect unusual activity — at night.

The ghost hunting contest runs from Oct. 6 through Oct. 31, and the trip is expected to take place in early December.

If anything spooky is found, the ghost hunter will be expected to take photos and videos for evidence and to journal a short report of the scariest, funniest or mysterious findings.

It's rumored that the El Cortez basement is full of the ashes and cremated remains of former employees who died without any family, making the hunt a little more eerie.

And $5,000 can go a long way these days, considering people can't get over the wildly high prices Vegas is charging visitors these days.

“Having a coffee that was $14 was crazy. I just wasn't expecting that. It was just a latte with a few extra flavors,” Katherine from College Station, Texas, told Fox News Digital.

“I got a drink this morning. It was, like, $12 for a lemonade or something like that. And water bottles are so expensive,” her daughter Cammie added.

Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for Dungeons & Dragons. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.

In a blog post on D&D Beyond the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous Unearthed Arcana.

Some of the core changes were meant to streamline the class. Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.

The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.

The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.

The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.

The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.

Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life.

Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System.

However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed.

In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored.

The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise.

We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space – from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces – with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.

Is it the invasion of the genome snatchers?

Just in case the idea of aliens walking around in human skin suits wasn't frightening enough. An outlandish study asserts that aliens might have abducted us and inserted genes into human DNA, with the fallout affecting potentially millions of people.

“Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation,” lead researcher Dr. Max Rempel, the founder and CEO of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, told the Daily Mail of the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.

Rempel came to this far-fetched-seeming conclusion by analyzing DNA from both regular people and those who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens. This comes following a spike in UFO sightings over the last year, making many fear that we are on the verge of some not-so-friendly close encounters.

The scientist specifically analyzed 581 complete families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 families that didn't appear to correspond to either family.

These genetic aberrations entailed a bundle of 348 non-parental genetic variants. As the subjects were born before 1990, this ruled out human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, which only emerged in 2013.

Rempel also analyzed 23andMe results from individuals who self-identify as alien abductees, discovering that some families showed evidence of non-parental markers.

If this evidence is confirmed to be true, the alien prober feels that “it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.” In other words, like the premises of every sci-fi flick from “Invasion Of The Body Snatchers” to “They Live,” the aliens are already walking amongst us, camouflaged our genes, per his theory.

The extra-terrestrial enthusiast even claimed that noted that a good portion of those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's, and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions, although he noted this is speculation at this point.

He even suggested that these extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy, much like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi sequel “Alien Resurrection.”

Of course, there are some caveats to this out-there study. Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, noted that there is “no conclusive evidence yet” as they “need better datasets, which are available only on approval.”

“That takes time and effort,” said the scientist, who added that current commercial genotyping services, which rely on array-based data, aren't precise enough to support such radical claims. Instead, he advocates for next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which can detect novel variants with much higher resolution.

Rempel's hope is to use high-resolution or next-generation sequencing — which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution — to analyze parents and children who identify as alien abductees and hopefully pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand.

Not to mention that the researcher's theory is in the same wheelhouse as the most fringe alien-hybrid hypotheses floated by tinfoil hat conspiracists, such as the Naza mummies, which reportedly harbor both human and alien DNA.

Nigel Watson, author of “Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited,” urged caution due to the sample size and the challenge of studying those with anecdotal evidence of alien abductions.

‘Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors,” he said. “We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”

Nonetheless, Watson believes that further genetic research on volunteer abductees is needed and could potentially prove as “world-shattering as recovering a flying saucer.”

In the interim, Rempel believes that possible “alien hybridization” could have major implications for the future of humanity.

“We need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet, and which alien races we might give priority,” he said.

Is it the invasion of the genome snatchers?

Just in case the idea of aliens walking around in human skin suits wasn't frightening enough. An outlandish study asserts that aliens might have abducted us and inserted genes into human DNA, with the fallout affecting potentially millions of people.

“Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation,” lead researcher Dr. Max Rempel, the founder and CEO of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, told the Daily Mail of the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.

Rempel came to this far-fetched-seeming conclusion by analyzing DNA from both regular people and those who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens. This comes following a spike in UFO sightings over the last year, making many fear that we are on the verge of some not-so-friendly close encounters.

The scientist specifically analyzed 581 complete families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 families that didn't appear to correspond to either family.

These genetic aberrations entailed a bundle of 348 non-parental genetic variants. As the subjects were born before 1990, this ruled out human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, which only emerged in 2013.

Rempel also analyzed 23andMe results from individuals who self-identify as alien abductees, discovering that some families showed evidence of non-parental markers.

If this evidence is confirmed to be true, the alien prober feels that “it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.” In other words, like the premises of every sci-fi flick from “Invasion Of The Body Snatchers” to “They Live,” the aliens are already walking amongst us, camouflaged our genes, per his theory.

The extra-terrestrial enthusiast even claimed that noted that a good portion of those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's, and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions, although he noted this is speculation at this point. 

He even suggested that these extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy, much like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi sequel “Alien Resurrection.”

Of course, there are some caveats to this out-there study. Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, noted that there is “no conclusive evidence yet” as they “need better datasets, which are available only on approval.”

“That takes time and effort,” said the scientist, who added that current commercial genotyping services, which rely on array-based data, aren't precise enough to support such radical claims. Instead, he advocates for next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which can detect novel variants with much higher resolution.

Rempel's hope is to use high-resolution or next-generation sequencing — which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution — to analyze parents and children who identify as alien abductees and hopefully pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand.

ANDERSON, Calif. - A 37-year-old woman from Anderson, Hannah Chacon, remains missing after she vanished this past summer. She was last seen on August 9 at 8:30 a.m., leaving her mother's home at Blue Oak Court Apartments on Highway 273.

Hannah has a rare disorder called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, also known as "Brain on Fire." During episodes, she may appear psychotic and experience seizures.

Mary Chacon, Hannah's mother, said, "Last words were, I love you, mom and if she went, I gotta go, that was it."

Mary Chacon shared her belief that Hannah is still out there and in need of help. "My inclination, my gut feel as a mother, is that she's still out there and no one has commented on her or seen her if I just feel the mom feels I know she's out there and she needs help," she said.

She explained that Hannah's symptoms might make her seem as though she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, which could cause the public to hesitate in offering assistance. "Some of those symptoms makes them appear as if they're on very heavy drugs or alcohol or mentally ill psychotic schizophrenic because of that people will tend to back away from her, so if she's in need of help, they may be fearful the public may be fearful of trying to help her when in fact, if they can find her call 911 she needs to be transported immediately to an emergency room," said Mary Chacon.

Police later found Hannah's phone along the Sacramento River in Anderson, providing a clue to her last whereabouts. Mary wants searchers to look along the river for signs of her daughter.

Hannah is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 185 pounds, and has short brown hair and brown eyes. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a black pullover sweater, olive green shorts, and tennis shoes. She also has tattoos on her arms and ankle.

Anyone with information on Hannah's whereabouts is urged to contact the Anderson Police Department at (530) 378-6606 or call 911.

Jensen Ackles teases filming a scene for The Boys Season 5 that caught him totally off-guard: "I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for that."

During Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far, The Road Ahead": Creation Philadelphia, Misha Collins shared some interesting details on his and Jared Padalecki's Supernatural reunion with Jensen Ackles for the fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys. But the ten-ton teases didn't stop there, with Ackles sharing an anecdote about filming a scene for the upcoming season that gives us a much better sense of just how much Kripke is dialing up things for the streaming series' final run.

"I walk into the scene. Soldier Boy. And I turn the corner and I go, 'Oh my god.' That wasn't my line," Ackles shared, getting a nice wave of laughter from the audience. "And I was supposed to stay there. But I hadn't seen what was going on. We'd blocked it out. We rehearsed it. Things changed when the camera was rolling, and I hadn't seen it. And I walked in and it was, 'Dear God,' and I just walked back out. And they were like, 'Uh, cut?' And I was like, 'I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for that [laughter]. And I don't think anybody else will be either." Ackles and Padalecki gave each other very knowing stares before Padalecki said, "I can't wait," and Ackles yelled to the audience, "Enjoy!"

Here's a look at what Ackles had to tease during #SPNPhilly on Sunday – and once again, a ton of thanks and appreciation to Fangasm for continuing with the excellent coverage:

During his Saturday session, Collins discussed how the video that the trio posted, confirming that they would be filming together, pulled in millions of viewers. From there, Collins dropped a ten-ton tease that there are other "surprise guests" on tap for the episode, too. In addition, Collins shared how director Philip Sgriccia (definitely no stranger to Supernatural) made the call after the trio filmed their scene to give it another go as Sam, Dean, and Castiel:
