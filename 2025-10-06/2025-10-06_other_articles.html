Aaron Deese's narration even invokes a monotonous High-School history class at times, though that has more to do with bland writing than the actor himself. I can understand the instinct to inject some visual variety into the feature by animating old photographs and diagrams, but this kind of cheap digital shortcut only hurts an otherwise credible experience without actually adding any value to it – and I really hope that we don't see more of this in future Small Town Monsters projects. Ironically enough, Lost Contact is one of the most down-to-earth explorations of an alleged close encounter that I've seen in years, and this sober approach to the subject matter is precisely why I found it so refreshing. It's unlikely that we'll ever uncover the complete truth behind what happened to Mantell on that fateful afternoon back in 1948, but Breedlove's latest documentary is a great place to start the investigation. ‘Monster Girls' Trailer – First Documentary to Explore the Work of Women in Makeup & Creature Design ‘I Know Catherine, The Log Lady' Trailer – Documentary Chronicles “Twin Peaks” Actress' Final Performance UFO Conspiracy Thriller from ‘Top Gun: Maverick' Director Joseph Kosinski Ignites Bidding War</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The oldest and possibly “most haunted” hotel in Las Vegas is hosting a contest just in time for spooky season. Only one lucky soul will be chosen to participate. This old-school hotel — and many others on Fremont — has seen it all since it first opened its doors in 1041: mobsters, murders and even paranormal activities. In a hotel that is 84-years-old — it's almost expected for guests to see and hear some creepy things, like phantom footsteps and shadowy figures. “We're sending you to investigate, fully equipped with ghost-hunting gear, to see if the stories are true!” the contest listing from Casino.org read. “The chosen ghost hunter will check in to the El Cortez for a haunted weekend stay, where you'll explore the casino's oldest and eeriest corners, searching for signs of ghostly activity.” The chosen one will be tasked with walking through the hotel's corridors, casino floor and any other areas that are thought to be haunted using ghost-hunting equipment such as EMF meters, EVP recorders and thermal sensors to detect unusual activity — at night. If anything spooky is found, the ghost hunter will be expected to take photos and videos for evidence and to journal a short report of the scariest, funniest or mysterious findings. And $5,000 can go a long way these days, considering people can't get over the wildly high prices Vegas is charging visitors these days. And water bottles are so expensive,” her daughter Cammie added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for Dungeons & Dragons. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. Ever since he was small, Tyler Chancey has had a deep, abiding love for video games and a tendency to think and overanalyze everything he enjoyed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life. Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System. However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed. In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored. The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise. We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space – from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces – with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An outlandish study asserts that aliens might have abducted us and inserted genes into human DNA, with the fallout affecting potentially millions of people. This comes following a spike in UFO sightings over the last year, making many fear that we are on the verge of some not-so-friendly close encounters. The scientist specifically analyzed 581 complete families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 families that didn't appear to correspond to either family. As the subjects were born before 1990, this ruled out human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, which only emerged in 2013. Rempel also analyzed 23andMe results from individuals who self-identify as alien abductees, discovering that some families showed evidence of non-parental markers. If this evidence is confirmed to be true, the alien prober feels that “it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.” In other words, like the premises of every sci-fi flick from “Invasion Of The Body Snatchers” to “They Live,” the aliens are already walking amongst us, camouflaged our genes, per his theory. The extra-terrestrial enthusiast even claimed that noted that a good portion of those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's, and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions, although he noted this is speculation at this point. He even suggested that these extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy, much like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi sequel “Alien Resurrection.” Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, noted that there is “no conclusive evidence yet” as they “need better datasets, which are available only on approval.” “That takes time and effort,” said the scientist, who added that current commercial genotyping services, which rely on array-based data, aren't precise enough to support such radical claims. Rempel's hope is to use high-resolution or next-generation sequencing — which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution — to analyze parents and children who identify as alien abductees and hopefully pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand. ‘Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors,” he said. “We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”</p>

"Some of those symptoms makes them appear as if they're on very heavy drugs or alcohol or mentally ill psychotic schizophrenic because of that people will tend to back away from her, so if she's in need of help, they may be fearful the public may be fearful of trying to help her when in fact, if they can find her call 911 she needs to be transported immediately to an emergency room," said Mary Chacon. Police later found Hannah's phone along the Sacramento River in Anderson, providing a clue to her last whereabouts. Mary wants searchers to look along the river for signs of her daughter. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a black pullover sweater, olive green shorts, and tennis shoes. Anyone with information on Hannah's whereabouts is urged to contact the Anderson Police Department at (530) 378-6606 or call 911.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: Supernatural, the boys Jensen Ackles teases filming a scene for The Boys Season 5 that caught him totally off-guard: "I'm sorry. During Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far, The Road Ahead": Creation Philadelphia, Misha Collins shared some interesting details on his and Jared Padalecki's Supernatural reunion with Jensen Ackles for the fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys. But the ten-ton teases didn't stop there, with Ackles sharing an anecdote about filming a scene for the upcoming season that gives us a much better sense of just how much Kripke is dialing up things for the streaming series' final run. That wasn't my line," Ackles shared, getting a nice wave of laughter from the audience. "And I was supposed to stay there. But I hadn't seen what was going on. Things changed when the camera was rolling, and I hadn't seen it. I wasn't prepared for that [laughter]. And I don't think anybody else will be either." Ackles and Padalecki gave each other very knowing stares before Padalecki said, "I can't wait," and Ackles yelled to the audience, "Enjoy!" Here's a look at what Ackles had to tease during #SPNPhilly on Sunday – and once again, a ton of thanks and appreciation to Fangasm for continuing with the excellent coverage: That time @JensenAckles walked into a scene on #TheBoys and was like OMG…and that was not his line. During his Saturday session, Collins discussed how the video that the trio posted, confirming that they would be filming together, pulled in millions of viewers. From there, Collins dropped a ten-ton tease that there are other "surprise guests" on tap for the episode, too. In addition, Collins shared how director Philip Sgriccia (definitely no stranger to Supernatural) made the call after the trio filmed their scene to give it another go as Sam, Dean, and Castiel:</p>
