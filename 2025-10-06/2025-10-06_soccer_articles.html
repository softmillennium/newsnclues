                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Demand for World Cup tickets is surging despite sky-high prices. FIFA raised ticket prices for at least nine 2026 World Cup games after just one full day of sales, in response to demand that seems undeterred by record-setting price tags. The assumption was that most price adjustments would occur after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when matchups will be set and demand will increase for games involving popular teams. But on Friday, in the second window of the very first lottery phase, fans logged into FIFA's ticketing portal and already saw some prices that were slightly higher than the ones first revealed Wednesday. On Monday, in the third window, there were at least a few more upticks. According to screenshots sent by fans to The Athletic, Category 1 prices also increased Friday by a similar amount — roughly 5% — for three of the four quarterfinals; at least three Round of 16 matches; the first Round of 32 match at SoFi Stadium in Southern California; and the USMNT's third group game, also at SoFi. For the Round of 16 game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the Category 1 price jumped from $895 on Wednesday to $935 on Friday, then to $980 on Monday — at which point the game's entire first-phase allotment sold out. The adjustments, the availability of tickets after 48 hours of purchasing, and exorbitant price listings on resale sites, suggest that some fans are more than willing to pay the prices that others have deemed “astonishing” and “unacceptable.” Multiple fans who won the opportunity to purchase tickets on Monday told The Athletic that they ultimately didn't buy any — in some cases because prices were too high, in other cases because, after less than three full days of sales, nearly all coveted tickets were gone. By Monday evening, none were available for the Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals or final. FIFA made around 1 million tickets — roughly 15% of the total inventory — available in this first “Visa presale” phase. (More will be available for all games in later phases.) From a pool of around 4.5 million entrants, it randomly selected a lucky few for the first of several time slots: Wednesday at 11 a.m. But within a few hours of the curtain raising last Wednesday, before most fans got through a digital queue, tickets to the final — priced from $2,030 to $6,730 — were no longer available. By Wednesday night, the thousands of tickets made available for Mexico's three group games were also gone. By the end of that first 24-hour window, nearly all Category 4 allotments and many Category 3 allotments — the cheaper categories — had also sold out. The sales likely confirmed suspicions that, despite the backlash to FIFA's initial prices, they were actually an underestimate of market value and demand. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said last month. FIFA oversees global soccer and funnels a majority of its revenue back into the sport, and has been capitalizing on that excess World Cup demand in a variety of ways. On Thursday, FIFA also launched its World Cup ticket resale platform, where some of Wednesday's buyers quickly listed tickets for several times the price they'd paid a day earlier. As millions of fans were shut out of this first lottery phase, anxiously awaiting acceptance emails that haven't yet come, FIFA has sold many “RTB” tokens for hundreds or thousands of dollars apiece. They promise buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets to a specific match, in an unknown section, for a to-be-determined full price. “Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarifies on an FAQ page. “It only gives you access to purchase the ticket(s).” On Saturday, FIFA Collect went to market with its latest batch of RTBs. There were 12 available for Mexico's third group match, priced at $3,999 each, and they quickly sold out. And according to spinoff websites, last week and the mid-September week of ticket lottery applications were FIFA Collect's two most lucrative weeks on record, with over $2 million in primary sales — mostly of RTBs — in each seven-day span. RTB holders do not yet know when, or at what price, they'll be able to actually purchase tickets. A third lottery phase will then open after the World Cup draw in December. In this Visa presale phase, more entrants could be selected for purchasing windows between now and Oct. 21, but supply is waning. And only three matches — two in Kansas City, one in Santa Clara, California (near San Francisco) — had any standard Category 3 availability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Ream celebrated his 38th birthday as the U.S. Men's National Team reported for October camp on Sunday. Still, he jabbed at his younger teammate Cristian Roldan's age. Damn, you're old,” Ream said jokingly to Roldan in a media availability with the two veteran leaders on Monday. Ream and Roldan, along with goalkeeper Matt Turner, are the only players 30 years or older on the current National Team roster as the USMNT faces Ecuador (Oct. 10 in Austin, Texas) and Australia (Oct. 14 in Commerce City, Colo.). To round out 2025, the USA will face two more World Cup-bound squads Paraguay and Uruguay in the next window. During the last FIFA World Cup cycle in 2022, Ream contemplated whether that would be his first — and last — World Cup. At 38 years old and counting, there's no sign of the center back slowing down in the imminent future. “I've always maintained that I'll push myself to the absolute maximum and bring every ounce of playing time that I can out of my body and my mind,” Ream said. However, he understands the final decision isn't up to him, and he's willing to advance the team's success in any way. “He's revitalized his National Team career at an older age,” Roldan said of Ream. “It provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here with the team, to really believe that I could get here. He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level but sustain that throughout your career.” Before earning his first cap under Pochettino, Roldan gained confidence once again playing at the highest level this past summer. He credited his run with the Seattle Sounders FC in the FIFA Club World Cup and Leagues Cup as pivotal. Then he helped lift a trophy with a victory over Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF in the tournament featuring MLS and Liga MX squads. Pochettino utilized the September camp to bring in some different faces and allow the deeper player pool a chance to perform ahead of World Cup roster decisions. Roldan took full advantage of that opportunity with productive minutes in the first match against Korea Republic, which earned him a starting position in the USA's 2-0 win over Japan. In this October camp, it's about building on that for Roldan and the larger group. The time is now to continue growing winning habits. “I think that we had a good game against Japan, and how can we build off that?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And with eight months and three training camps remaining before the World Cup squad is set, 38-year-old Tim Ream appears almost certain to not only make Pochettino's roster, but remain in contention to start in the Group D opener June 12, 2026, at SoFi Stadium in greater Los Angeles. “I know I said after the last World Cup that, OK, it could be my very first and last,” the Charlotte FC player said Monday, one day after celebrating his birthday. The former Fulham standout was among 26 players invited to camp in Austin, Texas, ahead of Friday's friendly against Ecuador. Next comes Australia on Oct. 14 in the Denver suburbs. Through 14 U.S. matches this year, Ream leads the team in minutes played and is second to left back Max Arfsten in starts. In all 10 starting assignments, Ream has worn the captain's armband. That's the type of leader we need.” That Ream remains a pivotal piece after playing every minute at the 2022 tournament could be received in different ways. On the flip side, the lack of positional depth has left Ream almost indispensable — even with his physical limitations. “Listen: We all know I'm not the quickest,” he said with a smile. At the moment, with World Cup veterans Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson not at full strength, Ream and Crystal Palace's Chris Richards are the only sure bets on a backline that could include two or three center backs. The other central defenders in camp are Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers, Toulouse's Mark McKenzie and FC Cincinnati's Miles Robinson. Should someone supplant Ream, “I'm the old guy in the corner, handing out orange slices and giving pep talks to these guys,” he said. Whether that happens or not is obviously down to me, but then also down to other decisions and down to other players and their form, as well.” In 1994, Fernando Clavijo was 38, but four months younger than Ream would be next summer. Asked Monday to share tips about career longevity, Ream said, “I don't think we have long enough to sit here and go through everything. Kristin, his wife of more than 13 years, is also a former Saint Louis University soccer player. Ream adapted last year, when, late in the MLS season, he signed with Charlotte after more than 12 years in England with Bolton Wanderers and Fulham. Under English coach Dean Smith, Charlotte enters the international break in fourth place in the 15-team Eastern Conference and assured of a playoff berth. Ream's ability to extend his career — both at the club and international level — has inspired his teammates. “He's essentially revitalized his national team career at an older age, and it provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here, to really believe that I could get here,” said Roldan, 30, a 2022 World Cup player who, until last month, had gone more than two years without a call-up. “He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level, but sustain that throughout your career.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristian Roldan has said that positional stability and the confidence from a standout FIFA Club World Cup has led to him playing the best soccer of his life — and a revival with the U.S. men's national team. Roldan played the final half hour in a 2-0 defeat against Korea and then went the distance in a 2-0 win over Japan. Those displays helped the 2022 World Cup veteran earn a recall for this month's matches against Ecuador and Australia. Amid another standout campaign in MLS, the 30-year-old was asked Monday about how he's managed to revitalize his USMNT career. "I think that I benefited a whole lot from being able to play multiple positions in the last World Cup cycle, being able to fit into different tactical formations and positions. But now I've been able to hone in on being a center midfielder, a deep-lying midfielder and I think that's helped me tremendously — just being able to widen my range of passing, direct traffic, be a leader. Roldan said his confidence was boosted by a standout display this summer at the Club World Cup, where he impressed against powerhouse sides Atlético Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Botafogo. After the tournament ended, Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer was full of praise for Roldan after he went toe-to-toe with some of the world's best. "We should be talking about this for years to come because these three games …[especially] against Botafogo and Atlético, [Roldan] was the best player on the field," Schmetzer said. Roldan said that the three matches in June proved to him that he can perform on the biggest stage. "I think FIFA Club World Cup helped me tremendously," Roldan added. Holding my own against teams like PSG and Atlético really gave me a lot of confidence. "I'm playing with a lot of confidence right now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're planning to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup, prepare for sticker shock. And that is before prices begin rising through FIFA's controversial new dynamic pricing system. Final tickets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are now starting around $6,300. On the resale market, some are already listed for more than $25,000. Supporters and politicians argue FIFA, despite being a nonprofit, is prioritizing revenue over access. The system, familiar to fans of U.S. sports and air travel but largely foreign to European and South American soccer, adjusts ticket prices based on real-time demand. In Qatar, the highest price for a final ticket was $1,607. “This is the first time in history FIFA has used dynamic pricing for a World Cup,” said Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's Chief Operating Officer for 2026, in an interview with ESPN. Under dynamic pricing, ticket prices rise or fall depending on demand, but few fans know what they're buying when sales begin. With the tournament schedule still incomplete, tickets are sold without team assignments. That uncertainty makes early buying a gamble, but one many are still willing to take. For some, this World Cup could be the last chance to witness greatness. Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have already qualified. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the pricing model, pointing to examples where they have said dynamic pricing has helped fans. At the 2023 Club World Cup, also held in the U.S., tickets for a semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense dropped from $474 to just $13 within days. But fan groups say that's little comfort for those who bought early. In East Rutherford, many were frustrated when they paid top dollar for what turned out to be an underwhelming matchup. Others who waited bought tickets for less than the cost of a stadium beer. “This is not ‘make football truly global,' this is the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all,” said Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, in an interview with The Athletic. “FIFA's leadership seems unable to understand that it needs fans in the stands. None of this exists when you set such prices.” Some tickets to the final have already been listed for more than $25,000. At previous World Cups, combined fees were closer to 10 percent. FIFA defends the model as aligned with standard ticketing practices in North America. In public statements, the organization has said that revenues from both primary and secondary sales will be reinvested into global soccer development. It has set a $13 billion revenue target for the 2023 to 2026 cycle, up from $7.6 billion during the four years leading to Qatar. Some economists have argued that the approach, while unpopular, is economically sound. “FIFA deserves a lot of criticism,” they wrote, “but its pricing proposal at least acknowledges the real-world trade-offs that this complex event must navigate.” Prices for similar seats can vary widely depending on when a ticket is purchased. For supporters with limited means, that unpredictability could make access less equal. Democratic New York State Assemblyman and mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has become one of the most vocal political critics of FIFA's strategy. He launched a campaign titled “Game Over Greed,” calling on FIFA to end dynamic pricing, reinstate resale caps and reserve 15 percent of tickets for local residents at discounted prices. “The biggest sporting event in the world is happening in our backyard,” Mamdani said, “but most New Yorkers will be priced out of watching it live.” As pressure builds, FIFA has shown no signs of altering course.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Men's National Teams (U-20, U-19, U-17) to Train and Play Matches in Spain from Oct. 6-15 LOS ANGELES (Saturday, Oct. 4, 2025) – In a testament to the quality and commitment to excellence of the LA Galaxy Academy, 10 First Team and Academy products have been called up to participate in both international and domestic training camps. LA Galaxy defenders Riley Dalgado (U-20), Jose ‘Pepe' Magana, Jr. (U-19), Harbor Miller (U-19), midfielders Dylan Vanney (U-19), Vicente Garcia (U-17 2009s), and forwards Ruben Ramos, Jr. (U-19), and Aaron Medina (U-17 2009s), will all be participating in their respective international training camps to be held in Spain during the October FIFA window. In addition, LA Galaxy Academy defender Enrique Martinez and midfielder Mateo Tsakiris were called up to the U-17 Men's National Team (2008s) domestic camp in Fayetteville, GA from Oct. 6-10. These camps are a part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship. Notably, Alexsander Menedez (U-17 2009s) was also called in to camp with the U-17 Men's El Salvador National Team. The LA Galaxy Academy passionately believes in whole child development. The club provides a robust enrichment program including nutrition education, cognitive development, and college preparation. All these experiences are intentionally curated by experts who work with the LA Galaxy First Team, so Academy players are exposed to a well-rounded experience as they develop into young adults.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fluminense and Chelsea lock horns on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, before Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain contest the other match a day later at the same venue. However, in the expanded 2025 competition, things are being done a little differently. The Sporting News looks at FIFA's decision on a Club World Cup bronze-medal match and what it might mean for the World Cup next year. MORE:Full Club World Cup results and schedule | How the prize money works There is no third-place playoff game at the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. That means this week's beaten semifinalists will not have to stay in the United States to prepare for an additional fixture. FIFA decided not to include a bronze-medal playoff game at the expanded tournament so that participating clubs could resume their domestic commitments as soon as they had been eliminated. The sport's governing body said: "For the inaugural edition of the this elite global competition, FIFA decided not to include this match to ensure that clubs and players who do not make the final can transition to their next commitments as soon as possible." Certainly, the majority of competing sides would not have wanted to stay in the U.S. for an additional few days after losing a semifinal simply to play in a third-place game: Fluminense are partway through their 2025 season in Brazil, while Chelsea, Real Madrid and PSG all have preseason programmes due to start in the coming week or so. The international tournament, which will be played across the United States, Canada and Mexico, will see an expanded field of 48 national teams compete from June 11 to July 19 next year. The bronze-medal game between the losing semifinalists will take place on July 18 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa president Gianni Infantino has repeatedly insisted that "the world will be welcome" during next summer's men's World Cup, which will be held mostly by the USA, with some matches in Canada and Mexico. With political violence on the rise, state troops deployed to major cities by President Donald Trump, and a more hardline stance taken on immigration, the tournament's main host nation is in a state of division and disruption. As ticket sales begin and fans make travel plans, BBC Sport explores some of the issues causing concern. Last week the first batch of tickets for next summer's matches went on sale, with more than 4.5 million fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them. Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues last week. Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher. Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats. The Athletic also reports, external that Fifa will also implement 15% charges on both the buyer and seller of tickets resold via its official platform. Fifa did not respond to questions put forward by the BBC. "These prices are astonishing - $2,030 for the cheapest final ticket is unacceptable," said Thomas Concannon, who leads the Football Supporters Association's England Fans' Embassy. "If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 (£2,363) at least. "Combined with travel and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for match-going fans we've ever seen by some distance." Fifa is also adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods. "Dynamic pricing has really been a thing here for more than a decade," said Scott Friedman, found of the Ticket Talk Network in the USA. "For Fifa, it's supply and demand - they are trying to maximise their revenue. "People can't really travel from overseas to do that. During his previous term in office, when the World Cup bid was accepted, Trump signed a letter insisting that "all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination". Some fans, including those from the UK and EU, will be able to travel to the World Cup without a visa. That is because 42 territories are in the USA's Visa Waiver Program, meanings fans will only need to apply via the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, which is usually approved or rejected within 72 hours. But citizens of most countries, especially those in Asia, Africa and South America - including plenty who have either already secured qualification for the World Cup or are likely do so - do have to apply for visas. Applications for US visas usually involve at least one face-to-face interview at an embassy, and the Trump administration has increased its officials' powers to investigate applicants' social media use and public political statements. Last week the State Department announced it will increase staffing levels at some embassies in order to try to process applications more quickly, but hasn't revealed which countries or how many staff. "We have a long way to go before we're ready to welcome the world," said Travis Murphy, a former State Department diplomat and founder of Jetr Global Sports, which helps international athletes access US visas. "The current administration has been outspoken in terms of limiting international travel, and putting restrictions into some processes to make it more difficult. The regulations really haven't changed that much - how strictly some of the rules are enforced is really what is [important] here. "I would hate to see our country put itself in a position where future events might be pulled away because of how we handle this." The current wait time for a US visa interview, in which applicants have to convince an individual official that their visit should be permitted, is up to 15 months in Colombia Forced deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have also increased on the orders of Trump, who has deployed National Guard troops in Democrat-led cities, including Los Angeles, which will host eight matches. ICE and National Guard deployments have drawn mass protests from distrustful communities in some cities, and Trump has threatened to force matches to be moved from cities he deems "unsafe". "On different issues, depending on the day, the president or some of his key people are trying to push a more polarised agenda. "There are lots of individuals who can be disruptive and dangerous. And the United States, of course, has ready access to firearms in a way that most countries do not." Protests against ICE officers attempting to conduct forced deportations have become commonplace in Los Angeles this year 'I am fully all in' - Kane open to new Bayern deal 'With power comes responsibility' - the footballer who cycles to work 'With power comes responsibility' - the footballer who cycles to work 'The most wonderful human' - Greenwood leads support for ex-team-mate Moody Delays, distrust, dynamic prices - how 'welcoming' will World Cup be? Man City believe but will they win WSL this season? 'I like to be famous but unknown' - Ekitike in his own words 'Ten days in Lionesses' den and I wanted to stay forever'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A coalition of community organizations and documentary filmmaker Billy Corben on Thursday called again on FIFA and Miami-Dade to use their influence to protect soccer fans from federal immigration agents roaming stadiums during next year's World Cup tournament. At a demonstration in front of FIFA's Coral Gables office, they pressured officials to protect World Cup attendees from “overzealous immigration enforcement” and to reinvest Miami-Dade County tax dollars set aside for the World Cup into the local community. “Miami-Dade is a proud county of immigrants, and we are subsidizing the World Cup with over $60 million in public cash and resources,” Corben said during Thursday's press conference. The activists say their fears about immigration agents are warranted, citing last week's New York Times report that revealed “FIFA was alerted to 145 human rights concerns at Club World Cup games, including federal policies and enforcement.” They warn that the stakes are too high in a state with an aggressive posture toward immigration. “The potential for due process abuses, racial profiling, and for fans to lose their liberties and freedoms is far too great,” they said, noting that the backdrop in Florida “includes the reopening of the Everglades [Alligator Alcatraz] facility and news of a Mexican national on a tourist visa who was detained and deported.” “The Trump Administration's recent immigration policies have affected both staff and fans,” they said. Since the first protest on June 30, activists said an official of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee contacted them, according to Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, Policy Coordinator with American Friends Service Committee. She said no meeting date with FIFA has been set. Amy Morales, director of advocacy and policy for Engage Miami, said community nonprofits had to fight for full funding before county commissioners at the same time the World Cup was getting $46 million in subsidies from the county. “What we're saying here today is that we do not want our taxpayer dollars funding the separation of families — funding deportations,” Morales said to WLRN. Luna Plaza, a migrant justice committee member of the Florida Student Power Network attended both protests. “Sports, in general, shapes all of our lives,” Plaza told WLRN. “It's really saddening to hear that so many safe spaces are being taken away for undocumented folks — including sports.
