Fred Ramsdell, Mary Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi identified regulatory T cells, which help to keep the immune system in check.Credit: F. Ramsdell, Institute for Systems Biology, Michaela Rihova/CTK Photo/Alamy This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to three scientists for discovering a class of immune cells that help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, Fred Ramsdell, a scientific adviser at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in Bainbridge Island, Washington, and immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, will share the prize of 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million) “for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”. Drug companies flock to supercharged T-cells in fight against autoimmune disease Drug companies flock to supercharged T-cells in fight against autoimmune disease Their discoveries help to explain “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”. The findings led to the development of a range of therapies for autoimmune diseases that are now in early clinical development, says Samantha Bucktrout, an immunologist at Greywolf Therapeutics in Oxford, UK, who has previously worked with Ramsdell. “If it wasn't for these initial findings — and all of this whole field that these individuals started — we would never be at this place now where we can talk about cures,” she says. Autoimmune conditions — which include type 1 diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis — affect around one in ten people1. Bucktrout likens the cells to an elite police force that represent only 1–2% of all T cells, but are highly effective at “keeping everyone in order”. “They really mop everything up and dampen inflammation very effectively.” How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals? How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals? In experiments using a marker for regulatory T cells, Sakaguchi showed that mice lacking these cells developed autoimmune conditions of the thyroid, pancreas and other organs, and that giving the animals a solution containing regulatory T cells stopped disease progression. This discovery allowed researchers to isolate and work on regulatory T cells for the first time, and other research teams began to identify different types of regulatory T cell with different kinds of immune-suppressing properties. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene caused a rare genetic autoimmune disease4. The work “really changed our view of a lot of conditions and is still changing our view”, says Anne Pesenacker, an immunologist at University College London. Studies have found that people with some autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, often have too few regulatory T cells in their blood or ones that do not function properly. And even early experiments on mice showed that there was potential to use regulatory T cells in treatments for such conditions, says Pesenacker.

In the past two years, they have demonstrated that they can analyse data, design experiments and even come up with new hypotheses. The pace of progress has some researchers convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) could compete with science's greatest minds in the next few decades. In 2016, Hiroaki Kitano, a biologist and chief executive at Sony AI, challenged researchers to accomplish just that: to develop an AI system so advanced that it could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel prize. But by 2050, the Nobel Turing Challenge envisions an AI system that, without human intervention, combines the skills of hypothesis generation, experimental planning and data analysis to make a breakthrough worthy of a Nobel prize. Ross King, a chemical-engineering researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an organizer of the challenge, thinks such an ‘AI scientist' might rise to laureate status even sooner. “I think it's almost certain that AI systems will get good enough to win Nobel prizes,” he says. “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.” “If tomorrow, you saw a government programme invest a billion dollars in fundamental research, I think it would advance much faster,” says Yolanda Gil, an AI researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Others warn that there are looming risks to introducing AI into the research pipeline2. The Nobel prizes were created to honour those who “have conferred the greatest benefit” to humankind, as its namesake, Alfred Nobel, wrote in his will. For the science prizes, Bengt Nordén, a chemist and former chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, considers three criteria: a Nobel discovery must be useful, be rich with impact and open a door to further scientific understanding, he says. Although only living people, organizations and institutions are currently eligible for the prizes, AI has had previous encounters with the Nobel committee. Demis Hassabis (left) and John Jumper (middle) won a Nobel prize for the AI model AlphaFold.Credit: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Gil says that she has already seen AI tools assisting scientists in almost every step of the discovery process, which “makes the field very exciting”. It can forecast lethal dust storms and help to optimize the assembly of future quantum computers. AI is also beginning to perform experiments by itself. Gabe Gomes, a chemist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues designed a system called Coscientist that relies on large language models (LLMs), the kind behind ChatGPT and similar systems, to plan and execute complex chemical reactions using robotic laboratory equipment3. And an unreleased version of Coscientist can do computational chemistry with remarkable speed, says Gomes. One of Gomes's students once complained that the software took half an hour to work out a transition state for a reaction. The Tokyo-based company Sakana AI is using LLMs in an attempt to automate machine-learning research4. This is the first of three waves of AI in science, says Sam Rodriques, chief executive of FutureHouse — a research lab in San Francisco, California, that debuted an LLM designed to do chemistry tasks earlier this year. It and other ‘reasoning models' learn to mimic step-wise logical thought, using a trial-and-error process that involves training on correct examples. The existing models are helpful collaborators that can make predictions on the basis of data, and accelerate otherwise painstaking sorts of computation. But they tend to need a human in the loop during at least one stage. Secrets of DeepSeek AI model revealed in landmark paper Secrets of DeepSeek AI model revealed in landmark paper James Zou, a biomedical data scientist at Stanford University in California, has begun moving into this realm. For instance, when given a published paper and a data set of RNA sequences associated with it, the system found that certain immune cells in individuals with COVID-19 are more likely to swell up as they die, an idea that hadn't been explored by the paper's authors. It's showing “that the AI agent is beginning to autonomously find new things”, Zou says. All papers will be written and reviewed by AI agents, alongside human collaborators. Zou says he hopes that the meeting will help researchers to assess how capable AI is at doing and reviewing innovative research. AI helps A-Lab researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop materials. There are known challenges to such efforts, including the hallucinations that often plague LLMs, Zou says. But he says these issues could be mostly remedied with human feedback. Rodriques says that the final stage of AI in science, and what FutureHouse is aiming for, is models that can ask their own questions and design and perform their own experiments — no human necessary. The most promising areas for a breakthrough — by an AI scientist or otherwise — are in materials science or in treating diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, he says, because these are areas with big open challenges and an unmet need.

In the 1960s, scientists classed chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans as a distinct family (Pongidae), thinking that these great apes had long diverged from humans. Few scholars expected that, in nature, these apes would display strikingly human-like behaviour. Jane Goodall, who has died aged 91, overturned this view with her groundbreaking observations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Her discoveries foreshadowed the genetic evidence showing that chimpanzees, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and humans are more closely related to one another than to gorillas (Gorilla spp.) The findings had a major role in shifting perceptions towards recognizing the importance of emotions, personalities and complex cognition, reshaping scientific and public understanding of human evolution. She often told this story to illustrate the patience and curiosity that defined her life's work. In Nairobi, she sought out the renowned palaeontologist Louis Leakey, who invited her to join him and his wife Mary on a fossil-hunting expedition in Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, known as the Cradle of Humankind for its rich deposit of early hominid fossils and stone tools. During the trip, she committed to studying chimpanzees in what is now called Gombe National Park in Tanzania — a small, 35-square-kilometre patch of forest that Leakey had long hoped to investigate. Biggest ever study of primate genomes has surprises for humanity She was dismayed to learn that the main chimpanzee study of the time, conducted in 1929–30, had lasted for only four months and had been done by a large, intrusive expedition operating in classic colonial excess. She was not surprised that it had produced few results. In 1961, she began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, under zoologist Robert Hinde, who encouraged her to focus on social relationships, individual personalities and the expression of emotions. She observed their political manoeuvring, deception, coalitional aggression and cooperation outside family groups — behaviours that indicated previously unsuspected levels of social intelligence.

Nature Chemistry (2025)Cite this article Achieving efficient red and near-infrared (NIR) emission in boron cation-based emitters remains challenging owing to their intrinsic instability, strong electrophilicity of the boron centre and pronounced non-radiative decay governed by the energy gap law. Here we report a family of air- and moisture-stable carbodicarbene (CDC)-borabenzo[c]anthanthrenium ions exhibiting solid-state red-to-NIR luminescence (maximum emission wavelength up to 730 nm) with competitive quantum yields. Crystallographic, photophysical and computational analyses reveal that the CDC ligand plays a dual role by electronically stabilizing the boron centre and directing ion-pair assembly via charge localization, thereby modulating exciton coupling and aggregate-state emission. These cationic π-extended boron frameworks represent rare examples of monoboron-doped luminophores displaying deep-red-to-NIR emission. Our findings highlight that the combination of π-extension, a charge-directing CDC ligand and ion-pair assembly constitutes an effective strategy to access efficient red/NIR emitters, providing guiding principles for the design of functional long-wavelength emitting main-group materials.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Jeffery DelViscio & Alex Sugiura For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed. According to a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, the ocean of Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules that indicate the environment could potentially support life. Back in 2005 the Cassini spacecraft caught plumes of water vapor and frozen particles shooting up from tiger-stripe-like fissures in the planet's icy crust. Subsequent analysis of gravity measurements captured by Cassini confirmed the presence of a subsurface ocean near the moon's south pole about a decade later.

Cassini's mission ended in 2017, but new analysis of data from a 2008 flyby just yielded additional insights into the frosty moon's watery reservoir. In flying through one of Enceladus's water plumes the spacecraft exposed its Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument to tiny, freshly ejected grains of ice. After years of studying data from different flyby events to understand how Cassini's instruments behaved under different conditions, scientists were able to apply their findings to old data and find new patterns. The new study determined that several sophisticated carbon-based structures, including esters and ethers, can be found in the subsurface waters of Enceledus. That's important because these structures are identical to substances considered to be vital chemical building blocks for living organisms on Earth. And that adds to evidence the moon could be a compelling candidate for hosting some kind of life—or at least allowing us to gain a better understanding of how life evolved on our own planet. Speaking of life as we know it—and how the heck it got here—a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology & Evolution suggests that for hundreds of millions of years before plant life made it onto land, fungi may have dominated the planet. The delicate filaments of mycelium that typically make up the bodies of fungi don't tend to fossilize well, and the fossils they do leave behind are often microscopic and hard to identify. This new study aimed to overcome that issue with the help of a “molecular clock.” Essentially, scientists can plot out the timeline of one species's divergence from another by tallying up the difference in their respective numbers of genetic mutations, which happen at fairly regular intervals as organisms evolve. Counting the ticks of a molecular clock is only possible if you have regular anchor points from the fossil record to calibrate them, which is tricky for fungi. Tracking when a gene moved from one lineage to another helped the scientists pinpoint which organisms emerged when, which they say has allowed them to tighten up the timeline of fungal evolution. The study suggests that fungi evolved from a common ancestor dating back to roughly 1.4 to 0.9 billion years ago, which is about half a billion years or more before land plants evolved. According to a study published last week in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, the risk of children and young adults developing long COVID could be twice as high with a second infection than with the first. Looking at 2022 and 2023 data from about 465,000 children and adolescents , the researchers found an increased risk of chronic symptoms potentially related to the condition such as severe fatigue, headaches, kidney damage, abdominal pain, cognitive issues and abnormal heartbeats after a second COVID infection. Blood clots were more than twice as likely with a repeat COVID case, and the risk of myocarditis—a potentially lethal swelling of the heart—actually more than tripled. The study authors noted that long COVID cases weren't necessarily linked to severe illness during the acute COVID infection. In some lighter respiratory infection news a study published last Wednesday in ACS Central Science hints that we might one day have access to an easy, surprisingly tasty method of diagnosing the flu at home. In lab tests using vials of human saliva the presence of influenza caused the thymol to break off on its own. The researchers say they hope to conduct human clinical trials of a flu test in roughly the next couple of years. Yogurt forms when microorganisms ferment milk and create lactic acid, which thickens the dairy and gives it a tangy taste. A lot of traditional yogurt-making methods fell by the wayside as production became standardized, including a traditional practice from the Balkans and Turkey involving red wood ants. The researchers even partnered with chefs from a two-star Michelin restaurant to create dishes such as ant-powered ice cream and soft cheese. But don't go digging around in your backyard to find fermentation buddies just yet: the scientists do warn that live ants can carry parasites, while frozen or dehydrated ants come with their own potential risks. That's all for this week's science news roundup. Tune in on Wednesday to hear how one of the Internet's most famous astronauts is using his experience in spaceflight to write alternate-history thrillers.

Nature Computational Science (2025)Cite this article A preprint version of the article is available at bioRxiv. The design of folded proteins has advanced substantially in recent years. However, many proteins and protein regions are intrinsically disordered and lack a stable fold, that is, the sequence of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) encodes a vast ensemble of spatial conformations that specify its biological function. This conformational plasticity and heterogeneity makes IDP design challenging. Here we introduce a computational framework for de novo design of IDPs through rational and efficient inversion of molecular simulations that approximate the underlying sequence–ensemble relationship. We highlight the versatility of this approach by designing IDPs with diverse properties and arbitrary sequence constraints. These include IDPs with target ensemble dimensions, loops and linkers, highly sensitive sensors of physicochemical stimuli, and binders to target disordered substrates with distinct conformational biases. Overall, our method provides a general framework for designing sequence–ensemble–function relationships of biological macromolecules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HHMI Janelia Research Campus Senior Group Leader Meng Wang and her team study longevity. When they crossed their long-lived worms with "wild-type" worms that weren't overexpressing the enzyme -- a routine lab procedure used to wipe clean any genetic manipulations -- they saw that the offspring also lived longer than normal worms. In reproductive cells, these histone messengers cause modifications in the worm's epigenome -- a collection of chemical tags that regulate gene expression -- enabling the lysosomal changes to be passed from generation to generation without changing the underlying DNA. Epigenetic modifications can help organisms cope with many different types of environmental stressors -- from diet changes to pollutant exposure to psychological stress -- and the new work shows how these advantages could be conferred from parents to their offspring. "You always think that your inheritance is in the nucleus, within the cell, but now we show that the histone can go from one place to another place, and if that histone carries any modification, that means you are going to transfer the epigenetic information from one cell to another," Wang says. "It really provides a mechanism for understanding the transgenerational effect." The researchers found that one type of histone modification -- a type of epigenetic change -- was elevated in long-lived worms compared to those with normal lifespans. Using a combination of genetic tools, transcriptomics, and imaging, they found that changes in lysosomal metabolism affecting the worms' longevity activate a series of processes inside the cell. These actions trigger an increase in a specific histone variant, which is transported from the worm's somatic or body tissues to its germline or reproductive cells through proteins that deliver nutrients to developing eggs. The new research also unveils a new mechanism for transporting information from somatic to germline cells through histones, which could help explain how other types of inherited information are passed from parent to offspring. By providing a mechanism for understanding how environmental changes to somatic cells are passed through the germline, the new work could help researchers better understand transgenerational effects that have been previously observed, like the malnutrition of a parent affecting its offspring.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a sparkling scene of star birth captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. What appears to be a craggy, starlit mountaintop kissed by wispy clouds is actually a cosmic dust-scape being eaten away by the blistering winds and radiation of nearby, massive, infant stars. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve. Scientists have since learned that it is composed of at least two stars, though they cannot be resolved in this image. At 74 and 66 solar masses, respectively, the two known stars are still among the most massive and luminous stars ever seen. Captured in infrared light by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. That nebula extends far beyond NIRCam's field of view. They are like fingers pointing toward the hot, young stars that have sculpted them. The fierce forces shaping and compressing these spires cause new stars to form within them. More than 200 of our solar systems out to Neptune's orbit could fit into the width its tip, which is 0.14 lightyears. In this image, the color cyan indicates hot or ionized hydrogen gas being heated up by the massive young stars. Dust molecules similar to smoke here on Earth are represented in orange. Black denotes the densest gas, which is not emitting light. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).
