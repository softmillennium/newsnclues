                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Government officials from India and Nigeria both made statements on crypto today, but they took surprisingly different directions. Both explicitly acknowledged pros and cons, yet their speeches have many key differences. Nigeria, meanwhile, is forming a Committee to profitably engage with this risky yet lucrative industry. Today, two major regional economies, Nigeria and India, both saw high-level government officials make statements on crypto regulation, but they went in two different directions. He claimed that India has not been encouraging the crypto industry, levying “very heavy” taxes on its users. “India has also announced that we will be coming out with a digital currency, which will be backed by a Reserve Bank of India guarantee. We don't encourage [crypto] because we don't want anybody to be stuck…with a [token] that has no backing and nobody at the backend,” Goyal claimed. It's a little unclear what he meant by this. Strictly speaking, India already has its own crypto, launching the digital rupee in 2022. This may seem impressive, but it really isn't for a country with over 1 billion people. Nigeria, meanwhile, is no stranger to prominent crypto scams, but the nation still seems interested in friendly regulation. Abbas Tajudeen, Nigeria's Speaker of the House, recently inaugurated a Committee on cryptocurrency. Despite addressing fears of criminal activity, he gestured towards the industry's economic benefits: Across the world, financial systems are being reshaped by technology. So far, his nation's crypto industry is less developed than India's, but positive engagement may change this paradigm. This “reserved, yet bullish” perspective may prove more fruitful than begrudging participation. It'll be interesting to see how India and Nigeria both evolve in the crypto space, if these government representatives have their say in policy implementation.

BTC changed hands around $125,200 recently, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours. While the dollar's weakness has helped the rally to new highs, the largest crypto now has clinched to new highs in euro terms crossing 106,000 EUR and surpassing its January peak, while breaking its mid-August peak in Swiss franc (99,642 CHF), TradingView data shows. Ethereum's ether ETH$4,677.76 advanced 4% to hit $4,700, its strongest price in more than three weeks, leading the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index higher. Crypto stocks posted mixed results on Monday, with retail trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) falling 3% after Galaxy Digital unveiled GalaxyOne, a new crypto trading platform that mirrors Robinhood's core offering. Elsewhere, crypto-linked companies including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL) and Michael Saylor's parent company Strategy (MTSR) all closed roughly 2% higher. Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) each gained around 10%, driven by optimism around data center demand and possibly boosted further by bitcoin's rally earlier in the day. Bitcoin's rally is "fueled by a perfect storm of macroeconomic tailwinds," said Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of Deribit, the options trading venue that was recently acquired by Coinbase (COIN). The U.S. government shutdown is driving debasement trades into perceived hard assets such as gold and BTC, strong inflows into BTC ETFs coupled with dwindling spot supplies on exchanges are feeding a "self-reinforcing bull cycle," he said in a Monday update. However, he also warned of currently overbought conditions, suggesting that a brief shakeout to $118,000–$120,000 remains possible. "Bulls have their eyes on $130K+, and bears might find opportunities in overbought squeezes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin Mining Stocks Jump as Crypto Market Continues Historic Rally Bitcoin's price hit new records Monday, as the so-called debasement trade has become more attractive. But Bitcoin mining company stocks rose even quicker, furthering sizable gains seen across the industry in recent weeks. MARA finished Monday priced at $21 per share after jumping more than 9%; CleanSpark rose by the same amount and was trading for $17. Google last month announced it was backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher, giving Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher. “Miners are winning because they're flexing optionality: power, infrastructure, AI revenue, and leveraged exposure to Bitcoin rallies, all packaged in stocks," Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher told Decrypt. "That's giving them an edge over crypto companies whose exposure is narrower or more operationally constrained." Bratcher added that some miners are holding onto their mined BTC rather than selling it, giving them a benefit akin to crypto treasury firms, particularly as Bitcoin continues to rise. "Investors are increasingly viewing miners not just as Bitcoin proxies, but as owners of scarce infrastructure: power contracts, land, grid access, and cooling capacity," said Bratcher. It had dropped down slightly to $125,191—still a 9.5% jump over the past week. A report from European asset manager CoinShares said that the lion's share of that investment was directed at Bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S. Experts dub that kind of move the "debasement trade"—when investors try to hedge against weakening currencies and geopolitical headwinds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Switzerland's gambling regulator is looking into whether "right-to-buy" tokens sold by global soccer organizing body FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup tournament comply with rules that govern gambling, Bloomberg reported. Gespa is assessing whether the tokens, which can be bought, sold and traded on FIFA's non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, are gambling-like or represent conditional purchase rights. The authority has not alleged wrongdoing nor had it received any reports of wrongdoing, and is gathering facts to determine whether any action is warranted, director Manuel Richard told Bloomberg on Monday. According to FIFA's website, RTB tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that reserve a dedicated purchase window for a specific match. Team-linked RTBs activate only if the chosen team qualifies, and they can be sold on the secondary market via FIFA's native marketplace powered by its Web3 partner, Modex. FIFA said RTBs were created to address extreme demand for tickets at specific matches and tournaments. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, for example, there were 3.4 million tickets available for around 23 million requests, according to FIFA. Cointelegraph reached out to FIFA for comment, but had not received a response at time of publication. NFTs are unique blockchain tokens that verify ownership and authenticity of a specific asset. While the wider NFT boom peaked in 2021–22, FIFA has continued using NFT technology for digital collectibles, ticket-access rights, and gaming. Soccer's world governing federation first began experimenting with Web3 and NFTs back in 2022, when it announced plans to launch its native platform, FIFA Collect, on the Algorand blockchain. In Dec. 2023, before the Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, FIFA and Modex launched 1,000 NFTs — 100 offering a chance to win tickets to the 2026 World Cup finals and 900 additional collectibles minted on Polygon. The free-to-play mobile title that launched in June 2025 lets players run clubs, compete, and trade NFT player cards on the Mythos blockchain. Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect, said AvaCloud's EVM-compatible stack makes connecting FIFA Collect with mainstream wallets and DApps easier. With an estimated fan base of over five billion globally, Avalanche Subnets will let FIFA run a dedicated, tunable chain that can be adjusted independently of the Avalanche network to handle event-driven surges, such as the World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Francisco, CA – October 6, 2025 – Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: OPEN) shares experienced a significant surge today, with the stock jumping a remarkable 13.9% in afternoon trading and closing the day up 14.6%. This substantial uptick was ignited by a positive signal from CEO Kaz Nejatian, hinting at the iBuying giant's imminent foray into accepting cryptocurrency payments for home purchases. The market's enthusiastic reaction reflects a growing appetite for innovation in an industry traditionally slow to adapt. For Opendoor, this move could solidify its reputation as a forward-thinking leader, attracting a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially reshaping the competitive landscape for years to come. The catalyst for today's market excitement was a concise yet impactful declaration from Opendoor's CEO, Kaz Nejatian. Responding to a query on X (formerly Twitter) about enabling home buying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets, Nejatian unequivocally stated, "We will. This brief message was enough to spark a buying frenzy, as investors quickly grasped the potential of a major real estate platform embracing digital currency transactions. The company's stock had already seen a remarkable year-to-date performance, skyrocketing over 415% higher in 2025, and this latest news further fueled its upward trajectory. Opendoor's business model, centered on buying, renovating, and reselling homes directly, uniquely positions it to integrate crypto payments. The company plans to convert Bitcoin into U.S. dollars internally during property transactions, effectively shielding individual home sellers from the complexities and volatility of directly accepting digital assets. Beyond the crypto announcement, Opendoor has been undergoing a broader transformation under Nejatian, shifting towards an "AI-first, agent-led" platform model dubbed "Key Connections," aimed at improving efficiency and generating higher-margin, capital-light revenue. The market's initial reaction was distinctly bullish, characterized by a significant spike in trading volume for Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN). Traders and investors viewed the move as a crucial step towards the mainstream adoption of digital currencies, potentially unlocking a vast, untapped market for real estate transactions. By being an early mover among iBuyers to fully integrate crypto payments, it gains a significant competitive advantage. This move could attract a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers, particularly younger, digital-native generations (Millennials and Gen Z), who are looking to diversify their digital assets into tangible real estate. Opendoor's iBuyer model allows for seamless conversion of crypto to fiat, simplifying the process and mitigating volatility risks for sellers, thus enhancing its appeal and market share. Cryptocurrency payment processors such as Bitpace, CoinsPaid, Propy, BitPay, WCT Pay, and PassimPay will likely see increased demand for their services. These companies provide the crucial infrastructure for crypto-to-fiat conversions and transaction management. Furthermore, crypto-wealthy individuals and investors gain a more direct and efficient avenue to deploy their digital assets into the real estate market, offering diversification opportunities. Forward-thinking real estate developers and agents who embrace crypto payments can also expand their client base globally. On the other hand, traditional financial institutions and real estate entities that are slow to adapt risk losing market share. Traditional banks and mortgage lenders that do not explore or adopt cryptocurrency integration in real estate may find themselves at a disadvantage as more efficient, crypto-backed alternatives emerge. The inherent speed and efficiency of crypto payments could expose the inefficiencies of traditional, slower transaction methods, pressuring companies reliant on older systems to modernize or face obsolescence. The evolving regulatory landscape and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also pose risks, meaning companies that fail to manage these aspects effectively could face financial or legal challenges. Bitcoin, once primarily a speculative asset, is rapidly gaining traction as a viable medium of exchange, with platforms already facilitating multi-million dollar real estate transactions using digital currencies. Key aspects include the tokenization of real estate, where physical properties are converted into digital tokens, enabling fractional ownership and increasing liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Smart contracts are set to automate various real estate processes, reducing intermediaries and streamlining complex procedures. The use of decentralized ownership records on a blockchain promises tamper-proof property information, while DeFi (Decentralized Finance) integration could revolutionize real estate lending and borrowing. As a major iBuyer, Opendoor's embrace of crypto sets a precedent, potentially compelling other large real estate companies to explore or fast-track their own digital asset strategies to remain competitive. However, the integration of cryptocurrency into real estate also presents a complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are grappling with establishing frameworks for taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection in the digital asset space. The IRS currently treats cryptocurrencies as property, which means crypto transactions can trigger capital gains taxes. Stringent AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings are essential to prevent illicit financial activities, as real estate has historically been a target for money laundering. Furthermore, consumer protection in crypto transactions, especially regarding escrow and the absence of traditional banking guarantees, necessitates robust third-party solutions. Each shift introduced superior attributes like efficiency, speed, or accessibility, ultimately reshaping the market. Opendoor's adoption of crypto payments is another such wave, promising faster settlements, reduced transaction costs, and increased global access, underscoring the imperative for traditional industries to adapt or risk being left behind. Opendoor's commitment to integrating cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment, ushering in both short-term adjustments and long-term transformations for the company and the broader real estate market. An initial focus on widely recognized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins (e.g., USDC) is likely to mitigate risk. However, navigating the still-evolving regulatory landscape will be a significant challenge, requiring careful compliance and adaptation. Looking further ahead (beyond mid-2027), Opendoor's crypto adoption could lead to more profound changes. Ultimately, successful integration could establish Opendoor as a leader in crypto-enabled real estate, driving down transaction costs and increasing security through blockchain technology, thereby compelling competitors to follow suit. However, significant challenges persist, including the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies, ongoing regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions, and consumer distrust or education gaps. Despite growing interest, the mainstream adoption of crypto in real estate is still nascent, with many sellers preferring traditional fiat transactions dueposing a barrier to widespread acceptance. Potential scenarios range from gradual integration and niche success, where Opendoor gains a competitive edge with tech-savvy buyers but broader adoption remains slow due to regulatory hurdles, to a transformative disruption where Opendoor becomes a catalyst for widespread crypto adoption, leading to integral blockchain use in property registries and financing. A third scenario involves significant hurdles, where volatility, regulatory complexities, and consumer distrust limit the impact of crypto payments on Opendoor's transaction volume. Opendoor's (NASDAQ: OPEN) bold announcement regarding cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment for the real estate industry, signaling a decisive step into the digital asset era. The significant stock jump on October 6, 2025, underscores investor confidence in CEO Kaz Nejatian's vision to integrate cutting-edge technology into traditional property transactions. This move is more than just a new payment option; it's a strategic embrace of Web3 principles, promising enhanced efficiency, security, and global accessibility for home buying and selling. The key takeaway is that Opendoor is positioning itself as an innovator, aiming to capture a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially redefine the competitive landscape. While the path ahead is fraught with challenges—including navigating regulatory complexities, managing crypto volatility, and overcoming consumer skepticism—the potential rewards are immense. Investors should monitor Opendoor's progress in implementing its crypto payment system, including details on which cryptocurrencies will be accepted, the underlying technological infrastructure, and initial transaction volumes. The evolution of cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning real estate transactions, will also be critical. Opendoor's digital leap has irrevocably altered the market's trajectory, and its lasting impact will be measured by its ability to turn this ambitious vision into a seamless reality for homebuyers and sellers alike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the United States has turned away from the concept of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), other jurisdictions, such as Europe and China, have embraced it. China has already been testing a digital Yuan live and in the wild. However, while some European policymakers view a CBDC as beneficial for the European Union (EU) and its citizens, some are expressing concerns about the potential for abuse, including privacy concerns and government intervention. While declarations of commitment not to abuse a digital Euro have been issued by public authorities, concerns persist as governments can change their minds, as the allure of insight and control is simply too strong to resist for a central authority. A glimpse into the kind of nightmarish dystopian future we're sleepwalking into if we ever allow digital ID, CBDCs, social credit scores and personal carbon allowances to get off the ground.pic.twitter.com/WFkg1pOXyh The speaker discusses CBDCs as a conduit for implementing economic policies. A WEF panelist just laid bare the true, dystopian purpose of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Lagarde, President of the ECB, explains that European citizens will have the choice between cash and digital currency, and both will be easy to use. Lagarde commented on stablecoins that “I think it risks undermining our capacity to conduct monetary policy.” It's a permissioned coupon with purchase restrictions, travel limits, and an expiration date. The WEF has touted China's development of a digital Yuan (e-CNY). The digital Yuan is said to have “controllable anonymity,” as a central bank can access transaction information for regulatory purposes or to deal with illicit activities (whatever that means).

A retail CBDC issued by the US Federal Reserve appears to be dead on arrival. This past week, the Bank of England softened its stance on stablecoins in response to public pressure and market-driven demand. Meanwhile, large jurisdictions such as China and the European Union, along with several other countries including Russia, India, and Brazil, are moving forward with plans for a CBDC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge recently dismissed a class action lawsuit that alleged Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Apt Yacht Club collection of NFTs, colluded with several celebrities to inflate the prices of its products. On October 1, US District Judge Fernando Olguin found the plaintiffs Adonis Real and Adam Titcher failed to show that the digital assets created by Yuga Labs, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and cryptocurrency ApeCoin, were securities. Sotheby's to Sell René Magritte Work Bought by Family of Nazi-Executed WWII Resistance Fighter Four Works by Bacon and Rodin to Headline Sotheby's Frieze Week Sale The Bored Ape Yacht Club was among the most successful NFT collections, with celebrity endorsements from Justin Bieber, Madonna, Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry, as well as media personality and businesswoman Paris Hilton. Real and Titcher filed the class action lawsuit in 2022, claiming that six types of digital assets sold by Yuga Labs are unregistered securities and the celebrities who promoted Yuga Labs' products violated federal and state securities laws. In addition to Bieber, Madonna, Curry, and Hilton, the lawsuit's list of defendants also included Mike Winkelmann (the American digital artist known as “Beeple“), Reddit founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, NFT collector Amy Wu, Adidas America, Inc., as well as Sotheby's. Judge Olguin found that Yuga Labs' products did not meet the Howey test, a legal framework created by the Supreme Court which requires “1) an investment of money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others” in order to label something a security. “In short, despite satisfying this sub-prong, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the other Howey prongs and therefore fail to allege that any, some, or all of defendants' digital assets are a security,” Judge Olguin wrote. Plaintiffs Real and Titcher have until October 10 to file a third amended complaint. Get our latest stories in the feed of your favorite networks</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold futures (GC=F) neared $4,000 per troy ounce on Monday to touch a fresh record, while silver futures (SI=F) also jumped to $48.50 per ounce, less than two dollars away from a 1980 intraday high. Meanwhile, bitcoin jumped about 2% to touch a fresh record north of $125,790 per token. Meanwhile, fiscal uncertainty in some developed markets has driven a flight to safe-haven assets. Market analysts view Takaichi as a "fiscal dove," supporting government stimulus to grow the economy. Takaichi's election indicates "how much of the developed world is pivoting into a 'Run It Hot' fiscal dominance framework, carrying monster deficits in order to try and outgrow debt," Nomura Securities analyst Charlie McElligott said in a note on Monday morning. "Accordingly, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin are again simultaneously moving to fresh ATH's as the chief winners in this latest escalation of the ... 'Debasement Trade,' alongside equities then too ripping to record highs as well," he added. Gold and silver have surged more than 50% and 60% year to date, respectively, as expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted the appeal of metals, which tend to perform better when interest rates are lower. "The ongoing US government shutdown has amplified Bitcoin's safe haven narrative, with investors increasingly rotating from U.S. related assets like treasuries into assets seen as resilient to political dysfunction and inflationary pressure," Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR, said in a note. Wall Street sees further gains for the crypto space as stablecoin issuance sends native tokens for blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) higher. And that's going to be very positive for crypto overall," Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, told Yahoo Finance last week. Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) are up 115% since the company's IPO in June. Related stocks have also been on a tear in recent weeks. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is up 295% year to date, while Coinbase (COIN) is also up 56% since the start of the year, off its all-time high from July.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The largest cryptocurrency by market value has rallied as appetite for risk remains strong and as investors use bitcoin (and gold) to hedge their bets against geopolitical uncertainty and high government debt, in what JP Morgan analysts have referred to as the "debasement trade." A growing pool of traders is also buying tokens as more crypto ETFs are launched and cryptocurrencies  become more integrated into financial services. Last week, bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $3.2 billion, the second-highest haul since they launched in January 2024. The digital currency was trading at $125,500 recently, after hitting an all-time high today of around $125,800. Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin's weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out major price levels worth watching out for. Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum and sits well below its December peak, providing ample room for the cryptocurrency to move further into price discovery before consolidating. Let's forecast how a new move higher might look on bitcoin's chart and also identify major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to forecast where bitcoin's trend may be headed next if a new move higher plays out. It's worth noting that this earlier trend commenced following a 10% weekly advance from a prior descending channel on the chart, similar in size to last week's breakout from the recent pattern. This area, currently situated just above the 50-week moving average, could attract buying interest around last month's low and prominent highs that formed on the chart in December and January. Selling below this level could see the cryptocurrency's prices test support near $92,000. Investors may look for entry points in this location close to a period of consolidation that developed on chart just below the December and January peaks. The cryptocurrency's price finds a confluence of support in this region from the prominent March 2024 peak and this year's notable April trough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AtomOne (ATONE) emerged as a community-driven fork of the Cosmos Hub, created after disputes over governance and validator dominance. While AtomOne trades near $1.60 with rising volume, its influence comes less from price action and more from its disruptive architecture. Instead of reinventing Cosmos governance, it introduces a dual-chain model across Solana and XRPL, while giving presale buyers fixed launch prices, staking rights, and audited security guarantees. AtomOne's core disruption lies in its constitution and governance model. It rejects delegation-heavy voting, empowers individual stakers, and isolates fee volatility from staking security with its two-token design. The project also embraces Interchain Security, promising resilience as a hub that minimizes complexity while maximizing decentralization. XRP Tundra is not a governance fork, but the logic is similar: create structural separation in token roles to ensure both utility and stability. In Phase 5, TUNDRA-S costs $0.091, buyers receive a 15% bonus, and free TUNDRA-X allocations valued at $0.0455. That fixed model echoes AtomOne's separation of functions: governance stability paired with yield capacity. A $500 entry translates into thousands of tokens whose listing value is already defined. Team identity has been verified via Vital Block KYC, with certification published openly. For a presale environment often criticized for opacity, Tundra's willingness to submit to multiple audits and disclose team credentials is a defining advantage. AtomOne's innovation is governance, but it does not reward external participants with yield beyond staking ATONE. Tundra expands the value proposition with Cryo Vaults for XRP holders. Vaults lock XRP from 7 to 90 days, with APY boosted via Frost Keys, NFT multipliers that can shorten lock-ups or enhance payouts. Staking is not yet live, but presale participants secure vault slots in advance. This mirrors AtomOne's governance inclusivity: early contributors shape the system's benefits long before broad adoption. AtomOne minimized governance risk by simplifying its hub role. Liquidity positions are NFT-based, giving providers flexibility, while permanent lock options guarantee depth. This ensures that early volatility reinforces, rather than undermines, investor confidence. AtomOne's disruption lies in governance reform across the Cosmos ecosystem. XRP Tundra's disruption lies in presale economics: dual tokens across chains, fixed launch valuations, staking rights, and independently verified oversight. Both projects signal that structural innovation — not meme hype — defines the next wave of crypto adoption. Independent commentators, such as Crypto Goat, frame Tundra's presale as a rare chance to replicate AtomOne-level disruption but with multipliers locked in from the start. AtomOne's constitution shows how governance innovation can shape ecosystems. XRP Tundra offers investors their own disruptive pathway: Solana + XRPL integration, dual tokens, yield, and fixed multipliers backed by audits and KYC. With Phase 5 allocations nearly exhausted, the presale window is closing fast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) published its semi annual progress report on the adoption of DLT in capital markets. The report highlights the strong growth in US-led sectors such as stablecoins, repo and tokenized money market funds. By contrast, the report shows a decline in fixed income issuance, especially bonds, and attributes this to the Eurosystem's wholesale DLT settlement trials that ended in November 2024. The trials had accounted for almost a third of 2024's figures. Several participants in the European settlement trials were hoping that the European Central Bank would allow the trials to roll on in order to maintain momentum. That didn't happen, although the central bank has announced that Project Pontes will launch in a pilot phase in late 2026, with other trials possible before then. Total fixed income issuance was €3.25 billion ($3.8bn) in 2024 according to AFME figures, dropping to €1.7 billion ($2bn) for the first three quarters of 2025. The number of issuances  has declined from 55 to 24 during the same periods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitwise's CEO, Matt Hougan, believes that ‘Solana is the new Wall Street', as the ecosystem is quickly becoming an investor favorite for tokenization and stablecoin-related activity. This alone makes the Solana ecosystem the best option for institutional investors, who often demand high throughput and ultra-fast finality. This optimism seeps into top altcoins, too, with fresh contenders like Snorter Token's ($SNORT) experiencing a surge in investor interest in its bid to make meme coin hunting both fun and lucrative. Solana is already looking bullish for Q4 2025, with several factors contributing to the increase in investor confidence and participation. CoinGecko's list of the top Solana treasuries is quite telling in this sense. The last 30 days have been highly fruitful for the ecosystem, with over $1.7B worth of $SOL moving into treasuries like Forward Industries, DeFi Development, and Upexi. Forward Industries alone has invested over $1.5B in $SOL, purchasing 6,822,000 tokens, or 1.251% of the total supply. These factors put $SOL on an upward trajectory for 2025's Q4, which could give us a new ATH by the end of October. This is thanks to its fast reaction speed, ensuring early entry and profit maxing, and its native scam detectors, which ward off suspicious projects. Here are several features that recommend it as an essential trading companion The Copy Trading feature is a valuable addition, catering to novice traders who need assistance in devising a successful strategy. The presale has been growing fast since its inception, reaching $4.3M so far, with $SNORT valued at $0.1071. If you want to invest, this is the best time to do it, as October rolls out and the market's movements promise fat ROIs. Such a performance would qualify $SNORT as one of the best crypto presales to buy right now, with massive returns expected once it hits the mainstream.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grayscale became the first US crypto fund issuer to feature staking for its Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded products. Crypto asset manager Grayscale has introduced staking for its exchange-traded products (ETPs), becoming the first US-based crypto fund issuer to offer staking-based passive income opportunities. Grayscale's Solana (SOL) fund, the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), has also enabled staking and is awaiting regulatory approval for uplisting to an ETP, which would make it one of the first spot Solana ETPs to enable staking, according to the company's Monday X post. By enabling staking across its Ethereum and Solana products, Grayscale said it aims to give investors exposure to the “long-term value accrual of these networks while maintaining the funds' core objectives.” “Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver,” said Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors.” This makes them structurally different from ETFs governed by the 1940 Act, though they follow the same legal framework used for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether ETFs. “ETHE and ETH hold digital assets; however, an investment in ETHE and ETH is not a direct investment in digital assets,” Grayscale said. Grayscale said it will stake via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers and that investors can access the products through standard brokerage accounts Related: Japan's new PM may be a boon for risk assets, crypto markets More broadly, spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs in the US have been approved through exchange rule filings (Rule 19b-4) and Securities Act registration, not under the 1940 Act.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This news release constitutes a "designated news release for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024. Hashrate: Averaged 19.4 exahash per second ("EH/s"), with a peak of 21.7 EH/s The focus has now shifted to energizing ASICs, with new units being steadily integrated into production. These figures are publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers. Record Production: Despite consecutive all-time high Bitcoin network difficulty, HIVE mined 267 BTC in September - a year-to-date high - underscoring its operational strength. Figure 1: Aerial view of HIVE's 100 MW Phase 3 build nearing completion. To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/269180_fd70db1054b5d87e_001full.jpg As of today, HIVE's global Bitcoin mining fleet totals 21.8 EH/s, powered entirely by renewable hydroelectric energy. "HIVE's September milestones demonstrate the power of a focused, dual-engine strategy as our global Bitcoin mining fleet now produces over 9 BTC per day. Our executive team was in Paraguay last month and Gabriel Lamas, HIVE's Country President, is doing an outstanding job while Phase 3 Valenzuela continues to advance ahead of schedule. At the same time, BUZZ HPC, under Craig Tavares' leadership, is expanding our AI cloud capabilities and forming strategic partnerships with Bell Canada, Dell Canada, VAST Data and other leading AI companies in Canada to broaden access to enterprise-scale compute. HIVE is a unique Canadian data center company that only sources green hydroelectric energy to power its operations. With data centers spanning 9 time zones, across Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, we've built a truly global footprint that reflects our commitment to sustainability, capital efficiency, and long-term value creation." "With construction substantially complete at our Phase 3, 100 MW site in Valenzuela, approximately 50% of the hashrate capacity is now online, with commissioning of the remaining hydro containers well underway. With disciplined energy management and optimized fleet efficiency, our current 9 BTC/day production (at Bitcoin network difficulty of 151T) demonstrates the resilience of our Paraguay-based engineering and technical teams. As we approach the successful completion of our targets for 2025, HIVE looks ahead to further expansion in global operations for 2026, with our cash flow from the Bitcoin mining business providing funding and growth for our HPC and GPU AI cloud business. We are always looking for long-term accretive opportunities, and we believe increased sustainable cash flow is the key to long-term success in these industries." As previously disclosed, all ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded and have shipped. HIVE expects future growth to follow the economics of its Paraguay operations. Each additional exahash increases daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable with fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal labor increases. Results may vary depending on network difficulty and Bitcoin prices. Founded in 2017, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. builds and operates sustainable blockchain and AI infrastructure data centers, powered exclusively by renewable hydroelectric energy.
