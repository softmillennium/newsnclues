On Sunday night, Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein” had a surprise showing at the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles. Following a marathon screening of his earlier works (“Cronos,” “The Devil's Backbone,” and “Mimic”), the beloved Mexican filmmaker invited stars Mia Goth and Jacob Elordi to help introduce their new movie to a ravenous genre audience. “They were ecstatic,” said Beyond Fest co-founder Christian Parkes in an interview with IndieWire on Monday. Previously shown at the Venice International Film Festival (where IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio gave it a “B,” and again at a secret screening at Telluride), “Frankenstein” is expected in limited theaters on October 17 and will hit Netflix on November 7.

And then it was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that's kind of nuts!' You have to ingest the film and make sure it works. It wasn't really until six o'clock — doors were at seven — that we did the tech check and we were like, ‘OK, this can actually happen. Beyond Fest has been around since 2011, but this year's edition marks unprecedented success for the most popular genre event in Los Angeles. With just two days left, organizers are projecting record attendance with approximately 30,000 festivalgoers coming from across the city and around the world. “It's been gradual growth,” said programmer Evrim Ersoy, who has been with the fest since year two but sat out this year to manage social media from his home in London. “Slowly but surely, we're building the people's trust, and these filmmakers are coming to us,” he said. Exclusivity can be key to making a movie or event seem “cool,” and the sudden activation of “Frankenstein” was an electric highlight this weekend. But while other genre promoters jockey for access, Beyond Fest insists they don't worry about premiere status. The “pipe dream” event got started on a fake-it-til-you-make-it mentality 14 years ago, and organizers have kept the faith ever since. They're not coming because it has to be the premiere.” Del Toro's “Frankenstein” has been compared to Robert Eggers' “Nosferatu,” and early spectators for next year's Oscars race could see this premiere as a step on that path. We want to make sure everyone can go see something.” From the first 70mm print of Brady Corbet's “The Brutalist,” to the West Coast premiere of Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite,” Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque programming has organically turned into an “overarching umbrella, where all of these films can live through their connective genre tissue,” said Parkes. “Time and time again, filmmakers after their screening, they thank us and they say, ‘That's exactly who I made my film for. “We've had a second screen for a long time,” said Ersoy — shouting out Beyond Fest at American Cinemtheque's shorts programming as well. “It's always been about highlighting films that people wouldn't normally take a chance on. Everyone's heard del Toro's ‘Frankenstein' is coming, but maybe this helped them find something else. Beyond boasted the West Coast premiere of Best Picture winner “Anora” last year, and Sean Baker was back to host a chat with the legendary Japanese actress Meiko Kaji (“Lady Snowblood,” “Blind Woman's Curse”) for her first-ever U.S. appearance in 2025. With the reigning Best Director winner practically popping in just to say hi — and del Toro across town literally tossing out “Frankenstein” t-shirts — Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque has established itself as an award-worthy monster maker capable of winning the fight too many genre lovers feared was finished when “The Substance” lost.

With “Which One,” Drake strings together his fourth No. “Nokia” reigned for two weeks in May, followed by the PARTYNEXTDOOR and Cash Cobain collaboration “Somebody Loves Me” in July for a week and the three-week rule of “What Did I Miss?” beginning in August.

He previously went four in a row between 2018 and 2019, albeit largely as a featured act on Bad Bunny's “MIA” and Meek Mill's “Going Bad” and Chris Brown's “No Guidance,” followed by a lead-act reign of his own via “Money in the Grave,” featuring Rick Ross. It's also Drake's fourth nonconsecutive calendar year with at least four No. As for Central Cee, “Which One” is his first Rhythmic Airplay No. His previous best, “Band4Band,” a collaboration with Lil Baby, peaked at No. 1 on Rap Airplay, Central Cee's first ruler and Drake's record-extending 45th. That's two in a row for Drake, as “What Did I Miss?” reigned for three weeks beginning this August. It's Drake's chart-leading 91th top 10 on the former and Central Cee's second. 23 on the all-format, multimetric Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 9 and ranks at No. 87 on the latest tally via 16.5 million radio audience impressions and 2.4 million official U.S. streams earned in the week ending Oct. 2, according to Luminate. The song is expected to be part of Iceman, Drake's ninth studio album, a release date for which has not yet been announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. We've long suspected that AI companies were training their models on copyrighted material, with some cut and dry lawsuits that Hollywood studios are battling aggressively, and it suddenly felt like OpenAI was now just daring everyone to get them to stop. Related Stories 2025 Student Academy Awards Winners Are Announced in New York City How Beyond Fest Locked Guillermo del Toro's ‘Frankenstein' — with Less Than 24 Hours Notice “They've essentially admitted that there's at least a live issue here as to whether creators or owners of copyrights will be able to enforce their rights,” Ray Seilie, an attorney with KHIKS told IndieWire. And by implication, you're saying they have some rights here. But then they don't go all the way and ask for a license. Because I think we all know it has been happening,” added Simon Pulman, an attorney with Pryor Cashman. “What they are effectively saying is as a position, ‘The second you create it, we have the right to use it, unless you affirmatively opt out. That begging for forgiveness came quick on Saturday when, after the Internet was flooded with people using Sora 2 to create custom “South Park” episodes, Pikachu in “Saving Private Ryan,” or police dashcam footage of “Mario Kart,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was changing its tune. “We are hearing from a lot of rights holders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction' and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman wrote in a blog. Altman explained that, rather than an opt-out, the generation of existing characters would instead have rights holders opt-in. It's the same way OpenAI intends to police “likeness,” which the company is treating separately from “copyright.” One of Sora 2's gobsmacking new features is letting people “Cameo” in your AI-generated videos. If you so choose, you can put yourself into an AI video with Sora 2, and your friends can do the same, but you can revoke someone else's privileges to your likeness or to a specific video they're making at any time. We read that as, if Nintendo is cool with people using AI to see Mario speeding away from cops like he's OJ Simpson, then more power to them. We just don't envy the person at Nintendo who has to comb through every video created and determine which ones Nintendo is cool with and which ones it's not. The trouble with this: OpenAI hasn't brokered a deal with a studio to grant them full permission to do whatever they want, like in the way Runway did with Lionsgate to generate AI models based on their films. When that news broke, we wrote that there's a distant future where Lionsgate and Runway charge people if they want to use AI to put themselves into “John Wick 5” or create their own fan-fic endings. “That's how you would have companies typically act in situations where you need to get permission from a copyright holder,” Seilie said. “This is a strange middle ground where [OpenAI] is saying, well, we acknowledge that you have some rights here, because why else are we asking for your opt-out? He explains that, if OpenAI can muddy the waters with an enormous amount of people using the Sora app, flood social media with AI slop, and make the process of combatting it so complex and difficult to navigate, the court of public opinion will eventually work out in its favor. After OpenAI along with Google recently lobbied the Trump administration to consider all AI training data “fair use,” it's betting this administration has sympathetic ears to help on legal grounds as well. But an important distinction that also remains murky is input versus output. Copyright holders may now say they don't want their characters appearing in the Sora 2 app, but it's not clear whether that also precludes that material from being ingested in training data for the Sora model. Sora may bar users from generating Darth Vader, but it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't learn from Darth Vader to create everything else. That means that even if one were to successfully opt out, it could be near impossible to verify whether OpenAI has actually complied. Sora 2 just produced a mini episode of South Park for me pic.twitter.com/fHWqDxfGSo “You don't, it's a ruse,” said Bryn Mooser, CEO of the AI film studio Asteria. Studios, he believes, shouldn't be asking OpenAI whether Sora 2 can generate their copyright but should ask, was it trained on it? Mooser said it's not hard to imagine a near future where AI-generated likenesses of actors are used to sell junk, and that the 10-second clips that can put your friends' faces into the videos are all about creating content for social media. This is not the utopian vision of creating an AI model that can cure cancer or democratizing the filmmaking process so that anyone can make their own “Avatar.” And after playing around with everything Sora 2 can do, he said what it can create is “pretty shocking to see how brazen” it is with copyright. “It's not going to be all the breathless articles that were written about when Sora 1 came out: Hollywood is over. When Sora 2 comes out it's, ‘We don't care about Hollywood. And we don't care about the needs of Hollywood when it comes to having AI tools that are actually powerful enough to be used for making film and television.' And while using AI in any capacity is already toxic enough in Hollywood without OpenAI's help, Mooser feels making generative AI videos synonymous with viral memes is going to make things even harder for the indie filmmakers who dream of using AI ethically. “We've all been at these points before where technology is going to disrupt how we make things, and I think that the industry has done a good job up until now of ‘we set our standards with the guilds or with our norms.' We don't wait for court cases in Washington D.C. to decide this stuff. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What could be better than a personalized wedding venue? This is something that HGTV's “Property Brothers” star Drew Scott has discussed creating for his brother, Jonathan Scott, and his fiancée, actress Zooey Deschanel. A post shared by Jonathan Silver Scott (@jonathanscott) “I will offer to build a venue, right?” Drew told People in an interview published on October 6. It's not me pushing, but I was told… People were saying that you need to get this done.” Drew also gave reassurance to anyone wondering why the couple is taking so long to walk down the aisle, sharing that they are very much in love. Jonathan and Deschanel have a beautiful blended family as he steps into the role of stepdad to her two children, daughter Elsie, 10, and son Charlie, 8, from her previous marriage to Jacob Pechenik. The couple may not have made much progress in terms of wedding planning, at least, not what they have shared publicly, but they do occasionally give fans a glimpse into their relationship. In an Instagram post on October 2, Deschanel posted a video informing fans of what they can find them doing on “date night.” Among the things that you can find them doing is talking about their cats a lot, having a little dance, and discussing leaving events early. “The cats talking is real haha,” a fan wrote. “‘Talking about our cats' deserved first billing with you guys,” another fan shared. “You better walk that man down aisle,” a third person shared. The world needs more love,” and “What a Beautiful, Inspiring couple.” Fans adore Scott and Deschanel as a couple, and when they finally get married, it's going to attract a lot of attention because fans feel invested in this relationship at this point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Upsetting, as Johnson is a tireless promoter who leaves no stone unturned on the PR tour. Like Swift he has a social media reach of a half billion-plus, one which he speaks to directly. Upsetting as there truly seemed to be an awards glow on The Smashing Machine coming out of its Venice Film Festival World premiere after its 15 1/2 minute standing ovation, Johnson crying on a global stage, Safdie's Silver Lion win and a seemingly good 73% Rotten Tomatoes certified fresh critical score. Three weeks ago, Smashing Machine was forecasted to be one of A24‘s highest openings in the high teens to $20M range. Just like Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party for a Showgirl is a box office case study in its last-minute announcement and thrifty marketing campaign which fueled a $34M opening, so is the fallout here from Smashing Machine. Word began to leak at Smashing Machine‘s Toronto North American premiere that the movie wasn't all that. And, no, not because Johnson was stretching with an edgy dramatic performance, rather Smashing Machine wasn't an underdog sports movie, nor necessarily one about a champ's downfall, rather a very non-traditional, deliberately paced movie about an athlete struggling with drug addiction. Here's the good news before diving into the bad, and that's this movie at a net $50M production cost with tax credits from Vancouver and New Mexico won't lose much, estimates being in the $10M-$15M range. Smashing Machine‘s budget is propped by foreign sales (which the Rock lobbied for back at Cannes 2024) estimated to be in the $35M range. A24 also has a great pay-one deal in HBO Max. Smashing Machine was a project foreign buyers liked in qualitative terms but at the time, sources say there were concerns over its commerciality as a story with an unrecognizable Johnson onscreen and UFC lesser known cultural presence outside the United States. Johnson took a $4M fee, significantly below his historical $20M+ paycheck plus points. Sources say he even gave a portion of his paycheck to Emily Blunt and Kerr. Theatrical P&A is factored at an estimated $15M. Reality check: There's a very low ceiling on wrestling movies at the box office and arguably always has been, outside Jared Hess' 2006 Nacho Libre which opened post the director's fanfare of Napoleon Dynamite, when Jack Black original comedies could debut to $28.3M and end their domestic run at $80M. Look back at the grosses of wrestling movies, and Smashing Machine‘s actually seems above average, i.e. A24's 2023 Iron Claw ($4.8M 3-day, $35M domestic), Darren Aronofsky's 2x Oscar nominated The Wrestler (its highest grossing weekend at $3.7M was its 6th with a $26.2M final domestic in 2008) and Bennett Miller's 2014 Foxcatcher ($1M in its widest break, final of $12M). In regards to Smashing Machine‘s misfire, some are elbowing A24 and its means of marketing. The hipster specialty cinema brand no doubt wants to graduate to bigger headliner projects, evident in their business with Johnson here and their upcoming Josh Safdie directed movie Marty Supreme with 2x Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet. Criticizes one boutique studio exec, “If A24 wants to make movies at this budget threshold with A list stars they can't just rely on their digital-social media and tastemaker driven campaigns. Many believe that A24, particularly with a star like Ortega, could have positioned the movie better. While 64% 18-34 showed up for Smashing Machine, the entire over-35 specialty adult crowd was completely missed. Optics you don't expect on a wide release for the Rock had Benny Safdie walking around Manhattan, passing out flyers and promoting the movie with a sandwich board. iSpot shows Warner Bros with One Battle After Another outspending Smashing Machine, 13 to 1 on linear. To A24's defense, they did hit up sports programming, it's just that some believe it came too late with spots during MLB playoffs, NFL, college football, ESPN SportsCenter and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Movie marketing execs say it took a lot for Warner Bros' to get One Battle After Another to a $20M+ opening; that DiCaprio-starring, Paul Thomas Anderson-directed movie towering over Smashing Machine in 2nd place with a 2nd weekend of $11M. UFC CEO Dana White was a definite proponent of Smashing Machine and embraced it early with several screenings for UFC tastemakers as well as signed-off integrations. Again, word of mouth, but also, they're a homebound demo, shelling high priced money to watch fights in their living room. Smashing Machine is the type of movie they're bound to catch on their couch. Despite all the rah-rah coming out of Venice for the film, it also comes as another warning sign for other auteur driven starry movies down the road (who can forget Joker: Folie a Deux) looking to make an awards season world premiere there. Some in tracking ponder whether a 76% certified fresh score is a solid indicator when it comes to forecasting opening weekends. While there's no overlap in demos between Swift and Rock, essentially she ran away with his movie's higher ticket priced premium large format screens, not to mention, if you're surfing the web over the weekend, you were apt to land on a movie ticket portal for the 14x Grammy winner's movie, not the multi-billion dollar leading man. As we mentioned in our weekend coverage, Swift was able to rally with very little promotion because she was tied to her own cultural event, that being her 12th album drop, not to mention she's in a zone that fans crave to watch her. The latter couldn't be said about Johnson and his fans when it came to Smashing Machine. Not to mention, audiences weren't really in their seats for his last R-rated movie, 2013's Pain & Gain which earned a C+ (despite the Michael Bay bodybuilders and drugs movie opening to $20.2M). But there's no need for Johnson to sweat: He'll be back in all victory belt box office glory soon with the openings of Disney's live-action Moana on July 10, 2026 and Sony's Jumanji 3 on Dec. 11 next year as well. Johnson posted three hours before this post, “From deep in my grateful bones, thank you to everyone who has watched The Smashing Machine.” “In our storytelling world, you can't control box office results — but what I realized you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. And I will always run to that opportunity,” he continued while summing, “Truth is this film has changed my life.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. This movie should have been made for $10-15M max.! Dwayne taking $4M when he doesn't need it. Did he not tap into the WWE at all? What kept me away, aside from apathy, was that I have no desire to see The Rock and Emily Blunt onscreen together again. Their chemistry in Jungle Cruise was passable at best, but no romantic spark at all – to watch them do it again but with no jokes? Credit to Dwayne for doing something different as an actor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tori Amos has long spoken out about the world's injustices, and she isn't stopping any time soon. The singer-songwriter announced her 18th studio album, In Times Of Dragons, today, Pitchfork reports. The album presents “a powerful journey of resilience and awakening where the pursuit of freedom meets forces that seek to control and silence,” a press release reads. That's pretty heady stuff, but Amos' work isn't all terror and tyranny. The book is a semi-autobiographical tale about a young girl named Tori who's an incredibly talented musician (Amos was something of a child prodigy herself), but wants to make her own music instead of rehearsing for her recital. Pre-sale tickets for select dates will be available to fans who pre-order In Times Of Dragons before Tuesday, October 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actual rituals of Americans' dreaded visits to the DMV are such a tattered and trampled punchline of both stand-up and real life that a series set in one had better have something fresh to bring to the party. Rich jerks gripe about proper (easily-googleable) Real ID documentation. Irritated customers perform would-be wacky things in line—and so on. Behind the wheel are Meadows' Gregg, buoyed by the actor's signature beaming, underplayed cynicism; Tony Cavalero's Vic, whose himbo-oddball schtick includes steering his test-takers through the McDonald's drive-thru (which they pay for); and Harriet Dyer's Colette, whose chipper optimism and fumbling awkwardness mark her out as DMV's nominal lead. Alongside Meadows, Aussie actor Dyer has already proven her rom-com cred in homeland hit Colin From Accounts, while Kearney's booming presence as the gung-ho but insecure Barbara fits nicely. Cavalero appears to be channeling the Workaholics iteration of his Righteous Gemstones partner Adam Devine at points, but his weird energy offsets some of Vic's abrasiveness. Dyer doesn't lean enough into either Colette's cmishaps or thwarted do-gooder naivete, while Kearney's turn as the blustering Barbara is no Michael Scott, saddled as she is with a running gag about her being too unworldly to recognize, say, a vibrator from the lost and found. Dyer's character stammers her way toward the stolidly hunky Noa again and again, ultimately thwarted by wheezy sitcom plotting as much as Colette's rumpled insecurities. The pilot sees her impaled shirtless on a nail while attempting to escape through the communal bathroom window, while another episode forces her to grade calamitous neophyte driver Noa's road test. (She's dubbed “E-Z Pass” by co-workers for never failing anybody.) That surfer-dude Noa is either clever and competent or dim-bulb clueless according to the needs of each of the first four episodes is a genuine worry. As is, Tarrant and Dyer's lukewarm chemistry as they weave toward an inevitable future pairing bumps against manufactured obstacles aplenty without either character being engaging enough to care all that much about. The pilot brings in a lightly kooky pair of government inspectors, whose revelation to the panicked Barbara that theirs is one of four area DMVs being evaluated for potential closure. That should set off a ticking clock but for the fact that the next three episodes abandon the thread entirely in favor of watching Colette try to fool a judgmental visiting actor friend that she's really a veterinarian. This is a resolutely unambitious portrait of lowest-rung bureaucrats lightly peppered with tonally indifferent stabs at character development and overarching purpose. Kearney's Barbara makes an effortful case in the pilot that the DMV's mandatory democratic drudgery despite “what you look like or how much money you make or if you went to college” is somehow meaningful. (Meadows' Gregg is much more convincing as he shepherds new hire Noa through hard-won DMV rewards like pantomiming his non-existent cigarette during smoke breaks or “going number zero” to goof off in the bathroom.) As with most work-related premises, there's undoubtedly a good sitcom lurking at the DMV. But the glimmers of invention (the driving testers keep track of the number of days since they were almost killed on a whiteboard) are so meager here that this DMV feels as perfunctory and forgettable as re-registering your car.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beyond the Gates creator Michele Val Jean promised Deadline in July that a “hot male” was about to join the action in her leafy Maryland suburb. She kept her word: Greg Vaughan is joining the CBS sudser in a mystery role later this season. Details about his role are expected at a later date. Over the weekend, cast member Trisha Mann Grant posted a video on Instagram to celebrate star Clifton Davis' birthday. Jason Aldean, Lainey Wilson & Bailey Zimmerman To Headline CBS' 'New Year's Eve Live: Nashville's Big Bash' 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming In July, Val Jean told Deadline that “I can't say who just yet, but I will say longtime soap fans all know and love him!” He portrayed Eric Brady on the then-NBC daytime drama since 2012, and won a supporting actor Daytime Emmy for the role in 2018. He took over the role of Dr. Ted Richardson, previously played by Maurice Johnson. Just last month, Beyond the Gates killed off its first big character. The role of Doug McBride, who was played byJason Graham, perished in a car crash. Graham, whose previous credits include 911, All-American Homecoming and Sisters, was part of the original cast when the CBS soap debuted in February. Beyond the Gates has been renewed for a second season. The sudser is up 67% in multi-platform viewership from last year's time period and beats ABC's General Hospital by 7% among women 25-54 on broadcast, according to Nielsen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Campbell knew Springsteen's tongue was planted firmly in cheek. The veteran guitarist's résumé includes a seven-year stint in Bob Dylan's band starting in 1997 and studio sessions with Dylan, Paul Simon, Levon Helm, Rosanne Cash, and just about every American music legend of the last half-century. (He's also toured and recorded with his wife, singer Teresa Williams.) His connections to the Springsteen-Scialfa home go back a ways, too. In the Eighties, Campbell met Scialfa when the two sang and played together in bands on the New York club scene, met Springsteen at a birthday party for E Street bassist Garry Tallent, and guested on one of Scialfa's albums. He was even briefly the boss of the Boss: In 2003, Springsteen played guitar on an album Campbell co-produced for their friend Soozie Tyrell. Over the last 40-plus decades, Springsteen has slipped all 10 of its songs into setlists, whether on solo tours and with the E Street Band. But until that call to Campbell, he'd never played the whole record start to finish with the same minimalist accompaniment. “He said the songs had never been performed the way they were recorded, and he needed a second guitar player, and would I be interested and have time to do it?” Campbell recalls. “I said, ‘Gee, let me think about this — yes. After signing on and learning that E Street Band keyboardist Charlie Giordano would be the only other musician on the project, Campbell started his prep by relistening to Nebraska and focusing on the subtle overdubs Springsteen added to his voice-and-guitar basics. “I'd listened to that record many times, but I didn't pay attention to what was going on instrumentally, because there wasn't a lot going on instrumentally,” he says. That took a lot of paying attention to what was going on. “It was impossible to get note for note everything that was played, but I wanted to absorb the vibe and the chordal inversions,” he says. In what Campbell calls “one of those pinch-yourself moments” he and Giordano, who would contribute synthesizer and celeste to replicate the subtle glockenspiel parts, found themselves at Springsteen's home studio in New Jersey, rehearsing the material the first time as a trio. To recreate Springsteen's mandolin on songs like “Atlantic City,” Campbell brought his own instrument and borrowed one of Springsteen's 12-strings for others. Watch Bruce Springsteen Perform ‘Land of Hope and Dreams' at New York Film Festival Springsteen Previews ‘Nebraska' Box, Rips Trump in New Interview Greil Marcus on 50 Years of ‘Mystery Train': “I Know These Stories Keep Traveling” Arriving at the venue, Campbell realized how secretive it was; no fans were milling about. “I wasn't thinking about that or aware of it,” he says. “Any of the intrigue was just superfluous to what we were doing. It felt to me like Thom wanted to get Bruce's performance on film in a way that really enhanced that darkness.” Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson Will Tour as Rush in 2026 Taylor Swift Conquers Her Biggest Stage Ever on ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump Are Now Cooling on Him Campbell recalls the musicians moving efficiently from tune to tune, with what he calls just a “trunkload” of guitars behind him and Springsteen. As the filming went on, Campbell watched as Springsteen and Zimny huddled after each take: “Thom would say, ‘Okay, that's great,' and if Bruce was cool with it, we moved on.” According to Campbell, the trio didn't attempt any songs that weren't on the album, but given they played a few versions of each song, this still means there's an alternative live Nebraska now in the vaults. He hasn't yet seen Zimny's completed movie of the concert, which will be included in the Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition box out on Oct. 17. “That landscape he created with that record was a real interesting and emotionally moving place to be for a couple of days,” he says. “I very much look forward to the next collaboration, if that ever comes around.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tori Amos has announced a new album, In Times of Dragons. The follow-up to 2021's Ocean to Ocean is due out in spring 2026, via Universal's recently relaunched Fontana label. The singer-songwriter has also announced a huge European tour. Amos said in a press release, “In Times of Dragons is a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the ‘Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.” Early this year, Amos released a soundtrack to the children's book Tori and the Muses.

Hyperdub is the latest label to pull its catalog, joining Bayonet, 10k, Pan, and more. Back in 2017, Lorde announced—and swiftly canceled—a concert in Tel Aviv, after proponents of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, including the authors of an article in New Zealand publication The Spinoff, criticized her decision to play in Israel. Lorde wrote at the time, “i pride myself on being an informed young citizen, and i have done a lot of reading and sought a lot of opinions before deciding to book a show in tel aviv, but i'm not proud to admit i didn't make the right call on this one.” An Israeli court ordered the authors of the article in The Spinoff to pay damage to fans who claimed the cancellation caused them “moral and emotional injury.” The article authors said the ruling was designed “to intimidate Israel's critics” and added that, rather than paying the court-ordered fine, they would raise funds for a mental health organization in Gaza. Today's new additions to the No Music for Genocide streaming embargo join the likes of Massive Attack, Björk, MJ Lenderman, and dozens more who have backed the organizers' stated protest against “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the suppression of pro-Palestine activism. Massive Attack have also joined a separate but parallel drive to pull music from Spotify altogether; proponents of that movement primarily cite founder Daniel Ek's investment in weapons contractor Helsing, which is not linked to Israel. Music businesses' links to the military industrial complex are also listed as a target of the No Music for Genocide movement, for which more than 1,000 artists and labels have signed up, according to organizers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weiss will become editor-in-chief of CBS News, but will work outside of the current org chart by reporting directly to Paramount CEO David Ellison. “I have to imagine she will be his eyes and ears inside CBS News,” one staffer at the company said. Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News. This move is part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects — directly and passionately — to audiences around the world,” Ellison said in a statement. “We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.” “This is a great moment for The Free Press,” Weiss said. “This partnership allows our ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience. The Free Press will remain a stand-alone business outside of CBS News. According to one source, staff in the news division are more confused than anything by the hire: Weiss does not have TV experience (though her digital chops may be the more important skill given the trajectory of TV news right now), and her positioning of editor-in-chief is a perplexing one, with TV news organizations typically using a different organizational structure than newspapers or magazines where the title is more frequently found. While TV news outlets have a central reporting structure, in practice each program is led editorially by the executive producer and anchors. He also told journalists at a press conference later that morning that his intent was to maintain CBS' legacy as a news organization. “I think we want to be fact-based and truth-based as a news organization,” Ellison said. “At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better — recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. How that squares with what Weiss will bring to the table remains to be seen given her well-known perspective on a range of issues, unless Ellison has other deals in mind with people who bring their own perspectives. Also perplexing some staff is how she will engage with Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News, who remains in his role. That structure leads one high-level news executive outside of CBS to wonder whether Weiss will end up having more direct impact than some people think on CBS News' output, or significantly less impact than people think. The argument for her asserting control over CBS News: A powerful title and a direct line to the CEO (effectively bypassing all other executives in the CBS structure) could enable her to do things that Cibrowski can't, or make moves that senior news executives or producers could otherwise block. The anchors and executive producers of CBS News programming report into Cibrowski, who reports into Paramount TV chief George Cheeks, who reports to Ellison and Jeff Shell. It may be hard to have meaningful influence on programming unless she can find a way into that reporting structure. An interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of last year's election sparked a lawsuit from President Trump, a suit that was ultimately settled for $16 million (or something closer to $30 million, according to Trump). And last month CBS changed its interview policy for Face the Nation after facing outrage over an edit made to an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the Sunday show. It's a situation that has left staff at CBS News anxious about what, if anything, Weiss will do to try and influence CBS News programming, and about the looming cuts that are widely expected in connection with the company-wide Paramount cuts, which are likely to happen next month. And inside 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of CBS News, staff are holding their breath. The appointment of Tanya Simon as executive producer drew universal acclaim from employees, but the famously independent program (it has its own correspondents, producers and production crews, and works out of offices in a different building than the rest of CBS News) is gearing up for a fight over that independence. Bill Owens, the show's former EP, resigned after CBS named Susan Zirinsky to a role overseeing standards for all of CBS News, including 60 Minutes, in what was seen as an unacceptable change in long-standing protocol. But one veteran news executive — someone skeptical of Weiss, it's worth noting — nonetheless thinks that perhaps her addition could end up being a wake-up call that the news division needs. CBS News digital is in need of a refresh, with many competitors like NBC News and CNN pouring cash into forward-looking digital efforts. In other words, the status quo wasn't good enough. You can read Ellison and Weiss' notes to staff at the company below. I think we can all agree that the temperature of our nation's social discourse feels higher than ever. Too often, the space once reserved for thoughtful dialogue has been consumed by partisan division and hostile disputes. If we are to move forward, we must find our way back to the ideals that shaped both our country and civilization itself: open exchange of ideas, vigorous yet respectful debate, and a genuine regard for the beliefs and traditions of others. George Washington warned that the primary danger in politics is partisanship. Today, that danger extends far beyond politics – threatening the fabric of our communities. When we reduce every issue to “us vs. them” or “my way vs. the wrong way,” we close ourselves off from listening, learning, and ultimately growing, both as individuals and as a society. At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better – recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. With this in mind, I am excited to share that The Free Press is joining our Company. Since its launch just five years ago, The Free Press, under co-founder Bari Weiss' leadership, has built one of the most dynamic news organizations in the country, one that resonates with audiences of all ages and perspectives. Guided by their core values of truth, balance, and an exchange of ideas, the team has made it their mission to help restore public trust in the news – and they are delivering real results. Their dedication to independent and fearless reporting has won the devotion of some 1.5 million readers – more than 170,000 of who are them now paid subscribers – an extraordinary achievement in such a short time. She brings a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum. This, combined with her restless desire to build, believe, and innovate, makes her a perfect fit for our storied news division. In these early days working together, I've seen the Bari who you will get to know: a person of incredible energy, judgment, and perception for what will resonate with audiences. Working alongside our exceptionally talented colleagues at CBS News, she will help ensure that our reporting remains relevant, accessible, and – most importantly – trusted in this new era for American media. I am confident that, in the coming years, CBS News and The Free Press will make big strides and be at the forefront of a much-needed transformation in how news is gathered, reported, and delivered. So please join me in extending a warm welcome to Bari and the entire team from The Free Press as they join us on that journey. The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you: I look forward to meeting many of you in the days ahead and to listening and learning from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To an older generation, they were Stiller & Meara, the comedy duo with an endless reserve of gently absurd sketches on The Ed Sullivan Show. To a younger generation, he was the fulminating father of George Costanza on Seinfeld. The Severance-y Stiller documents his forebears in all their messy glory in Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, a new documentary that world-premiered at the New York Film Festival on Sunday, ahead of its debut in theaters and on Apple TV+ later this month. What starts (and indeed what started out) as an affectionate but membrane-thick portrait of American comedy royalty turns into something unimaginably layered, investigating numerous spousal and parental relationships — and asking tough questions about the price of perfectionism, the pitfalls of parenthood and, really, the ultimate value of an earthly life. Scorsese' Review: Apple TV+ Docuseries Offers an Entertaining, if Standard, Overview of a Legendary Filmmaker “Yeah, it's a little personal,” Stiller said before the screening as he described what his family thought of him embarking on this quest. “But it's also, I think, in a way about everyone.” Even to those who know the comedy of the Jewish-American Stiller and Irish-American Meara (they died in 2020 and 2015, respectively), some of the background will surprise — he, an army veteran from an unloving Brooklyn home who urgently sought validation from audiences; she, a nimble comic talent weighted down by her mother's suicide when she was still a girl. Ben Stiller, who does not skimp on his parents' best moments in front of a camera, is also not afraid to expose the dark side they showed to him and his older sister Amy; subjects like Anne's alcoholism and Jerry's work obsession at the expense of his family each get rich treatment. Ben Stiller and his wife Christine Taylor also frequently worked together, though with slightly fewer pitfalls; Taylor's voice, it should be said, brings high levels of consideration and insight in a film not lacking for either quality. Stiller sets the film at the sprawling Upper West Side apartment where Anne and Jerry raised their family and to which Ben and Amy have returned after Jerry's death to go through, pack up and throw out all their parents' stuff to prepare for the sale of the longtime home. Jerry Stiller had a compulsive need to record and save everything, and as we watch Ben Stiller take it all in after his father's death, there is something both humanizing and surreal at the sight of a famous actor undergoing the same heart-wrenching ritual as everyone else. At that rummage-y point several years ago, Ben Stiller had no idea where his filmic lark would lead. But as he showed footage to friends and entertainment colleagues, he began to get a certain kind of feedback: maybe it would work better if you went deeper and even bared your own soul? “I was pushing myself out of it because I didn't want it to be about me,” Stiller said at the screening. If the director comes out of this process feeling, dishearteningly, that parental mistakes have been repeated, he does possess the vulnerability to admit it. One can't imagine the subjects of the film ever turning a critical eye on themselves in this way; indeed, Jerry seems uncomfortable whenever Anne discusses even banal details of their relationship on camera. (Ben Stiller after the screening said he thought his mother would like the movie, but his father might be uncomfortable with how much was shared.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britney Spears sparked concern among fans after revealing a painful leg injury in her latest Instagram video, just days after spending time with her sons, Sean, 20, and Jayden, 19. In the clip, the 43-year-old pop icon danced inside her home wearing a sparkling pink mini dress, accessorized with fingerless gloves and black heels. A white bandage wrapped around her right knee was clearly visible as she moved carefully to the music before briefly sitting at her piano to play a few notes. “I fell down the stairs, and my leg snaps out now and then,” Spears explained in her caption, adding that she's “not sure if it's broken.” Fans quickly flooded the comments with messages of concern. “Hope she's getting good care and rest,” one user wrote on X, while another added, “Oh no, that sounds painful!” The “Toxic” singer's post quickly went viral as fans voiced their concern for her well-being. She shares Sean and Jayden with ex-husband Kevin Federline, who now lives in Hawaii. In June, Spears posted a video celebrating Jayden's new Mercedes AMG SL 63, valued at $187,000. How long am I going to be in shock?” she wrote. Sources told the Daily Mail that those close to Spears are “wary” that Jayden's new music interests could lead to family tension, fearing he may use her fame and connections for career gain. Amid ongoing personal struggles, Britney Spears is reportedly facing new professional hurdles. Sources claim that production on her long-awaited biopic — inspired by her 2023 memoir “The Woman in Me” — has stalled, with insiders citing concerns over the singer's “erratic” behavior, leaving Hollywood producers frustrated. I just hope she finds peace,” one person commented under her latest post, echoing the sentiment of many. Despite recent challenges, Spears' devoted fan base continues to rally behind her, hoping she finds stability, healing, and the creative freedom she has fought for since the end of her conservatorship.</p>
