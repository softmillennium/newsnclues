                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Max Verstappen had to settle for second between George Russell and Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix. Max Verstappen shared mixed feelings after a hard-fought run to second position in Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix, having “struggled a lot” behind the wheel of his Red Bull throughout the race. Red Bull headed to the high-downforce Marina Bay Street Circuit aiming to validate the apparent progress they have made with their RB21, following back-to-back wins for Verstappen in low-downforce conditions at Monza and Baku. Verstappen was heard complaining about shift problems in particular, at one stage describing his car as “undriveable” after locking up and narrowly avoiding the barriers at Turn 14, but he survived to come home between George Russell's Mercedes and Lando Norris' McLaren. “It was a bit more difficult than I would have hoped for, to be honest,” Verstappen reflected afterwards. “The car was also not where I wanted it to be, unfortunately. A few things of course to learn from that, I think, from some decisions that we made throughout the weekend in terms of the set-up. Nonetheless, Verstappen added: “Even if the balance would have been perfect, I think second was still the best possible, because you can't pass around here. For me, that first stint was all about just managing to go long enough.” As for how much encouragement can be taken from the weekend, given that he finished ahead of both McLaren drivers once again despite the higher downforce track characteristics, Verstappen maintained a cautious tone. Verstappen's latest result has seen him make further progress in the Drivers' Championship, moving to within 41 points of Norris and 63 points of championship leader Oscar Piastri.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimi Antonelli looks back on how his race unfolded for Mercedes at the Singapore Grand Prix. Kimi Antonelli was left with mixed feelings after the Singapore Grand Prix, believing more was possible as his Mercedes team mate went on to secure victory around the Marina Bay Street Circuit. The first was Qualifying, where he felt he did not do quite a good enough job in Q3 as his team mate grabbed pole. As we have seen previously, track position is extremely important. [I] lost a couple of places at the start, then [got] stuck behind Leclerc. I think with a better Q3, [it] could have been a different story but we'll try to do better next time.” Antonelli was unable to get past Leclerc in the first stint, despite running within DRS range of the Ferrari for lap after lap. But once both drivers had bolted on the hard tyre, the Mercedes man was able to pull off a pass, one of very few around a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult. After a tricky time of it in Europe through the summer, with that entire run of races in his home continent yielding just three points, Antonelli seems to have bounced right back into some much better form for the flyaway races. "The pace was good, and I was able to gain a position back with a good move on Leclerc. We could have achieved more tonight but P5 is still okay." Toto Wolff has famously joked that his team does well whenever he is forced into wearing a sweater, but that was definitely not the case in Singapore when humidity touched 80% at times. “I'm able to really put the car where I want and really play with the car so that is a real positive one and, yeah, just really looking forward to the next few races. He did a great job and maximised the result and also congratulations to McLaren for winning the Constructors' and congratulations to our department as well – they've done an incredible job [going] back-to-back, our engine is winning the Championship so incredible job from them as well.”</p>
