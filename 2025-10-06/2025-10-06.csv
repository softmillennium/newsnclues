            A rare, monstrous EF5 tornado that struck the United States more than three months ago was the first of its kind in more than a decade, experts announced Monday.
    


            A tornado that roared through part of eastern North Dakota in June and killed three people was upgraded Monday to an EF5 with winds greater than 210 mph, the National Weather Service in Grand Forks, North Dakota, confirmed.
    


            EF5 tornadoes pack winds of at least 201 mph and are the highest level of the Enhanced Fujita Scale, the scale used to determine tornado strength. Tornadoes this strong are rare. Only 60 tornadoes of EF5 strength – including this one – have been recorded since 1950, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center.
    


            The tornado first hit near Enderlin, North Dakota – located about 40 miles southwest of Fargo – and tracked north for nearly 20 minutes and about 12 miles before ending near Alice.
    


            Tornadoes are rated after they've occurred based on the degree of damage they cause. The Enderlin tornado was originally rated an EF3 with winds of 160 mph.
    


            Additional investigation by weather service meteorologists in consultation with other scientists led to the upgrade, mainly based on the damage the tornado did to a freight train.
    


            The violent tornado tossed one empty train car nearly 500 feet off the track and knocked over several fully loaded grain hopper cars, according to the report. Its raging winds also ripped large trees down to stubs and inflicted “complete destruction” on one farmstead.
    


            The last EF5 tornado in the US roared through Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2013. Twenty-four people were killed and more than 200 were injured after the tornado turned the city to rubble in a matter of moments.
    


            Despite the rarity of such a monster, the fact that there hadn't been an EF5 tornado in more than a decade didn't sit right with some scientists.
    


            A study released in August dove into this so-called EF5 tornado “drought” and posited the lack of these high-end ratings had more to do with a potentially imbalanced damage rating scale than the power of the twisters themselves.
    


            Tornadoes are assigned ratings based on the type of damage that they do and that damage level is tied to a wind speed. A tornado that rips apart a single family home down to its foundation is given winds of 200 mph, making it an EF4. However, before the scale was changed in 2007, that type of damage was considered the most extreme level.
    


            The August study argued that adjusting the definition of an EF5 tornado down slightly to 190 mph would result in an EF5 frequency that's more consistent with decades past.
    


            That area of discussion will continue for years to come, but one thing is certain: The EF5 counter has reset and the clock is ticking again.

            A judge at the Tirana appeals court was shot dead on Monday by a man involved in a trial, police in Albania said. The gunman fled the scene but was later arrested.
    


            Judge Astrit Kalaja was shot inside the courtroom by a 30-year-old suspect with the initials E. Sh., according to police. Kalaja died while being taken to a hospital.
    


            The gunman also shot two other people involved in the hearing, police said. Their injuries weren't life-threatening.
    


            Authorities haven't provided details about the motive, or the nature of the case being heard. The case found at the court's website referred to a property.
    


            Police later arrested the suspect, who ran away after the shooting, and also found the alleged revolver he used.

The US President Donald Trump has said he had already made a decision on supplying long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine. He however refused to reveal what the exact decision is.

“I've sort of made a decision on that. I would have to ask the question where are they sending them,” he told journalists at the White House on Monday.

“I'm not looking to see escalation,” Trump stressed.

Last month, US Vice President J.D. Vance revealed that the White House was considering supplying Kiev with the rockets, which cost an estimated $1.3 million each and have a range of 2,500km (1,550 miles), meaning that they could potentially reach Moscow and far beyond.

Russian President Vladimir Putin later warned that relations between Moscow and Washington would be ruined in that case. He also argued that Kiev's forces would be unable to operate such a sophisticated system without the “direct participation of American military personnel.”

Reuters, citing anonymous sources, reported that the US was unlikely to supply Tomahawks to Ukraine, as the current inventories were committed to the US Navy and other uses. The Financial Times also reported that some people inside Trump's inner circle were skeptical as to the Tomahawks' ability to change battlefield dynamics.

The Israeli authorities have confirmed deporting activist Greta Thunberg. She and hundreds of others were detained last week after attempting to reach Gaza aboard an aid flotilla.

Thunberg was a part of a group of over 170 activists deported to Greece and Slovakia on Monday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a post on X. It also published a photo of her and two other women at the Ben Gurion airport.

The group included citizens of a total of 19 nations, including the US, the UK, Germany, and France, among others, according to the ministry.

”All the legal rights of the participants in this PR stunt were and will continue to be fully upheld,” the ministry said of the activists, calling their aid flotilla a provocation. The ministry used the occasion to accuse the group of “spreading lies” as part of what it called a “pre-planned fake news campaign.”

The ministry was referring to earlier accusations made by a number of journalists and activists, who said Thunberg was mistreated in Israeli custody. “They dragged little Greta by her hair before our eyes, beat her, and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag,” Turkish journalist Ersin Celik told Anadolu news agency.

The Swedish Embassy in Tel Aviv reportedly said that Thunberg had complained about “harsh treatment” and not receiving enough food or water, according to an email cited by The Guardian. West Jerusalem has denied the allegations, calling them “brazen lies.”

Over 400 activists onboard some 50 boats were detained by the Israeli navy on Friday as they tried to breach the blockade of Gaza by sea. More than 130 of them were deported to Türkiye over the weekend.

Most of those detained were taken to Ketziot Prison in the Negev Desert; Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir stated that he was “proud” of the harsh conditions they were held in.

West Jerusalem's actions have sparked a wave of protests in Europe, Latin America, and beyond.

Germany could withdraw from Eurovision 2026 if Israel is excluded, Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated on Monday. The organizers of the contest have been facing mounting pressure for a ban due to the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.

In an interview with ARD, Merz was asked whether Germany should voluntarily pull out of Eurovision in the event Israel is disinvited.

”I would support this,” he responded, adding, “I think it's a scandal that this is even being discussed. Israel has a place there.”

Germany is part of Eurovision's so‑called ‘Big Five' that contribute the most financially to the contest, along with France, Italy, Spain, and the UK.

While France has affirmed its participation regardless of Israel's status, Spain, the Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland, and Slovenia have threatened to withdraw if the country is not banned.

Under mounting pressure, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced plans last month for an unprecedented online vote in November that could determine whether Israel is expelled from Eurovision 2026.

In a letter to member broadcasters, EBU president Delphine Ernotte Cunci acknowledged the “unprecedented diversity of views” on the issue of Israel's participation and said the vote would occur at an extraordinary general assembly.

Israel's broadcaster KAN responded by voicing “hope that the Eurovision Song Contest will continue to maintain its cultural and apolitical character,” but warned that exclusion “could be a step with wide‑ranging implications.”

Though describing itself as “apolitical” the EBU banned Russia from the contest in 2022 following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. Moscow has repeatedly condemned reprisals against artists, insisting that attempts to “cancel” Russian culture abroad will ultimately fail.

However, Israel has continued competing despite international concern about its actions in Gaza.

The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel's military campaign in Gaza has led to the deaths of over 67,000 Palestinians, according to the local health authorities.

The 70th edition of Eurovision is slated to take place in Vienna, Austria, with the grand finale on May 16, 2026.

Body of Max Thomas, 60, discovered last week outside Sam's Throne campground in Ozark national forest

Arkansas officials shot and killed a male black bear that they believe fatally mauled a 60-year-old Missouri man last week at his campsite in the Ozark national forest, authorities have said.

The body of Max Thomas of Springfield, Missouri, was discovered on Thursday several yards outside the Sam's Throne campground in north-west Arkansas, Newton county sheriff Glenn Wheeler said.

A deputy had gone to the campground after the man's son reported he had not heard from his father, who had sent his family pictures of a black bear in his camp on Tuesday morning, Wheeler said. The deputy found evidence of a struggle and injury, including drag marks from the campground into the woods, the sheriff said.

“We believe he was in the process of breaking down his camp when the attack occurred,” Wheeler said.

The state medical examiner's office determined the man's death to be an “animal mauling”.

On Sunday, a bear was caught on a trail camera near the campground that appeared to be the same animal photographed by the victim and encountered by another man at a roadside overlook in the area, Wheeler said.

Local hunters and hounds were brought into the area and quickly tracked the bear, which was killed and transported to Little Rock, where authorities will obtain DNA samples to confirm it is the bear who fatally attacked the man.

“We knew the bear in the photos was a male and this one is too,” Wheeler said in a press release. “It matches the size of the photographed bear and has the same facial colorations. Not to mention it was back in the same area where the attack happened.”

It is the second fatal bear attack in Arkansas in recent weeks. In September, a 72-year-old man died after being attacked by a bear in nearby Franklin county, according to authorities with the Arkansas game and fish commission.

Despite the recent attacks, Don White Jr, a large mammal ecologist at the University of Arkansas at Monticello, said fatal bear attacks in Arkansas are “exceedingly rare”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) yesterday said it was investigating Internet personality Holger Chen (陳之漢) after he allegedly called for the decapitation of President William Lai (賴清德) during a live stream on Sunday.

The bureau said in a statement that it was investigating comments by a “social media influencer” that might constitute incitement to commit a crime and threatening bodily harm under the Criminal Code.

The CIB added that it had begun gathering evidence related to Chen's remarks and asked the New Taipei City District Prosecutors' Office to summon him for questioning.

Chen — a former gang member turned fitness celebrity and businessman who is better known as Kuan Chang (館長) — allegedly made the comments during a live stream focused on Taiwanese politics and cross-strait issues, the bureau said.

Referring to the use of military “decapitation strikes,” Chen, apparently addressing China, allegedly called for it to “chop off the head of William Lai,” before going on to say: “I am waiting, brothers, I think about it day and night.”

Although Taiwan has ample free-speech protections, those freedoms are not limitless, the CIB said.

“The exercise of freedom of speech must be based on respecting the rights of others, and must not incite violence or endanger public safety,” it said.

Chen, 46, was previously a vocal supporter of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government, but has since become an avid backer of the Taiwan People's Party and its founder, Ko Wen-je (柯文哲), as well as a frequent critic of the DPP.

The gym entrepreneur turned Internet influencer also made a high-profile trip to Shanghai in June, during which he praised China to his mostly Taiwanese viewership, drawing the ire of many in the DPP.


TRACK RECORD:
                                        The elderly woman from the viral video did not report for her sentence for shoplifting, and was known for allegedly harassing people on the metro                                        Taipei police yesterday arrested an elderly woman causing an disturbance at a convenience store, as she is wanted on shoplifting offenses, and identified her as in the “Taipei Metro flying kick incident” video, which has gone viral online in recent days.
The woman, surnamed Tseng (曾), 73, was taken to Taipei's Datong Police Precinct to record a statement, then escorted to the Taipei Shilin District Prosecutors' Office for questioning, as she was found to have several shoplifting convictions, including an outstanding warrant for her failure to serve a 55-day jail sentence.
The widely circulated video, recorded on a Taipei Metro train on

In a video recorded on Monday afternoon on the Tamsui-Xinyi Line (Red Line), the woman, surnamed Tseng (曾), approached a young person sitting in a priority seat and demanded that they get up.
When the young person refused, Tseng swung her tote bag and hit them several times. The passenger then asked someone to hold their bag, stood up and kicked Tseng, sending her flying

The civil aviation authority made the announcement ahead of the Mid-Autumn Festival long weekend after Minister of Transportation and Communications Chen Shih-kai (陳世凱) visited the renovated facility yesterday morning.
Chen said he loved watching planes fly overhead in Taipei's Binjiang Street, adding that he was particularly impressed by the childcare room as well as the futuristic-style entrance to the observatory.

In Korea, the season is also celebrated, though with different customs and a distinctive atmosphere. Called “Chuseok,” it usually lasts three days and centers on harvest traditions and ancestor worship.
During Chuseok, Koreans follow traditions passed down for generations. In spite of their busy routines, many families return to their hometowns to conduct memorial rites. An elaborate table is prepared with an array of traditional foods to thank their ancestors for the harvest. Another custom involves visiting ancestral burial sites, where families clean the graves and

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","Competition heats up to challenge Nvidia's dominance","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2025/10/07/2003845025","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has whetted the appetites of Nvidia Corp's competitors, who are seeking to close the gap on the chip giant, which has so far been the central playmaker in the AI revolution. 

Virtually unknown to the general public just three years ago, Nvidia now boasts the world's highest revenues, driven by sales of its graphics cards or graphics processing units (GPUs), the processors that are key to building the technology behind ChatGPT and its rivals. 

While Nvidia was not the first to develop GPUs, the California-based company made them its specialty starting in the late 1990s, at the very beginning of cloud computing, and thus has unique experience in the field.

Moreover, Nvidia is “a three-headed dragon,” SemiAnalysis founder and CEO Dylan Patel recently said on the No Priors podcast. 

The company does not just design chips, but offers an entire infrastructure capable of making them work together with networking and software — the dragon's two other heads. 

Nvidia can “satisfy every level of need in the data center with world-class product,” Jon Peddie Research founder and president Jon Peddie said. 

At a considerable distance from Nvidia, whose market share is estimated at about 80 percent depending on the source, Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) has until recently been considered the runner-up. 

However, AMD generates the bulk of its revenue from central processing units (CPUs) — processors used for personal and business computers that are less powerful than GPUs — and “can't divert resources from that golden egg,” Peddie said. 

Determined to reduce their dependence on Nvidia, major cloud providers have developed their own processors. 

Google began using its Tensor processing unit a decade ago, while Amazon Web Services' Trainium appeared in 2020. 

Today, Google and Amazon account for more than 10 percent of the market and have even overtaken AMD in terms of “performance, pricing, usability, reliability and ability to produce enough chips to satisfy the biggest customers,” SemiAnalysis researcher Jordan Nanos said. 

Google is even offering its chips to third-party customers, according to several media reports. 

However, Amazon does not sell its Trainium to other players. 

The only nation rivaling the US in the sector, China, is seeking to make up for lost time — and is having to do so without the most advanced US chips, which are now subject to export restrictions. 

For Nanos, Huawei Technologies Co (華為) ranks among Nvidia's most credible competitors, alongside Google or Amazon, and ahead of AMD. 

Like Google and Amazon, their Chinese equivalents Baidu Inc (百度) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (阿里巴巴) are also having their own AI processors manufactured, but these remain merely substitutes for Nvidia's GPUs. 

“They can't catch up technically for a while using in-country” fabrication facilities, Peddie said. 

However, “over time, with its huge and smart workforce, and subsidized investment, China will be able to make state-of-the-art fabrication systems,” Peddie added. 

No expert sees the Santa Clara, California, giant loosening its grip on the sector in the near future. 

“Nvidia underpins the vast majority of AI applications today,” Gabelli Funds LLC analyst John Belton said. “And despite their lead, they keep their foot on the gas by launching a product every year, a pace that will be difficult for competitors to match.” 

Early last month, Nvidia announced that its new generation, Rubin, would be commercialized late next year, with performance for AI functions estimated at 7.5 times that of its flagship product Blackwell.

Slovakia seeks a swift end to the war in Ukraine rather than Russia's defeat, Prime Minister Robert Fico said during a televised debate on Slovak public broadcaster STVR on Oct. 5.

“The goal of the foreign policy of the Slovak Republic, of the government of the Slovak Republic, of which I am the prime minister, is not the defeat of the Russian Federation. Our goal is to end the war in Ukraine as soon as possible. These are Slavs killing each other. War is not a solution,” Fico said.

Fico criticized the European Union's approach to Russia's war against Ukraine and accused the bloc of focusing on military aid instead of peace initiatives.

“If the EU spent as much energy on peace as it does on supporting the war in Ukraine, the war could have been over long ago. I will never be a wartime prime minister,” he said.

Since returning to office in 2023, Fico has ended military aid to Ukraine from Slovak army stocks and questioned EU sanctions on Russia. In the past, Fico has also vowed to block Kyiv's entry into NATO — a move that requires the agreement of all 32 members, including Slovakia.

Fico visited Moscow in December 2024 and has been fostering closer ties with Moscow, both diplomatically and economically.

Sonya has a Master's degree in Global Affairs from New York University, and a Bachelor's degree in Music from the University of Houston, in Texas.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 6 that he has ""sort of made a decision"" on whether to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles. 

Officials from Russia's Tyumen Oblast claimed on Telegram that three Ukrainian drones were shot down over an ""industrial facility"" in the city, adding that no fire, casualties, or explosions occurred amid the attack. 





The CDU-6 unit has a capacity of 160,000 barrels per day — around 40% of the refinery's total output. According to Reuters, repairs may take around a month.



According to the statement, 263 Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the battlefield, while 59 others were killed in the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Over the last few weeks, drones have violated the airspace of at least eight European countries.

The components were reportedly manufactured by companies based in the U.S., China, Taiwan, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

Everyone managed to take shelter in time, and no casualties were reported. The fire has since been extinguished by first responders.

The facility produces a wide range of munitions, including aircraft and artillery shells, guided air bombs, anti-tank missile warheads, and ammunition for air defense and engineering units.

Both leaders began their trips by honoring fallen Ukrainian soldiers at Kyiv's Wall of Remembrance. 

The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

""We are using all tools,"" Danish Industry and Trade Minister Morten Bodskov said.

""We have significant damage. The scope of work will be significant,"" Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Key developments on Oct. 6: 

Ukrainian drones struck Russian-occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 6, hitting the Feodosia oil terminal, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

The terminal, located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, is the largest oil storage facility in Crimea. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

Pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind said the explosion sparked a fire visible from tens of kilometers away, while additional blasts were reported near the Saki and Kacha airfields.

According to the General Staff, the terminal serves as a multifunctional facility for transferring oil and petroleum products between rail, sea, and road transport.

Ukrainian forces also struck an ammunition depot belonging to a logistics battalion of Russia's 18th Combined Arms Army in Crimea, though the results of that strike are still being assessed.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had intercepted 251 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 40 over the occupied peninsula.

Separately, Ukraine also claimed to have struck Russia's state-owned Sverdlov Plant overnight on Oct. 6, one of the country's main producers of explosives and ammunition.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

A Ukrainian attack damaged energy facilities and disrupted power supplies in the Russian city of Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Oct. 5.

The attack follows weeks of intensified Russian strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Nearly 40,000 Belgorod residents were left without electricity after the strike, which caused significant damage across seven municipalities, according to Gladkov.

""We listened to a report from energy officials on the nature of the damage caused by the nighttime shelling of Belgorod. We have significant damage,"" he said. ""Scope of work will be significant.""

Emergency crews were deployed to the affected areas, and hospitals in Belgorod have switched to backup power. Local authorities are coordinating school operations amid the outages, Gladkov said.

On the morning of Oct. 6, Gladkov reported that partial power outages continued in 24 settlements, affecting 5,400 residents. He did not indicate when full power restoration was expected.

""Restoration work is continuing, and we hope that it will be completed in the very near future,"" he said.

Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) released an alleged intercepted phone call, in which a Belgorod Oblast resident described widespread blackouts and internet outages following the attack.

""All of Shchebekino was without power,"" a woman can be heard saying. ""The streets were all dark.""

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio.

Ukraine is investigating evidence that Russian forces executed at least 322 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), the Prosecutor General's Office reported on Oct. 6 in response to a request from Ukrinform.

According to the statement, 263 Ukrainian soldiers were executed on the battlefield, while 59 others were killed in the 2022 Olenivka prison explosion in the occupied part of Donetsk Oblast.

Ukrainian POWs held in Russian captivity often face torture, abuse, and inhumane treatment, according to Ukrainian officials and human rights groups.

Many former POWs have reported beatings, starvation, and psychological pressure.

To date, 80 criminal proceedings have been opened, the Prosecutor General's Office said.

Nine Russian servicemen have been formally charged, while indictments against six of them have already been submitted to court. Two have been convicted, and two more cases remain under judicial review.

Up to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable seen by the outlet.

""After North Korea, Cuba is the largest contributor of foreign troops to Russia's aggression, with an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans fighting in Ukraine,"" the cable said.

The U.S. circulated an unclassified cable, sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, as part of its campaign to counter a United Nations resolution calling for Washington to lift its embargo on the Caribbean nation, which has been in place since 1960.

The Oct. 2 unclassified cable, sent to dozens of U.S. missions, directs diplomats to urge foreign governments to oppose the resolution, which has passed the U.N. General Assembly every year since 1992.

The U.N. resolution holds symbolic value, only the U.S. Congress can ultimately lift the decades-long embargo.

According to Reuters, the U.S. State Department declined to provide additional details on the Cuban fighters, but said it was aware of reports that they were serving alongside Russian troops.

More than 100,000 Western-made components were discovered in drones and missiles launched by Russia against Ukraine overnight on Oct. 5, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a day after.

This revelation highlights the continued presence of Western technology in Moscow's weapons, despite years of sanctions.

Russian troops launched around 500 drones and more than 50 missiles in a large-scale attack on Ukraine, targeting settlements across the country, including those far from the front lines in the west. The strike killed at least six people, including an entire family of four, and left 18 others injured.

According to Zelensky, the attack drones contained 100,688 foreign-made components. Around 1,500 were found in Iskander missiles, 192 in Kinzhal ballistic missiles, and 405 in Kalibr cruise missiles.

These components were reportedly manufactured by companies based in the U.S., China, Taiwan, the U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

Ukraine's partners already have detailed information on every company and every product involved, Zelensky said. He added that Kyiv is also working on new sanctions targeting individuals and entities aiding Russia.

""It is crucial to shut down every scheme that circumvents sanctions, because Russia uses each one to keep killing. The world has the power to stop this,"" Zelensky said. 

While Western countries have banned the export of many dual-use components to Russia, Moscow has adapted to sanctions by relying on smuggling networks and other schemes to obtain restricted goods.

Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, previously said that most foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield in Ukraine originate from China.

Fox Sports analyst and former New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the late-night incident in a downtown Indianapolis alleyWade Payne/The Associated Press

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is now facing a felony battery charge for what authorities said Monday was a fight over parking, in addition to the misdemeanour charges that the Fox Sports analyst was already facing from the weekend incident in Indianapolis.

Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears announced the felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury, which carries a potential sentence of one to six years in prison, during a news conference with Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Chris Bailey. Mears said the investigation is ongoing and that additional charges are possible.

“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” the prosecutor told reporters.

A police affidavit alleges the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted a 69-year-old truck driver who backed into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis, leading to a confrontation early Saturday outside the vehicle that prompted the driver to pull out a knife to defend himself.

Ex-NFL star and Fox analyst Mark Sanchez stabbed, arrested after fight in Indianapolis

The former New York Jets quarterback was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the altercation, according to court records filed Sunday.

It became clear after investigators learned more about the victim's medical condition that the more serious felony charge was warranted, Mears said.

“This was a situation that did not need to occur,” the prosecutor said. “The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries as a result of that altercation.”

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, the initial affidavit signed by a police detective said. The truck driver, identified as P.T., had a cut to his left cheek, it said.

Authorities have not said whether the truck driver might also faces charges, but Mears noted that Indiana “has some of the most robust self-defence laws in the nation.”

Sanchez had been scheduled for a hearing Tuesday on the original misdemeanour charges but that was rescheduled to Nov. 4. Sanchez remained hospitalized and was listed in stable condition Monday morning.

One of Sanchez's attorneys, James Voyles, declined to comment on the case.

“This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days,” Sanchez's brother, Nick, said in a statement released Monday. “Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.”

Mark Sanchez was in Indianapolis for the network's coverage of Sunday's game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

The prosecutor said police are still gathering information and have several outstanding search warrants. He also said surveillance video captured the incident from multiple angles.

“I don't care who you are. I don't care what you do for a living. I don't care where you live,” the police chief said. “If you come into our city, commit violence, we will use all the tools at our disposal to hold you accountable.”

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Ontario Premier Doug Ford say they don't want Donald Trump to bully Prime Minister Mark Carney during a White House meeting on Tuesday and urged the U.S. President to strike a trade deal with Canada that benefits both countries.

Mr. Carney is returning to Washington to meet with Mr. Trump for a second time on Tuesday, although Canadian officials are cautioning not to expect any breakthroughs.

Mr. Shapiro, who is a high-profile Democrat, spoke alongside Mr. Ford at a joint news conference in Quebec City on Monday after a meeting between Great Lakes governors and other U.S. officials and the premiers of Ontario and Quebec.

Carney has large and risky job ahead of him on Washington visit, former officials say

Mr. Shapiro, who could be in the running to become a 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, said he's “very concerned” about the Trump administration's policies and that “dangerous” tariffs have caused costs to skyrocket in his state, including for farmers, small businesses and manufacturers.

He said he respects Canada's sovereignty and it is against the United States' long-term interest to fight with Canada.

“I hope the President of the United States has re-evaluated his tough guy approach to Canada,” Mr. Shapiro said on Monday.

“Instead of coming in and trying to bully the Prime Minister, actually sit down and work to hammer out a deal that lifts everyone up. This is not a zero-sum game. I don't believe that if a Canadian does well, a Pennsylvanian has to be worse off.”

Pennsylvania has a balanced trade policy with Canada of roughly US$14-billion in imports and exports, with more than 10,000 people in his state working for Canadian-based companies, Mr. Shapiro said.

LeBlanc hopes to make progress on steel, aluminum tariff relief before USMCA review

Mr. Ford, meanwhile, said dealing with the U.S. President is unpredictable, but he hopes Canada can achieve certainty with a fair trade deal for both sides of the border.

“I don't want the Prime Minister in there getting bullied,” the Premier said.

“Hopefully we'll come out with positive results. And I'm confident that the Prime Minister is going to go in there and do a great job. He's a smart, smart businessperson. So let's see what happens.”

Mr. Ford also criticized the President for abandoning a constructive relationship with Canada in favour of other countries. “It seems like he's given more love to China and Russia than he is his closet ally in the entire world,” the Premier said.

He added that Canada has critical minerals that the U.S. needs, and that it would be beneficial for both countries to see some tariff relief, including on steel.

The Ontario Premier also repeated his threat to pull Crown Royal whiskey from the shelves of the LCBO, after Diageo – one of the world's largest alcohol producers – said it would be closing a bottling plant in Southwestern Ontario next year. Mr. Ford also mused Monday about possibly taking down other alcohol products owned by U.K.-based Diageo, such as Smirnoff vodka.

Opinion: Without a deal with Trump, Carney rolls out responses for an economic rupture

Since returning to the White House earlier this year, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a string of tariffs: 50 per cent on steel and aluminum, 25 per cent on autos – with a carve-out for U.S. parts – and 35 per cent on any goods traded outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with the exception of oil, gas and potash, which are subject to 10-per-cent tariffs.

On Sept. 30, Mr. Trump imposed a new 10-per-cent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber shipments, raising the total levy on softwood to more than 45 per cent.

Mr. Trump on Monday said he and Mr. Carney would discuss tariffs, which the U.S. President claimed were causing companies to leave Canada for the U.S.

“Well, I guess he's going to ask about tariffs, because a lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States, you know, everybody's moving back,” he told reporters in the Oval Office when asked what would be on the agenda for his meeting with the Prime Minister. “They're losing a lot of companies in Canada.”

Mr. Trump did not specify which companies he was referring to, but insisted these were companies that “left here 20 years ago” because “presidents that sat here right at this desk weren't doing their job.”

The President said his tariffs have been “effective.” 

When asked if he would be open to changing his position on tariffs in his talks with Mr. Carney, Mr. Trump replied by talking up the amount of money tariffs have raised for the U.S. treasury.

“Everybody has said I'm right. They find billions of dollars that they didn't even know they had. Recently, they said they found billions of dollars and they couldn't understand it. I said ‘check the tariffs shelf,' and they come in the next hour and they say ‘sir, you're right, it's from the tariffs,'” Mr. Trump said.

The tariffs are paid by importers bringing Canadian and other foreign products into the U.S, with the cost typically passed on to American consumers.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also characterized Mr. Carney's visit as a “working meeting” and said trade would be on the agenda.

“I'm sure trade will be a topic of discussion tomorrow and all of the other issues that are facing both Canada and the United States. I know that the President looks forward to having that discussion with Carney in the Oval Office,” she said at a Monday press briefing.

Quebec Premier François Legault said on Monday that he did not want to set expectations for the Carney-Trump meeting too high, but that certainty is needed.

“What will happen next week? What will happen with the renegotiation of the USMCA next year?” Mr. Legault said.

“The most important thing is to have a long-term forecast about the market, and right now it's total uncertainty. So, we can see that private investments are really on pause everywhere in Canada.”

Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, also a Democrat, added that the uncertainty in Washington “is a problem, and it shouldn't be a problem.”

Meanwhile, Official Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre challenged Mr. Carney to bring home results from his meeting with Mr. Trump.

In an open letter to Mr. Carney released Monday, Mr. Poilievre remarked that former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper struck a truce in the long-running Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute within 80 days of taking office.

“If you only return with excuses, broken promises and photo ops, you will have failed our workers, our businesses and our country,” the Conservative leader wrote.

“Get the tariffs off Canadian softwood lumber,” he continued, noting that softwood levies have “more than doubled since you took office. Time for the promised win for suffering lumber workers, mills and towns.”

Mr. Poilievre urged Mr. Carney to persuade Mr. Trump to remove U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and autos.

“Time for your promised win to reverse the damage.”

Israeli authorities said on Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

Israel's Foreign Ministry posted on X that “the deportees were citizens of Greece, Italy, France, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Denmark, Slovakia, Switzerland, Norway, the U.K., Serbia, and the United States.” The post included photos of Thunberg and other activists wearing white T-shirts and grey sweatpants.

Thunberg was among dozens of deportees to land in Athens, Greece, on Monday afternoon. Crowds of supporters gathered at the Eleftherios Venizelos international airport and chanted “Free free Palestine!” as activists disembarked.

“That this mission has to exist, it's a shame! It is a shame!” Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly after arriving. “I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story,” she added.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their “complicity” with the “genocide” being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.

“This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,” Thunberg said. “We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza.”

Ottawa says Israel will release three Canadians it detained for attempting to reach the Gaza Strip through the Mediterranean Sea.

Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand wrote on the platform X today that “Canada is aware of three Canadians who were detained off the coast of Israel.”

She says Global Affairs Canada has offered consular assistance and “all three are in the process of being released.”

Her department said Sunday that Canada was aware of two detained citizens and had asked Israel to release them.

The group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East says another six Canadians are set to reach the region by mid-week.

Hundreds of thousands protest across Europe in support of Palestinians

The interception of the flotilla led to large-scale demonstrations in cities across the world.

Israeli authorities again rejected mistreatment accusations that have emerged in interviews with activists who were deported to Turkey, Spain and Italy over the weekend. Israel's government has also vehemently denied claims that its offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide, despite a growing number of experts denouncing it as such.

Lubna Tuma, a lawyer with the Adalah association representing more than 470 Global Sumud Flotilla participants who were detained last week as they attempted to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, said 150 people were still held in Israel's Ktziot prison, including Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela. Forty of them were on hunger strike, including many Tunisians.

“Some stated that they prefer that their food go to the people in Gaza,” Tuma said during a briefing on Monday that was broadcast on Adalah's and the flotilla's Instagram accounts. Others were also refusing to drink water “until medical treatment is given to all detainees,” she said.

The association's legal team said the remainder of the activists – including those from countries that don't maintain diplomatic relations with Israel – were expected to be deported on Tuesday.

Israeli authorities said Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including Greta Thunberg.

Adalah lawyers have seen most, but not all, of the activists. Tuma said Israeli authorities have repeatedly violated activists' rights. Tuma said it started with their interception in international waters and continued with their transfer to Israel and detention in a maximum-security prison, where Tuma said activists were subject to physical violence and humiliation.

Israeli authorities have strongly rejected the claims, reiterating that the detainees' rights had been respected throughout their detention. Israel's Foreign Ministry accused one activist of biting a female medical staff member.

Several activists have given testimonies alleging mistreatment by Israeli authorities.

“There was some dehumanizing and violence and shouting,” Roos Ykema, a Dutch member of the flotilla who was deported to Madrid on Sunday, told The Associated Press. “But we got the European treatment,” she added.

North African nationals who were detained told the AP they faced harsher treatment than their European counterparts.

“When I showed my Belgian passport their behaviour toward me changed completely,” said Houssem Eddine Rmedi, a dual Tunisian-Belgian citizen.

Others said they weren't so lucky.

“The moment you show your Tunisian, Algerian or Moroccan passport, they start beating you,” said Moroccan activist Ayoub Habraoui, who added that he and others were kept kneeling under the sun for nearly six hours.

South Africa's government said Monday that its citizens would be released and repatriated on Tuesday via Jordan. Several other governments that had citizens taking part in the flotilla have said their embassies in Israel were working closely with Israeli authorities to make sure activists were released and sent home as swiftly as possible.

Israel's blockade of Gaza and its interception of an aid flotilla are both illegal, maritime law expert Douglas Guilfoyle suggested on Thursday.

The Indian Health Ministry said in a statement that test samples of Coldrif cough syrup found a highly toxic industrial solvent. At least nine children died allegedly after consuming it.

Three Indian states have banned a cough syrup after at least nine children died allegedly after consuming it, authorities said.

The Indian Health Ministry said in a statement that test samples of Coldrif cough syrup, made by Sresan Pharma in Tamil Nadu in southern India, contained diethylene glycol (DEG).

DEG is an industrial solvent that is highly toxic if ingested even in small amounts.

""The samples are found to contain DEG beyond the permissible limit,"" the ministry statement said.

""The sale of this syrup has been banned throughout Madhya Pradesh,"" said Mohan Yadav, the chief minister of the central Indian state, where most of the deaths occurred.

Yadav added that the sale of other Sresan Pharma products is also being banned.

Tamil Nadu and its neighboring state Kerala have also banned sales, according to local media.

Meanwhile, according to The Hindu, the southern state of Telangana issued a public alert regarding Coldrif cough syrup.

The incident has renewed scrutiny of India's pharmaceutical industry.

In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) linked cough syrups made by another Indian company to the deaths of 70 children in The Gambia.

New Delhi had disputed the WHO findings.

A year later, the WHO again warned against two cough medicines made in India after Uzbekistan linked the syrup to the deaths of at least 18 children.

A fifth global warning against India-made medication in a 10-month span was issued after medicines contaminated with toxins were found in Iraq.

India provides 20% of the world's supply of generic medicines, according to a Press Information Bureau (PIB) statement in May.

These are cheaper versions of drugs produced once patents expire.

Its pharmaceutical industry ranks third in the world by volume, the Indian government agency added.

In 2011, a study published by the Indian Journal of Pharmacology found that while generic drugs were five to six times cheaper than their branded equivalents, there was no significant difference in quality.

Kyiv says long-range drones have struck deep inside Russia, hitting several targets hundreds of miles from Ukraine. Meanwhile, a perinatal center in Sumy caught fire after a Russian drone strike. Follow DW for more.

Ukraine has said its long-range drones struck a major ammunition plant, an oil terminal, and a weapons depot deep inside Russian territory.

Kyiv's military reported hitting the Sverdlov plant in Nizhny Novgorod, sparking explosions and a fire, along with targets in Crimea and other areas near the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.

Russia said it shot down 251 drones in one of the biggest barrages of the war, while Ukraine steps up efforts to cripple Moscow's supply lines.

In Ukraine itself, the roof of a perinatal center in the north-eastern city of Sumy caught fire after it was targeted by a drone. Staff and patients had retreated to a shelter and there were no casualties.

Here is a roundup of events from Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, October 6.

 

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that its team at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant heard multiple rounds of incoming and outgoing shelling near the site on Monday.

IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a post by the agency on X that the shelling ""adds to nuclear safety risks at ZNPP,"" noting the plant has been without off-site power for nearly two weeks.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against Germany, saying Moscow's campaign extends beyond Ukraine to target all of Europe.

""He is waging an information war against us. He is waging a military war against Ukraine and this war is directed against all of us,"" Merz told broadcaster NTV on Monday. He said Putin aims to undermine Europe's political order and that supporting Ukraine is in Germany's interest to defend open, liberal societies.

Asked whether Putin was waging war on Germany, Merz replied: ""He is waging a hybrid war against us."" He linked recent drone incidents across Europe to Russian intimidation efforts, saying, ""We will not be intimidated and we will defend ourselves effectively.""

Merz said he is considering speaking directly with Putin but noted that ""every attempt to talk to him at the moment is ending in even tougher attacks on Ukraine."" He added that he had a heated exchange with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at last week's EU meeting in Copenhagen after Orban accused Germany of avoiding negotiations.

Merz said he reminded Orban that Putin responded to his own visits to Kyiv and Moscow last year by bombing a children's hospital in Kyiv.

Russian weapons used in attacks on Ukraine continue to include large numbers of foreign-made components despite sanctions, President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.

Posting Monday on X, Zelensky said that during the combined strike on October 5, Russia used 549 weapon systems containing 102,785 parts from companies in the United States, China, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, South Korea, and the Netherlands.

He said Ukraine had shared detailed information with partner governments and that every sanction loophole must be closed.

""It is crucial to shut down every scheme that circumvents sanctions, because Russia uses each one to keep killing. The world has the power to stop this,"" Zelenskyy said.

At least five people died in Sunday's attacks, which targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Strikes have continued into Monday, with a fire breaking out on the roof of a perinatal center in Sumy, according to presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak. All 11 infants, 35 patients, and 120 staff reached a shelter safely.

In Kherson, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said a 69-year-old woman was killed and 12 people were injured, including two minors. Ukraine has been defending against Russia's full-scale invasion since February 2022.

Ukraine said its long-range drones have struck a major Russian ammunition plant, an oil terminal, and a weapons depot behind the front line, escalating pressure on Moscow's military supply network.

The Ukrainian General Staff said Monday that overnight strikes hit the Sverdlov ammunition plant in the Nizhny Novgorod region, some 750 kilometers (about 470 kilometers) from the border with Ukraine. Kyiv said the attack triggered multiple explosions and a fire at the plant, which is said to make aviation and artillery ordnance, aerial bombs, and anti-aircraft and anti-tank munitions.

""The plant is one of the largest Russian producers of explosives. It is capable of equipping practically all types of ammunition,"" the General Staff said in a statement.

Ukrainian drones also hit an oil terminal in occupied Crimea, starting a blaze, and an ammunition depot of Russia's 18th Combined Arms Army, the General Staff said.

Russian officials reported one of the largest Ukrainian drone barrages since the full-scale invasion began, saying 251 drones were shot down across 14 regions, Crimea, and areas near the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.

Nizhny Novgorod Governor Gleb Nikitin said air defenses intercepted 20 drones targeting an industrial zone that includes the ammunition plant and that no facilities were damaged.

Ukraine's long-range attacks on refineries and oil sites have previously led to fuel shortages in Russia. Kyiv has been expanding its domestic weapons production, particularly drones, in an effort to strike deeper into Russian territory and disrupt President Vladimir Putin's war logistics.

A Russian strike has set the roof of a perinatal center ablaze in the northeastern city of Sumy, according to presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak.

He said 11 infants, 35 patients, and 120 staff members were inside the facility at the time of the attack but all managed to reach a shelter safely. Shelling has continued in the area, Yermak said.

Meanwhile, a 69-year-old woman has died in a Russian strike on the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin has said.

He said 12 people have been injured, including two minors.

			Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend can now only be freed if granted a presidential pardon

Ghislaine Maxwell has vowed to fight on after her appeal to overturn her sex trafficking conviction was rejected by the US Supreme Court.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence in a minimum security prison in Texas for trafficking underage women to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.

On Monday, Supreme Court judges rejected Maxwell's appeal. They did not give a reason for refusing to hear her case, as is customary.

In theory, the decision by the US' highest court of appeal means her only hope of an early release is through a pardon by Donald Trump, the US president.

However, Maxwell's family denied they had run out of legal road and said the disgraced socialite had been preparing a “Habeas petition”, which is used to challenge the lawfulness of an individual's detention.

“This fight isn't over,” David Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said.

“Serious legal and factual issues remain and we will continue to pursue every avenue available to ensure that justice is done.”

Maxwell has “been engaged for many months in preparing – and will shortly file – a Habeas petition” in the Southern District of New York, where she was convicted of sex trafficking in 2022, her family said in a statement.

Among their claims are that the 63-year-old was deprived of an impartial jury, seemingly referring to the fact that a juror failed to disclose a childhood history of sexual abuse in a pre-trial questionnaire.

However, they conceded the decision by the Supreme Court was “disappointing”.

In July, Mr Markus said: “We are appealing not only to the Supreme Court but to the president himself to recognise how profoundly unjust it is to scapegoat Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein's crimes, especially when the government promised she would not be prosecuted.”

Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify before Congress in July, but her deposition was delayed because she insisted she could not speak freely while the Supreme Court weighed her appeal.

Her lawyer said she would plead the Fifth Amendment under questioning if she was not granted immunity for future convictions. He also demanded she be sent the questions in advance.

Congress has so far rejected the conditions.

Maxwell said she would testify freely before Congress if Donald Trump freed her from prison.

Mr Trump, who has faced a backlash from supporters for his own association with Epstein, could look favourably on her if she publicly exonerates him from wrongdoing during committee questioning.

It could even endear the president to pardon her. He has previously refused to rule out granting clemency to the disgraced British socialite in exchange for her testimony.

Asked by a reporter on Monday if he would consider pardoning Maxwell after her appeal was rejected, Mr Trump said he would “take a look at it” and speak to the justice department about her case.

“I haven't heard the name in so long – I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it,” the president said.

He added: “I will speak to the DoJ [department of justice]. I wouldn't consider it or not consider it... a lot of people have asked me for a pardon.”

Mr Trump was friends with Maxwell in the 1990s, when they were both fixtures on New York's social scene, until at least 2004 when he fell out with Epstein, reportedly over a Florida real estate deal.

According to Steven Hoffenberg, a former business associate of Epstein's, the president “liked Epstein” but was “crazy about Maxwell, a very charming lady”.

When asked about Maxwell's sex trafficking prosecution in 2020, Mr Trump responded: “I just wish her well, frankly”, adding that he had met her “numerous times over the years”.

Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer of Mr Trump, met with Maxwell as the US president sought to quell criticism over his government's failure to publish all of the documentation it holds on Epstein.

Maxwell told Mr Blanche that she was not aware of any “client list” belonging to Epstein and never saw Mr Trump behave inappropriately.

A week after the interview, Maxwell was moved from a low-security prison facility in Florida to a less-restrictive prison camp in Texas.

Inmates at minimum security institutions, also known as federal prison camps, benefit from a low prison guard-to-inmate ratio and limited to no perimeter fencing.

Maxwell's transfer to the prison, just a week after she was interviewed by Mr Blanche, was condemned by her victims.

The US Justice Department closed the case on Epstein earlier this year, ruling there was “no incriminating client list” or any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people.

Maxwell's lawyers argue that her conviction is invalid, saying a plea agreement made with Epstein in Florida in 2007, which shields his associates, should have barred her criminal prosecution in New York.

That agreement stated that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”.

Maxwell's lawyers said that in its reference to co-conspirators, the agreement placed no geographic limit on where the non-prosecution commitment could be enforced.

Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted the following year after being accused of recruiting and grooming girls for sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.

The Epstein case has long been the subject of conspiracy theories, with many believing the disgraced financier sex trafficked underage women to a circle of high-profile associates.

Conspiracy theorists think the financier, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was murdered to stop his so-called “client list” from becoming public.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, said in congressional testimony on Sept 16 that there was no credible information that Epstein trafficked women and underage girls to anyone but himself.

Maxwell failed to convince a trial judge and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out her conviction based on the 2007 non-prosecution agreement.

The Israeli army has declared a temporary pause in its military operation “Gideon's Chariots 2,” which had primarily focused on occupying Gaza City. This decision came after the Israeli political leadership recommended scaling down offensive operations and restricting them to defensive measures in an attempt to create a suitable atmosphere for negotiations — particularly following Hamas's positive response to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal regarding Gaza.

In the past days, Israeli forces had expanded military operations in the city, encircling it completely from all sides and seizing control of entire neighborhoods in the heart of Gaza City, such as Sheikh Radwan, Sabra, and Tal al-Hawa. They relied on a scorched-earth policy, using intensive artillery, aerial, and naval bombardments, in addition to deploying old armored personnel carriers loaded with tons of explosives used to demolish entire residential neighborhoods and clear the way for ground forces.

The Israeli military operation displaced more than 600,000 of the city's residents and carried out systematic destruction that Gaza City had not witnessed since October 2023.

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

Before the war began, Gaza City had always been the most vibrant and prosperous area in the Gaza Strip. Known as the beating heart of the Strip and an inseparable part of it, the city had long been celebrated for its picturesque streets, green gardens, and remarkable historical landmarks, as well as for hosting several universities and distinguished educational institutions.

The destruction of Gaza City and displacement of its residents once again is deliberate and highly calculated. Israel fully understands how precious Gaza City is to the Palestinian people and how much they have already suffered living without it during 16 months of forced displacement in the south.

Most of Gaza City's residents are refugees who were forced to abandon their lands under the threat of massacres carried out by Zionist militias in 1948. Among them were my grandparents, displaced from the small village of Beit Daras, only 32 kilometers from Gaza City. For my grandparents and thousands of other refugees, Gaza City became the nearest refuge from the horrors they had experienced at the hands of the Zionist forces that attacked their villages. They thought they would remain in the city only for a short time and then be allowed to return to their homelands. However, days turned into years, and that glimmer of hope began to vanish. This pushed them to rebuild their lives in Gaza City, which they came to consider their second home.

Our grandparents' love and attachment to Gaza City were passed down through generations to us. We loved it as if it were our original homeland — the place that holds our memories and everything we hold dear in life. We believed we would live happily in Gaza City forever, never imagining that the Israelis would displace us from it, just as they did to our grandparents in 1948.

Leaving the city for the second time and heading south — the area that Israeli forces claim to be “safe” — was an agonizing decision for Gazans. We knew all too well that remaining in the city was impossible, as Israeli forces were carrying out a systematic plan of gradual occupation and “cleansing” of Gaza City's neighborhoods, killing anyone who refused to leave. At the same time, we also knew that life in tents — stripped of the most basic necessities and overshadowed by the uncertainty of whether we would ever return home — was simply another form of death.

Most Gazans believe that this displacement is the worst thing that has happened to them since the beginning of the war, as Israeli forces have used new and more aggressive methods to expel us — such as detonating explosives-laden robots in residential neighborhoods and using quadcopters to plant landmines on the roofs of homes to demolish them. Added to this are the heavy financial burdens we have never faced in any of our previous displacements: a single tent costs $1,000; renting a piece of land to set it up costs $200; hiring a truck to transport belongings can reach $1,000 due to soaring fuel prices and vehicle maintenance costs; and building a makeshift bathroom can cost $300.

The idea of paying such staggering amounts to leave your beloved home and live in a tent in exile reflects the depth of the oppression and pain we endure — as if our lives are meaningless, as if we are no longer seen as human beings with the right to live with dignity.

The despair we are living through keeps us clinging to the news, scanning for any headlines containing the word “ceasefire.” Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza and the Hamas-Israel agreement have become the only things that help us endure the hell of life in tents in the south. We hope that this time the war will truly end forever, that our stay in the south will not last too long like the last time, and that we will be able to return to our homes and live normally — free from bombardment, starvation, and daily killing — like anyone else in the world deserves.

Solaf Saim, 44, who was forced to leave her home in Gaza City and now lives in a tent in Deir al-Balah, said, “Leaving my home was like taking my soul away from my body. I never imagined such a horrible scenario.” Saim mentioned that she and her children are eagerly waiting for the announcement of a possible ceasefire so they can return to Gaza City, even though their home may be destroyed. “Just end the war and return me to my neighborhood. If my home is destroyed, I will set up a tent over its rubble, and I will be happy just because I am in the place I belong, surrounded by neighbors. I cannot live in the south. I do not know anyone there. The area is overcrowded, my tent is full of flies and insects, and I cannot stay inside it because of the heat of the sun. I am dying slowly here.”

Shorok Akilah, 30, said she had been determined not to leave the city, unwilling to relive the horrific experience of spending 16 months in a small tent in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis. However, she changed her mind: “The bombardment in my neighborhood intensified, and quadcopters began dropping bombs randomly near my home. Most of my neighbors had already fled south. My children were terrified and constantly crying. I could no longer endure it. I was forced to leave to protect my children — I couldn't let them die.”

She continued, “Gaza City is part of my heart. I cannot imagine living without it. My only wish is to return and never leave again. I hope Trump's plan will truly end the war because we are exhausted. This war has destroyed us in every way and taken us back to the days of the Nakba. Enough is enough.”

Last year, the Biden administration paused the contract with Paragon Solutions, which operates Graphite, while it conducted a review to ensure it complied with an executive order issued in 2023 which limits the government's use of spyware. In August, the Trump administration lifted the stop work order, news that was first reported by All-Source Intelligence.

The letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was signed by Democratic Reps. Summer Lee (Pennsylvania), Shontel Brown (Ohio), and Yassamin Ansari (Arizona).

The lawmakers asked Noem to provide information on the government's use of surveillance technology by October 14, including “a comprehensive list of data surveillance targets and ICE's strategy for deploying spyware or mass data surveillance within the United States.”

The lawmakers warned that allowing ICE to use to spyware “threatens Americans' freedom of movement and freedom of speech.” 

“Given the Trump Administration's disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE's repeated attacks on the rule of law,” they wrote. 

Paragon was founded in 2019 by former Israeli military intelligence officers who worked in the Israeli military's Unit 8200. Last year, the Florida-based private equity firm, AE Industrial Partners, bought Paragon.

Recently, Microsoft blocked Unit 8200's access to its cloud software after an investigation published in The Guardian revealed that the unit was using the cloud to store information on Palestinians — information that was then used to plan deadly attacks on Gaza. 

Paragon has been repeatedly accused of violating people's human rights. Earlier this year, the company was embroiled in a scandal after investigations revealed that the software had been used to spy on activists and journalists in Europe.

“There's no link to click, attachment to download, file to open or mistake to make,” John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, told the Associated Press of Graphite. “One moment the phone is yours, and the next minute its data is streaming to an attacker,” he said.

Researchers with The Citizen Lab, based at the University of Toronto, conducted a forensic analysis of two reporters' phones — “a prominent European journalist” who asked to remain anonymous, and Italian journalist Ciro Pellegrino. Both journalists' phones were targeted with Graphite, according to the researchers' report released in June.  

Amnesty International says Graphite “can never be human rights compliant and should be banned.”

“Paragon's Graphite spyware product is a form of highly invasive spyware capable of covertly accessing the most intimate and sensitive data on an individual's phone, and cannot be independently audited,” the group said in March.

The letter to Noem comes as the Trump administration has targeted anyone it perceives as an enemy, including pro-Palestine activists, anti-ICE protesters, and Democratic elected officials. On Friday, the administration deported award-winning journalist Mario Guevara for livestreaming law enforcement activities, which is protected by the First Amendment.

In comments to Truthout on Monday, Lee said that she will “not allow ICE to operate in the shadows.”

“Once that kind of surveillance is allowed, it rarely stays limited to whatever the government claims it is for,” she said. “History shows what happens when governments are given this kind of unchecked access. It leads to intimidation, to silence, to control. And too often, it is immigrants, organizers, and people speaking out for justice who feel it first. Our responsibility is to protect civil liberties, not surrender them.”

Project 2025 architect Russell Vought wants to seize the shutdown to further slash spending with mass federal layoffs.

As crucial services grind to a halt and federal workers go without pay, Donald Trump is using the ongoing government shutdown to do what he does best: grab more power.

Last week, as the shutdown loomed, Trump gloated that his administration would use it as an excuse to shutter “Democrat agencies,” whatever that means. It was, the MAGA leader said, an “unprecedented opportunity” that had been gifted to him by “Radical Left Democrats.” Meanwhile, Russell Vought, an intellectual architect of Project 2025 and the current head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made it clear that the shutdown was an opportunity to simply axe congressionally approved spending mandates, especially if they involved money that disproportionately flowed to blue states. In a memo sent out to all government departments in the days leading up to the shutdown, Vought's OMB ordered agencies come up with reduction in force plans for projects, programs, and activities that aren't “consistent with the President's priorities.” With that directive, the OMB furthered the mission of its head, long a supporter of an unbound presidency, to free up Trump to ignore Congress at his pleasure. 

The administration then proceeded to pull $8 billion in clean energy grants from 16 blue states and suspend payments on $18 billion for federal transport infrastructure projects in the New York region. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also announced it would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of FEMA disaster-preparedness grants from states until they recalculated their populations to reflect the recent mass deportations undertaken by the administration — a naked ploy to revise downwards the populations of large Democratic states such as California, New York, and Illinois — in a likely effort to reduce the number of congressional representatives that they are allotted.

By Friday, as the Senate voted on (and failed to pass) several bills to fund the government, the administration let it be known, through a series of announcements from White House spokespeople and surrogates appearing on right-wing media outlets, that it would soon begin implementing plans to permanently fire thousands of additional federal workers. Ever-pliant House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Trump's egregious overreach, arguing that with the shutdown, Senate Democrats had handed “the keys to the kingdom to the president.” While the White House again talked about eviscerating agencies that “don't align with the administration's values,” Johnson blamed Democrats for the failure to pass a funding bill and said that they “have now effectively turned off the legislative branch … and they've turned it over to the executive,” arguing that mass firings are within Trump's authority.

Those mass firings have largely not happened yet. On October 1, the first full day of the shutdown, Federal News Network reported that only the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had followed through on the demand to reduce its capacity, firing 1 percent of its workers in order to “focus on mission-critical operations.” In the days since, no additional mass firings have taken place. But the White House has stressed that thousands of other jobs could be on the chopping block. Given Trump's desire to shrink the federal workforce and to kill off programs and agencies and entire departments that he doesn't like, the shutdown seems simply a convenient excuse to implement harsh cuts the administration would likely have embarked upon anyway in the coming months.

That they hadn't begun the chopping by this past weekend seemingly reflects internal divisions in the GOP ranks, with many GOP congressmembers and senators deeply uncomfortable with the sort of across-the-board government reductions that Vought has been championing. But the longer the shutdown continues, and the more that Trump believes he can frame the cuts as being caused by Democratic intransigence during the budget fight, the more the administration could lean into Vought's take-no-prisoners strategy. In fact, over the weekend Trump began framing potential firings as “Democrat layoffs.”

The list of agencies where most employees have already been furloughed, compared to the list of services deemed “essential” and of “national security” value, may offer clues about where the Trump administration wants to target its culling efforts in the weeks to come. There's nothing inevitable about how these lists are populated: In a shutdown, the administration ultimately has tremendous discretion as to which employees and agencies it considers “essential” and can mandate to work through the shutdown, and which it views as disposable and can send home.

Turns out — no surprise — that this administration values its hard power federal employees: those whose jobs involve coercion, incarceration, and security. The rest, as they have repeatedly stressed, can be put “in trauma,” in Vought's unpleasant-but-honest phrasing, or at least made to feel perennially vulnerable.

Ahead of the shutdown, the administration laid out plans to furlough only about one-quarter of the federal workforce, people who would be sent home during the shutdown and wouldn't be expected to return to work until the government reopened. This represents a lower percentage than in previous shutdowns. The majority of federal employees would still be expected to show up at their jobs, and to work without pay for the duration of the shutdown. Demanding those employees work without paychecks, while simultaneously hanging over the federal workforce the Damocletian sword of potential mass firings, seems like a strategy designed to make employees feel perennially insecure. It makes it harder for them to protest being asked to work without pay or being furloughed from an agency deemed non-critical to the national well-being, since it presents an even more unpalatable alternative: If you don't like it, the argument goes, we can always simply fire you instead. It's somewhat akin to a theory of foreign policy associated with Richard Nixon, who believed that adversaries were more likely to comply if they feared him lashing out unpredictably.

The vast majority of employees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Labor Department, the Education Department, and other soft-power agencies have been placed on leave for the duration of the shutdown. The shutdown offered the Trump administration a convenient workaround for a recent court order to keep Voice of America functioning and to stop the firing of 500 employees. National Parks have been closed to visitors. At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), offices working on climate change issues have gone dark, while divisions reconfigured to work on rolling back climate change regulations remain open for business. Meanwhile, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, immigration courts, and the rest of the deportation-machine agencies are humming along as if it's still September 2025; only 5 percent of Homeland Security personnel are being furloughed, compared to 89 percent at the EPA and 87 percent at the beleaguered Department of Education. Meanwhile, ICE has announced that because of the huge influx of cash it received under the recent Budget Reconciliation Act, it will have no problems continuing operations through the shutdown.

Making all of this worse, many furloughed workers report that, without their knowledge, their emails began sending out automatic replies blaming Democrats for the shutdown and for the fact they aren't at their computers and able to respond to the public's questions. Government agency websites have subjected visitors to similar messages. Open up the Housing Department's website, and you are greeted with the following message, which flashes up first in blue, with a red banner across the entire page: “The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.” Click onto the Department of Agriculture website, and you can read “Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

All of this naked propaganda is a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the civil service from being used for partisan purposes. Yet, the longer the shutdown continues, the more one can expect this lawless administration to ratchet up the political stunts, using every tool in its arsenal to frame the message that it has the interests of the American people at heart while Democrats hold the country hostage to an “extremist” agenda. If the administration does ultimately start firing thousands of federal employees, expect that vindictive measure, too, to be pitched as simply being an unfortunate but necessary response to the “Radical Left's” efforts to shutter basic government services.

This despite the fact that the GOP controls the presidency, both houses of Congress, and is buttressed by a hard-right majority on the Supreme Court; this, too, despite the fact that what Democrats have asked for is for funding to be restored to insurance subsidies so that millions of families can continue to afford to access health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, and that it is GOP intransigence on this fundamental issue that is standing in the way of a vote to fund government.

This is a shutdown the GOP should have to own. Democrats aren't responsible for the furloughing of workers, and they certainly won't be responsible if Trump decides to fire thousands of additional employees in the days to come.

 Beijing's Reluctance to Engage With the U.S. Military Has Never Been More Dangerous

 Kurt M. Campbell

On October 24, 2023, a U.S. Air Force B-52 bomber was flying a nighttime mission in international airspace over the South China Sea when it was intercepted by a Chinese fighter jet. In a series of dangerous high-speed maneuvers, the jet pilot flew within ten feet of the bomber, endangering both aircraft and crews. This came on the heels of a June 2023 incident when the USS Chung-Hoon, a U.S. Navy destroyer, was sailing through the Taiwan Strait and a Chinese warship overtook her on the port side at high speed. The Chinese ship then abruptly tacked and crossed her bow at 150 yards, causing the Chung-Hoon to slow her speed quickly to avoid a collision. The Chinese warship ignored repeated attempts at ship-to-ship communication and violated standard operating procedures for close encounters on the high seas.

These are but two near misses in recent years between the U.S. military and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Although U.S. military strategists and planners are increasingly focused on preparing for intentional Chinese military actions in the Western Pacific, especially regarding Taiwan, these close calls have created substantial anxiety among U.S. analysts that an accident or miscommunication between the U.S. military and the PLA could pull the two countries into a conflict neither one desires.

These concerns are not new. For decades, the United States has tried to place guardrails on its military relationship with China, oftentimes borrowing from the playbook it used to keep U.S.-Soviet relations stable during the Cold War. During the 1990s, when Washington still enjoyed overriding military advantages over Beijing, U.S. strategists focused on reassurance, such as military dialogues and communication protocols. Today, as the Chinese military increases its presence in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea and as U.S.-Chinese tensions simmer from trade to technology, U.S. officials are more focused on confidence-building measures, which aim to create greater predictability in military operations, as well as crisis communications to ensure that a small mishap does not snowball into a full-scale war. “China is the most rapidly growing military, and the most rapidly growing nuclear power, in the world. The U.S. has the biggest military in the world,” U.S. Representative Adam Smith said while visiting Beijing last month. “It is dangerous for us not to be having regular communications about our capabilities and intentions.”

But despite repeated attempts on the part of U.S. officials to improve military-to-military communications, the Chinese side has resisted establishing and codifying even basic rules of the road. Although the reasons for Beijing's ambivalence have evolved, what has remained consistent is a deep skepticism that U.S.-led initiatives will advance China's interests. It will not be easy for Washington to overcome such long-standing suspicions. But now that U.S. and Chinese military capabilities are seen as comparable and the dangers of potential escalation have grown, U.S. officials looking to reengage U.S.-Chinese military diplomacy must understand this deep distrust—and then do what they reasonably can to overcome it.

U.S.-Soviet military diplomacy during the Cold War has long served as a model for successful relations between competing armed forces. Despite being existential nuclear adversaries, the two states developed significant military-to-military contacts during the later part of the Cold War. The 1972 Incidents at Sea Agreement, for example, sought to prevent ship collisions and reduce the risk of accidental escalation at sea. The 1989 Prevention of Dangerous Military Incidents Agreement sought to limit the use of certain weaponry, such as lasers that could potentially blind when aimed recklessly. These agreements were far from panaceas—U.S. and Soviet forces did have numerous dangerous and harrowing encounters—but they played an important role in preempting escalation.

At the beginning of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in the early 1980s, American strategists tried to apply these general models to relations with Beijing's armed forces. At the time, there were modest military contacts and exchanges, such as meetings on military doctrine and general training. But these efforts came to an abrupt halt in 1989, when Washington suspended them in response to Beijing's military crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Relations rebounded slightly in the early 1990s but not enough to account for rising tensions. The two militaries were increasingly operating close to one another, resulting in a series of near clashes, including the October 1994 Yellow Sea incident, when a Chinese submarine and fighter jets patrolled dangerously close to elements of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, including the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk. Around this time, senior Chinese civilian and military officials repeatedly complained to their Washington counterparts that U.S. reconnaissance aircraft were flying precariously close to Chinese airspace. They claimed, not incorrectly, that these flights sought to expose various Chinese air defense systems and operational protocols.

The third Taiwan Strait crisis, which lasted from 1995 to 1996, brought these issues to a head. In response to China's artillery shelling into the waters around Taiwan, the United States deployed two aircraft carriers to the western Pacific as a show of force meant to deter any further provocative military posturing on the part of the PLA. The Chinese, however, interpreted these actions as deeply humiliating and escalatory, creating substantial mistrust between the two militaries.

In Washington, the heightened tensions during the third Taiwan Strait crisis resulted in a bipartisan consensus around the need to establish military-to-military communication protocols with Beijing. But U.S. civilian and military leaders in the Pentagon had other reasons to pursue better relations with their Chinese counterparts, too. The PLA has long had an important bureaucratic role in internal Chinese politics, and as the twenty-first century neared, it had growing global reach. Forging ties with the PLA's leaders was thus not only a way to avert catastrophe but also a way to shape Beijing's thinking and global practices.



U.S. efforts to establish communications reached their high point from 1996 to 1999. In rapid succession, the two sides launched the 1998 Military Maritime Agreement, which sought to prevent dangerous naval interactions, and a special leadership communication channel—a so-called hotline between Washington and Beijing. Both of these initiatives were celebrated at the 1998 summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton. High-level military officials from the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff also began holding talks with their Chinese counterparts to compare military doctrines in an effort to avoid misinterpreting standard military deployments and training as preparation for imminent hostile operations. There were even fleeting exchanges on nuclear-related matters, including safety of nuclear warheads and command and launch protocols.

Still, this engagement went only so far. The two sides had a profound misalignment on the ultimate uses and value of these communication mechanisms. China was particularly reticent to make its military too accessible given the clear imbalance in military power. After the Cold War, U.S. submarines and reconnaissance flights conducted missions close to the Chinese mainland, including in the South China Sea, with greater frequency and relative impunity. China was overwhelmingly focused on closing this gap in capabilities and deployment patterns, and its military strategists viewed U.S. efforts at confidence building as insincere, designed by calculating U.S. military interlocutors not to prevent unintended escalation or conflict but to constrain or monitor China. In this view, formal confidence-building mechanisms could be used to Washington's advantage not only in an immediate crisis but also in the longer term, by giving the United States channels through which to prevent the PLA's ambitious buildup.

Chinese officials still maintained some ties to the U.S. military, which they sought to use for their own ends, such as limiting U.S. deployments and reconnaissance efforts in territory immediately adjacent to the Chinese mainland. But Beijing took pains to keep military exchanges and commitments vague, carefully scripted, and largely pro forma. Instead of instilling confidence, they worked to create anxiety and uncertainty in the minds of U.S. operators. This became all too clear in 2001, when a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3 surveillance plane in the South China Sea. When the U.S. plane and the 24 military service members aboard were forced to land on Hainan Island, which is home to a Chinese military base, U.S. officials tried to use the high-level communication protocols but were met with silence and stonewalling from their Beijing counterparts. Phones rang unanswered as the Americans were detained for 48 hours of interrogations at a military facility. (They were subsequently held for 11 days before being released.)

In the decades since, U.S. anxiety over China's military modernization and activity has only increased. Yet if anything, Beijing has become even less forthcoming. The United States has tried repeatedly to create mechanisms to prevent, manage, or curtail mishaps in a number of military domains—from cyberspace to outer space. But these efforts have invariably been met with misdirection or outright rejection by the Chinese. When U.S.-Chinese security-related dialogues have been launched, they have failed to live up to even limited expectations, such as when the Obama administration's cyber dialogue failed to limit Chinese hacking. What's more, these interactions have often spurred further suspicion and distrust rather than built confidence. For instance, when U.S. Army hosts took Chinese counterparts to observe armor training at Fort Hood in Texas, the visiting Chinese officer subsequently described the briefing and demonstrations as threatening and designed to intimidate.

China's reticence is driven by its deep suspicions. But it manifests in several ways. Beijing, for instance, persistently fears that bilateral agreements with Washington would codify China's inferior military status in perpetuity. From this perspective, a U.S.-Chinese code of conduct for military encounters gives the United States a get-out-of-jail-free card, allowing it to continue its freedom of navigation operations in the region because it can manage risk and extricate itself from a crisis. The belief that confidence-building measures are asymmetrically beneficial—that Washington gains more from transparency than Beijing does—is stubbornly persistent across China's armed forces.

Historically, China has also been reluctant to participate in confidence-building exercises precisely because they were modeled after the U.S.-Soviet experience. This had less to do with whether these mechanisms were operationally effective and more to do with how they would be perceived: Chinese strategists astutely sought to avoid giving the impression that the United States should view China as a Soviet-like military adversary. This is consistent with broader Chinese messaging during the early 2000s that sought to downplay talk of China's “rise” and instead focus on China's national “development.”



To some extent, that has changed: Beijing now wants to be seen as something of a superpower. But unlike the Soviet Union before it, China does not appear worried about the escalation risks that come from having poor ties with the U.S. armed forces. If anything, Beijing seems to see it as a benefit. While Washington generally opts to telegraph its military acumen, in the hope that its strength gives its adversaries pause, Beijing largely elects to foster uncertainty in its deployments, diplomacy, and doctrine—hoping that it increases U.S. forces' anxiety about operating in proximity. This strategy is largely political. Although some Chinese analysts and even some PLA officers have advocated for greater transparency between U.S. and Chinese forces, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have a preference for opacity about the PLA's present capabilities and crisis protocols. Ultimately, they believe ambiguity maximizes their flexibility in a crisis and increases deterrence.

And what the CCP says goes: the PLA is the armed wing of the party, not merely China's armed forces. The CCP-dominated military structure jealously guards decision-making authority in a crisis and views confidence-building schemes as a potential threat to party control and authority. Almost by design, military diplomacy would interfere with the CCP's control in a military scenario—precisely when control is most important to China's leaders.

It is possible that senior Chinese leaders are downplaying or even dismissing the risk of inadvertent war. The United States and China, after all, have not experienced serious military tensions since the latter years of the Korean War. And it may take such tensions before Chinese leaders change their minds, just as it took the 1962 Cuban missile crisis before Moscow and Washington set up clear military-to-military ties.

But the United States should keep pushing to create robust channels of crisis communications before an emergency occurs. Its efforts may ultimately fall short. Yet with enormous military firepower potentially arrayed against one another, the two great powers of the twenty-first century must have the foresight to create such channels without first subjecting the world to a Cuban missile–type crisis in the Indo-Pacific.

YAIR LAPID is the leader of the opposition in Israel's Knesset and served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Israel in 2022.

 After Two Years of Growing Isolation and Endless War, an Alternative Future Is Possible

 Yair Lapid

Two years after the worst attack on Israel in its history, the country stands at a crossroads. Israel is not a failed state. It is a great state with a failed government. Its foundations remain strong. Israel is undeniably in crisis, but the source of the crisis is not structural. It is political. In many ways, that makes the crisis more dangerous, but that also makes it easier to resolve. The solution comes from replacing the top rather than rebuilding from the bottom.

Consider the situation just three years ago, before the current government came to power. This was before it undertook the judicial overhaul that sought to dismantle Israel's democratic foundations and before Hamas's butchery on October 7, 2023. Then, Israel was known for its innovative tech-driven economy, its strong and vibrant democracy, and its resolutely independent judicial system. It was a country with more Nobel Prize winners than all 22 Arab countries put together; diplomatic and economic agreements spanning the globe from Washington to Abu Dhabi; durable peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan; extensive scientific and commercial collaborations with Europe; Oscar nominees; and Eurovision winners. Israel was a country that blended a profound philosophical and historical depth with the best of modernity. Back then, our enemies sought to kill us—they were just unsuccessful. Then, too, there were anti-Semites, but nobody listened to them. Then, too, Israel had its share of extremists, but they didn't lead the country.

The crisis is the result of an extremist and failed government, led by a prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is implicated in criminal cases and has lost the support of the Israeli public. His years in power have corrupted him and those around him. This government is openly contemptuous of the principle of a democratic State of Israel committed to Western liberal values. In its place, it seeks to install a theocratic and illiberal regime, one that is exempt from media scrutiny and free of the nuisance of concepts such as the rule of law and the constant threat of free and fair elections.

Now, with U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for the end of the war in Gaza and elections that must take place in the next 12 months, Israel has a chance to reinvent itself. Bringing the country back from the brink requires, first and foremost, getting the hostages home, but it also requires getting the extremists out of power. At stake is the future of Israel itself.

Nothing better encapsulates the disconnect between Israel's government and its people than the October 7 disaster. Panicked and paralyzed, the government failed to deal with both the security situation and the subsequent domestic repercussions: addressing the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Israelis, both from towns around Gaza and along the northern border with Lebanon, which was under continual assault by Hezbollah; undertaking the dramatic rebuilding that is still required in southern and northern Israel; and crucially, healing a traumatized nation. Israelis talk of the failures not only of October 7 but of October 8, as well.

By contrast, Israeli civil society quickly mobilized and rushed to fill the vacuum. Within a day, the Israeli tech industry took command of the situation, supporting victims and using its world-renowned creativity to prevent economic collapse. Reserve soldiers turned out in record numbers, and young Israelis took to social media to explain to the world what Hamas is and why the terrorist group attacked us. The opposition I lead stepped up to support the political and organizational effort, and the Jewish people in the diaspora stood by Israel's side in the struggle to bring the hostages back home. Where the government demonstrated contemptible weakness in its disarray and failure to marshal government resources, the Israeli public showed resilience, grit, and the determination to do what was needed.



Two years later, Israel is at a turning point. There is a real risk of international sanctions, a brain drain, and endless war. But Israel also has the opportunity to reinvent itself and build on its solid foundations. It is one of the only countries in the world that was founded as a democracy, and that democratic spirit runs deep through the majority of its citizens. The Israeli people will not relinquish the country's unique identity as a Jewish and democratic state without a fight. Israel's judicial institutions remain strong; its military and security services understand their role is to serve the state, not the government; and its economy remains a remarkable success story—even now. Although all these crucial institutions are being willfully degraded by the government, Israel is not yet at the point of no return. Israelis will have the opportunity to change the trajectory—and all it will take is one piece of paper in one ballot box on election day. “Jewish faith,” wrote Jonathan Sacks, the late chief rabbi of the United Kingdom and one of the foremost thinkers and philosophers in modern Jewish history, “is written in the future tense.”

None of that takes away from the depths of the national and international crisis in which Israel finds itself. October 7 exposed some ugly cracks. In the two years since then, the gap between the government and the people has only grown. The country is more polarized and divided than ever, a situation exacerbated by the government continuously ignoring the will of the people and dragging on a war that no longer serves Israel's national security interests. Israel's international standing has never been worse. At the United Nations in September, 142 countries voted for the establishment of a Palestinian state and only ten voted against. 

The world has turned on Israel. The Abraham Accords are at risk of being frozen or reversed. Israel has lost its long-standing bipartisan support in Washington. The cries of “from the river to the sea” on college campuses are an open call for the genocidal destruction of the Jewish state. When students at Columbia University and the University of Tehran scream the same slogans, Jews are right to be concerned.

Misguided statements by the government's extremist ministers are at the top of news broadcasts around the world, and Netanyahu and those around him react by accusing anyone who expresses criticism of anti-Semitism. But a victim mentality will not make things better. Not everyone who disagrees with the government is an anti-Semite, and Israel accomplishes nothing by wallowing in its woe. None of this is what Israelis want. Every opinion poll conducted in Israel over the past two years tells the same story: Israeli voters want change. They want leaders who can present a proud and optimistic vision of their country's future, rooted in its existing capabilities. That is the vision Israel should present to the world. Its citizens understand that the government has blundered from one crisis and failure to the next, and they believe there is an alternative.

The alternative is a government led from the center, one that will drive systemic change in national security, foreign relations, the economy, government institutions, and our relationships with our neighbors. The depth of the crisis is precisely the reason Israel is readier than ever to enter the next stage of its life cycle. All it needs is the right leadership acting in pursuit of a clear vision.

The alternative is to end the war in Gaza. Israel must work with Trump, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and a coalition of international partners to implement the 20-point Trump plan—get the hostages back, stop the fighting, and ensure that enough food and medicine enter Gaza to end the humanitarian crisis. Israel must establish a secure perimeter around Gaza from which it can protect its borders against further terrorist attacks. As the plan foresees, instead of being controlled by Hamas, the territory must be placed under the supervision of a transitional authority, which will manage daily life in Gaza and oversee its reconstruction. This coalition would include Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as a civil arm of the Palestinian Authority. If the Trump plan is not implemented, the break in Israeli society will be dramatic and the damage hard to imagine. Israelis need their hostages home; they need the process of rebuilding to begin.

The alternative is also a reworked understanding of Israel's national security doctrine. The October 7 massacre taught Israelis that we cannot afford to let our guard down even for a moment when it comes to murderous Islamist terrorist organizations. But that is not the only lesson. National security rests above all on a strong military, and that requires more than just targeting a nuclear facility at Natanz or launching rockets at central Doha. Security also requires nurturing the regional and global alliances necessary to bolster deterrence, establishing and maintaining strategic depth and international legitimacy, and building a united front against the threat of radical Islam, as well as the hegemonic ambitions of Iran and concerning trends in Turkey.



To do this, Israel should expand the Abraham Accords to include additional countries, including Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. It should take advantage of the opportunities that exist with Lebanon and Syria and strengthen the accords and initiatives that I launched as foreign minister in 2022 through the Negev Forum, which brought Israel together with Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Revitalizing these relationships, however, cannot happen until the war is over and Gaza is put under new leadership.

The alternative is also a far-reaching national investment in artificial intelligence and new energy infrastructure such as small module nuclear reactors, which are the future of energy and will transform the global market as it struggles to meet growing demand. In the coming years, Israel will need to transition from being the “startup nation” to being the “scale-up nation”—leveraging its innovation capabilities to upgrade vital national systems such as education, health care, and transportation. These are fundamental to Israel's future security and prosperity, yet they have been allowed to languish. To bring Israel back to its rightful place among leading Western liberal democracies, the next government will need to invest in fostering the sources of Israel's soft power—its productive middle class and successful tech sector.

The alternative is an Israeli society that addresses the structural problems that have plagued it for three generations, and especially now. A functioning and effective government will require the ultra-Orthodox community to enlist in the army and enter the job market. A functioning and effective government must help boost employment among Arab women, draft a constitution to formalize once and for all the balance of powers between the judicial and executive branches, invest in housing for young people, and tackle the skyrocketing cost of living.

The alternative is for Israelis to remind themselves, and others, that Israel's vaunted status as the only democracy in the Middle East cannot be taken for granted. It is a commitment that the country's leaders must constantly uphold. Israel's greatest ally has always been, and will continue to be, the United States. But to retain its place in the democratic family, Israel must also reset its relations with the European Union, as well as with Australia, Japan, India, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and all the other great democracies of the world. These relationships should be based on shared values and a shared struggle against increasing illiberal and theocratic tendencies around the world and the dangers posed by toxic social media and unhindered populism. That is why Israel should also strengthen its bonds with sympathetic countries that share our vision for the future, such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore.

The alternative may not include a Palestinian state in the first instance—not after what was done to Israelis on October 7. But unlike the current government, most Israelis recognize that the Palestinians exist and that we must one day separate from them. That process will be long and arduous. And it must begin with the Palestinians demonstrating their ability to effectively govern themselves. The burden of proof is now on the Palestinians, not on Israel. They must prove that they can effectively fight terrorism and ensure that an organization such as Hamas cannot seize power again. 

The Palestinian Authority must not only commit to fighting incitement but act; it must not only promise governance reforms but implement them; it must not only pay lip service to tackling corruption but root out its causes. The people of Israel have a right to live in peace and security, without the threat of a failed terror state on their borders. The Palestinians must prove to the Israelis that it is possible before any process can begin. Israel, for its part, must take annexation off the table and fight far more effectively to end the scourge of violence inflicted on Palestinians by extremist Israeli settlers. The former risks sacrificing Israel's regional integration with no strategic benefit; the latter is a moral stain on the country.

Israel's future will be determined neither by its enemies nor by its current government. It will be determined by its citizens. After two of the most traumatic years in our existence, a clear majority of Israelis want a new direction. The world looks at Israel and sees a country in crisis. I look at it and see a country holding its breath. It is waiting for a new leadership to lead it down a different path. Israel's future rests on the political decisions that Israelis will make in the coming year. Should the current government stay in power, Israelis may instead find themselves condemned to international isolation, poverty, and increasing social rifts. If Israelis choose courage over cowardice, openness over isolation, prosperity over religious zealotry, the country's best days will yet lie ahead.

Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Johnson County Republicans in an August meeting that she'll hold town hall meetings “when hell freezes over.”
    


            The Republican, who represents one of the nation's most competitive House districts in southeastern Iowa, has faced questions for months over when she'll hold a public town hall after promising to do so in April.
    


            And in the meeting with the Johnson County Republicans of Iowa — which was later posted on YouTube by the county party, where it went largely unnoticed at the time — she was blunt, saying she's already being hounded over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's massive government funding and policy bill.
    


            “You know, I don't have to hold a town hall so you can come and yell at me,” said Miller-Meeks, who won by 799 votes in 2024 and faces a likely rematch next year with Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan.
    


            “You can yell at me at the county fair — and you did! And you did. They did,” she said. “You know, you yell at me in church, you yell at me at the county fair, I'm out in public all the damn time. Someone yelled at me at the speedway.”
    


            Miller-Meeks added: “You have plenty of opportunities to yell at me and tell me I should be ashamed of myself, and by the way, I am not.”
    


            Miller-Meeks' comments came amid scrutiny over her and many other House Republicans refusing to hold public, in-person town halls. Party leaders, including the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, have advised against town halls after strong opposition to the GOP's spending cuts burst into view at some town halls this spring.
    


Talk about no taxes on tips, less about Medicaid cuts: How GOP is trying to sell Trump's landmark law



            Miller-Meeks pointed to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg criticizing her and other swing district Republicans over their votes for President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
    


            “We took the hard votes on reconciliation. We've been beat to crap over what we did on Medicaid. You know because you all have seen it,” she said.
    


            Miller-Meeks told the Johnson County Republicans that she was being pressed on when she'd hold a town hall by Tom Barton, a politics reporter for The Gazette newspaper in Cedar Rapids. “When hell freezes over,” she said.
    


            Miller-Meeks did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on her August remarks to Johnson County Republicans. But she did defend herself last week, telling the Gazette's Barton, “Every time I walk around Iowa — every meeting that I go to, every rotary I attend, every county fair I go to — I am out in the public. I am out in the open, and I can answer anyone's questions they have,” Miller-Meeks said.
    


            She told Barton that Democrats pressing GOP incumbents to hold town halls just want “other people like-minded to scream and yell at people so they can videotape screaming and yelling at people.”
    


            “And even when we were doing our press conference at the State Fair, people screamed and yelled and videotaped their screaming and yelling,” she told the newspaper. “And then other people had, you know, reasonable questions that they wanted answers to, and we were able to do that. So more than happy to meet with individuals, as I do always when I'm in district.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The White House claims a left-wing judicial ‘insurrection.' But many GOP and Trump nominees are rebuking the president, too","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/politics/republican-federal-judges-trump","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 21:10:54 GMT","


            Around 2 p.m. Saturday, top White House adviser Stephen Miller took to X to warn of a “growing movement of leftwing terrorism” that is “shielded by far-left Democrat judges.”
    


            Mere hours later, President Donald Trump's attempts to use the military on US soil to combat this supposed threat suffered their biggest blow to date.
    


            But it didn't come from a “Democrat judge”; it came from someone Trump himself had nominated in 2018, US District Judge Karin Immergut.
    


            By the end of the weekend, Immergut had ruled against Trump twice. She did so both for the administration's initial attempted National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon, and then again after suggesting it had defied her initial order by attempting to send in California troops. She even floated the idea that Trump was effectively trying to illegally implement “martial law.”
    


            It was a dizzying series of events. But it was an instructive one.
    


            Despite the administration's claims of what Miller has labeled a left-wing “legal insurrection,” the list of judges ruling against the president includes a fast-growing number of Republican- and even Trump-appointed ones.
    


            To date, GOP-appointed judges have ruled against the administration in more than a dozen high-profile cases. And their ranks include at least eight Trump-appointed judges.
    


            They've also often used strong language that suggested Trump and his administration were blatantly violating the law.
    


            The rhetoric around these cases is getting increasingly ugly, with some Trump allies taking Miller's cue and calling for impeaching judges or disregarding their rulings. Elon Musk has even called efforts to thwart Trump's actions “treason.”
    


            But the legal paper trail suggests something else entirely: that Trump is simply trying to do lots of illegal things — so much so that it forces even GOP- and Trump-appointed judges to call that out.
    


            Let's recap the big ones so far.
    


The case: Trump has sought to use the troops to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has faced protests, which the administration has cast as violent.
    


Judge: US District Judge Karin Immergut
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.” Read the filing here.
    


            The administration's action “does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order,” she said.
    


The case: Trump sued the entire federal court bench in Maryland over judges' orders putting a two-day pause on deportations.
    


Judge: US District Court Judge Thomas Cullen
    


Nominated by: Trump (2020)
    


In the judge's words: “This concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.” Read the filing here.
    


The cases: A series of cases has dealt with the administration's attempts to rapidly deport migrants without due process, often by using a centuries-old law called the Alien Enemies Act , which had previously been reserved for wartime. In some instances, this has led to migrants being deported to places they weren't supposed to be sent, like the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III (leading a three-judge panel)
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1984)
    


In the judge's words: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Timothy J. Kelly
    


Nominated by: Trump (2017)
    


In the judge's words: The administration's claims that parents in Guatemala had asked to be reunited with their children “crumbled like a house of cards about a week later. There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr.
    


Nominated by: Trump (2018)
    


In the judge's words: “The Court concludes that the President's invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and, as a result, is unlawful.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “Defendants have provided no evidence, or even any specific allegations, as to how Cristian, or any other Class Member, poses a threat to public safety.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge Leslie H. Southwick (leading a 2-1 panel)
    


Nominated by: George W. Bush (2007)
    


In the judge's words: “A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt or to otherwise harm the United States.” Read the filing here.
    


Judges: Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh (as part of a majority whose size was unclear)
    


Nominated by: Trump (2018)
    


In the court's words: “Notice [for immigrants] roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.” Read the ruling here.
    


The cases: Trump has sought to expand a president's authority to unilaterally levy taxes on imports and use them to negotiate concessions from other countries.
    


Judges: US Court of International Trade Judges Timothy Reif and Jane Restani (as part of a three-judge panel)
    


Nominated by: Reif by Trump (2019), Restani by Reagan (1983)
    


In the judges' words: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act “does not authorize any of the worldwide, retaliatory, or trafficking tariff orders. The worldwide and retaliatory tariff orders exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.” Read the filing here.
    


Judge: US appellate Judge Alan David Lourie (as part of a 7-4 decision)
    


Nominated by: George H.W. Bush (1990)
    


In the panel's words: “We discern no clear congressional authorization by IEEPA for tariffs of the magnitude of the Reciprocal Tariffs and Trafficking Tariffs.” Read the filing here.
    


The case: The White House barred the Associated Press from access to the Oval Office, Mar-a-Lago and Air Force One after the outlet declined to use Trump's preferred name for the Gulf of Mexico, the “Gulf of America.”
    


Judge: US District Judge Trevor N. McFadden
    


Nominated by: Trump (2017)
    


In the judge's words: “Indeed, the Government has been brazen about this.”
    


            “If there is a benign explanation for the Government's decision, it has not been presented here. At the evidentiary hearing, the Government conceded that the record reveals viewpoint-discriminatory motives, so all indicators point to retaliation.”
    


The case: Several academic institutions sued, arguing that the administration has carried out an ideological deportation policy aimed at pro-Palestinian viewpoints that chills the speech of others who would support that cause.
    


Judge: US District Judge William G. Young
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1985)
    


In the judge's words: “The facts prove that the President himself approves truly scandalous and unconstitutional suppression of free speech.”
    


            “The President's palpable misunderstanding that the government simply cannot seek retribution for speech he disdains poses a great threat to Americans' freedom of speech.” Read the filing here.
    


The case: The administration sought to ban race-based considerations in schools and universities as part of its anti-diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
    


Judge: Gallagher
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “The law does not countenance the government's hasty and summary treatment of these significant issues.” Read the filing here.
    


The case: The administration has sought to effectively end birthright citizenship, the long-acknowledged 14th Amendment interpretation that says almost anybody born on US soil is automatically a US citizen.
    


Judge: US District Judge John C. Coughenour
    


Nominated by: Reagan (1981)
    


In the judge's words: “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.”
    


            “It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals. The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain.” Read the judge's comments here.
    


The case: The administration has attempted to claw back $11 billion in congressionally appropriate funding that was earmarked to states for the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


Judge: US District Judge Mary S. McElroy
    


Nominated by: Trump (2019)
    


In the judge's words: “Agencies do not have unfettered power to further a President's agenda.” Read the filing here.
    


The case: The administration sought to severely curtail the activities of the US Agency for Global Media, which oversees the Voice of America and other state-owned media that broadcast around the world.
    


Judge: US District Judge Royce C. Lamberth
    


Nominated by: Ronald Reagan (1987)
    


In the judge's words: “It is hard to fathom a more straightforward display of arbitrary and capricious actions than the Defendants' actions here.” Read the filing here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Virginia Democrats criticize AG candidate Jay Jones for violent texts but aren't demanding he quit race","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/06/politics/jay-jones-texts-virginia-democrats","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:23:47 GMT","


            Top Virginia Democrats have sharply criticized attorney general nominee Jay Jones but are stopping short of calling on him to leave the race after newly revealed text messages showed he suggested that a colleague be shot.
    


            Gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi called Jones' texts inexcusable, as did Virginia's two Democratic senators.
    


            US Sen. Tim Kaine was asked Monday by CNN's Manu Raju if he still supports Jones, who apologized after the texts were revealed. “I do,” Kaine responded.
    


            “The comments are completely indefensible. I've known Jay Jones for 25 years, and those comments are very much out of character for him. So if I put the comments, which are clearly beyond the pale, against knowing this guy for 25 years, I'm still supporting Jay Jones,” he said.
    


            The decision to scold but not abandon Jones speaks to the party's overall desire to beat a prominent state-level incumbent – and, as some Democrats said Monday, a belief that President Donald Trump has changed traditional standards of decorum. Jones is running against Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, whom Trump has backed for reelection.
    


            It also points to political reality. Early voting began in Virginia late last month, and it's too late to remove a name or add a replacement to the physical ballot, Brian Tynes, a spokesman for the state Department of Elections, told CNN in an email.
    


            Republicans seeing GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears trailing Spanberger are hoping to hold onto Miyares' office and energize other campaigns. Miyares announced Monday that his campaign is spending $1.5 million on a pair of ads highlighting Jones' texts and a previous reckless driving charge.
    


            “The Democratic Party has to make this decision,” Miyares said when CNN's Kasie Hunt asked him if Jones should drop out. “Think about this: If somebody was applying to be a line attorney in the attorney general's office or a criminal deputy or even serving in a governor's cabinet, and it turned out these messages came out, they would not be hired.”
    


            In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages first reported by the National Review and obtained by CNN.
    


            “Three people, two bullets. Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot. Gilbert gets two bullets to the head,” the text reads in part, referring to Gilbert and the two dictators.
    


            The National Review reported that Jones tried to call Coyner after she objected to his language. He went on to say in the text messages that Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists” in reference to Gilbert's children, the National Review reported.
    


            Republicans were heavily invested in Miyares before the current news cycle. The incumbent raised $11.2 million for his reelection bid between January 1 and August 31, including $4 million from the Republican Attorney General Association, according to campaign finance data from the Virginia Public Access Project.
    


            Jones raised just $8 million over the same period, including $2.1 million from the committee that backs Democratic attorney general candidates.
    


            A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted September 25-29, before Jones texts were revealed, showed the Democrat leading Miyares by just 6 percentage points, within the margin of error. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 12 points in the same poll.
    


            The Jones text controversy comes as Republicans are attempting to portray Democrats as extremists in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last month.
    


            Democrats have pushed back on that framing, noting the president's own past suggestions of responding to political opponents and protesters with violence.
    


            Virginia state Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, a longtime Jones ally, said she condemns political violence and that both sides need to tone down their rhetoric. But she argued Republican calls for Jones to drop out were hypocritical.
    


            “Donald Trump said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot anybody and still be elected. And guess what? He said it, and he still got elected,” Graves said. “But because I stand behind somebody I've known all his life, there's something wrong with that? He's the Democratic nominee. There was a process.”
    


            And the Virginia Beach Democratic Committee issued a statement saying it was “lined up, ten toes down—ready to organize, mobilize, and deliver voters for Jay and our entire Democratic ticket.”
    


            “Recent press may have spotlighted past mistakes. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized, and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows,” the statement added.
    


            Democrats view the contest as part of a larger effort to push back on controversial Trump policies, arguing that a Democratic attorney general would join colleagues in other states to block Trump policies they deem harmful.
    


            For some Democrats, the possibility of depriving the president of an ally in the state is enough to overcome their revulsion with Jones' comments – at least for now.
    


            Chris Graham, the editor of the Augusta Free Press, a progressive news outlet located in a conservative part of the state, endorsed Jones in the June primary in which the candidate narrowly defeated Henrico Commonwealth's Attorney Shannon Taylor.
    


            Now, he's conflicted. Miyares, Graham said, would be a “rubber stamp” for the president. But he is uncomfortable with Jones, arguing he not only sent the texts but decided to run for office knowing the messages could hurt Democrats' chances of flipping the seat.
    


            Last week Graham wrote a column calling on Jones to drop out “immediately, if not sooner.” Still, he plans to vote for Jones and hope he gets replaced after the election.
    


            “I would not have endorsed him, and I'm sure lots of other folks wouldn't have voted for him, if we had known that those texts were out there,” Graham said.

            Just a couple of years ago, America's auto industry had visions of an all-electric future. It has since abandoned that talk after the Trump administration eliminated the federal government's incentives for the technology.
    


            The near future isn't looking too pretty. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs is expected to send sales plunging in the coming quarters and perhaps years. 



            But the global auto industry hasn't given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it's not all-electric, as they had expected. The auto industry remains uncertain about the regulatory future of gas-powered cars in large parts of the United States as well as other markets around the globe. And they don't want to fall too far behind China's massive EV surge.
    


            “They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. But they're more carefully going down the path than they were a few years ago.”
    


            The end of a $7,500 federal tax credit a week ago caused an EV sales surge during the third quarter as interested buyers rushed to grab a car before the discount expired. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla's sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers.
    


Goodbye to the $7,500 EV tax credit. What's that mean for EV prices?



            But after the sharp rise, EV sales for the rest of the year will likely come back to Earth with a heavy thud. And it's unlikely they'll get back up for a long time afterwards.
    


            While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that his company also expects that “EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously.”  



            But despite the gloomy outlook, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, a move it called its “next Model T moment,” a reference to the Ford car that helped introduce internal combustion vehicles to the mass market more than a century ago.
    


            “I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event.
    


            Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia.
    


            But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny's plan.
    


            Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn't hit the target.
    


            Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July.
    


            California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales.
    


            But Congress recently moved to end California and the other states' abilities to impose their own, stricter, emissions rules. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases.
    


            Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. That has been the case for years, even before CEO Elon Musk and the company's fans on Wall Street started talking about its ambitious-but-yet-to-be-realized plans about robotaxis and robots driving up the value of the company in the future.
    


            Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid-vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).
    


            “There's still an aggressive push for EVs. But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. “They're going back to their roots.”
    


            And America's car companies are saying they didn't see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline.
    


            The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn't have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM's investors presentation last month.
    


            He said that, despite those regulations and support for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit, “customers weren't adopting at the rate that the government wanted.”
    


            But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand.
    


            “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That's going to take a little bit of time. We'll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.”
    


            Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars.
    


            And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology.
    


            As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said  it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month.
    


            And Ford still thinks the world is changing, even if it's changing more slowly than people originally thought.
    


            “We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford's chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI in 2023 analyzed phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators.

The records enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of the calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The data encompassed several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the certification of the election results.

The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Trump and allies took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump was indicted in August 2023 with conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.

The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the document memorializing the “preliminary toll analysis” was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said.

Grassley called it a “violation of personal property and people's rights and the law and their constitutional rights.”




That document was dated Sept. 27, 2023, and lists the following Republican lawmakers as people whose records were apparently scrutinized: Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. 

The document suggests the analysis was conducted by an FBI special agent whose name was redacted and it was authorized by two supervisory agents. It does not say how or why those lawmakers were identified or whether any meaningful tips or leads emerged from that investigative work.

Most of the lawmakers were part of a group of Republicans who planned to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, some voted to certify the results, while others still voted against certification.

The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino — both Trump loyalists — to review the matter. Grassley suggested that more people at the FBI would be fired over the investigation, saying, “If heads don't roll in this town, nothing changes.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on social media that he had “grave concerns” about the incident.

“I fully support Senate committees getting to the bottom of this outrageous abuse of power and weaponization of the government,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.

A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting is playing out in state capitals, in courtrooms and on the ballot. 

The efforts to redraw U.S. House districts for partisan advantage got jump-started when President Donald Trump called upon Republican-led Texas to reshape districts so that the GOP could win more seats in next year's elections. 

Since then, lawmakers in Democratic-led California and Republican-led Missouri have approved revised districts, and officials in more states are considering it. Utah's Republican-led Legislature endorsed an altered congressional map Monday — though in response to a court order, not Trump's demands. 




U.S. House districts typically are redrawn once a decade, immediately after a census. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.

The stakes are high, because Democrats need to gain just three seats in the 2026 elections to take control of the House, which would allow them to impede Trump's agenda. The president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, a fate Trump is trying to avoid. 

Federal judges in Texas are considering a legal challenge to new congressional districts passed at Trump's urging during a special legislative session in August. Civil rights groups and dozens of Black and Hispanic voters contend the new map intentionally reduces minority voters' influence in violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution. They want to prevent the new districts from being used. 

Republicans hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats in Texas. The revised map could give Republicans a shot at picking up five additional seats in next year's elections. 




Voting began Monday in California in advance of a Nov. 4 election that will determine whether new congressional districts are implemented. 

Democrats already hold 43 of California's 52 seats. But after Texas undertook redistricting, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom urged California lawmakers to reciprocate. They did so by passing a revised U.S. House map that could give Democrats a chance to gain five additional seats.

Unlike Texas, California has an independent citizens' commission that handles redistricting after the census. So any changes to the map need voter approval. 

After Texas and California took action, Missouri lawmakers joined the redistricting battle by passing a revised U.S. House map designed to give Republicans a shot at winning seven of the state's eight districts — one more than they currently hold. The map targets a seat held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver by stretching the Kansas City-based district into rural Republican areas and reducing the number of minority voters.

Opponents are pursuing a referendum petition that, if successful, would force a statewide vote on the new map. Opponents also have filed several lawsuits asserting that mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the state constitution. 

Utah's Republican-led Legislature passed a revised U.S. House map Monday that could give Democrats an improved chance at competing for a seat. Republicans currently hold all four of the state's seats. 

The revised map would place Democratic-leaning Salt Lake City in a single district that stretches into rural areas, instead of splitting the city among multiple districts. But the revision still must be reviewed by a judge, who is expected to approve a new map by November. 

A Utah judge in August struck down the House districts adopted after the 2020 census because the Republican-led Legislature circumvented an independent redistricting commission established by voters. 

Republican lawmakers who hold a supermajority in the Kansas Legislature have been gathering petition signatures from colleagues in an attempt to call a special session on congressional redistricting in November. They are taking that route because Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly is unlikely to call a special session.

Republicans already hold three of the state's four congressional districts. A revised map would target the suburban Kansas City district held by Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids.

Republican Gov. Mike Braun has said that a legislative session on redistricting probably will happen, potentially as soon as November. Republican legislative leaders have met privately with Trump. But Braun has been waiting to call a special session until he is confident it will succeed. 

Republicans hold a 7-2 edge over Democrats in Indiana's congressional delegation. The GOP likely would target a northwest Indiana seat held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan. They also could attempt to slice up an Indianapolis district held by a Democrat, but that could stir opposition by diluting minority voters' influence.

Ohio will have new U.S. House districts for the 2026 elections, though their shape remains to be determined. Republicans currently hold 10 of the state's 15 congressional seats. 

Ohio's constitution requires new U.S. House districts because the ones adopted by Republican officials after the 2020 census didn't have sufficient bipartisan support. If bipartisan consensus remains elusive, Republican lawmakers in November could adopt revised districts without need of any Democratic votes.

Some Democratic state lawmakers have said they will file redistricting legislation for the 2026 session, and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore also has expressed support.

“If we are going to have states in mid-cycle, in mid-decade, determining whether or not they have fair maps or not, then so will Maryland. Then, we should have that conversation, too,” Moore said last week.

Democrats control seven of the state's eight U.S. House seats and could target an eastern Maryland district held by Republican Rep. Andy Harris.

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 15 in a legal challenge to Louisiana's U.S. House districts, currently held by four white Republicans and two Black Democrats. A lawsuit contends state lawmakers wrongly used racial demographics when redrawing districts in response to a previous court ruling to give Black voters a better chance at electing the representative of their choice in two districts instead of one. 

State lawmakers have been told to keep their calendars open between Oct. 23 and Nov. 13 in case the Supreme Court rules quickly and lawmakers could return for a special session on redistricting. 

Officials Florida, Illinois and New York all have raised the possibility of redrawing U.S. House districts. 

Republican Florida House Speaker Daniel Perez has created a special committee to look into redistricting. Republicans currently hold 20 of the state's 28 seats.

Democrats already hold 14 of the 17 U.S. House seats in Illinois. But Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has said it's possible to redraw even more districts favoring Democrats. 

New York has an independent commission that redraws districts after every census. State Democrats have introduced legislation to allow mid-decade redistricting, but the soonest new maps could be in place would be for the 2028 elections. That is because the proposal would require an amendment to the state constitution, a change that would have to pass the Legislature twice and be approved by voters.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.

The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S. 

Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store. 

In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to “enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.”

Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.

In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. “The changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users' ability to safely download apps,” Google warned.




Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.

In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals. 

Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.

Those commissions were the focal point of an antitrust lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games filed against Google in 2020, setting up a month-long trial in San Francisco federal court that culminated in the jury's monopoly verdict.

Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.

In a post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney applauded the Supreme Court for clearing the way for consumers to choose alternative app payment choices “without fees, scare screens, and friction.”

Although the Play Store changes will likely dent Google's profit, the company makes most of its money from a digital ad network that's anchored by its dominant search engine — the pillars of an internet empire that has been under attack on other legal fronts.

As part of cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department, both Google's search engine and parts of its advertising technology were declared illegal monopolies, too.

A federal judge in the search engine case earlier this year rejected a proposed break-up outlined by the Justice Department i n a decision that was widely seen as a reprieve for Google. The government is now seeking to break up Google in the advertising technology case during proceedings that are scheduled to wrap up with closing arguments on Nov. 17 in Alexandria, Virginia.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday asked a judge to immediately put on hold his order that would require elections officials to verify the citizenship of all 3.6 million registered Wisconsin voters before the next statewide election in February.

The state justice department, which represents the Wisconsin Elections Commission, is seeking the stay of Friday's ruling pending an appeal.

Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Maxwell scheduled a hearing on the request for Oct. 31, saying issuing an immediate stay would violate due process. He did temporarily block a section of his order that prohibits the commission from accepting any request to register as a voter without verification that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.

The fight over verifying the citizenship status of voters in battleground Wisconsin comes as President Donald Trump's Department of Justice has sought voter records from at least 26 states, including Wisconsin. Trump's Justice Department is taking steps to crack down on voter fraud and noncitizen voting, both of which are rare but have been the subject of years of false claims from Trump and his allies.

The Wisconsin lawsuit was filed in August 2024 in the lead-up to the November presidential election by two suburban Milwaukee voters, including a longtime critic of how elections are run in the state.

They sought a court order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission and state Department of Transportation to verify the citizenship of all applicants registering to vote. They argued that the state elections commission is failing to investigate unlawful voter registrations and not taking steps to ensure that noncitizens are not voting.

The state justice department argued that there is no requirement or duty under Wisconsin law for the elections commission and transportation department to share and match data to remove non-citizens from the statewide voter list.




Wisconsin law requires voters to certify that they are U.S. citizens but does not require election officials to obtain proof or require voters to present any.

Maxwell ruled Friday that the elections commission is “violating state and federal statutes by maintaining an election system that potentially allows individuals on to the voter rolls who may not be lawfully entitled to cast a vote in Wisconsin.”

The Wisconsin Elections Commission “is failing in the most basic task of ensuring that only lawful voters make it to the voter roll from where lawful votes are cast,” the judge ruled.

He ordered the elections commission to review the voter rolls before the Feb. 18 spring primary election to determine if anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is registered to vote. He also prohibited accepting any new voter registration request “without verification that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.”

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat who is considering running for governor, argued Monday that the court's order would “require a massive overhaul of Wisconsin's voter registration system and the creation of new verification requirements not otherwise provided for by statute.”

Further, the judge's order does not explain what it would entail to verify that an applicant is a U.S. citizen. Requiring additional documents, like a U.S. passport, will take time to implement, Kaul argued.

“A major modification to Wisconsin's electronic voter registration process will require months of development and testing before the changes may be deployed,” he said in the request for a stay of the ruling.

Any disabling of the voter registration system while those changes are implemented would violate the rights of others who are trying to register, Kaul argued. The state receives an average of 200 online voter registrations each day, he said.

Kevin Scott, an attorney for the voters who brought the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday that he hoped the state elections commission “does the right thing” and works to implement the judge's ruling.

A spokeswoman for the state elections commission did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump's aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

Speaking with reporters, President Trump was asked if he would invoke the Insurrection Act.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”




Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump's attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. 

Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor's objections. Otherwise, it's up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He's called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America's long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I'd do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer. 

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,'” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it's typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy's move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it's more symbolic than helpful.”

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge's decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it's the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump's immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump's orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump's opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power. 

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That's our backstop. That's what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump's attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge's weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

A mother in Connecticut allegedly poisoned her husband with antifreeze while the two were fighting for custody of their child.

Kristen Hogan, a 33-year-old Ridgefield resident, was arrested by the Connecticut State Police on Friday and charged with two counts of attempted murder and a charge of interfering with an officer, according to documents released by the agency.

Her husband, who's not named in court documents, went to a court hearing regarding their child on Aug. 7, but Hogan wasn't there. Authorities said that while he was in court waiting for Hogan, he got a notification that she was uploading data to the Wi-Fi router at his home. When he returned home, she was not there.

That same day, Hogan's husband drank a ""small amount"" of wine that was in his fridge, but woke up in the ""middle of the night"" and became ""increasingly ill."" At 6 a.m., his mother came to help him, only to find he was ""slurring his words, staggering and vomiting,"" and was taken to the hospital.

After ruling out a stroke, doctors believed he was poisoned by ethylene glycol, the ingredient used in antifreeze, according to court documents.

The husband told detectives that Hogan had access to his home and was ""the last person other than himself to be in the residence prior to him drinking the already opened wine.""

The wine tested positive for ethylene glycol when it was taken for testing by authorities.

When detectives seized Hogan's phone, they allegedly found searches for several chemical compounds, including monoethylene glycol, according to court documents, which detailed how she also searched how much of the substances ""would kill you.""

""Hogan was confused about the chemicals and then stated she recognized the word cyanide from the television show ‘Psych,'"" authorities wrote in court documents.

While Hogan initially denied poisoning her husband with antifreeze, she eventually admitted to putting ethylene glycol in her husband's wine bottle but ""never intended to kill him, but just wanted to make him sick as payback for him being mentally abusive,"" according to authorities.

Authorities said that Hogan put ethylene glycol in a bottle of tea on a separate occasion, adding she was trying to make her husband sick. Their child was also hospitalized in September and presented similar symptoms as the husband, according to authorities.

""Hogan stated it was only the wine and the iced tea, and nobody else knew she was tampering with [the victim's] drinks,"" according to the arrest affidavit.

When her husband was asked why Hogan would poison the wine, he ""believed that a motive for him being poisoned is the fact that Hogan would become the full owner of the residence and would gain full-time custody of their child,"" according to the arrest affidavit.

Hogan is being held on a $1 million bond.

Chicago FOP President John Catanzara and former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discuss the CPD's conduct as anti-ICE protests occur in Chicago on ‘America Reports.' 

A far-left professor at the University of Chicago was arrested Friday and charged with violent felonies stemming from riots at an ICE facility in the suburbs of the city. 

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital.

Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday. 

A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school.

Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests. 

Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. In her last post at 8:52 a.m., she took a photo of a line of Illinois State Police officers, and accused the state of ""enforcing Trump's agenda of terrorizing our community with abductions.""

She has not posted since.

A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called ""Movement Memos,"" which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they're setting up shop,"" she said, referring to federal immigration officials. ""I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard.""

She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals. 

""There's no center left,"" she said. ""You're either resisting or you're complicit.""

Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025.

""F--- the University of Chicago, it's evil, you know it's a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that,"" she said. 

However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power. 

""Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That's possible structural leverage,"" she said.

Socialism 2025 described itself as a ""a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today."" 

ANTI-ISRAEL PROFESSOR CURSES OUT EMPLOYER UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, SAYS SHE TEACHES TO BUILD POWER

The professor spoke on a panel called ""Revolutionary Accompaniment: Holding Each Other When Things Fall Apart."" 

According to the Truthout interview, she also organizes with Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at the University of Chicago, and has referred to the war in Gaza as a ""genocide."" 

""This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don't have power… what we don't have is power… the question I'm asking myself, and I'm asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?'"" she said at Socialism 2025. 

Much of her X feed consists of resharing posts that are critical of Israel, but she shares some posts of her own.

""Do you see that fight for Palestine is the fight for the whole world? A world where no one is disposable, where no one is disappeared—not by ICE or the IDF, where the will of the people of the world matters more than the will of profit and empire. Do you see it?"" she recently wrote.

Abdelhadi did not return a request for comment.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., discusses shutdown negotiations, the sentencing of Kavanaugh's would-be assassin and his new book, 'How to Test Negative for Stupid' on 'America's Newsroom.'

A weekend away from Washington did little to soften Senate Democrats' resolve as they again blocked Republicans' effort to reopen the government, ensuring the shutdown will last at least a week.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and most of his caucus are adamant that unless a deal is struck on expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, commonly known as ObamaCare subsidies, they will not provide the votes needed to fund the government.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., needs at least eight Democrats to cross the aisle and support the GOP's bill, which would reopen the government until Nov. 21.

SCHUMER'S SHUTDOWN SCHEME EXPLAINED: DEMS DOUBLE DOWN ON OBAMACARE CREDITS AS STANDOFF DRAGS ON

However, only Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, have broken with their caucus to end the shutdown. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., remains the lone Republican to buck his party.

Senate Democrats have remained steadfast in their demand that a deal must be reached to extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They argue that unless Congress acts, Americans who rely on the tax credits will see their healthcare premiums skyrocket.

Both Senate leaders are encouraging talks among rank-and-file members to find a solution, but neither side can agree on when exactly the subsidies should be dealt with.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENTERS 3RD DAY AS SENATE STALEMATE OVER OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES DRAGS ON

When asked what the appetite for tackling the expiring subsidies was within the Senate GOP, Thune said it was ""a mixed bag."" 

""But like I said, you know, there may be a path forward,"" he said. ""I think a lot of it would come down to what the White House lands on that, but certainly not without reforms. And we all know the program is broken, it needs to be fixed, so that would be certainly a starting place.""

Schumer wants an additional bulwark added to a deal: President Donald Trump has to sign off on it, given that there may be resistance among House Republicans to extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies.

""Look, the bottom line on that is we need the president to be involved. [House Speaker Mike] Johnson and a whole lot of his caucus don't like the ACA, don't want to do the extensions,"" he said. ""A lot of Republican senators in the Senate do, but they're not enough. Good is not enough.""

DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO BUDGE OVER OBAMACARE FIGHT AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., speaks to reporters before a Senate luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 12, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)

""You need Johnson and you need Trump to get it done,"" he continued. ""So that's the bottom line.""

Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that ""we're talking to the Democrats."" When asked if he would work to make a deal with them on ObamaCare subsidies to reopen the government, he said, ""Yeah."" 

""I'd like to see a deal made for great healthcare,"" Trump said. ""I want to see great healthcare, I'm a Republican, but I want to see healthcare much more so than the Democrats."" 

Schumer fired back in a statement that Trump's ""claim isn't true — but if he's finally ready to work with Democrats, we'll be at the table.""

And Fetterman, who has routinely voted against shutting the government down regardless of which party controlled the Senate, recognized that without Trump's greenlight, a deal would go nowhere.

He gave the example of a bipartisan border deal negotiated between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate in 2023 that was sidelined under orders from Trump.

""It got tanked. Trump tanked that, and he wasn't the president, and he didn't have to sign that thing,"" Fetterman said. ""So what I'm saying, where's the leverage? Because ultimately, doesn't he have to sign off on any of it anyway?""

U.S. Israel Education Association Chair Bruce Pearl weighs in on the Israeli-Hamas peace talks and reacts to being called ‘divisive' on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Bruce Pearl stepped down as the Auburn Tigers men's basketball head coach on Monday, and a longtime ESPN host appeared rather pleased about the news.

""Pardon the Interruption"" host Michael Wilbon called Pearl a ""divisive person"" and hoped there was ""pressure"" to push him out of the program. 

""He had become a divisive person, it seems to me, intentionally. And I hope there was pressure to just get him out,"" Wilbon said.

Pearl appeared on ""The Will Cain Show"" on Monday and offered a response to Wilbon, who he said he ""loves,"" adding that a ""dear friend"" of Wilbon reached out and said Wilbon's sentiments were ""probably political"" and ""not antisemitic.""

I've tried to bring people together my entire life. Maybe it's an example of why we can't agree to disagree about saying things politically,"" Pearl said.

""I was not forced out. I love Auburn. I love the opportunity now to be able to do some things for faith and family and our country, to be an advocate for Israel, an advocate for education. I'm looking forward to being able to do those things while my son is winning basketball games.""

Pearl, who is Jewish, has expressed his fervent support for Israel in the face of rising antisemitism in the U.S. since the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel. He's been a supporter of how President Donald Trump has handled the conflicts in the Middle East as well.

The White House blasted a federal judge who temporarily blocked the Trump administration twice from dispatching National Guard troops to Oregon in October, asserting that President Donald Trump has ""undisputed authority"" to deploy troops to Portland amid ongoing immigration protests there. 

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a ruling late Sunday blocking the Trump administration from sending California National Guard troops to Oregon — or any other state as Trump advances his quest to deploy troops to major U.S. cities to tackle crime and to keep watch on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discredited Immergut's ruling Monday and said that the Trump administration was appealing the decision. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

""I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law,"" Leavitt told reporters at a White House press briefing. ""The president is using his authority as commander in chief, U.S. code 12 406, which clearly states that the president has the right to call up the National Guard and in cases where he deems it's appropriate. … The ICE facility has been really under siege. And, by these anarchists outside, they have been, disrespecting law enforcement. They've been inciting violence.""

Earlier Monday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said that Immergut, a Trump appointee, has no authority to bar the president from sending troops to Oregon, and blasted the decision as one of the most ""egregious"" orders he's ever seen. 

""A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,"" Miller said in a Monday X post. ""Today's judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat.""

""Remember: all of this is about preventing the removal of illegal alien trespassers from the United States at any cost,"" Miller said. 

The Sunday temporary restraining order came just hours after Trump signed off on mobilizing California National Guard troops to Portland, despite Immergut's initial restraining order Saturday blocking the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to the city.

""How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention to the temporary restraining order I issued yesterday?"" Immergut said during a telephone hearing Sunday. 

""Aren't defendants simply circumventing my order?"" Immergut said later. ""Why is this appropriate?""

The Trump administration has argued that the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, is necessary to defend ICE officers amid ongoing protests at an ICE facility there. 

Miller previously railed against Immergut's first restraining order barring the Trump administration from sending troops to Portland, Oregon, and said Saturday the deployment is ""an absolute necessity to defend our personnel, our laws, our government, public order and the Republic itself."" 

Miller's posts come amid recent scrutiny for denouncing judges. For example, Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York singled out Miller and the ""extreme right"" for ""threatening judges"" who rule against Trump after a fire broke out at a South Carolina Circuit Court judge's property Saturday. 

Trump's effort to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities comes just after he told military leaders in September that they could be tasked with neutralizing the ""enemy within"" and that Democratic-led cities where he's sending troops could serve as ""training grounds.""

""We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military, National Guard, but military,"" Trump said Tuesday to top military leaders in Quantico, Virginia. 

The effort is controversial, given that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 puts restrictions on deploying U.S. troops to enforce domestic law. 

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and typically are overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from states to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops.

Newsom responded to Immegut's order late Sunday, and said: ""We just won in court — again."" 

""Trump's abuse of power won't stand,"" Newsom said in a post on X.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How progressive priorities drive up the cost of housing and construction","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3826737/progressive-priorities-increase-cost-housing-construction/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Sprawling regulations backed by the Left are discouraging development across the country, critics say, as Democratic agendas play out in the public arena.

In California, the bully pulpit of environmentalism, “green” regulations under the state's sweeping Environmental Quality Act have been critiqued for stalling construction and contributing to the state's housing crisis.

In states such as Maryland, the role diversity, equity, and inclusion-like policies embedded in federal contract requirements are playing in discouraging development has come into focus as efforts begin to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge.

Nationwide, and in the country's most populous blue cities, builders have expressed concern over a slew of labor, environmental, and safety mandates instituted under Democrats, which they argue have suppressed companies' ability to operate competitively. These include a 2022 order creating project labor union requirements, requirements on “prevailing wages,” and a 2024 rule listing two chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

“You do have that confluence of kind of interest groups, so that we need union labor, the architects have to have a certain minority component. And environmental concerns — are there spaces that we can't build, or do you need to do a huge study to make sure that there's some sort of plan because there's a five-eyed caterpillar that lives within the range?” said Wayne Winegarden, senior fellow of business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute.

“All of those types of regulations absolutely decrease the efficiency of what's happening, cause delays, drive up costs,” he added.

The 2024 rule expanding requirements around PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” was spearheaded by the Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency before trickling down to affect billions of dollars in development and thousands of workers.

The CERCLA regulations, backed by liberals, have put a stranglehold not just on small businesses but also on the “big, sophisticated contractors” looking to get involved in major infrastructure projects, as they have broadened the costly liabilities they could face, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.

“That liability is what's going to prevent contractors from bidding on major infrastructure projects where there might be PFAs contamination,” said AGC regulatory counsel Spencer Phillips, whose organization represents over 33,000 firms in the construction industry. “Members have told us that they're declining a bid on those types of projects, particularly airport projects, because PFAs contamination is pretty ubiquitous.”

“Even if a contractor doesn't know that there's PFAs on their site, it was totally by happenstance,” Phillips added, “all of a sudden, the contractor is on the hook for the entire dollar figure for the cleanup and remediation.”

The Biden administration's prevailing wage rule has also raised concerns that snaking requirements backed by Big Labor are throttling the industry. Projected to affect $217 billion in federally assisted construction spending annually for more than a million workers, the rule requires companies to pay wages equivalent to those paid to at least 30% of workers in a particular locality instead of the previously required 50%.

The rule added “really complicated compliance requirements to construction work that was historically not covered by the Davis-Bacon Act,” Phillips argued. He said he believes smaller and traditionally nonfederal contractors lack the resources to navigate payroll and recordkeeping requirements associated with the regulation.

Phillips suggested the prevailing wage rule acts as a deterrent for smaller firms to pursue certain contracts, which could reduce the quality of projects because it shrinks the applicant pool and the competitiveness of the bid process. The bigger the pool of applicants or eligible contractors is, “the better bids you'll get, the better work you'll get,” he said.

Prevailing wage regulations have sparked extensive debate in New York City, the country's largest metropolis, and contributed to criticism that they have contributed to the Big Apple's housing affordability crisis. 

Residents faced a housing crisis of record proportions as construction ground to a halt over the summer, largely due to the end of crucial tax incentives for developers, the renewal of which was blocked by liberals partly because of concerns that they needed an update to expand prevailing wage regulations.

Democratic City Comptroller Brad Lander and Big Labor groups opposed the renewal of the state's 421-a property tax exemption for the construction of affordable housing in 2022. They advocated a replacement measure that mandated prevailing wage laws apply to projects built under the tax exemption, which was previously exempt from such requirements. 

The new 485-x tax provision has not yet proven effective in motivating New York City developers, leading to stalled projects and fewer affordable options as the city faces a vacancy rate of 1.4%, the lowest since 1968.

By November 2024, former President Joe Biden's marquee 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act awarded $568 billion in federal funding to over 66,000 projects across the country, with a catch: Most projects awarded IIJA funding must comply with various federal regulations, including the prevailing wage rule and requirements set by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. The Transportation Department program requires recipients of DOT funds to award 10% of federally assisted contracts to DBEs, defined as firms at least 51% owned by women or minorities.

States such as Maryland have added regulations on top of the federal diversity requirements for many infrastructure projects, with critics arguing they have contributed to delays on multiple high-level developments. DBE requirements, currently being battled in court, have affected contracts involving projects ranging from the Golden State's high-speed rail project and the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore to the Brent Spence Bridge Project, all of which have faced delays and escalating costs.

The $3.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge recently faced a lawsuit alleging that the project's lead contractor reneged on an agreement to use a more diverse set of subcontractors, as 9%, or about $320 million, of the construction project's funds, was set to go to DBEs.

“We appreciate the need to attract new people into this industry,” said Brian Turmail, who leads strategic initiatives at AGC. “But for 50 years, at some level or another, public owners, at the state and local level, sometimes at the federal level, have been putting in place, sort of set aside for minority firms, and they haven't measurably increased the percentage of minority ownership of construction firms in this country. So we found that they don't actually work. They don't meet their policy objective while needlessly raising the cost of projects.”

Turmail pointed to the Brent Spence Bridge's paralyzed development as a prime example of regulations, including permitting requirements, impeding progress. The plan was first proposed in 2004. A decade later, taxpayers had spent more than $100 million on plans for a new bridge, years before the project was given the federal green light to proceed with construction in 2022. A design was unveiled earlier this year, with construction projected to begin in 2026 after environmental advocates sued the project last year, alleging that health and environmental effects were overlooked. 

“We've created a permitting process that essentially it's like a bad case that shoots in ladders,” Turmail said. “Anytime you fail one step of the process, you almost have to go back to the start. And not only can you fail the federal level, but the process is designed to make it really easy for special interest parties to get involved, litigate, and send the project back to square one.”

The permitting process in some of the country's largest blue cities has been similarly accused of preventing construction on housing and other priorities.

The process of getting building permits in Los Angeles can take one to two years, while the number issued is down 18.5% since 2022, according to the Pacific Research Institute. On the other hand, the permitting process in Republican-run cities, such as Dallas, often takes less than three months.

One recent example in Los Angeles showcased the obstacles contractors often face: Developer Cityview became one of only six large apartment developments under construction in the nation's second-most populous city after going through a three-year process to get approval, according to CoStar. The project survived an environmental appeal, required a legal settlement, and ultimately advanced only after qualifying for streamlined review under state law.

Overall, the cost of building new multifamily housing is 2.3 times higher in California than in Texas, according to a RAND analysis. Stringent energy efficiency standards add about 7% to construction costs, according to Cal Matters, while government-subsidized apartment projects that are often mandated to pay union-level wages carry labor expenses accounting for up to 35% of the total difference in costs between California and Texas.

COX ANNOUNCES $200 MILLION EFFORT TO STAVE OFF SALINE FAILURE IN GREAT SALT LAKE

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) eased some CEQA standards to help Los Angeles rebuild after the fires in January. However, he has faced criticism over his rationale for allowing such regulations to restrict development elsewhere.

“Certainly, any type of moves like that is helpful,” Winegarden said. “But is it enough? Is the question, and right now, no, it's not.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Venezuela warned the U.S. government that the American Embassy in Caracas could be targeted in a “false-flag” operation, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez said on Sunday.

Rodríguez said the United States and an unspecified European embassy had been warned in three separate channels that “extremist sectors of the local Venezuelan right” are looking to plant explosives at their locations.

A “false flag” operation is when a perpetrator tries to make an incident look like another party was responsible.

Rodríguez did not specify which extremist group would try to carry out the attack, who would be framed, or the motivation for such a plan.

The U.S. Embassy in Caracas employs 150 locals and spends more than $6 million annually for upkeep of the embassy and other diplomatic properties in the Venezuelan capital, according to a September 2025 report from the State Department's Office of Inspector General.

The State Department suspended operations at its embassy in Caracas and evacuated all diplomats in March 2019, during President Donald Trump's first administration.

Trump's second administration has taken a very aggressive posture toward Venezuela and its president, Nicholás Maduro, whom the U.S. does not recognize as the legitimate leader of the country. The administration has accused Maduro of being the head of the Cartel of the Suns and being directly involved in the cartel's drug smuggling operations.

The U.S. military has significantly increased its presence in the western hemisphere around Central America as the Department of War has taken a much larger role in stopping drug trafficking under Trump.

U.S. forces have carried out at least four strikes on vessels in international waters that U.S. officials have said were cartel members smuggling drugs that would end up in the U.S. Traditionally, the U.S. Coast Guard would interdict these vessels, search them, and, if needed, arrest those on board and give them due process.

These strikes have raised legal questions about the military's use of lethal force, while Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said they would continue as needed.

After the most recently announced strike on a Venezuelan boat, Hegseth said U.S. intelligence confirmed “without a doubt” that the vessel “was trafficking narcotics, the people on board were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.” He did not share what intelligence confirmed those conclusions.

US STRIKES VESSEL OFF VENEZUELAN COAST KILLING FOUR, HEGETH SAYS

Trump informed Congress last week that the U.S. is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, declaring some cartels to be terrorist organizations and their members “unlawful combatants.”

Trump has also publicly said the U.S. military could carry out operations on Venezuelan soil, which would be an escalation in its operations.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, fantasizes about murdering Republicans and their children and urinating on their graves, we recently learned.

We only know what Jones texts to one state lawmaker, and so we don't know the breadth of the folks he would like to kill and exactly what sort of children he wants to suffer.

VANCE CALLS ON ‘DERANGED' JAY JONES TO DROP OUT OF RACE

“Shocking” is the word some newspapers use to describe Jones's texts. On that score, I need to quibble. I was appalled and repulsed by the texts. Given that Jones has a very good chance of being my state's chief law enforcement officer, I'm also a bit terrified that his bloodthirsty hatred of conservatives will translate into political persecution.

But I wasn't quite shocked by Jones's texts. We already knew about his depraved indifference toward human life, thanks to his speeding violation.

In 2022, at age 33, Jones was caught going 116 miles per hour in a 60-mph zone. If someone is driving 90 in a 75, that person is reckless, or maybe dumb. If someone is going 90 in a 60, that person lacks all judgment. If someone is going 100 in a 60, that person is showing what our legal system calls “depraved indifference.” He may not be trying to kill other people, but he clearly simply doesn't care if he kills other people.

Jones was going 16 mph faster than that.

And then he faced almost no consequences for his actions: He “served” the community service to which he was sentenced by volunteering, purportedly, for his own political action committee and the NAACP.

VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT UNDER FIRE AFTER 2022 RECKLESS DRIVING CONVICTION COMES TO LIGHT

Jones is a man who simply doesn't value human life. He wants his political opponents and their children dead because he thinks conservatives are fascists who “breed little fascists.” He demonstrably doesn't care if his behavior kills other people.

It would be pretty dangerous to give such a depraved man the prosecutorial power of the state.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in Chiles v. Salazar, a case challenging Colorado's ban on certain forms of counseling for youth experiencing gender dysphoria. The stakes couldn't be higher for vulnerable young people and their families.

We make unlikely co-authors. Tyler Deaton leads American Unity Fund, which advocates for LGBT rights within conservative circles. Ryan T. Anderson leads the Ethics and Public Policy Center, applying Judeo-Christian moral tradition to law and culture. We've frequently disagreed — sometimes profoundly — on questions of marriage, sexuality, and religious liberty.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE IF GOP CANDIDATE CAN SUE OVER ILLINOIS MAIL BALLOT LAW

Yet we've joined forces to file an amicus brief in this case because we share a fundamental conviction: Children struggling with gender dysphoria deserve compassion, individualized attention, and comprehensive mental healthcare, not a system that pushes only one predetermined outcome.

Colorado's 2019 law — versions of which have been passed by over 20 other states — prohibits mental health professionals from providing any counseling that doesn't “affirm” a minor's stated “gender identity.” In practice, this means therapists can only validate a child's desire to pursue sex change interventions, whether social, medical, or surgical; they cannot explore underlying issues, address co-occurring mental health conditions, or help children find ways to understand themselves that don't include medically or surgically modifying their developing bodies.

The law's defenders have labeled therapy that doesn't “affirm” as “conversion therapy,” deliberately invoking a different and emotionally fraught topic. However, helping children work through distress about puberty — a universally difficult time — bears no resemblance to the coercive practices many gay and lesbian adults condemn.

This law isn't protecting children from harmful therapies. It's guiding them onto a medical conveyor belt that itself exposes them to serious risks of fundamentally experimental interventions that carry serious risks: impaired cognitive function, infertility, reduced bone density, and other lifelong health consequences.

It also tramples on the First Amendment rights of the therapists. Censorship has lately been a potent tool of far-left and far-right activism as censors embrace the illiberal impulse to silence or “cancel” any viewpoint they find objectionable. As an illuminating example, one of the authors of this piece published a book several years ago questioning the efficacy of medicalized treatments. It was met with outrage, but instead of this being followed by sober conversations about the evidence presented, Amazon pulled the book from its website, backing down instead of defending the author's right to free speech and the value that serious, evidence-based, public discourse could bring to this debate.

But the Colorado law has backfired in tangible ways that are hurting the very population it's claiming to protect; many of the therapists being silenced are themselves part of the LGBT community whose professional goal is to help the next generation of LGBT youth grow into healthy and successful adults. Instead, their businesses are being put under a microscope and damaged, ultimately resulting in fewer children having access to help and guidance when they most need it.

International evidence is mounting that there is no reliable benefit from medical sex-change interventions for minors. Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have all reversed course on so-called “gender-affirming care” after systematic reviews found the evidence weak or nonexistent, and instead recommend psychotherapy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently concluded that “the best available evidence indicates that puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery have not been shown to improve mental health outcomes” for youth with gender dysphoria. 

This isn't a new phenomenon. Detransitioners — young adults who medically “transitioned” as minors and later regretted it — consistently report that their gender dysphoria stemmed from other issues that went ignored or unexplored and that they were fast-tracked toward permanent bodily modifications when what they needed was mental health support.

SUPREME COURT TAKES UP CHALLENGE TO HAWAII HANDGUN RESTRICTIONS

The First Amendment protects many things, but at its core, it safeguards the marketplace of ideas and public debate — including professional discussions about the best ways to help struggling youth. Colorado's law doesn't just violate counselors' free speech rights; it abandons vulnerable children to an experimental medical pathway that increasingly looks like malpractice.

Whatever one's views on LGBT issues, surely we can agree that children deserve protection, not politics. As the Supreme Court considers this case, we hope the justices will recognize what's really at stake: the freedom of mental health professionals to provide ethical, evidence-based care and the right of children to receive it.

Ryan T. Anderson is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Tyler Deaton is a senior advisor at American Unity Fund. They filed an amicus brief in Chiles v. Salazar supporting the petitioner.

During my time in Congress, I voted for clean funding bills with both Republicans and Democrats — precisely the kind of legislation put forth by Senate Republicans that Senate Democrats are rejecting — because I understood government shutdowns hurt our workforce.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle agreed with this commonsense position as recently as last year. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) even said that “no reasonable member on either side — Democrat or Republican — wants a government shutdown.”

The same Democratic senators responsible for today's government shutdown previously passed 13 clean funding resolutions when they held the majority in Congress. Now, they no longer seem interested in reason; they seem more interested in grandstanding for completely out-of-touch policies that put American workers last, like providing free healthcare for illegal immigrants.

From the Department of Labor's perspective, it's clear these games will harm working families and wage earners across the country. Wildland firefighter pay will be affected — and so will the pay for our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every single day. Small business loans that support our Main Streets won't be dispersed. Key economic data that businesses, workers, and policymakers rely on to make informed decisions cannot be collected or reported, creating even greater uncertainty than what is already rippling across the economy from this shutdown. 

SENIOR HOUSE DEMOCRAT DARES GOP TO END SHUTDOWN BY NUKING SENATE FILIBUSTER

Our efforts to Make America Skilled Again will also be stunted by the shutdown, preventing the department from registering key apprenticeship programs and bolstering the skilled talent pipeline to answer the demand of growing workforce shortages in critical industries. Not to mention, our efforts to advance the boldest deregulatory agenda for American workers in recent history are being brought to a standstill. 

For these reasons and many more, the administration is committed to keeping the government open for Americans. We understand what is at stake and must remain laser-focused on supporting President Donald Trump's efforts to create a Golden Age of economic prosperity. 

We do that by continuing to fight for free and fair trade, increasing blue-collar wages beyond the 1.4% we've already achieved, incentivizing investments here at home, and expanding on the hundreds of thousands of private sector jobs that have already been created. 

The Democrats have brought our economic success to a halt due to their unwillingness to come to the table with Republicans in Congress. Under President Trump, we have achieved a 3.8% GDP, but because of the Democrats' shutdown, we could see a substantial hit to the GDP, a hit to our economic growth, and a hit to working families. A recent memo from the White House Council of Economic Advisers warns that the United States could lose $15 billion in GDP each week the government is shut down, with a monthlong shutdown leading to an additional 43,000 Americans unemployed.

Just nine months into this administration, our economy is growing faster than expected, driven by consumer spending, more affordable homes, and a booming stock market. We can't take our foot off the gas now.

SHUTDOWN SENDS CAMPAIGNS INTO OVERDRIVE TO SEIZE ON GOVERNMENT CHAOS

President Trump's America First policies are working, but it's all coming to a screeching halt because my former colleagues across the aisle are playing political games and refusing to come to the table. Senate Democrats have created a preventable crisis that will inflict real harm on the very people who form the backbone of our nation's economy. 

It's time for them to do the right thing and join us in putting American workers first.

The more the president puts the prime minister in his place, the more likely it is that the Gaza war will end.

The two-year war between Israel and Hamas is at a precarious inflection point after a roller-coaster sequence of events over the past week. On Monday, President Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point plan for ending the war in Gaza, presenting it as a nonnegotiable ultimatum to Hamas. On Friday, Hamas said it would consider discussing the first 10 points, including releasing the hostages in their custody, and effectively sidestepped the rest of the points, including turning over its weapons. Trump enthusiastically accepted this lukewarm response—declaring on Truth Social that “I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE”—and dragged Benjamin Netanyahu along for the ride.

“Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly,” Trump further demanded in that post, which went up at 5:14 p.m. eastern time on Friday—past midnight in Jerusalem. Faced with this presidential directive, the Israeli prime minister promptly acquiesced. In March, after the end of the previous Gaza truce, Netanyahu promised that Israel would conduct negotiations with Hamas only “under fire”—that is, it would not cease military action prior to a diplomatic deal being struck. On Saturday, the Israeli leader abruptly reversed course. Israel began halting offensive operations in Gaza—most notably around Gaza City, the primary target of the current war effort—and made plans to dispatch negotiators to Cairo.

Hussein Ibish: Hamas's worst option, except for all the others

In short, Trump successfully bullied Netanyahu—and if this latest round of talks is going to get results, he'll need to do more of it. That's because despite the president's confident proclamations of peace for our time, a deal is far from assured. Hamas can easily blow up the fragile process by refusing to release all of the hostages, or otherwise reneging on its hazy commitments to Trump and the mediating states. The terrorist group is reportedly divided between its leaders abroad who want to agree to Trump's terms and its leaders in Gaza who do not. At the same time, Netanyahu is already facing a mutiny among the far-right members of his coalition, who want to ethnically cleanse and resettle Gaza, and are threatening to bring down his government if the war ends. Today, Trump is the only actor who can provide a counterweight to these radicals and compel Netanyahu to make different choices by changing his incentives. As he showed this weekend, the president holds incredible leverage over the Israeli leader—he just needs to use it.

Contrary to the spin of Netanyahu's boosters in Israel and the fulmination of anti-Semites in America, Trump has never been beholden to Netanyahu. The reverse is true: Netanyahu has been beholden to Trump. For years, the Israeli leader has marketed himself to voters as the Trump whisperer and presented his alliance with the mercurial American president as an electoral asset. Netanyahu even festooned buildings with photos of himself with Trump on towering campaign posters across Israel. But these boasts have now become a straitjacket. With Israeli elections scheduled for late 2026—and possibly arriving earlier—the prime minister cannot afford a public feud with the president without refuting his own electoral argument. This means Netanyahu not only has to accept Trump's diktats; he has to spin them as his own ideas—or risk shattering the myth he has built around himself.

The president fully grasps this dynamic. “I said, ‘Bibi, this is your chance for victory,'” Trump told the Axios reporter Barak Ravid on Saturday. “He was fine with it. He's got to be fine with it. He has no choice. With me, you got to be fine.” The president's official rapid-response team then posted that quote on social media, in case anyone had missed the implication.

Trump has not only compelled Netanyahu's recent about-face on Gaza. Over the past six months, he has forced Netanyahu to abort a major counterstrike in Iran; publicly declared, “I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,” dashing the aspirations of the Israeli settler right; negotiated the release of an American hostage from Hamas behind Netanyahu's back; and made the Israeli leader apologize to Qatar for his recent strike there—after which the White House released a humiliating photo of Netanyahu's phone call of contrition. This week, he signed an executive order granting NATO-level security guarantees to Qatar, the longtime hosts and patrons of the Hamas leadership abroad. Trump has also repeatedly amplified and praised the Israelis protesting against the Netanyahu government and in favor of a hostage deal.

Netanyahu has spun most of these deviations from his desires as part of his plans. Like many successful politicians, he is “a master at disguising retreat as advance,” as the biographer Robert Blake once wrote of the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. But the illusion, at this point, is wearing thin. In reality, Trump is not and has never been Netanyahu's pawn. He is who he has always been: a transactional politician who leads a largely pro-Israel coalition but is also closely tied to an array of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, because of both business and geopolitical considerations. Trump's agenda is his own. The president has demonstrated time and again that when he acts in the Middle East, he is balancing the interests of his competing stakeholders, not fulfilling the Israeli right's wish list.

Netanyahu is a similarly political operator: He is a creature of his coalition and a product of the pressures placed on him. Absent Trump's interference, the strongest force acting on the Israeli leader's decisions has been his far-right partners, whose influence has shaped Netanyahu's choices throughout this conflict. Most Israelis oppose the radical right's messianic designs on Gaza and want to bring the war to a close, but they will need the American president to change the calculus of their prime minister.

The White House aide equates opposition to Trump's agenda with terrorism—and pushes for the use of state power to suppress it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Stephen Miller spent his weekend, as he is wont to do, describing American politics as if the nation were in the advanced stages of civil war and as if he were dictating a message while racing to a mountain hideout to escape bloodthirsty guerrillas. “There is a large and growing movement of leftwing terrorism in this country. It is well organized and funded,” he wrote on X. “And it is shielded by far-left Democrat judges, prosecutors and attorneys general. The only remedy is to use legitimate state power to dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

The provocation for this latest sweaty missive was an unfavorable judicial ruling (by a judge contravening President Donald Trump's federal takeover of 200 National Guardsmen in Oregon). But violent defiance has become the animating vision through which Miller—and, therefore, on account of his sweeping influence over domestic politics, the Trump administration—views his conflict with Democrats, the media, the judiciary, or any entity that stands in his path.

The most consistent theme in Trump's career is that any word or deed that he deems contrary to his political interests is illegitimate. Any unfavorable news story is libel, any election he loses is rigged, any unflattering fact pattern is a hoax, and almost anybody who opposes him should be locked up.

Miller's career was defined, in its early stages, by a fanatical hatred of immigration. Over time, as Miller has emerged as the chief architect of Trump's second-term agenda, his worldview and Trump's have blended together.

“The Democrat Party is not a political party,” he said in August. “It is a domestic extremist organization.” Several weeks later, Trump seized on Charlie Kirk's assassination to depict his own political opponents as accessories to murder. “For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,” he said, in remarks reportedly written by Miller. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”

Kirk's death became the immediate pretext for using state power to crush political opposition. As the shock of that murder has worn off, Miller is shifting to a more durable pretext: the political and legal backlash against Trump's expansive deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The executive branch certainly has the right, and indeed the obligation, to enforce immigration law. Trump, though, has redefined the boundaries of this enforcement in numerous ways: by detaining people without due process, some of whom have inevitably turned out to be citizens; by seizing law-enforcement powers from states and localities; by employing masked agents who don't always identify their agency, and who have frequently attacked journalists and bystanders.

These actions have generated public pushback, and even isolated and horrifying acts of violence—but hardly an insurrection. As the ruling turning down Trump's demand to federalize law enforcement in Oregon notes, the administration's assertion that Portland is in a state of revolution musters a total of four episodes of threatening behavior by protesters to justify this claim. One of the incidents is “protesters setting up a makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials.” Another was “someone posting a photograph of an unmarked ICE vehicle online.” The other two involved flashlights being shone in the faces of agents driving vehicles. These incidents may be regrettable, but they do not even constitute actual violence, let alone terrorism.

In the Miller-Trump formulation, however, Trump embodies both the public will and the only force standing between the public and rampant criminal anarchy. It follows that opposition to Trump in any form, including by judges issuing legal rulings, constitutes an illegal rebellion. “The President is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, not an Oregon judge. Portland and Oregon law enforcement, at the direction of local leaders, have refused to aid ICE officers facing relentless terrorist assault and threats to life,” Miller asserted on X. “This is an organized terrorist attack on the federal government and its officers, and the deployment of troops is an absolute necessity to defend our personnel, our laws, our government, public order and the Republic itself.”

Trump's remarks on the night of Kirk's murder redefined violent incitement to include harsh criticism of judges. (“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law-enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.”) Now Miller himself is going after judges.

To call this “hypocrisy” is to engage Miller's reasoning at a level upon which it does not operate. The essence of post-liberalism is the rejection of the notion that some neutral standards of conduct apply to all parties. Miller, like Trump, appears to believe his side stands for what is right and good, and his opponents stand for what is evil. Any methods used by Trump are ipso facto justified, and any methods used against him illegitimate.

A couple of weeks ago, Miller claimed that a disturbed gunman shooting Charlie Kirk impelled the government to crack down on the left. Now he says a handful of activists protesting ICE impel the government to crack down on the left.

Violence is not the cause of Trump and Miller's desire to use state power to crush their opposition. It is the pretext for which they transparently long.

Immigration arrests have declined and jail overcrowding is worse despite billions in new funds.

Few provisions in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act were as thrilling to immigration hard-liners as the $45 billion it provided to supersize the ICE detention system. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had long complained that a lack of jail space constrained their ability to deport more people. The bill gave ICE enough money to nearly triple its detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds—a “once-in-a-generation opportunity,” the White House called it.

But in the three months since the bill was signed, the agency has added little to that capacity. The lack of beds may be limiting ICE's ability to expand its enforcement; the number of arrests it's made peaked in June and has declined in the months since. The agency's focus on partnerships with state governments has done little to add capacity, despite driving up costs. And overcrowding has worsened in short-term holding cells at ICE processing centers, where detainees, attorneys, and immigrant advocates report abysmal conditions.

Lawmakers who visited the Baltimore center in August said detainees were spending as long as eight days in bare-bones cells designed for 12-hour stays. In Georgia, Virginia, and California, attorneys say immigrants have been forced to sleep on concrete floors without showers or bedding for days. Last month, a district court judge in New York City ordered immediate improvements to the processing center at a federal building in Lower Manhattan, where secretly recorded videos showed packed holding cells and men sleeping beside toilets.

The lack of detention space has slowed Trump's immigration crackdown at a moment when it was primed to accelerate. From January to June, the average number of detainees per day in ICE custody rose 43 percent, to more than 57,000. But since July, when the funding was approved, the detainee population has increased only about 5 percent, to roughly 60,000, the latest statistics show.

The stream of social-media clips showing masked federal agents kicking down doors, raiding Home Depot parking lots, and pulling people from their car have kept up the appearance of an ever-expanding campaign. ICE's own data show that the agency's buildup stalled over the summer.

Eight current and former officials at ICE and the Department of Homeland Security told me that they blame Corey Lewandowski, the longtime Trump-world figure who is a “special government employee” at DHS and functions as the unofficial chief of staff to Secretary Kristi Noem. Lewandowski has operated as a gatekeeper for Noem, especially since June, when the department implemented a new policy requiring her to sign off on any contract exceeding $100,000.

Read: Fast times at Immigration and Customs Enforcement

With 260,000 employees and an annual budget of $62 billion, DHS has thousands of contracts in that range—including things like Coast Guard vessels, Border Patrol equipment, and TSA software—and deals with private-prison companies that have facilities with tens of thousands of beds that they say could be operational within weeks. Ever since Trump was elected, companies like the Geo Group and CoreCivic have been quickly expanding and promising their investors fat profits.

DHS's new contracting rules have produced “chaos,” according to the current and former officials I spoke with, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared reprisals from the administration. Most of them support the president and his mass-deportation plan, but told me they were dismayed that ICE seemed to be losing altitude right after securing the funding they'd always dreamed of.

“There's extreme frustration that the president's agenda—when it comes to ICE beds, and therefore deportations—is not going to happen,” one former DHS official told me. “The White House worked for months to get the reconciliation bill over the finish line. Why did you just lobby Congress for months saying you needed the money if you don't intend to spend it?”

There's a jarring disconnect between what I've been hearing from supporters of the president who are disappointed with ICE's pace, and the images on social media each day: sobbing families torn apart in courthouse hallways; a commando-style night raid on a Chicago apartment building; and masked federal officers smashing car windows, slamming people to the ground, and targeting bystanders who dare to question them. The Trump administration has made a show of force by sending National Guard troops to reinforce ICE teams in Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; and Chicago. But a closer look at ICE data shows that the intensity of ICE enforcement nationwide has essentially leveled off.

In May, Stephen Miller and Noem told ICE's top leaders that they should be making 3,000 arrests a day nationwide to meet the president's goal of 1 million deportations a year. ICE data show that the number of immigrants arrested by ICE per month peaked at 31,590 in June, but that, since then, arrests have been down about 11 percent.

ICE deported about 350,000 people during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended September 30—the highest mark in a decade, but well below Trump's goal.

In an interview, Lewandowski acknowledged that ICE's numbers had flattened out this summer. But he said he and other Noem advisers have spent the past few months focused on cost-saving measures that required hardball negotiations with detention contractors. “I understand that the private companies, who have made an incredibly good living off the backs of the U.S. taxpayers for a long time, are not happy,” Lewandowski told me.

He insisted the approach is working. “We are asking all vendors to provide the best value,” he said. “They've all come back and said, ‘You know what? We can do better. We can do better because we understand.'”

Ryan Gustin, a spokesman for CoreCivic, told me in an email that his company has maintained “an open line of communication” with DHS and ICE officials as they “explore all options available to them to address the increasing demand for detention services and capacity.” The company announced two new ICE contracts last week, Gustin noted, for a 2,560-bed detention center in California's Kern County, and a 1,033-bed facility in Leavenworth, Kansas. The company, whose stock price has doubled since September 2023, told investors that it expects $200 million in combined annual revenue from the sites.

Alexandra Wilkes, a spokesperson for a trade-industry group that represents private detention companies, said in an email that Geo and others “have a long-standing record of providing private sector solutions to the federal government that are priced to be fair and reasonable while providing value for the American taxpayer.”

Some of the former officials who expressed to me frustration with Lewandowski and the slowdown are former ICE officials with ties to the for-profit detention companies that have ready-to-open facilities they're eager to fill. CoreCivic told investors in August that it has about 30,000 beds available for ICE, and Geo said it has roughly 10,000.

But Noem and Lewandowski have prioritized agreements with Republican governors offering detention space at state-run prisons. In addition to the Florida-run facility known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” ICE has announced additional sites and come up with other cartoonish names for them: the “Cornhusker Clink” (Nebraska), “Speedway Slammer” (Indiana), “Deportation Depot” (Florida), and “Louisiana Lockup,” the latter in an abandoned wing of the notorious Angola prison.

Those contracts have provided the agency relatively few beds—several hundred here and there—in contrast with the privately run facilities with capacity for thousands of detainees. “Why are they signing these contracts with these governors for small potatoes?” one frustrated official grumbled to me.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, told me that Noem sought deals with state governors and others because the for-profit detention companies are trying to “take advantage” of the government.

“Secretary Noem isn't going to let the American taxpayer get ripped off,” McLaughlin wrote in an email. Noem, she said, “found innovative, cost-effective solutions” through deals with states that provide more flexibility “so that we aren't locked into decades-long contracts when bed space need is eventually slowed.” McLaughlin claimed that these efforts have saved taxpayers more than $12 billion.

Former officials I spoke with disputed those claims, noting that ICE has long had the ability to terminate contracts when it no longer needs detention space. Two officials critical of Lewandowski said they thought the partnerships with states were a play to boost Noem's profile among GOP leaders as a potential vice-presidential pick for 2028.

“I want to see the administration succeed,” a senior administration official told me, “and we can't succeed if we're playing all these fucking games.”

Lewandowski called those claims “absurd,” and told me that Noem “already knows all those governors,” from her time as governor of South Dakota.

DHS last year said its average daily cost was $165 per ICE detainee. The contracts that ICE signed with private companies for new detention sites this spring appear to be roughly in the same cost range. Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility run by the Geo Group in Newark, is projected to cost ICE about $165 per detainee per day, records show. The company's North Lake detention center, which opened in June in a remote county in Michigan, costs about $130 a day. A Tennessee facility run by CoreCivic that opened last month is about $160 a day.

Those rates are significantly lower than the amounts DHS appears to be paying through its most recent contracts at state-run facilities. The commissioner of the Indiana Department of Corrections told state lawmakers last month that DHS will pay $291 a day at the “Speedway Slammer,” while guaranteeing that the facility has a minimum of 450 detainees. The average cost of a bed inside the tents at “Alligator Alcatraz” is $245 a day, records show.

DHS has not released the details of its contract with the Louisiana Department of Corrections, but two ICE officials told me its rates were even steeper. Lewandowski said those costs reflected a need for a higher level of security. “The price per person may be higher, but the people who are being housed in Angola are the worst of the worst,” he told me.

DHS did not provide a comparison of the rates it's paying the states versus the private companies.

Several top DHS officials have deep ties to Louisiana, and Lewandowski was hired as a consultant for Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry's 2023 campaign. Lewandowski told me he has disclosed all of his financial assets to the department and recused himself from any discussions that raise a potential conflict of interest. He said he plans to remain an adviser at DHS as long as Noem and Trump want him. Lewandowski's critics in the administration often cite rumors of an extramarital affair between him and Noem. “It's bullshit,” he said. “I don't know why you would raise the issue. It's sexist. It's a low blow to someone who has achieved incredible success on her own.”

The for-profit detention companies that receive federal contracts from ICE have long been criticized by liberal groups and many Democratic lawmakers. When President Joe Biden took office, he ordered the Department of Justice to end its use of the private firms, though the directive excluded immigration detention. Over the years, the Geo Group, CoreCivic, and others have filled their executive ranks with retired ICE officials who maintain close ties to the agency and senior DHS leaders.

ICE officials I've spoken with have often told me they prefer working with for-profit companies over state-run facilities. The private companies tend to be more flexible and less bureaucratic, they say, treating ICE like a customer rather than another government agency. If ICE officials need to make sudden changes to detention capacity or services, for example, the private companies are usually more responsive, as long as ICE keeps cutting checks.

By law, immigration detention is administrative and not intended to be punitive. But the Trump administration has been trying to encourage more immigrants to self-deport to avoid the grim conditions in ICE detention. Trump has also appeared to delight in making ICE facilities as intimidating as possible, but his plans for a prison camp for 30,000 ICE detainees at the Guantánamo Bay Navy Base have been on hold, along with his threats to send thousands of detainees to a megaprison in El Salvador.

MSNBC reported last month that the Trump border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 cash payment in 2024 from FBI agents pretending to be businessmen interested in detention contracts. Homan, who started a consulting business after retiring from a career at ICE, has not denied taking the money but told Fox News that he didn't do anything illegal. The White House has backed him, calling the FBI investigation—shut down by Trump officials—a politically motivated scheme to “entrap” Homan.

Three former ICE officials I spoke with said Homan has been frustrated with Noem and Lewandowski over the contracting slowdown, but he has mostly remained on the sidelines because his past consulting work has created so many potential conflicts.

Lewandowski told me the ICE detention network is now poised to resume its rapid expansion, and he pointed to ICE data showing that deportations have nearly tripled since January. Top ICE officials spent the past several months consumed by a more pressing White House mandate to recruit, hire, train, and deploy 10,000 new ICE officers by the end of the year, he said. The agency has received 175,000 applications so far, Lewandowski said, and has overhauled ICE-academy courses to cut training times roughly in half. The new hires will help relieve officers who have been working overtime. “We have put an enormous strain on our workforce,” Lewandowski said. “Now we're seeing some reinforcements.”

The Trump administration implemented a new policy on July 8 that restricts the ability of immigration judges to release ICE detainees on bond while they're fighting deportation, another strain on ICE capacity. DHS officials have turned to the Pentagon for help setting up “soft-sided” ICE jails to hold detainees in giant tents. This summer the Department of Defense, which the administration now calls the Department of War, signed a deal for a 5,000-bed tent site at Fort Bliss, near El Paso, awarding a $1.26 billion contract to a company with no website and whose business address is the owner's modest home in suburban Richmond, Virginia. The Washington Post, citing an unpublished copy of an internal report by ICE inspectors, reported last month that the site, known as Camp East Montana, accumulated 60 violations during its first 50 days of operations, including failures to monitor detainees' medical conditions, insufficient access to legal counsel, inadequate recreation space, and broken toilets. DHS denounced the Post story as “false” and “fearmongering clickbait.”

Seventeen detainees died in ICE custody during the 2025 fiscal year, up from 12 the year before, agency data show. Most of the deaths were linked to medical emergencies, according to ICE records, but at least three detainees took their own life. The agency says it provides comprehensive medical care to all detainees. Immigrant advocates and attorneys dispute that.

Read: The ICE workforce has never been so miserable

As the pace of detentions has outstripped the opening of new facilities, the problems have rippled through the system. In August, ICE detainees in Georgia reported 20-hour daily lockdowns, verbally abusive guards, soiled mattresses, and “inhumane” conditions. Some of the grimmest accounts are from the holding cells in ICE field offices, designed for stays of 12 hours or less, but where immigrants have been staying for days on end—awaiting transfer to an ICE detention center—without soap, showers, clean clothes, and other basics. The cells keep their lights on 24 hours a day, and detainees typically receive little more than a silvery plastic blanket to keep them warm.

In a September 17 ruling in New York, U.S. District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered ICE to take immediate steps to improve access to meals, basic hygiene products, mattress pads, and other supplies at the cramped holding cells in Lower Manhattan.

“ICE has forced these detainees into facilities that are too small to accommodate the numbers, that never were intended to hold people overnight, that are unequipped to feed them properly, and that, more broadly, are not capable of housing the detainees in a humane manner,” Kaplan wrote.

One former ICE official I spoke with said he expected multiple lawsuits in the coming months over conditions at overcrowded processing centers. “And they will have legitimate lawsuits,” the official told me. “Everyone inside ICE knows they'll be right.”

The Supreme Court's 2024 decision threatens the system of international justice.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Vladimir Putin met with Donald Trump in Alaska in August, one prominent strand of social-media commentary had nothing to do with the possibility of a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine (the meeting's ostensible purpose). Rather, it turned on the question of whether Putin—who faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, stemming from Russia's wartime actions—could conceivably be arrested when he stepped foot on U.S. soil.

As a practical matter, of course, the answer was no—it wouldn't happen, and not just because the Trump administration had no interest in making an arrest, or because the Russian reaction would be dangerous, or because the United States is not a member of the ICC. As a legal matter, most countries treat a serving national leader—a president, a prime minister, a king; whether its own or that of some other country—as having complete immunity from the jurisdiction of their national courts. Immunity is defined by Black's Law Dictionary as an “exemption” from the duties and liabilities imposed by the law. A serving national leader with personal immunity cannot be arrested, detained, or judged.

But what happens after a national leader has left office? And what if he or she is accused of having committed crimes under international law while in office, such as torture or genocide? Can a former national leader ever be arrested by another country and judged by its courts for crimes committed elsewhere while in office?

Read: The Supreme Court goes through the looking glass on presidential immunity

The answer to that question is yes, or at least it has been: In recent decades, the vector of legal evolution has pulled international jurisprudence away from blanket immunity. To my mind, as an international lawyer who has been involved in cases dealing with international crimes, this is the right direction.

But images of the summit meeting in Alaska brought international law once again to the fore, and offered a reminder that the international legal regime is under threat. The reason relates not so much to Putin as to Trump. Specifically, the Supreme Court's 2024 ruling in Trump v. United States—an immunity case that concerned a former president's legal liability for actions in relation to official conduct—could have potentially far-reaching ramifications for international justice.

The idea that criminal law is applicable to any person—even a king or a president—is not new. In 1649, King Charles I was put on trial for a “wicked design to erect and uphold in himself an unlimited and tyrannical power to rule according to his will, and to overthrow the rights and liberties of the people.” Convicted, he paid with his head.

In 1764, the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria offered a rationale for the idea that the criminal law should extend to rulers and why criminal sanctions should apply globally: “The certainty of there being no part of the earth where crimes are not punished may be a means of preventing them.”

That said, for centuries the rule was clear: A foreign head of state could never be subject to the jurisdiction of another country's courts, either while in office or subsequently, in relation to official conduct. The immunity from prosecution was absolute. The U.S. Constitution, which came into force in 1789, makes no mention of immunity for the U.S. president, either while in office or afterward. But in 1812, the Supreme Court recognized that a serving foreign head of state had absolute immunity while present on American soil. It said nothing in that decision about immunity from criminal prosecution for the president. Indeed, the Court said nothing on the subject until July 2024.

It took a century after the Supreme Court's 1812 ruling for the international legal regime to shift significantly. In 1919, in the aftermath of the First World War, the victorious powers agreed that Germany's former ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who had fled to the Netherlands, should be arraigned before an international tribunal on a charge of warmongering—a “supreme offense against international morality and the sanctity of treaties,” in the words of the Treaty of Versailles. This was a first: immunity extinguished because of the gravity of the offense, an international crime. No tribunal was established, however. Prosecutorial enthusiasm waned, and the Dutch government made clear that Wilhelm would not be extradited. He was never put on trial.

Still, a precedent had been set. In 1945, after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the four Allied powers—the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—brought Germany's former leaders before an international tribunal at Nuremberg. In order to do this, they recognized new categories of crimes: aggression, genocide, crimes against humanity. For these, no one would have immunity. The crimes committed were heinous and crossed the line into international criminality.

Justice Robert Jackson took a leave of absence from the U.S. Supreme Court to serve as chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg tribunal. He also led the drafting of the tribunal's governing statute, which provided immunity for no one, not even a former head of state. In a letter to President Harry Truman, Jackson set out his thinking. Immunity was an “obsolete doctrine” and “a relic of the doctrine of the divine right of kings.” It was also “inconsistent with the position we take toward our own officials”—a telling comment, because it seems to presume that the U.S. Constitution provided no immunity for a former American head of state. Jackson worried that giving immunity to former leaders would produce “the paradox that legal responsibility should be the least where power is the greatest.” As Jackson saw it, quoting an earlier British jurist, “even a King is still ‘under God and the law,'” and that principle likewise meant no immunity for Karl Dönitz (Hitler's successor as Reich head of state) or Hans Frank (Germany's head of state in occupied Poland). Both were tried and convicted, and Frank was hanged for his crimes, as were 10 others.

The principle of no immunity was widely applied. In the 1990s, the U.S. led the world in creating international tribunals for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. Accordingly, former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević was indicted, arrested, and put on trial. (He died before the trial concluded.) When the International Criminal Court came into existence, in 1998, it dispensed with all immunities for international crimes over which it would have jurisdiction, not only for former heads of state or government (such as former President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who has been indicted, arrested, and transferred to The Hague) but also for serving ones. In addition to the warrant for Russia's Putin, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan when he was still in office, and it has issued one for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. (Like the U.S., none of these countries is a member of the ICC; they reject the court's jurisdiction and argue that a serving head of state is entitled to immunity under general international law.)

Meanwhile, most of the world's nations have also signed international agreements on genocide and torture, obliging countries to prosecute or extradite (to another country, wishing to prosecute) any person alleged to have committed such crimes. The agreements either exclude the right to immunity for any person or pass in silence on the matter. The U.S. is a party to both agreements.

By the turn of the millennium, one big element of the legal situation had become fairly clear: A former head of state enjoyed no immunity with respect to international crimes before international tribunals. What was not clear was what would happen if a former head of state accused of an international crime was brought before a national court in a country other than his own. Then came Pinochet.

Augusto Pinochet, the commander in chief of Chile's armed forces, seized power in a coup d'état on September 11, 1973. As the head of a military junta and then as president, he led a regime that suspended democratic rule and due process, detained tens of thousands of people, and engaged in the widespread use of kidnapping, torture, and “disappearance” (including by means of helicopters, from which victims were dropped into the ocean). At least 3,200 people were killed in Chile during the Pinochet years, and thousands were tortured. The whereabouts of at least 1,000 people remain unknown.

Pinochet was well advised by seasoned lawyers, who knew the potential danger he faced under national criminal laws, including those of the U.S. In September 1976, his regime had used a car bomb to murder Orlando Letelier, Chile's former defense minister, near Dupont Circle, in the heart of Washington, D.C. A year and a half later, Pinochet promulgated a sweeping amnesty law to prevent Chile's courts from sitting in judgment on the crimes of his regime. Some years after leaving office, in 1990, Pinochet was appointed senator-for-life, a position that gave him the further protection of absolute immunity in Chile.

In 1998, believing that he was immune from legal challenge, Pinochet went to London, where he had tea with Margaret Thatcher and bought books about Napoleon from Hatchards, his favorite bookshop. On the evening of October 16, while recovering from a minor operation in England, he was arrested by Scotland Yard. The officers acted on a warrant issued by a judge in Madrid, who sought his extradition to Spain, charging him with genocide and torture, among other crimes. The case had started in 1996, after the killing in Chile of Carmelo Soria, a United Nations official, and other Spanish nationals. The arrest was unprecedented: the first time ever that a former head of state of one country was detained in another on charges of international crimes. “I know the fucker who's behind this,” Pinochet said to the interpreter who informed him of his rights, referring to Juan Garcés, a lawyer in Madrid, who had indeed initiated the process.

Pinochet's legal team argued that the former president had absolute immunity before the English courts. They maintained that the acts alleged came under the rubric of official conduct, and so Pinochet could not be detained or extradited. The court proceedings—in which I was involved as counsel for Human Rights Watch, an intervener in the case—were convoluted. A panel of three judges ruled that Pinochet had absolute immunity under English law because he was a former head of state and all the acts in question were official conduct. Sir Thomas Bingham, the lord chief justice, maintained that there was no exception for international crimes. The Nuremberg precedent was irrelevant, he explained, because that was an international court, not a national one. Bingham and his colleagues had been unable to find a single case anywhere in the world in which a national court ruled that a former head of state had no immunity for international crimes.

The Crown appealed the decision to the House of Lords, at the time the highest court in Britain. Eventually, in March 1999, seven judges of the House of Lords ruled 6–1 that Pinochet had lost his immunity once the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture had come into effect in Britain, Chile, and Spain. Because the treaty obliged parties to prosecute or extradite torturers, the necessary implication was that they had a right to do so. Lord Hope of Craighead, one of the judges in the majority, concluded that any preexisting right to immunity under international law could not “survive” a charge of torture on “such a scale as to amount to an international crime.”

The ruling had immense significance because it set a precedent that could in time be followed by national courts in other countries. Henceforth, any former head of state who engaged in torture was on notice that, once out of office, he was at risk of arrest anywhere in the world. Pinochet was allowed to leave Britain, ostensibly on grounds of ill health (although this was always challenged), and after returning to Chile was eventually stripped of all relevant immunities by the country's supreme court. He was indicted on multiple charges, and at the time of his death, in 2006, was under house arrest.

The Pinochet precedent, although not without its critics, has since taken hold. Recently, a French court ruled that Syria's ex-president Bashar al-Assad could be indicted in France for his official role in authorizing torture. Although the French court in its decision threw out existing charges against Assad—which is what got the headlines—it did so only because those indictments had come down when Assad was still in office. Now that he was no longer serving, the court decided, new indictments could be drawn up.

By extension, and in theory, the Pinochet precedent should also have force in the United States: A former head of state who has engaged in torture or certain other international crimes will be subject to arrest and cannot invoke immunity if he or she sets foot in the U.S. The same principle would apply equally to U.S. presidents who might engage in a policy of torture or other international crimes: They might face a risk of questioning or even arrest abroad. (In 2011, former President George W. Bush canceled a visit to Switzerland after Amnesty International filed a legal complaint there concerning the Bush administration's use of waterboarding, widely recognized to be a form of torture.) The fact that it was official conduct does not give them immunity when they leave office.

This was the context in which I followed the case that former (as he was at the time) President Trump brought to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024. The federal grand jury that indicted him on various counts of conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election result was not, of course, focused on international crimes. But I watched the case closely because the issue of immunity was at its core. Immunity is an issue so basic that it has a way of affecting anything it gets near: spreading sideways, rippling backward. In particular, I wondered whether the Court would follow the line taken by Robert Jackson eight decades earlier. Or would it instead give a former U.S. president some sort of immunity that could extend to international crimes, either explicitly or by necessary inference (which can play a significant role in legal developments).

The lower courts rejected Trump's arguments: As they saw it, he had no criminal immunity as a former president for any acts, whether private or official. Though unstated, the lower-court rulings left clear by extension that a former president who tortures or commits genocide or disappears people in a manner that constitutes an international crime has no immunity.

Trump appealed to the Supreme Court, which in Trump v. United States overturned the lower courts. It did so with gusto but also with limited explicit reasoning, and apparently without much thought as to some of the broader implications, including the international ones. Six of the nine justices ruled that, despite the U.S. Constitution's silence on the matter, a former president has “absolute immunity” for “core constitutional powers” as well as a presumption of immunity for all other official acts, including those where his powers have been subjected to limitations by Congress. The majority's judgment did not speak to the issue of crimes under international law—including torture, disappearances, and genocide—which the United States has historically joined other countries in condemning.

The Supreme Court had never previously addressed a former president's immunity from a criminal suit. (Back in the Nixon era, it had ruled on a former president's immunity from a civil suit.) There was no direct precedent on which to rely. As with the Pinochet case, all nine justices agreed that there was no immunity for private acts. “Like everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. But for all official conduct, the president was, unlike everyone else, protected by a general principle of immunity. This was because—in the view of the majority—the case had “profound consequences for the separation of powers”; Article II of the Constitution was to be interpreted to protect the president's executive powers from the risk that criminal law would be used in an unbridled manner to constrain those powers. The “nature of Presidential power” required “some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office,” Roberts wrote, without any real explanation as to why that should be.

What this means in practice is that where the president exercises “core constitutional powers” under Article II—powers that might involve military action, foreign affairs, and national security more generally, among other matters—he will have absolute immunity, as well as an immunity that extends to matters of evidence. In the view of the majority, without such immunity a president might be deterred by fear of criminal prosecution from taking the “bold and unhesitating action” that the “public interest” requires. Even if, in exercise of these powers, he commits genocide or torture, the majority seemed to be saying, as a former president he will be immune from the jurisdiction of U.S. criminal courts. That is a far-reaching conclusion, at odds with the approach taken by the House of Lords in Pinochet.

Read: The art of the decline

The majority adopted a slightly different stance in relation to official conduct that lies outside “core constitutional powers,” where responsibility is shared with Congress. Congress has shared powers to criminalize certain conduct by the president, and it has legislated in relation to torture and genocide. But even in such cases, a former president enjoys “at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution” in order to enable him to act “without undue caution.” Immunity would be lost only if the application of “a criminal prohibition” to the president's conduct posed no danger of “intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.” The application of this limitation was not explained. From the decision it is not knowable, and its interpretation will have to be litigated, probably on a case-by-case basis.

It could well be that, if a president were ever to be charged with international crimes, the Court would find that the conduct fell outside core constitutional powers and that the president thus enjoyed merely a presumptive immunity. But even so, as the three dissenting justices pointed out, it would be “hard to imagine” a prosecution for official acts that posed “no dangers of intrusion on Presidential authority”—making it impossible, therefore, to reach the threshold where immunity would be lost. Chief Justice Roberts brushed away that concern. The limitation was needed to avoid prosecutions of ex-presidents from becoming “routine.” He offered no evidence of past practice to support that proposition.

The bar for prosecution becomes even higher because of another aspect of the judgment: The majority ruled that a prosecutor cannot use documents, conversations, or other kinds of evidence related to acts concerning core constitutional powers to prove crimes that are not covered by an absolute immunity. (Justice Amy Coney Barrett dissented on this aspect but joined the majority on all others.) Prosecution of a former president would thus likely encounter a series of dead ends.

The Supreme Court remanded the particular facts of the case back to the district court, to determine which of former President Trump's acts subject to the grand-jury indictment were to be treated as unofficial conduct, and where a claim to a presumptive immunity would not be sustained. Years of litigation and uncertainty would have followed, save that Trump was reelected to the presidency.

Jack Goldsmith, who headed the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration, has concluded that the immunity ruling was a “mess,” one that has a “made-up feel” and creates an “entirely new law” that is replete with “ambiguities.” He is not alone in this critique. I spoke recently with Lord Hope, now retired as a U.K. supreme-court judge. Among other things, he found the idea that a U.S. president needed immunity to be able to take decisions to be “absolutely ridiculous.” He acknowledged that the Court had not explicitly addressed the issue of immunity for international crimes, but also noted that uncertainty in this regard was damaging in itself: The ruling left in him a lingering doubt and a worry that, if pressed, “the majority would say that its judgment applied to everything.”

The consequences of the Supreme Court's decision outside the U.S., and for international law, are not hard to imagine. For one thing, even without mentioning international law, the decision moves American domestic law on immunity in the direction of that taken by more-authoritarian states. This is not speculative; it's simply a fact. The majority judgment leaves, at best, a serious question mark when it comes to taking action against international crimes. It will make prosecutors hesitate to bring charges—putting in place obstacles to success—and serves to encourage copycat rulings in other countries. The judgment may also short-circuit future American attempts to hold other former leaders to account for international crimes. What Lord Hope called the “foggy” nature of the ruling makes it more difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to argue against immunity for former leaders charged with international crimes and facing proceedings before national or international courts. If a former U.S. president might have immunity for everything—as the current president would undoubtedly argue—then why shouldn't Milošević or al-Bashir or Assad or Duterte? A former head of state of another country who turns up in the U.S. and is charged with an international crime would be able to assert that he should have no less immunity than that accorded to a former U.S. president for such a crime. The highest courts in other lands—in countries such as Germany and Argentina that until now have not allowed far-reaching immunities for a former head of state—could be encouraged to follow suit. If the highest American court is receptive to immunity for a former president with respect to international crimes—as this judgment suggests, and as Russian law already mandates—then why can't the courts of other countries be?

Maria Ressa: Fight fascism before it's too late

The uncertainties generated by this ruling undermine the values that have been advanced by the United States since 1945, including by conservative administrations. It was, after all, Ronald Reagan who signed the torture convention and whose administration moved to ratify the genocide convention.

The approach and tone adopted by Roberts in the 2024 Supreme Court decision are regrettable. They invite us to imagine the very different kind of letter—think of it as a thought experiment—that might have been sent to President Truman if it had been John Roberts rather than Robert Jackson, who was invited to draft the charter of the Nuremberg tribunal back in 1945:

We have decided to maintain the idea of immunity for former leaders, to ensure that they are not enfeebled or made overly cautious by the fear of criminal prosecution after they leave office. We have concluded that immunity is not an obsolete doctrine or a relic of the doctrine of the divine right of kings. It is a vital, necessary, and living thing. It is fully consistent with the position we take toward our own former presidents. We accept the paradox that legal responsibility should be the least where power is the greatest, including in relation to crimes under international law. Where official conduct is concerned, we accept that a president is under God, but not that he is under the law

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Democrats Still Have No Idea What Went Wrong","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/10/democratic-party-strategy-progressives/684453/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The party's progressives seem to think the problem is not with their platform but with voters.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On a recent panel of progressive activists analyzing what went wrong in the 2024 election, the author, activist, and failed political candidate Qasim Rashid spoke with confidence about the way forward for the Democratic Party. The problem, he insisted, was not that Democrats had strayed too far from public opinion but that the party had grown too solicitous of it. “Saying the right thing timidly,” he proclaimed, “is less effective than saying the wrong thing loudly.”

Rashid's argument was anything but timid, and it certainly played well in the Washington, D.C., room where the progressive donor network Way to Win was holding a confab called Persuasion 2025. Yet Rashid meant for this event to be more than just a pep talk among allies. His call for a confident, undiluted progressive platform is “how you see people flip red seats to blue,” he said.

Rashid's track record as a candidate does not quite bear out this confident assessment. He has run for office three times, falling short every time. In 2020, he lost his race for Congress by 16 points in a district Joe Biden lost by four. He went on to found a firm specializing in “relational messaging to inspire and mobilize communities to advance economic justice, social equity, climate action, and protect our democracy.” It's called, unironically, Just Win.

The purpose of this conference was to reassert the left's strategy for regaining control of the Democratic Party and, at least in theory, a national governing majority. Yet beneath the bold proclamations, one could detect an undercurrent of defensiveness. After almost a decade of nearly unchallenged supremacy, the progressive movement's hold on the party is no longer certain.

Read: The anti-Trump strategy that's actually working

At the end of the Obama era, most Democrats (myself included) saw liberalism's ascent as nearly inevitable. Accordingly, they saw little cost in getting ahead of where public opinion was obviously headed. When Senator Bernie Sanders challenged Hillary Clinton from the economic left in 2016, she replied by outflanking him to the left on social issues while breaking with the Obama administration's moderate positions on trade (she opposed President Barack Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership) and education (she backed away from his support for charter schools and other reform measures).

In 2020, nearly the entire presidential field raced leftward. Sanders, having seen Clinton's supporters attack him on race and gender, incorporated identity politics into his messaging. Senator Elizabeth Warren competed to be seen as no less progressive than Sanders, and other Democrats tried to keep up with them both. Progressive activist groups served as referees, rewarding candidates who endorsed their ever-growing list of policy demands. Debates turned into contests over who could treat undocumented immigrants more generously or promise a more sweeping domestic agenda. Biden, whom most Democrats and reporters alike had left for dead, won the race largely because he, as the only well-known candidate who had not abandoned the Obama legacy, occupied the ideological ground where most of the party's voters remained.

In that context, Kamala Harris's promise to the ACLU that she would support taxpayer-financed gender-transition surgeries for prisoners and detained migrants received little attention—it was just one more edgy, leftist policy commitment in a campaign that consisted of little else, and her floundering candidacy soon dropped out of sight.

This promise seems to have played a large role in Harris's doomed presidential campaign five years later. Harris, whose position on the ticket was itself a sop to activists who had demanded a Black, female vice president, was already an awkward fit as the default Democratic nominee. Her defeat forced moderate Democrats to reckon with the ways progressive activists had not just driven the entire field leftward but also pressured Harris to adopt a position so toxic that it inspired the Trump campaign's most effective ad. This lone commercial, with its potent tagline—“Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you”—moved viewers by an estimated 2.7 points, a shift larger than Trump's margin of victory in most swing states.

Moderate Democrats have since staged a counteroffensive, complete with a new think tank (the Searchlight Institute), a moderate caucus (Majority Democrats), a magazine (The Argument), and an organizing conference (Welcomefest, which held its first gathering in 2024 but attracted far more attention this year). What unifies these various outfits is that they all blame progressive interest groups for relentlessly pushing Democrats to adopt positions well to the left of what the general public wants.

Persuasion 2025 was the leftist retort. Representative Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat from Texas, rebuked all who “blame progressive organizations for the Democratic Party's problems.” Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder of Way to Win, called for an “alignment of party and movement forces,” which apparently means bringing Democrats closer to progressive positions, rather than avoiding positions and rhetoric that alienate a majority of the electorate.

Numerous speakers warned against throwing any progressive constituency “under the bus,” a phrase that has become a term of art in the factional battle. It stands for the idea that Democrats should not retreat from positions taken on behalf of allies, however unpopular they may be. No compromise with the electorate was the conference's standing order.

This doctrine might sound irrational to anyone who recognizes that winning elections demands the support of that very electorate. But progressive activists have developed a coherent, if not persuasive, argument for it.

Read: Democrats don't seem willing to follow their own advice

First, they deny that polls showing any left-wing positions as unpopular convey meaningful information. Anat Shenker-Osorio, a progressive strategist, roundly dismissed the relevance of polling as “pollingism,” and rejected the very notion that politicians can win support by heeding public opinion. “We know that humans are in fact irrational creatures,” she explained from a panel at Persuasion 2025.

What's more, where voters do support regressive positions, Democrats should dismiss this as a kind of false consciousness. As various speakers argued, working-class voters facing economic stress tend to lash out at vulnerable targets. “When people are psychologically insecure, they are incapable of being welcoming to people who are different than them,” the activist Erica Payne said. “This is about money. Money, money, money, money, money, money, money.”

Attempting to disarm right-wing attacks by abandoning positions that are unpopular with these and other voters is not only unnecessary, but also futile. “You cannot feed your opposition's narrative,” Shenker-Osorio argued. She is even more absolute on her website: “Conventional wisdom says to meet people where they are. But, on most issues, where they are is unacceptable.”

Rapidly transforming the American public's beliefs is a daunting task—all the more so if you dismiss their current values as unacceptable. The Democratic Party's pragmatic wing has been pleading to broaden the tent, ideally before the Trump administration stamps out all opposition. The party's progressives seem determined to reeducate the public rather than compromise for their votes. This is a seductive approach if the goal is ideological purity. It is a problem only if the party hopes to win elections.

5 questions about Trump's Gaza plan.

Israel and Hamas will begin indirect talks in Egypt on Monday after Hamas said it would accept parts of President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan, including releasing all remaining Israeli hostages. I spoke with my colleague Josh Keating about what we know about the deal and its chances of succeeding for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

What happened on Friday? Is the war actually about to end?

On Friday, Hamas issued a response to the 20-point Gaza peace plan, which had been put forward by President Donald Trump last Monday and which had already been provisionally agreed to by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas announced that it had agreed to the deal, including the release of all its surviving hostages and the remains of those who have died, but stated that it wished to begin talks to “discuss the details” of the arrangement.

Though Trump appears to have interpreted this as a “yes,” skeptics in both Israel and the US suspect the group is just playing for time and will bog down the process in negotiation over the details.

On Saturday, following a demand from Trump, the Israeli military was ordered to halt its operations in Gaza in order to prepare for the prisoner release, though some strikes still took place.

What makes this plan different from previous failed efforts?

Unlike previous ceasefires, this deal would see all of Hamas's remaining Israeli hostages, taken on October 7, 2023, released at once. It would also see Hamas give up its weapons and its governance role in Gaza. As an inducement, the deal promises amnesty to Hamas members who lay down their arms.

The deal combines previous US proposals with more recent language worked out by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. It's purposely vague on a number of the stumbling blocks that have scuttled previous efforts to end the war. It envisions Israeli forces gradually withdrawing from the strip as the deal is implemented, but attaches no time frame to that withdrawal and allows Israel to keep a “security perimeter presence” inside Gaza indefinitely. It states that Hamas's rivals in the Palestinian Authority would eventually govern Gaza — previously a nonstarter for Israel — but only after an extensive “reform program.”

In the meantime, Gaza would be governed by a provisional government overseen by a “Board of Peace” that includes Blair and is overseen by Trump himself.

How much credit does Trump deserve in all of this?

According to reporting from Axios, the wider peace deal emerged out of conversations between the Trump administration and Arab governments over resolving the diplomatic crisis that followed Israel's bombing of Qatar in early September.

Those Arab countries signed onto the deal and reportedly pressured Hamas to agree to it. It reportedly took a “stern and clear” phone call from Trump to Netanyahu to dissuade the Israeli leader from rejecting the deal or demanding sweeping changes to it.

If all that's true, and if the deal actually works, Trump can fairly claim significant credit for it. But those are still big ifs.

What are you looking out for as we wait to see if this deal takes effect?

Negotiators for both Israel and Hamas are headed to Egypt this week to discuss the implementation of the deal. Hamas did not say anything in its statement on Friday about disarming — a key demand for Israel. It also seems plausible that Hamas may look to tie the withdrawal of Israeli forces from central Gaza to a more specific timetable.

This is still far from a done deal.

What's the current situation in Gaza? What would this deal mean for the Palestinian people?

In August, parts of Gaza were officially declared under famine, meaning more than 20 percent of households face extreme lack of food. Israel has ordered all residents of Gaza City, the enclave's most populous city, to evacuate ahead of a renewed ground offensive and on Thursday, just a day before Hamas's response, blocked the main road into the city to prevent people from returning. More than 400,000 people have fled the city in the last few weeks, and Israeli officials have stated that any who remain will be treated as enemy combatants.

The Gaza City operation is presumably off if the deal goes through. If it does not, Trump says that Israel would have his full support to “finish the job” — wiping out Hamas by military force no matter how many Gaza civilians or Israeli hostages die in the process.

The “anti-woke” commentator quit the New York Times in protest 5 years ago. Now she'll be CBS News's top editor. How?

The anti-woke backlash is coming for CBS News — in the person of Bari Weiss.

In a deal that will have seismic ramifications for the mainstream media, Paramount (CBS's parent company) has purchased The Free Press (Weiss's online publication) for around $150 million in cash and stock.

It's an enormous win for Weiss, an outspoken center-right commentator who quit an editing job for the New York Times' opinion section five years ago, and who has made criticism of the “woke left” a central theme of her work.

And the capstone is that, as part of the deal, Weiss will now be the editor-in-chief of CBS News — putting her in charge of a storied journalistic institution.

As of this writing, it isn't clear how Weiss (and Paramount CEO David Ellison, who arranged the deal) intend to go about remaking CBS News. But of late, Paramount seems to be keenly focused on pleasing the Trump administration and the right.

What is quite clear is that in the five years since Weiss broke with the mainstream media via her Times resignation — she publicly criticized what she said was the paper's adherence to progressive orthodoxy and intolerance of dissenting views — she's just kept rising to greater levels of influence and wealth, to her many critics' deep dismay.

Since its founding a little less than three years ago, the Free Press has become one of the top-earning Substack publications — perhaps the top — pulling in over $10 million a year from about 170,000 paying subscribers.

Among the many anti-woke newsletters on that platform, the Free Press rose to the top for a few reasons. Weiss decided to put together a whole publication, with many writers and contributors, rather than relying just on her own byline. She proved a skilled networker and fundraiser, getting initial startup money from, among others, venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and David Sacks — and following it up by raising millions more.

The influential economics blogger Tyler Cowen, in explaining why he became a Free Press columnist this year, cited its “startup” mentality, Weiss's “charisma,” and added that the publication “has the audience I wish to reach.”

That audience — disillusioned ex-liberal or centrist elites, often in blue states, who have broken with Democrats and the left but who generally aren't yet full MAGA or traditionally conservative — has shown up, with their views and their wallets, because the Free Press's ideological slant speaks to their concerns.

Indeed, one way to understand Weiss's impact is that she is a convener of a new faction on the right, one organized around recent issues and controversies that shook up traditional political loyalties. And now, one of this faction's champions — arguably its leader — will have a chance to reshape CBS News.

So what does the Free Press faction believe?

Though The Free Press has had a variety of writers with different views on various matters, its core worldview, I would argue, has five main pillars.

Weiss was one of the many who responded to the “Great Awokening” — the leftward shift among progressives on issues of identity, particularly race and gender — with skepticism and, eventually, outright opposition.

During her New York Times tenure, Weiss was drawn to those who argued something had gone awry in progressive discourse on campuses and elsewhere (she wrote a much-discussed story on a so-called “intellectual dark web”). Her work faced much criticism inside and outside the Times, sometimes for factual reasons, but also because she'd hit a nerve by claiming in the age of Trump that progressives were the intolerant ones.

Tensions came to a head in summer 2020, when the opinion section's top editor, James Bennet, was forced out after staffers went public to claim that an op-ed he had run had put Black staffers in danger. Not long afterward, Weiss quit too, posting her resignation letter denouncing Times culture on her website. “My own forays into Wrongthink have made me the subject of constant bullying by colleagues who disagree with my views,” she wrote.

Weiss went to Substack, a platform on which many “anti-woke” newsletters thrived. Frustration with wokeness and “cancel culture” was a powerful bonding agent: many people felt they'd been socially ostracized or had to self-censor, and they were tired of it. Before long, Weiss — who had called herself a centrist and said she voted for Joe Biden in 2020 — was making common cause with conservative activists like Christopher Rufo. They had common enemies.

Many critics of the Great Awokening were particularly perturbed by the shift left of major institutions, such as mainstream media outlets, academia, tech companies like Facebook and Twitter. To them, these institutions seemed totally dominated by progressives, constantly bending to their demands — while those who departed from the progressive consensus risked deplatforming, being accused of spreading dangerous or bigoted misinformation, and having their jobs threatened for saying the wrong thing.

So these institutions and “the experts” in general have become a constant punching bag for the Free Press — portrayed as politically biased and constantly wrong. (The Free Press launched as one of the outlets covering the “Twitter Files” that Elon Musk released to try to impugn his company's previous owners.)

During the pandemic, these issues of wokeness in institutions had become entangled with criticism of the public health establishment. Skeptics of vaccines, critics of lockdowns, and those pushing for speedier school reopenings all felt their views were being censored. So the Free Press became a home for such commentary — indeed, three of its contributors now have top public health posts in the Trump administration.

Without going “full populist,” the Free Press has also tried to expand the tent for who can count as an expert with views worth taking seriously. When they recently convened a roundup of expert reactions to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s tenure as health secretary, they included Zeke Emanuel and Emily Oster — but also vaccine skeptic Alex Berenson and Vani the “food babe” Hari.

But recently, there have been signs that Free Press editors think the pendulum is swinging a bit too much. A recent editorial opens with the requisite fulminations against the public health establishment — before professing to be “horrified” that Florida's surgeon general wants to end all vaccine mandates for children. It turns out that a ceaseless, years-long assault on the “experts” may bring some undesirable consequences.

Since Weiss was an undergraduate at Columbia University in the mid-2000s, she's been involved in the pro-Israel side of campus controversies; she wrote a book called How to Fight Anti-Semitism in 2019.

These issues were always a part of the Free Press mix, but they became utterly central to its coverage after the October 7, 2023, attacks. The publication cheered on Israel's war abroad, while arguing that a scourge of antisemitism on US college campuses was making Jewish students unsafe.

But as the war has stretched on, horrific conditions in Gaza haven't budged Weiss's support for what she's called “a war between civilization and barbarism” — one between “good and evil.” This August, a Free Press investigation insisted viral photos of starving Gazan children were misleading, because the children suffered from preexisting health conditions.

Weiss's critics often argue that her pro-Israel politics makes an awkward fit with her condemnation of other identity politics.“Weiss rails against identity politics as part of left extremism even as Jewish identity forms the central tenet of her own political approach,” the academic Judith Butler wrote back in 2019. Regardless of the internal coherence of this worldview, there's clearly an audience for it — especially after October 7.

Relatedly, the Free Press is broadly tolerant toward the contemporary right — including, as we'll get to in a minute, the president and his top officials. But the faction of the right they criticize the most is the conspiratorial populist far right. Think Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, and Candace Owens.

In February, Weiss worried in a speech that the “far right” — which she clarified was “not the one defined by cable news” — could devour “what remains of the center right.” Another Free Press article from July argued that “a visible faction of the MAGA movement is revising American history, reviving dangerous conspiracies, and erasing the taboo against open bigotry.”

These complaints are sometimes about explicit professed racism, but they very often tend to be about the antisemitism (sometimes alleged, sometimes indisputable) and criticism of Israel that is common on parts of the online right. And the far right has no love for the Free Press either; commentator Darryl Cooper asserted that the Free Press's true mission was “to make sure moderate liberals and conservatives newly skeptical of the mainstream narrative stay on the reservation with regard to Israel.”

The Free Press isn't an avowedly right-wing or pro-Trump publication. Its audience is people who find Fox News or other conservative media too hardline, lowbrow, or sycophantic toward the president. But they aren't an anti-Trump publication either — far from it.

Indeed, the standard Free Press take on Trump is that he should be understood as a politician with the support of about half the country who does some good things and some bad things — and not as an appalling aberrant figure and budding authoritarian who all decent people must despise. (Weiss has said she bristled at the “overzealous, out-of-touch, hysterical reaction” against Trump in his first term, and asserted that the reaction itself proved “extraordinarily authoritarian and totalitarian in its impulses”).

As Trump began his second term and proceeded to do various extreme and authoritarian things, the Free Press has criticized him about various matters (such as Trump planning to accept a plane from Qatar and going too far in his retribution efforts). But they've been strategic about how they do so — being careful not to tip over into becoming an “anti-Trump” publication, since that would cost them their influence on the right.

Some commentators who liked Weiss's anti-wokeness takes have been appalled at this stance toward Trump's second term. “The almost total avoidance of coverage of the current government threats to freedoms as basic as habeas corpus, due process and free speech on campus is quite something,” Andrew Sullivan wrote, adding: “When there is coverage, it's nitpicking in order to defend Trump.”

“Yes, PC-SJW-Critical-Woke-Intersectionality is bad, but some perspective, please,” Steven Pinker posted on X. “Blowing up the international order, sucking up to autocrats, wrecking the world economy, sowing doubt about vaccines, spreading medical quackery, strangling lifesaving foreign aid, pardoning violent rioters, preventing data collection, spewing nonstop lies, & extorting the press, law firms, and universities is worse.”

But the Free Press has found a good deal to like about Trump's second term — most notably, the strike on Iran, after which they editorialized: “Trump Keeps His Promise on Iran. The World Is Safer for It.”

Weiss has spent years pillorying the mainstream media for everything they get wrong, and has built her own alternative. Now, she'll face a challenge of a different magnitude — trying to put her stamp on a major, long-established mainstream TV news network: the home of 60 Minutes.

One big question is whether she — and Paramount CEO David Ellison — are hoping to change CBS News to be somewhat more responsive to conservatives' critiques, or whether they want to fully reshape it into a center-right operation.

According to a Semafor report, Weiss has discussed bringing on her old New York Times opinion section boss, James Bennet. Bennet has written at length about how he thought the Times went astray in 2020, but he isn't exactly a right-wing ideologue: He was the top editor at The Atlantic and was a contender to become the top Times editor as well before his ouster.

I tend to think that you don't put Weiss in charge of your mainstream media organization if you are seeking only minor changes. Which means we could be looking at a new version of the “Musk Twitter takeover” playbook — basically a wrecking ball, aimed at demolishing the old institution and creating something more ideologically pliable in its place.

The big question is just what Ellison (the son of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's richest person last month) wants — and why, exactly, he shelled out so much cash for the Free Press and Weiss. Little is known about David Ellison's politics, but his father has long been a Trump supporter, and both are staunch supporters of Israel.

There have also been signs that David Ellison is quite solicitous toward the administration. To get the merger that allowed him to become CEO past Trump's Federal Communications Commission, Paramount settled an absurdly groundless lawsuit by Trump over how 60 Minutes edited a Kamala Harris interview last year.

Then, once Ellison was ensconced, Trump's administration complained about how a Face the Nation interview of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was edited — spurring CBS to suddenly announce that they would now air such interviews unedited.

Last month, CBS News also named longtime conservative think tanker Kenneth Weinstein to be its new ombudsman, in charge of reviewing outside complaints about its coverage — fulfilling a commitment they'd made to the FCC to get the merger through.

How the deal placing Weiss atop the network will play out remains to be seen. Blatant ideological interference will surely lead to staff protests, if not an exodus. But that may be exactly what Weiss wants — to dismantle a citadel of the media establishment and create something new in its place.

Update, October 6, 9:38 am ET: This story, originally published early Monday morning, has been updated with the news that the Paramount/Free Press deal has closed.

Trump is attempting to deploy the National Guard in Portland and Chicago.

This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.

Welcome to The Logoff: The Trump administration is pushing harder to deploy National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago despite the protests of state and local leaders.

What's the latest? Up to 400 Texas National Guard troops are on their way to Chicago after a federal judge declined, for now, a request by the state of Illinois to block their deployment, which Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker described Monday as an “unconstitutional invasion.” They could arrive as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday.

Also over the weekend, a federal judge in Oregon slapped down two efforts by President Donald Trump to send National Guard troops — first from Oregon and then from California — into Portland. Trump has falsely described the city as “war ravaged.”

Why does Trump want to deploy troops? The administration has pointed to protests at ICE facilities in both Portland and Chicago as part of its rationale, though in terms that dramatically distort the actual impact of protests. Chicago, in particular, has faced a heavily militarized crackdown by federal immigration agents who have tear-gassed Chicagoans and arrested a city council member.

What's the context? In August, Trump deployed National Guard troops to Washington, DC, where they've had little to do besides some landscaping on National Park Service property. But Trump has suggested he has a darker vision for his troop deployments. “We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,” he told US military leadership last week.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

Why does this matter? Trump is trying to deploy soldiers into US cities to address a completely made-up set of facts, contrary to the wishes of those cities' leaders. In the process, he's recruiting red-state governors like Texas's Greg Abbott to help him go after his opponents. And his administration's rhetoric is getting increasingly histrionic. On Monday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller described anti-ICE protests in Portland as “the textbook definition of domestic terrorism.”

It's become controversial. Here's how to really think about it.

Empathy is in a weird place right now. Most of us probably think the ability to place ourselves in someone else's shoes is a good thing. That's what compassion is all about right? But a recent trend in conservative Christian circles is calling empathy into question. Some people even believe it's a sin.

Even those who think of empathy as a good thing struggle with the concept. Erica Steenberger, a therapist based in Chicago, admits that at times it can be overwhelming — and she's basically empathic for living. “I've been really thinking a lot lately about the darker side of being someone who practices empathy on purpose as a career all day, every day, and there's been some really hard parts of it that I was not prepared for,” she told the Explain It to Me hotline, Vox's weekly, call-in podcast.

If therapists struggle with empathy, Steenberger says she sees the way people in different professions do too. “Maybe somebody works retail and throughout the day, they deal with some angry people, some disappointed people, and they have some regular interactions too. But they're also chatting with their coworkers, and one of their coworkers is telling them about a really difficult thing happening in their family. And another coworker is talking about the stress of school. Then this person finishes their shift and they get in the car and they listen to the news and they're hearing about Gaza or they're hearing about deportations, and they're imagining what it would be like to be in that situation,” she tells Vox. “I just don't think someone going through that day is thinking about how much vicarious grief, vicarious stress, vicarious anxiety they've been around.”

So, is empathy a good thing, or a bad thing? According to Jamil Zaki, the answer is complicated. Zaki is a psychology professor at Stanford University, where he also leads the Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab. “I hesitate to just use good and bad to describe a psychological state like empathy. It just is,” he says.

How do we learn to be more empathetic? And what does empathy really mean in the first place? Zaki tells us on this week's episode of Explain It to Me.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

What is empathy? What exactly are we talking about here?

Empathy has three pieces. The first is vicariously sharing what other people feel, which is called emotional empathy. The second is trying to understand what life and reality is like for another person, which is cognitive empathy. And the third is caring about others and wishing for their well-being to improve, which is often called empathic concern, or compassion. These three pieces are connected to each other, but they can also be separated.

There's this idea that empathy is a sin. How do you think of that, as someone who studies it?

I've seen this in a lot of the very recent critiques of empathy — this idea that if you empathize with somebody, you're sort of giving up your own perspective, that you will end up agreeing with them or condoning whatever they do. That is not true at all.

I do think there are certain ways in which empathy can lead us to make decisions that we probably don't want to make. For instance, favoring somebody who we empathize with versus somebody who we don't know, or favoring people who we're close to because we understand their emotions more. That said, the idea that empathy is always toxic or that we should remove it from our lives seems quite misguided to me as well, because empathy has enormous fundamental ways of supporting everything that we do well as a species.

We often think of empathy as something that we do for other people, but it turns out that it actually helps us in many cases. In our lab we find that when people feel empathy for their roommates, classmates, for the people that they're close with, for instance, they themselves are less stressed, happier and less lonely. We also find that when you give to others, that's one of the best things that you can do for your physical and mental health. It helps us, the people who feel empathy, but it also helps the people around us. Physicians who are empathic treat their patients in ways that are more effective. Bosses who are empathic have happier and healthier employees. Parents and spouses who are empathic have healthier connections with family.

Finally, empathy helps us connect at a broad scale. People who feel it are more likely to volunteer, to donate to charity, and to see people who are different from them free from the lens of prejudice, stereotyping, and bias. So there are lots of benefits.

“We often think of empathy as something that we do for other people, but it turns out that it actually helps us in many cases.”

What's going on in our brains when we're empathic? 

Well, let's be clear that empathy doesn't always make us feel better. For instance, if you were in my lab right now and we were scanning your brain, and you saw somebody else experience pain — like stub their toe or accidentally cut themselves with a knife — the parts of your brain that would come online would not be those associated with pleasure, but with pain. Your brain would look as though you were going through the situation that this person was.

But when we can use that empathy to make a positive difference for somebody else, that's when you start to experience benefits. If I were to scan your brain while you instead did something kind for somebody who you felt connected to, the parts of your brain that come online when you eat chocolate would also be active. I think a lot of us these days feel empathy, but don't take any action. You go online and you see tragedy after tragedy, suffering all over the world and you feel helpless. That's not a very healthy state for a person to be in. But when we can turn empathy into action, that's when it starts to benefit us.

Are people naturally empathetic, or is this something we learn over time?

I think a little bit of both. As a species, we are enormously empathic. We can care for people who are thousands of miles away, who we will never meet. We can care for future generations who haven't been born yet. We can care for fictional characters who don't even exist. That's something that no other animal does. So our capacity for empathy is fantastic.

That said, it's also something that changes with our experience. Certain experiences can cause our empathy to weaken and atrophy, and others can cause it to strengthen and grow like a muscle. It is a skill, and crucially, that means that by practicing the right habits, we can build our empathy on purpose.

Okay, so if empathy is like a muscle, how do we work that muscle? How do we become more empathetic?

We've found that people who think that empathy is a fixed trait are less likely to work on it and less likely to grow. But people who know that it's a skill try to work on it — try to grow and actually do as a result. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you think you can change, you're going to be right. And if you think you can't change, you're also going to be right. Empathy changes, not because you do some grandiose thing once, but it changes because you just take a slightly different approach to what you do every day. I encourage people to put a daily calendar hold for just five minutes where they can perform a small act of goodwill or service.

Another really critical habit to develop is humility. Oftentimes, the reason that we can't empathize with other people is because we're too confident in our own perspective, especially during disagreements. It's critical to say, “What don't I know? What does this person have to teach me?” And shifting our goal in conversations from scoring points and dunking on people to trying to learn from them.

The real reason why the animated movie resonates.

Netflix's mega-hit KPop Demon Hunters is now the streaming platform's most popular movie of all time. But its ascendance as 2025's surprise cultural phenomenon extends far beyond the animated movie itself.

It's the music. It is the first soundtrack to have four songs in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, with the single “Golden” reaching No. 1 for several weeks. The high-octane songs have the glossy production, catchy hooks, and charisma Korean pop is famous for.

The story follows girl group trio Huntr/x, who adore their fans as much as slurping ramyeon. But there's a twist: they lead double lives to protect the world from demons through their music. Standing in their way are The Saja Boys. They're demons masquerading as a human boy band, fighting back with infectious pop tunes and 8-pack abs to thwart Huntr/x's critical mission.

That premise did not impress Sony, the studio that made the movie but ultimately passed distribution to Netflix.

One of the reasons why the movie is so special is that it honors k-pop's status as one of the world's most popular genres, said Rebecca Sun, author of The Quiet Part Substack about cultural news and criticism. K-pop groups like Blackpink, BTS, TWICE, and NewJeans don't always get as much love from American tastemakers, even though their music and presence is literally everywhere.

“I found that every single project that highlights some sort of historically excluded culture or some subculture,” Sun said, “they always are more successful if they just throw you in there rather than attempt to handhold you in some cheesy way.”

Below is an excerpt of a conversation between Today, Explained host Noel King and Sun, edited for length and clarity. There's more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did this movie come from? How did Netflix get a hold of it?

So this is another brilliant part of the narrative.

The movie is completely produced by Sony Pictures Animation, which is the studio that made the Oscar-winning Spiderverse movies. And the two directors, Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, had deals with Sony. So it was completely developed in-house within Sony. They pitched Sony's distribution arm and they passed. Sony said, yeah, I don't think we're going to put this movie out ourselves.

Simultaneously, Sony had a first-look deal with Netflix. This was a deal that was struck around the time of the pandemic where Netflix said, “Hey, we promise that we will finance at least one or two of your movies a year. We'll put them on our streaming service and we'll just buy them for you. So you make them, we will pay, we reimburse you for the entire production budget and the rest is history.”

And Sony was not the only entity to underestimate this movie. You actually wrote on your Substack that you ignored an invitation from Netflix to prescreen this movie. Why? What was going through your head?

Okay, so first of all, I cannot compare myself anywhere to the level of import as a player in this universe.

To me, you are.

Thank you. But this is what was going through my head: As somebody who's been covering entertainment for a very long time, I had been tracking K-pop projects in Hollywood for a decade. Like, Hollywood has been trying to make K-pop themed projects since at least 2015, which is the earliest known project that I could find. And so it was more my cynicism about the industry's historic failure to make a successful scripted K-pop feature.

But look, it wasn't just me. Because merchandising — you know they tried, Netflix tried going to merch retailers to say, hey, do you want to partner with us on this movie we have coming out, KPop Demon Hunters, and all the merchandisers passed.

So yeah, whatever toy companies passed on making stuffed Derpy tigers, they could have made so much money this summer.

But this raises a very interesting question, right, because I don't know a ton about K-pop, but I do know that Korean music and Korean movies have had stunning global appeal for years now. Why, to this point, was nobody able to pull off this type of movie and why did this movie hit, do you think?

One commonality I found in all of the K-pop projects that never made it to the finish line was they were all written from the point of view of what I call the outsider's gaze. So there were several projects where the protagonist was a Westerner, and in most cases a white character, who was imported to Korea to the K-pop scene for some reason. It's always been this fish out of water trope. And I think that that comes from studio executives who themselves are not K-pop fans, but have just read in the papers that K-pop is big. They were like, let's do a K-pop thing, but let's make sure that this exotic thing makes sense to people. They're trying to sort of reverse-engineer its popularity.

Whereas KPop Demon Hunters, what's interesting about it is that it takes place in a universe where [it's] just assumed that every single person in the world, every single character in the movie is obsessed with K-pop. Every single person from kids to old men at the sauna listen to K-pop, participate in the subculture's rituals, and there's no explanation.

I was talking to some friends, they are 4 and 6 years old, and they were telling me how much they love KPop Demon Hunters. And I was talking to their mom at one point over their heads. And we were saying like, okay, we get it.

How long do you think this movie is going to dominate for? At what point does the obsession fade?

That's a question to ask some kids.

UPDATE, October 6, 2025: This article was originally published on October 4, 2025. It has been updated after AMD announced it had entered into a multi-year deal to provide chips to OpenAI.

Lisa Su is the engineer behind one of the most dramatic corporate turnarounds in the tech industry.

The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia.

On Monday, the company announced that it had agreed to a massive multi-year deal to provide its AI chips to OpenAI. The announcement sent AMD's stock soaring as much as 27% in premarket trading.

When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025.

But Su's leadership has not been without challenges. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing.

Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation:

Lisa Tzwu-Fang Su was born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1969, to Su Chun-hwai and Sandy Lo. Her family immigrated to the US when she was around the age of three, because her father, a statistician, was pursuing his graduate studies at the University of Texas in Austin. Her mother at that time was an accountant. The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City.

As a child, Su liked to take apart and rebuild remote-controlled cars and other gadgets, which sparked her interest in engineering. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986.

Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s.

Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies.

After leaving the academic environment, Su worked in engineering, research, and managerial positions at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor.

As the lead scientist at the IBM Semiconductor R&D Center, she contributed to the development of copper interconnects in chips, replacing aluminum ones. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research.

Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion.

At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. However, the PC market was shrinking in the early 2010s while demand for smartphones and tablets was booming.

AMD began to adopt a ""semi-custom"" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market.

In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD.

In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel.

In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles.

The development of the Ryzen chips helped revive its market share among consumer products, while the simultaneous launch of the EPYC processor chips helped carve its share among data centers and servers. Companies with a large demand for cloud, like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, have all been adopting EPYC chips.

In 2018, AMD also managed to launch the world's first 7-nanometer data center GPUs, namely the Radeon Instinct MI50 and MI60.

By 2020, AMD's market cap had reached over $110 billion.

Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, ""Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?"" at the CEO, who was sponsoring the event.

""I'm with AMD,"" Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility.

In 2022, Su became the first MIT alumna to make a gift for a building that will bear her own name. Originally called Building 12, the home of MIT.nano was renamed the Lisa T. Su Building.

Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology.

Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. Her spouse is Daniel Lin, but it is unclear when the pair got married or if they have children. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together.

Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends.

Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title.

Su and Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia and the biggest competitor to AMD, are actually related. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother.

Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers.

AMD's business has grown more than a hundred times since Su took the wheel, but it is still just a fraction of the size of the $4.4 trillion Nvidia.

When asked if she thinks she could outcompete Nvidia, Su told Wired in an August interview that she doesn't necessarily want to be compared to Intel and Nvidia, because ""the market is humongous"" and she sees plenty of opportunities.

On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware.

In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential.

But Su was not angry. Instead, she hopped on a 90-minute call with the SemiAnalysis's lead analyst the next day to hear him out.

""Feedback is a gift even when it's critical,"" Su wrote in a post on X after the call, ""We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem.""

Similar to Nvidia's H20 chips, AMD has developed chips specifically for the Chinese market in response to past US export control regulations, namely the MI308 AI chips.

In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market.

""We lead today because we have the best technology. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play,"" said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. ""They may not be as good as we are today, but frankly, usage really spurs innovation.""

In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses.

On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an ""excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead.""

The AI Action Plan has faced criticism for attempting to override state-level AI governance and withholding AI infrastructure funding from states with more stringent regulations.

On Monday, AMD announced it had agreed to a multi-billion-dollar partnership to supply its artificial intelligence chips to OpenAI.

The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia.

The multi-year deal, announced Monday, will see OpenAI deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs, with the first 1 gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026.

It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets.

""This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential,"" Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said.

Business Insider Edition 

South Africa has dispatched a team of investigators to France following the sudden death of its ambassador, Nathi Mthethwa, who was found dead in his Paris hotel room earlier this week.


        South Africa is sending a team of top investigators to Paris to assist with the probe into the death of Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa, whose body was discovered in the inner courtyard of the Hyatt Regency hotel after an apparent fall from the 22nd floor.
    


        French authorities have launched an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his passing, while Pretoria has called for a thorough investigation to determine the cause of death.
    


        National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five seasoned police officers will work alongside French authorities to ensure a thorough and transparent inquest.
    


        Ambassador Emmanuel Nkosinathi “Nathi” Mthethwa, 58, was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday, September 30, at the Hyatt Regency in western Paris.
    


        The South African diplomat had been reported missing the day before after his wife said she received a distressing message from him, in which he apologized and suggested he intended to take his life.
    


        French prosecutors said the room was on the 22nd floor and that the window's safety mechanism had been tampered with. They found no immediate signs of struggle, nor traces of drugs or foul play in initial examinations.



        President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed sorrow over the incident, calling Mthethwa's passing “tragic” and offering condolences to his family.
    


        His appointment as ambassador to France began in December 2023, following a long political career in which he served as Minister of Police and Minister of Sports, Arts & Culture.
    


        Complicating matters, Mthethwa had in recent weeks been mentioned during testimony at a judicial commission investigating political interference and corruption in South Africa's criminal justice system.
    


        Some reports suggest he faced allegations of obstructing investigations while serving as police minister, though he was never formally charged.
    


        A close ally of former South African President Jacob Zuma, who is himself facing corruption charges, Mthethwa's career was marked by controversy.
    


        His tenure as police minister remains indelibly linked to the 2012 Marikana massacre, one of South Africa's darkest post-apartheid tragedies, when police opened fire on striking miners, killing 34.
    


        National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five officers have been deployed to Paris to work with French authorities on the probe into Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa's death.
    


        He said the officers' role is to “support a thorough and transparent inquest.”
    


        French prosecutors stated that initial investigations suggest the death may have been a deliberate act, citing a message the ambassador sent to his wife indicating his intention to end his life.
    


        They added that no immediate signs of foul play were found at the scene, but the investigation remains ongoing.

Harvey's CEO told Business Insider he's growing his $5 billion legal AI startup by focusing on two things: regular calendar audits and hands-on hiring.

Winston Weinberg, who cofounded Harvey three years ago, said in an interview on the sidelines of TechLaw.Fest in Singapore in September that as Harvey doubles revenue roughly every six months, the demands of running the company change just as quickly.

""When that happens structurally, you just get all of this pressure as the CEO,"" he told Business Insider. ""The only way to relieve that pressure is to completely level up and change how you operate,"" he added.

To keep up, he said he conducts what he calls a ""calendar audit,"" combing through how he spends his time and deciding what to drop, what to delegate, and what to take on personally.

Weinberg said his aim is to automate himself out of daily operations so he can focus on what he sees as a CEO's three core jobs: recruiting, product, and customers.

""Every founder wants this — you're trying to automate yourself away,"" he said.

""I want to be able to feel that when something goes wrong or something is the No. 1 priority, that I can focus all of my time on that, and the rest of the company is humming,"" he added.

Hiring is the one area Weinberg won't delegate, especially in new offices. He said he wants to be involved with the first hires whenever Harvey opens a new office.

The company said its APAC office in Sydney opened last month. It will hire about 15 people there this year, with plans to increase its head count further after that.

Those first hires really matter because they are ""going to go out and hire more people,"" he said.

He added that in some cases, he has tapped existing Harvey employees with local roots to lead new offices — like the company's head of Australia, who was born and raised there.

While larger AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic can outspend him, Weinberg said Harvey's edge comes from empowering leaders early.

""What we can do is we definitely promote junior talent, and you will have just way more ownership at our company,"" he said of the 350-person company.

""There are folks that have never managed people in their entire careers that are now managing 20 people,"" he added.

Some tech leaders have also echoed that it's wiser to work for startups over big companies.

Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham said on X last year that while working for big companies might be ""safer,"" the connections forged with startup colleagues can cue up future success.

""In 10 years they'll be running everything,"" Graham wrote of startup employees, ""even if the startup tanks.""

Prince William says his parents' failed relationship taught him what kind of partner and parent he wants to be.

During an appearance on Canadian actor Eugene Levy's Apple TV+ series ""The Reluctant Traveler,"" the Prince of Wales said he wanted to give his children as normal a home life as possible. The episode aired on Friday.

""I think it's really important that that atmosphere is created at home. You have to have that warmth, that feeling of safety, security, love,"" William told Levy. ""That all has to be there, and that was certainly part of my childhood.""

However, since his parents got divorced when he was 14, that sense of stability ""lasted a short period of time,"" William said.

""But you take that and you learn from it and you try and make sure you don't do the same mistakes as your parents,"" he said. ""I think we all try and do that. I just want to do what's best for my children, but I know that the drama and the stress when you're small really affects you when you're older.""

William also shared that one of the ways his family bonds is by sitting down at the dinner table together.

""So, we sit and chat, it's really important. None of our children have any phones, which we're very strict about,"" William said.

Williams's parents, Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles, wed on July 29, 1981. Their marriage was troubled from the beginning, overshadowed by Charles's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. Diana and Charles separated in 1992 and finalized their divorce in 1996. The following year, Diana died in a car crash.

Reflecting on the ""insatiable"" media scrutiny that followed his parents' marriage, and his mother in particular, William said that it made him more protective of his own family.

""They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they'd be everywhere. If you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family,"" William said.

A representative for William did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside regular hours.

William isn't the only public figure to reflect on how their parents' relationship shaped their own approach to family and marriage.

During a March appearance on the ""Sibling Revelry"" podcast, Macaulay Culkin said his strained relationship with his father taught him what not to do as a parent.

""It's one of my earliest memories of him was, 'When I grew up, this is how I'm not gonna be with my kids,'"" Culkin told podcast hosts Kate and Oliver Hudson.

In July, Tracee Ellis Ross said her mother, Diana Ross, inspired her to find joy and meaning in being alone.

""[My mom] didn't build the wealth she has, she didn't build the career she made because of a man. The example that was set for me [was] that I didn't need a man to build the life I wanted. It wasn't, 'Look at me,' it was, 'This is me.' And that informed something very important for me foundationally,"" Ross told Self Magazine.

Robotaxis are becoming common in some big US cities, but they're still novelties in many.

In Atlanta and Austin, for instance, companies like Uber and Lyft started offering rides in driverless cars earlier this year, but some riders have told me they've had to go out of their way to hail one. Where I live, in Washington, DC, you can spot self-driving cars on the road — Google's Waymo, for one, is testing them in the market — but they're not yet available to customers.

In San Francisco, meanwhile, self-driving cars are everywhere.

On a trip there last week, I couldn't walk around the areas like Union Square and Market Street in the city center without seeing a car drive by without anyone at the wheel.

It was a strange sight for me, but I shouldn't have been surprised. Waymo has been operating driverless rides in San Francisco since 2022, and the company opened the service up to anyone who downloads its app in the city last year.

After days of seeing robotaxis pass me on the street, I decided to hail a Waymo car and see what it's like to ride one in a city where they've become so ubiquitous. Here's what I found.

I wanted to get from my hotel near Union Square to a meeting about 12 minutes away, so I pulled out my phone to check availability and prices.

I was traveling close to 9:30 a.m., so I expected to hit rush-hour traffic and see higher prices than if I had waited until later in the day.

Despite not having a human driver to pay, Waymo charged me more than Uber or Lyft would have for the same trip.

After booking with Waymo, I pulled up the two other ride-hailing services to compare prices. An UberX ride would have cost around $13, while Lyft, which was running a discount when I checked, would have charged about $10.

With a 20% tip, the Uber ride would have cost about the same as Waymo, but the Lyft ride would've been a few dollars cheaper.

A Waymo spokesperson said that the company looks at multiple factors when pricing rides, such as the trip's duration and distance. ""During busier times, such as morning rush hour and weekends, prices may be higher,"" the spokesperson said.

Self-driving cars, especially ones operated by Waymo, are everywhere in the center of San Francisco.

During the six-minute wait for my ride, I noticed at least a half-dozen other Waymo vehicles drive by, including two right next to each other. Going around town over the previous couple of days, I found out how hard it was to even walk around a city block without seeing at least one or two self-driving cars.

I initially missed the notification that my car had arrived. As I looked around my pickup location, though, I couldn't see a Waymo stopped near me.

After checking the map, I realized that it had stopped down the block and up another street. While it took less than a minute to walk there, I wondered why the car had not navigated to my designated pick-up point.

Waymo uses several factors, such as zoning, traffic, and walking distance, to determine where its vehicles pick up and drop off passengers, with the goal of ""balancing safety and convenience,"" the Waymo spokesperson said.

I knew that this was my car from the license plate, which was on-screen in the Waymo app. My initials were also visible on the console that was on the roof.

The street where my car stopped wasn't as busy as the one I waited on, which might explain why it was there.

I found it funny that there were three other Waymo cars stopped behind it.

I had to slide this button forward in the Waymo app to indicate I was ready to leave.

Sitting in the back of the electric Jaguar I-Pace, I noticed a screen on the console between the two front seats.

As the car started moving, a safety video started playing. It reminded me to buckle my seatbelt and said that I shouldn't touch the steering wheel or the pedals.

Some people I know swear that they'll never get in one of these cars because no one is behind the wheel. I didn't find it that strange, in part because I was traveling along city streets at low speeds.

Still, I couldn't help but take a video of the empty driver's seat, especially as the car made a turn and the wheel rotated without anyone present.

At one point, the car stopped in the middle of an intersection.

As I tried to look ahead and see what was happening, I noticed that the screen in the front of the car laid out the situation for me: Someone was crossing the street one vehicle ahead, and the car I was in had noticed and stopped.

The screen between the front seats also allowed me to call support if there was an issue.

Fortunately, my destination was on a less-busy street than the one where I hailed the car, so it was able to pull up directly in front of my destination.

As I got out, the Waymo app prompted me to leave a review and offered walking directions to my destination (which I didn't need, in this case).

I felt safe riding in Waymo's vehicle, and with the company's expansion to other cities, I would try one again.

But I probably won't pay a premium to ride in a Waymo again. If Uber and Lyft are cheaper, I'd likely take a ride with one of those services.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance.

Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections.

This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world.



After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch.

Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now ""feels extremely busy.""

He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. ""The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing,"" he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion.

Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. ""Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out,"" he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on.

Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski ""quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research,"" he said.

After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: ""I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward.""

Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors.

""I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen,"" Papatheodorou told Business Insider.

She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk.

""I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer,"" she said. ""It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to.""

Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave.

Her role, she admits, is ""incredibly high pressure."" Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving.

She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. ""Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients,"" she joked.

As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible.

Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee.

That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds.

Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities.

Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a ""no-brainer"" for him, he said.

Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl.

He sources potential deals by ""hanging around the hoop"" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from ""vanity and trophy assets"" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said.

Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business.

""Golf is all about strategy,"" she said. ""I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions.""

Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities.

She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a ""unique way"" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to ""disentangle"" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and ""have agendas that they want to do on their own.""

Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. ""I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,"" she said. ""I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.""

She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023.

Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: ""My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles.""

In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history.

It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record.

Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys.

Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. ""Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US,"" he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, ""further sparked my interest in global markets.""

At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business.

""For me, it has always been a team sport,"" he said, ""doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees.""

From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak.

It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. ""I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating,"" she told Business Insider.

As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group.

Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda.

Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. ""It helps us accelerate our development road map materially,"" she said.

Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of ""why not try to apply myself and see what happens.""

Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn't the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen.

Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum.

The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street.

Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector.

The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen.

And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion.

Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors.

In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals.

Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs.

""The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you,"" Mittal said. ""My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also.""

Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, ""that is not related to my immediate tasks.""

""I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months,"" Mittal said. ""To reconnect with potential possibilities.""

A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry.

As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. ""I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments,"" she said.

Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year.

Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began.

Chang said she's a ""big proponent of always getting on the ground."" At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings.

Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries.

When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career.

""It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution,"" Chakravorty said.

Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity.

Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas.

Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion.

The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a ""very accelerated"" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert.

Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession.

""The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks,"" she said.

Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity.

""All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world,"" Kane said.

Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on.

After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team.

The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines.

""I love complex problems, trying to figure them out,"" Kane said.

In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo.

""We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business,"" Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic.

Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers.

""We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past,"" Kane said. ""Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company.""

The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets.

Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook.

O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has ""just scratched the surface"" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider.

""Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box,"" she said.

O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a ""de-risked startup,"" integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said.

The explosive growth in private credit was ""very much the thesis"" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower.

A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows.

""Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health,"" she said.

In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand.

At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and ""lost my voice by the end of the night,"" he said.

A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015.

When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business.

""The first deal I did was $125 million,"" Kirchoff said. ""Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week.""

Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments.

The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position.

""I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me,"" Kirchoff said.

He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt ""ended up being a really good transaction for the firm,"" Kirchoff said.

Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's ""generalist"" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries.

His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air.

""There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve,"" he said.

And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. ""We don't have any walls at Apollo,"" he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said.

""We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open,"" Kearney said.

Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year.

""It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition,"" Kearney said.

The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. ""Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses,"" he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: ""I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like.""

That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions.

Miami-based Park is ""incredibly proud"" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two ""best in class"" SaaS companies, he said. ""Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors,"" Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's ""still relatively new"" compared to some players, he noted.

Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a ""chip on my shoulder"" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship.

In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him ""under his wing,"" is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues ""played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward."" Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an ""open-door"" culture for juniors: ""I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions.""

When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that ""barely existed,"" he told Business Insider.

Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies.

UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought ""an area of finance where there was huge growth potential,"" that was ""off the beaten path.""

He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being ""at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction.""

He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring ""extremely nuanced"" deals through investment committees.

In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds.

In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets.

This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations.

Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators.

About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change.

""My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually,"" he said.

So he called Goldman and said, ""Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?""

He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. ""The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with,"" he said — a sign that the market is picking up.

His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. ""Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual,"" he said. ""The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world.""

His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: ""You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us.""

Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry.

""I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well,"" he said.

​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves.

Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans.

As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: ""There was an error in the book!""

He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an ""extremely competitive applicant pool,"" one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia.

""He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets,"" a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost ""giddy"" about esoteric aspects of the market.

Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said.

Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team.

Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades.

""He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets,"" the former colleague said.

Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview.

Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: ""unparalleled exposure"" to global business leaders and policymakers.

Kress long knew she wanted a career at the ""intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets."" Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders.

She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a ""dream job"" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real.

Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients ""realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives,"" she said.

A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing.

She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, ""never shooting from the hip,"" and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the ""culmination"" of her career.

A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs.

Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour.

From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite.

It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place.

After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area ""a little slower than I would have liked.""

A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year.

He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering ""one of the toughest intellectual challenges."" Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data.

Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and ""old-school macro investing practices,"" such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often.

Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: ""I love the world of investing.""

From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews.

When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was ""a blessing in disguise,"" says Woodson.

""You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years,"" Woodson said.

A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career.

Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment.

He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium.

Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's ""trustworthy and honest"" and ""people love working for and with him,"" one buy-side client said.

""You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both,"" said Malafronte.

Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.)

""When things seem too obvious, they probably are,"" he added.

Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics.

Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires.

Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund.

There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies.

He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year.

Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics.

Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant.

Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders.

Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work ""compound"" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning.

Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago.

Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading.

He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. ""She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well,"" he said.

He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: ""I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.""

In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others.

Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times.

It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out.

Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him.

After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors.

He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld.

Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager.

Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets.

Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a ""once-in-a-career"" opportunity.

Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently.

The episode shaped her philosophy to be an ""internal expert"" on her client.

""I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer,"" Naylor said.

One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself ""in the room,"" weighing in on key decisions.

One objective for the team has been tackling the ""gray market,"" the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities.

Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the ""Gray Trading Panel"" on Bloomberg terminals.

The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. ""I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined,"" Naylor said.

Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets.

""Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career,"" Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient.

Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through ""some pretty turbulent markets,"" like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to ""grind out sales"" during that time helped prove her chops to management.

""I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once,"" Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. ""As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident.""

Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's ""intellectually stimulating."" The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver.

Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

The move: AMD stock surged as much as 38% on Monday to $226.71 ahead of the opening bell, rebounding after it fell 3% on Friday. The rally brought the semiconductor producer's year-to-date gain to 88% at intraday highs.

Why: AMD announced a multi-year agreement with OpenAI to provide AI chips to the ChatGPT maker, specifically advanced graphics processing units.

The chipmaker will deploy its AMD Instinct GPUs to help power OpenAI's fast-growing infrastructure, with the first deployment scheduled for the second quarter of 2026. In total, all the AMD chip deployments will extend 6 gigawatts of power to OpenAI, across multiple generations of AI infrastructure.

""Under this definitive agreement, OpenAI will work with AMD as a core strategic compute partner to drive large-scale deployments of AMD technology starting with the AMD Instinct MI450 series and rack-scale AI solutions and extending to future generations,"" AMD noted in a statement.

The deal also gives OpenAI the option to take a 10% stake in AMD. The chipmaker has issued it a warrant for 160 million shares of AMD common stock, which will vest as they reach certain milestones.

What it means: This news follows a deal between OpenAI and Nvidia, in which the chip giant will provide OpenAI with hardware to build new data facilities as part of a $100 billion investment.

The blockbuster deal was thought to be a bearish development for AMD, elevating its top competitor, Nvidia, in its partnership with the face of the AI boom in recent years.

However, with AMD's own OpenAI deal in the books, the chip maker is in a better competitive position, with its tech getting a major endorsement from the top AI developer.

""This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. ""AMD's leadership in high-performance chips will enable us to accelerate progress and bring the benefits of advanced AI to everyone faster.""

Bari Weiss has a new home.

The anti-establishment journalist is now the editor-in-chief of storied CBS News. David Ellison's Paramount Skydance has hired Weiss and acquired The Free Press, the conservative-friendly news site Weiss founded after leaving The New York Times' opinion section. Ellison's Paramount bought The Free Press for about $150 million, a source familiar with the acquisition said.

Paramount announced the news on Monday morning. The editor-in-chief role is a new position for CBS News, reporting to Ellison.

Paramount said in a statement that Weiss ""will shape editorial priorities, champion core values across platforms, and lead innovation in how the organization reports and delivers the news."" It's not immediately clear what level of involvement Weiss will have in the newsroom's day-to-day operation and who will report to her. Paramount said Weiss ""will partner with CBS News President Tom Cibrowski.""

The Free Press ""will maintain its own independent brand and operations, and continue to do reporting, video and audio podcasts, and events,"" Paramount added.

""Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News,"" Ellison said in a statement. ""This move is part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects — directly and passionately — to audiences around the world.""

Not all CBS News staffers will be giving Weiss a warm welcome. Business Insider spoke with five current and former employees across CBS News and Paramount who said they had hesitations about Ellison's decision to bring on Weiss.

Some staffers were already on edge after Paramount settled President Donald Trump's lawsuit against ""60 Minutes"" in July for $16 million. Now, they worry Weiss's arrival could further entangle the newsroom politically.

""The general sense is, 'This can't be happening,'"" said a high-ranking journalist at CBS News, who doesn't think hiring Weiss would pay off since she doesn't have a background in TV. Weiss has worked on the editorial sides of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. It's worth noting that NBC News President Rebecca Blumenstein also came from those two newspapers without a background in TV.

One CBS News reporter was optimistic that Ellison's appointment of an editor-in-chief could signal that the news organization is prioritizing digital at a time when its TV audience is steadily shrinking. This person also questioned whether Weiss is qualified for the role.

""This partnership allows our ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience,"" Weiss said in a statement. ""We honor the extraordinary legacy of CBS News by committing ourselves to a singular mission: building the most trusted news organization of the 21st Century.""

A cultural commentator like Weiss seems like ""quite an odd choice"" to lead CBS News, said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the media nonprofit Poynter Institute. CBS News is not overtly partisan but faces trust gaps across the political spectrum. Less than a quarter of Republicans trust the network, and Democrats view it less favorably than its peers, according to the Pew Research Center.

CBS News is hierarchical and grounded in history, said a longtime ""60 Minutes"" employee who left earlier this year. By contrast, Weiss is a contrarian who ""likes to go rogue"" and is highly opinionated on hot-button issues, like Israel's involvement in Gaza, they said.

""How does she engender trust with the journalists she's trying to oversee?"" the former ""60 Minutes"" veteran said.

While The Free Press appeals to some conservatives, it's not a far-right site. Weiss and Co. have criticized Trump and his allies, including when the FCC pressured local ABC affiliates into deplatforming Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show.

""If they wanted a beloved-by-MAGA person, I'm not sure she's it,"" Edmonds said.

In fact, Weiss is divisive precisely because she's not overtly partisan, said media analyst Alan Wolk, who cofounded TV research firm TVREV.

""She's demonized by both sides,"" Wolk said.

In any case, hiring Weiss shortly after installing right-leaning ombudsman Kenneth Weinstein to monitor for bias may shift the perception of CBS News. Media industry observers are split on whether that's for the best, and how audiences feel may depend on their political leanings.

""Trying to broaden your audience by bringing in different points of view is rarely successful, particularly with network news,"" TV industry consultant Cathy Rasenberger previously told Business Insider.

Former ABC News anchor Terry Moran is more optimistic.

""Viewpoint diversity will make things better,"" Moran said when asked about rumors of Weiss joining CBS News. ""There's a monoculture and monothink in established media, and breaking that can only be good.""

The former longtime ""60 Minutes"" staffer also said Weiss could jazz up CBS News with her knack for podcasts and newsletters.

""That's probably a good thing if it's going to stay alive and relevant,"" this person said.

While hiring Weiss might be risky, it's driving buzz about CBS News — arguably for the first time since the ""60 Minutes"" lawsuit settlement.

""For putting attention on CBS News, it's a brilliant move,"" Wolk said.

Deloitte has agreed to partially refund an Australian government department after errors were discovered in a report completed partly using the technology.

The Big Four firm had been contracted to conduct an assurance review of the country's Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF), part of the IT system that administers welfare and benefits payments. The firm completed the seven-month project, which was worth 440,000 Australian dollars, around $290,000, in June.

But the final report, published in July, was found to contain multiple errors, including academic references to people who didn't exist and a made-up quote from a Federal Court judgment, the Australian Financial Review first reported.

The errors were noticed by the Australian welfare academic Chris Rudge.

An updated version of the report was published on the website of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations on Friday. The new copy deletes more than a dozen nonexistent references and footnotes, rewrites the reference list, and corrects multiple typographic errors, the AFR reported.

In the updated report, Deloitte also disclosed that its methodology ""included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT — 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR's Azure tenancy.""

The detail that AI was used was not part of the report published in July, according to AFR.

Deloitte ""confirmed some footnotes and references were incorrect"" on the review and has agreed to repay the final installment under its contract, a DEWR spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.

The spokesperson added that the changes did not change the review's substance or overall recommendations on the TCF system.

Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about whether AI caused the errors.

The tech hiring market is being pulled in two directions: a flood of candidates for certain roles and stark shortages in others.

New survey data from Indeed highlights the unevenness of the tech talent landscape and the profound impact of AI on reshaping the skills employers need most.

While many tech jobs attract an oversupply of applicants, the study found that key areas, such as cloud computing, data analytics, and AI development, are still starved for qualified professionals.

""What began as a cyclical downturn in tech hiring may now be entering a new phase — one shaped by the rise of AI, increased requirements, and less demand for entry-level talent,"" Indeed wrote in a report released on Monday.

The study analyzed data from Indeed and Glassdoor on tech jobs, in combination with a commissioned survey of 1,035 tech workers in the US conducted by YouGov. Participants, primarily working in software and IT, answered an online questionnaire between late May and early June.

Generative AI is reshaping career paths. The Indeed study identified tech jobs that have been axed the most when companies adjust their operations to embrace generative AI.

Here are the top four roles that got cut in AI-inspired reorganizations:

Indeed found that after such reorganizations, companies often reallocated resources to new tech roles. Here are the top three areas that benefited:

The top skills requested in tech job listings posted in the first half of 2025 include Python, SQL, and Amazon Web Services, according to Indeed data.

Indeed also looked at which areas of tech exhibited the largest increases in job listings. Fields that stood out included AI, Python, Google Cloud Platform, and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), a process for integrating and releasing software changes more quickly.

Employers are beginning to think less about individual tools and more about clusters of tech skills packaged together, according to the study by Indeed.

Python, machine learning, and data analysis are increasingly inseparable, while AWS, DevOps, and CI/CD often appear in tandem, according to the data.

These clusters reflect how technical professionals are expected not only to master a language or technology, but also to possess capabilities across different technologies.

Generative AI is accelerating this shift. Roles that once centered on traditional coding are being redefined to include prompt engineering, AI integration, and the responsible deployment of AI systems, according to Indeed. Professionals are now expected to partner with AI tools to drive efficiency, strengthen data analysis, and more.

The gap between some tech job postings and available talent is widening, leaving employers scrambling to compete for a limited pool of specialists, according to Indeed. To bridge the gap, Indeed suggested that companies sharpen recruitment campaigns around what highly sought-after candidates actually value, from career growth to cutting-edge project opportunities.

At the same time, learning new skills has become a necessity rather than a perk. Identifying employees with adjacent skill sets and providing them with pathways into high-demand roles is increasingly viewed as one of the few sustainable ways to keep pace with market needs, according to Indeed.

Tech talent shortages aren't going away. They're shifting toward the skills that define the AI era.

In a recent South Park episode, Randy Marsh urges his daughter to learn hands-on skills because AI will automate many knowledge-based jobs.

""AI can do everything better than we can, except for stuff that requires arms,"" he says.

It's funny, but also true. AI models are getting really good at digital skills such as coding. Beyond bits, though — in the physical world — AI is nowhere near matching the ability of humans to perform many different tasks.

A big reason for this yawning capability gap is data. In the digital world, the internet provides a readymade mountain of information that machines can learn from. In the world of atoms, there's no equivalent.

This physical-world data mountain must be built from scratch. It's a herculean task. I recently met an unassuming startup founder who's hacking away at this problem in an interesting way.

Ali Agha spent seven years at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, developing autonomous multi-robot systems for exploring different environments, including Mars. He started FieldAI in early 2023 and has a team of robotics and AI experts from companies including Google, DeepMind, Waymo, Tesla, Nvidia, Boston Dynamics, and Amazon.

In the race to amass all this physical world data, some big tech companies have a natural advantage. Tesla has huge vehicle and battery factories. Amazon runs hundreds of massive warehouses. Foxconn assembles millions of iPhones and servers in gigantic plants. If you don't have such assets, you have to get more practical and inventive. And this is exactly what FieldAI has done.

Its AI models are designed to get many different types of robots out into real-world situations as quickly and safely as possible. Once there, they perform relatively simple but valuable tasks. While doing this, these machines constantly collect new data, which is fed back into the startup's AI models, which helps them improve. This, in turn, helps FieldAI release more robots into new situations, where, again, they gather even more data and learn all over again.

This is a contrast to some other AI robotics players, which are working on much more ambitious capabilities before getting their machines out in the wild.

""You're deploying more, you're getting more data, and that data makes the model better, which helps you deploy even more, and even more data is starting to be collected,"" Agha told me in a recent interview. ""This flywheel has started spinning faster and faster.""

In the six months of 2025, FieldAI contracted 10 times more robots than in the first half of 2024. This is helping to drive that flywheel of real world data collection.

This has caught the eye of major investors. In August, FieldAI raised $405 million, one of the largest startup funding rounds this year. Backers include Nvidia, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Vinod Khosla, Intel, Samsung, and Laurene Powell Jobs.

""Enabling autonomy solutions at scale is an extremely difficult problem, but the deep expertise of the FieldAI team and their unique approach to embodied intelligence reflects a pragmatic path forward,"" said Khosla, who was one of the first investors in OpenAI.

The new money will pay for new hires and a major push to ""productize"" FieldAI's novel approach, according to Agha. That means getting a heck of a lot more data-collecting robots out into the world.

The startup's AI models are designed to control many different types of robots, from quadrupeds to humanoids, wheeled robots, and passenger-scale vehicles. The machines are already deployed in Japan, Europe, and the US, in industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, urban delivery, and inspection.

Agha took me through a practical example from the construction industry to show how FieldAI's approach is working.

Building Information Modeling, or BIM, is an established way to create a detailed digital copy of a construction project, so progress and issues can be tracked accurately.

Usually, BIMs are maintained and updated by human employees walking around construction sites, recording details manually by taking photos and writing notes.

Instead, FieldAI deploys robots to conduct these site tours and update BIMs automatically. This helps construction companies keep better track of the projects, and it's more thorough and cheaper than hiring human workers to walk around for hours doing this task, according to Agha.

A key task is taking photos regularly so you can go back over time and see a project's progress, or a lack of progress. Was the drywall put in before all the piping was finished? If there's a disagreement between the contractor and the insurer, for instance, having an extremely detailed photographic record of the project over time is key.

A robot can walk around these huge sites non-stop, 24/7, while a human can't, which makes these automated BIMs much more detailed and accurate, Agha noted.

As FieldAI machines tour these sites, they constantly collect new data, which gets fed back to improve the AI models that power the robots. Then, next time, the robots can add more tasks.

""A huge benefit of these platforms is that they compound future use cases,"" Agha said. So one month, a FieldAI robot is taking site photos. The next month, it might also check that the safety barriers are in the correct place. The following month, it might add inventory tracking. There were 100 copper pipes on the second floor yesterday so why are there only 25 now?

The end result is that construction projects can be monitored more closely for less cost, increasing customers' return on investment, according to Agha.

""The key for ROIs, is that the person who was previously walking six hours a day around these massive sites — this person now spends most of their time checking the incoming data from our robots and is analyzing where there's progress and why these other things haven't happened,"" he said.

Recently, FieldAI had to pull one of these robots from a construction site, due to a paperwork issue. The project superintendent kept calling to ask when the robot was coming back, because they'd gotten so used to an automated system patrolling the site and reporting back so often, according to Agha.

""That was a signal for us,"" he said. ""It was a validation that helped to convince us that this is the right time to grow.""

Bari Weiss is now the top editor at CBS News, and she's starting day one with an ""open mind"" and a sense of urgency, according to a memo she sent to the newsroom on Monday.

Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who founded the anti-establishment media company, ""The Free Press,"" just sold her company to CBS News owner Paramount for roughly $150 million, a source familiar with the deal said. As part of the deal, Weiss is now editor-in-chief of CBS News, while ""The Free Press"" will continue to operate separately.

In her introductory memo, obtained by Business Insider, Weiss listed 10 core journalistic values she would champion at CBS News, including remaining ""fair, fearless, and factual"" and holding ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny.""

Some current and former CBS News employees told Business Insider they were wary of Weiss taking charge of the nearly 100-year-old newsroom. A former CBS News staffer said they wondered how Weiss, who has a commentary background and history of taking stances on hot-button issues, would approach managing a straight-news operation.

Weiss said in a statement that the deal would allow The Free Press' ""ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience.""

""We honor the extraordinary legacy of CBS News by committing ourselves to a singular mission: building the most trusted news organization of the 21st Century,"" she said.

Paramount CEO David Ellison said Weiss ""is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News.""

Read the full memo that Weiss sent to CBS News employees below:

Dear Colleagues:

I am thrilled and humbled to be writing to you as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News.

Growing up, CBS was a deep family tradition. Whenever I hear that tick, tick, tick or that trumpet fanfare, it sends me right back to our den in Pittsburgh. The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege.

Right now, I imagine you have some questions. I do, too.

My goal in the coming days and weeks is to get to know you. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. I'll approach it the way any reporter would—with an open mind, a fresh notebook, and an urgent deadline.

What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you:

I look forward to meeting many of you in the days ahead and to listening and learning from you. I am profoundly honored to join you—and I can't wait to get started.

With gratitude and excitement,

Bari

After years of stalled experiments and regulatory hurdles, drone delivery is beginning to take flight in the US.

Chipotle in August began teaming up with drone delivery and logistics provider Zipline to ensure Dallas area fans can get their burritos and bowls delivered — anytime, and almost any place. In June, GoTo Foods partnered with DoorDash and Wing to bring items from its portfolio of brands, including Auntie Anne's and Jamba, to three Texas markets: Frisco, Fort Worth, and Plano.

The pilot programs build upon short-lived drone delivery experiments from other brands that have been rolled out and subsequently discontinued over the last decade, like the Flytrex and El Pollo Loco partnership, which briefly took to the skies in 2021.

This moment, however, seems to be different, five industry insiders told Business Insider.

""I do think it's an inflection point for the industry,"" Kent Ferguson, head of partnerships for Wing, said. ""We have an improving regulatory framework to allow us to service more customers and scale much more quickly. We have the infrastructure that is flexible, cost-effective, and we have the planes on hand — thousands of planes — to service the millions of customers.""

Multiple companies, including Zipline, Wing, Flytrex, and DroneUp, are vying for commercial drone dominance with their unique designs of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, for short. Some of the aircraft resemble miniature passenger planes, while others resemble hobbyist drones, featuring four rotating propellers and an attached payload.

From an operational standpoint, the challenges of drone delivery for participating retailers are the same as those of an order being picked up by a human driver or a robot courier, GoTo Foods' chief commercial officer, Kieran Donahue, told Business Insider.

""We still have to make sure we get the right items in the bag, that the food is prepared properly,"" Donahue said. ""It doesn't matter whether it's coming from a DoorDasher in a traditional car or a drone.""

The benefits to retailers, though, are clear: faster delivery times, lower labor costs, and increased customer satisfaction — and it's not just GoTo Foods and Chipotle that want in on the perks. Major grocery players, including Walmart and Amazon, are rolling out pilot programs at scale. Getting dinner ingredients delivered by drone may soon be as common as ordering take-out through Grubhub or Uber Eats.

Although drone technology has become increasingly useful to the commercial sector in recent years due to technological advancements, the recent momentum isn't thanks to better hardware alone — it's also due to the regulatory climate.

L.R. Fox is the founder and CEO of WhiteFox Defense Technologies and vice chair of the US Chamber of Commerce Drone Committee. He told Business Insider that a June executive order signed by President Donald Trump was a catalytic moment for the industry. It signaled a path forward and broke through an otherwise complicated web of federal regulations that had prevented widespread adoption.

""The key thing that enables drone delivery is known as 'Beyond Visual Line of Sight,'"" Fox said. ""Up until this point, you have companies that had literally a guy standing on a rooftop, flying the drone until he can't see anymore, and then another guy standing on a rooftop and taking over control of the drone.""

The executive order set the stage for the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration, which control the country's airspace, to enable and monitor routine Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations for drones for commercial and public safety purposes.

So far, the test programs are gaining traction and shaving precious minutes off delivery times, representatives for both GoTo Foods and Chipotle told Business Insider.

""What's unique about drone delivery is, with this particular technology, we don't have to implement the drones at every restaurant to be able to still have full coverage of an area,"" Chipotle chief technology officer Curt Garner said. ""One restaurant out of five or six may be able to have the same delivery radius that we would typically experience with somebody going into a restaurant and driving a car as a courier.""

The Texas market, in particular, has been a playground for drone pilot programs, in part because of its temperate weather and the layout of its cities, Harrison Shih, head of the DoorDash Drone Program, told Business Insider.

""It's fairly suburban, a lot of single-family homes,"" Shih said. ""These are the profiles that drones fly really well in, where they can lower packages.""

The DoorDash Drone Program is also operating in Charlotte, North Carolina, for similar reasons. Both sites offer the company essential testing data for scaling up in more congested neighborhoods.

""Hopefully, what we see in 2026 is that the market will open up, and more and more metropolitan areas will be able to be covered,"" Shih said.

Still, as these experiments move closer to the mainstream, questions about safety and reliability persist.

A 2024 survey by the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator for Political Economy and Regulation found that 70% of respondents were concerned that drones would disturb their neighborhoods and may be unsafe, and 51% would oppose legislation to expand US airspace for delivery drones.

""Right now, if somebody launched a drone and had a bomb on it, there's very little anybody can do to stop it,"" Fox said. ""Not from a technology standpoint, but just from a deployment and authorities standpoint — local or state law enforcement cannot do anything to stop a drone, it's a federal crime for them to do that, which is insane.""

Federal authorities have limited authority to disable or destroy threatening drones that pose a threat to their facilities or national security. Proposed laws aim to grant state and local police more authority, but have not yet been passed.

One of the primary concerns in the industry now is that when companies fly hundreds or thousands of drones a day across various populated areas, ""one of them is going to have some kind of incident,"" Fox said.

""So working through how that's resolved is definitely a factor,"" he added. ""Then, trying to ensure that it doesn't cause a complete halt or pause to the industry.""

Beyond the safety concerns, other practical considerations are still being addressed, such as determining suitable delivery zones and mitigating noise from propeller blades.

""The likelihood of the drone delivery straight to your window is very far off,"" Fox said. ""We might not ever see in our lifetimes.""

For now, when using platforms like Wing and Zipline, customers mark their preferred delivery zone when setting up their order — generally required to be a flat surface the size of a picnic blanket with clear skies overhead.

Garner said Zipline is addressing noise concerns from both design and operational standpoints: ""The drones are quite high in the air when the payload is lowered, so that buzzing noise that you would typically associate with a zone with the drone isn't audible,"" he said.

Even with hurdles ahead, the companies testing drones say the momentum is more real now than it has been before. By shaving minutes off delivery times, reducing labor costs, and opening up new occasions for off-premise dining — from soccer fields to suburban cul-de-sacs — drones are being positioned not as a gimmick but as a serious tool in the future of last-mile logistics.

If these trials succeed, the next frontier in convenience shopping might not be at your doorstep, but hovering right above it.

Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned Monday that OpenAI's deals with Nvidia and AMD are purely announcements, not deployments. 

""Now we will see what gets delivered,"" the Altimeter Capital founder told CNBC. ""Ultimately, the best chips will win.""

OpenAI's megadeal with AMD and its relentless push to expand artificial intelligence capabilities underscores the intensifying competitive landscape. 

Gerstner said the deals provide ""more evidence that the world will remain compute-constrained despite best efforts to bring massive supply online.""

Experts say it's also another validation of the AI arms race heating up, with AI a key element in the geopolitical race between the U.S. and China.

OpenAI's Chinese rival DeepSeek sent shockwaves last year when it claimed to have a lower-cost AI model than its U.S. peer. And Deepseek has continued to innovate, delivering new open-sourced models using domestically made AI chips.

Last week, the U.S. government issued a report warning of DeepSeek's national security concerns, Axios reported.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation said DeepSeek provides Chinese Communist Party views more frequently than U.S. models, according to Axios.

OpenAI's partnership with AMD is raising hopes that it is taking the right steps to increase production and  build more complex AI models.

""What we're really seeing is a world where there's going to be absolute compute scarcity, because there's going to be so much demand for AI services, and not just from OpenAI, really from the whole ecosystem,"" OpenAI President told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" Monday. ""And so that's why it's just so important for this whole industry to come together.""

AppLovin shares plummeted on Monday after Bloomberg reported that the SEC has been probing the mobile advertising company over its data-collection practices.

The agency has been looking into whether the company violated agreements on pushing targeted ads to consumers, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report said that the SEC is responding to a whistleblower complained filed this year along with multiple short-seller reports, and added that neither the company nor its officials have been accused of wrongdoing.

An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn't typically comment on the ""existence or non-existence"" of regulatory matters.

""That said, as a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels.""

The stock dropped 14% in regular trading after the report, which landed shortly before market close. It fell another 5% in extended trading. 

AppLovin's stock has been on a tear, jumping about 80% this year after soaring more than 700% in 2024. The surge has been driven by the company's artificial intelligence technology that's allowed it to provide better ad targeting capabilities to brands.

Last month, AppLovin was added to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings, at the same time that Robinhood joined the index in place of Caesars Entertainment.

AppLovin made the move into the benchmark despite a short-seller's effort to keep it out.

In March, Fuzzy Panda Research advised the committee for the large-cap U.S. index to keep AppLovin from becoming a constituent. AppLovin shares dropped 15% in December, when the committee picked Workday to join the S&P 500.

Three notable short-seller firms, including Fuzzy Panda, have slammed AppLovin of late. The latest was Muddy Waters Research, which in March said the company's ad tactics ""systematically"" violate app stores' terms of service by ""impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, Google, and others."" In so doing, AppLovin is funneling targeted ads to users without their consent, Muddy Waters said.

Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research put out reports the prior month, taking aim at AppLovin's AXON software, which drove its earnings growth and stock surge. The shares dropped 12% on Feb. 26, the day of the short reports.

After those reports were published, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote a blog post, defending his company's technology and practices, and taking aim at the short sellers trying to profit from AppLovin's decline.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to halt key parts of a judge's order requiring Alphabet's Google to make major changes to its app store Play, as the company prepares to appeal a decision in a lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games.

The justices turned down Google's request to temporarily freeze parts of the injunction won by Epic in its lawsuit accusing the tech giant of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and pay for transactions within apps.

A federal appeals court in July upheld the judge's sweeping order against Google.

The injunction issued last year by U.S. District Judge James Donato requires Google to allow users to download rival app stores within its Play store and make Play's app catalog available to competitors. Those provisions do not take effect until July 2026.

The judge also said Google must allow developers to include external links in apps, enabling users to bypass Google's billing system. That part of the injunction is due to take effect later this month.

Donato issued his order in a lawsuit that Epic filed in 2020 against Google, alleging its restrictive app store rules violated antitrust law. Epic won a jury trial in San Francisco in 2023. Google has denied any wrongdoing.

Google has called Donato's order unprecedented, and said it would cause reputational harm, safety and security risks and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if allowed to take effect.

Google in its Supreme Court filing said the changes would have enormous consequences for more than 100 million U.S. Android users and 500,000 developers. Google said it plans to file a full appeal to the Supreme Court by October 27, which could allow the justices to take up the case during their nine-month term that began on Monday.

Epic has said Google is relying on what it called ""flawed security claims"" to justify its control over Android devices. Epic had urged the justices to allow Donato's injunction to take effect ""so consumers and developers can benefit from competition, choices and lower prices.""

In July, a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, ruling that the record in Epic's lawsuit was ""replete with evidence that Google's anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance.""

Google faces other lawsuits from government, consumer and commercial plaintiffs challenging its search and advertising business practices.

In this article

Figma shares jumped 7% on Monday after the design software vendor's technology was promoted by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in an onstage demo at his company's annual DevDay conference in San Francisco.

Altman discussed Figma's integration into ChatGPT, which has more than 800 million monthly users. He showed how third-party applications could plug in with OpenAI's Apps SDK, or software development framework.

""When someone's using ChatGPT, you'll be able to find an app by asking for it by name,"" Altman said. ""For example, you could sketch out a product flow for ChatGPT and then say, Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram. The Figma app will take over respond and complete the action.""

In addition to asking for Figma's help by name in ChatGPT, the assistant can also suggest Figma when it's relevant, Figma product manager Luke Zhang said in a blog post.

The rally for Figma, at its high point, was the steepest since the day of the company's public market debut on the New York Stock Exchange in July.

Figma has been ramping up its own tools for working on app and website designs using generative AI models from OpenAI and other providers.

Subscribers to products that connect to the Apps SDK will be able to log in without leaving their ChatGPT conversations, Altman said. He said people working on products in Figma can also launch the FigJam tool to keep working on development ideas. Apps SDK is based on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard that OpenAI rival Anthropic introduced last year.

Software developers will be able to submit apps for review later in 2025, Altman said.

Over time, OpenAI will offer many ways to generate revenue through third-party integrations, Altman said. Last week, OpenAI announced a feature allowing people to buy products listed on Etsy through ChatGPT.

A top federal prosecutor in Virginia is resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to seek a criminal indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime antagonist of Trump, MSNBC reported Monday.

The prosecutor, Elizabeth Yusi, works in the U.S. Attorney's Office  Eastern District of Virginia, which recently obtained an indictment of another target of Trump's ire, former FBI Director James Comey.

""Yusi, who oversees major criminal prosecutions in the Norfolk office of the Eastern District of Virginia, has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC,"" according to MSNBC's report.

""Yusi plans to present her conclusion to the president's new interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, in the coming weeks, they said,"" MSNBC reported.

Halligan was installed in that job by Trump after her predecessor,  Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from Trump after opposing the filing of charges against Comey. 

Halligan soon afterward got a grand jury to indict Comey on charges of lying during testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020.

Comey denies the allegations.

Trump over the weekend called James ""SCUM"" in a social media post that urged her removal as attorney general.

In an earlier social media post, on Sept. 20, Trump called on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute James, Comey, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Bill Pulte, whom Trump appointed to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has suggested that James committed mortgage fraud in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home, where her niece lives.

James's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has denied the suggestion that James said the home was her primary residence to obtain a more favorable loan rate.

""Lowell noted that a power-of-attorney form had mistakenly listed the house as a primary residence, but that James herself checked 'no' on the loan application when asked if the house was her primary home,"" MSNBC reported. ""In addition, according to Lowell, James also sent an email to her mortgage broker stating the house 'WILL NOT be my primary residence.' ""

James, in early September, appealed an intermediate appellate court's decision tossing out a $500 million penalty  on Trump and his company in connection with business fraud.  The appellate court said the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition of excessive fines.

The court upheld a trial court judge's finding that Trump and others had committed business fraud.

He has denied wrongdoing in that case, which stemmed from a lawsuit that James filed against him.

The Senate on Monday for a fifth time did not pass a House bill that would temporarily fund the U.S. government, deepening the government funding stalemate.

Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, and Democrats remained at loggerheads over the terms of a funding deal as the government shutdown dragged on to its sixth day.

The 52-42 vote fell largely along party lines, as was the case during the four previous votes on the same measure.

The measure would have funded the government through Nov. 21. The Senate on Monday also rejected House Democrats' plan to temporarily fund the government, as had been expected.

Republican senators need at least eight votes from members of the Democratic caucus to meet the 60-vote threshold required to advance the legislation.

The only senators from the Democratic caucus so far to vote for the House resolution have been John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, as well as Angus King of Maine, one of two independents in the caucus.

Those three senators again voted with Republicans on Monday evening, while Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted with Democrats to oppose the measure.

The Trump administration reiterated its threat of mass layoffs of government workers if the shutdown persists beyond Monday.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that President Donald Trump could ""start taking sharp measures"" if the Senate does not approve the funding bill.

Hassett said Democrats would be to blame for ""any government worker that loses their job"" due to reduction-in-force orders.

Federal employees normally are furloughed during government shutdowns, not laid off.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune can now tee up another vote for Tuesday, Punchbowl News reported.

Monday - Friday, 6:00 - 7:00 PM ET

In this article

CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday explained why he's bullish on Take-Two Interactive, saying it's set to dominate the video game space now that its top competitor is going private.

""This was an industry with three major players, but now, with Activision gone and EA going private, Take-Two's now the only major publicly-traded American video game company that's a pure play,"" Cramer said. ""I think this is huge. Not only were some very sophisticated investors willing to pay a premium for EA, but Take-Two has real scarcity value now.""

Take-Two is known for a number of popular video game series, namely the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The company is gearing up for a May 2026 release of ""Grand Theft Auto VI,"" the latest iteration of the series, which gamers have been anticipating for more than a decade. Its predecessor, ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" is one of the best-selling video games ever, having sold more than 200 million copies since it came out in 2013.

Take-Two's stock has climbed over the last few months, and shares are currently up 39.6% year-to-date.

Last week, the company's peer Electronic Arts announced it would be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in a deal worth $55 billion. The take-private deal will be the largest leveraged buyout in Wall Street history. Cramer noted that Electronic Arts' takeover comes two years after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, another major American video game publisher.

According to Cramer, those who want to invest in a traditional video game company now need to enter the Japanese market or ""bet on Take-Two."" He also said that while Microsoft and Sony have large gaming divisions, most of their sales come from other businesses.

Cramer also pointed to several aspects of Take-Two's business he finds impressive, including results from its most recent quarter. The company beat Wall Street's estimates and raised its full-year forecast for net bookings. Take-Two said new player accounts for GTA Online have grown more than 50% year-over-year, Cramer noted. He also said the company has other successful franchises beyond GTA, including sports game NBA 2K. The 2025 iteration of the game has already sold more than 11.5 million units, the company said, and daily active users climbed 30% year-over-year. While most of Take-Two's games are played on Playstation, Xbox and PC, Cramer noted its mobile business is growing nicely.

""GTA VI"" is likely to be a success, Cramer continued, even if the release date is delayed. If the game is delayed, and the stock takes a hit, he suggested investors use the decline as a buying opportunity.

""Just keep in mind, if you're taking the plunge into Take-Two here, you have to be able to stomach any delays to 'GTA VI,'"" he said. ""In fact, you should expect delays — video games aren't like movies, which come out on a regular schedule.""

Take-Two did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Deloitte on Monday announced a deal to bring Anthropic's artificial intelligence assistant Claude to its more than 470,000 employees around the globe. 

The rollout will be Anthropic's largest enterprise deployment ever, building on a partnership the two companies first unveiled last year.

Deloitte, which offers consulting, tax and audit services, is one of the 300,000 business customers Anthropic has amassed in the four years since the startup's founding. 

""We are both investing a significant amount in this partnership, whether that's financial or whether it is just simply the engineering resource that we're going to put into this as well,"" Paul Smith, Anthropic's chief commercial officer, told CNBC in an interview.  

The companies declined to disclose the financial details of the deal.

Deloitte will build out and deploy different Claude ""personas"" for different groups of employees, ranging from accountants to software developers, over the next several months. Staffers can also get support from specialists within Deloitte's Claude Center of Excellence, which is designed to help teams deploy and benefit from the technology more quickly.

Ideally, exposing Deloitte employees to AI will help them reap the personal benefits like productivity gains, while also inspiring them to think about how the technology could be used to transform other industries and sectors, said Ranjit Bawa, Deloitte's U.S. chief strategy and technology officer.

""Our clients obviously want to know: 'Are you using it as well?' So we can advise them better, we can be more credible,"" Bawa said. ""That's why we said we got to start with ourselves as we continue to have our clients reimagine their future.""

Deloitte's Claude deployment, which will take place across more than 150 countries, comes as Anthropic has been working to beef up its global presence.

The startup said in September that it would triple its international workforce this year, and brought on a new executive, Chris Ciauri, to spearhead that expansion.

That same month, Anthropic announced its latest AI model, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and that it closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation. The Amazon-backed startup has had to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google for customers.

""We're still pretty busy,"" Smith said. ""But it's good busy.""

In this article

Nike's turnaround plan is showing early signs of progress, but it will ""take a while"" for the company to return to profitable growth, CEO Elliott Hill said in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen aired Monday.

""When we come to work we think about three brands, and then multiple sports under each brand and then 190 countries that roll up to our four geographies,"" Hill said in a sit-down interview from the company's headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. ""Each brand times sport, and each [geography] times country, they're at different stages of the evolution."" 

When asked when investors can expect Nike to get back to mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth with strong margins, Hill acknowledged that ""it'll take time."" But he said the company has ""the path"" to get there. 

""It's going to take a while,"" said Hill. ""It's not linear. But it is a portfolio, and ultimately the goal is to have the entire portfolio all working together to drive the revenue and the profit that we hope to deliver for all of our investors."" 

The comments come nearly a year into Hill's tenure as CEO. Investors are looking for more clarity into how well his strategy to turn around the company is working as quarterly sales and profits have declined for much of the last year.

The struggles have shown in Nike's stock, which has fallen about 12% in the last year. While Wall Street knows how Hill plans to fix the company, it is still unclear how long it will take.

Since Hill took over last October, he's worked to reverse many of the strategies implemented by his predecessor, former eBay CEO John Donahoe, who tried to sell more shoes and apparel directly to shoppers. Instead of focusing on sales only through Nike's website and stores, Hill is moving back to wholesalers and working to win back shelf space that competitors have taken over. 

During his interview with Eisen, Hill said Donahoe's focus on digital sales made sense during the Covid pandemic, but that changed when the world started to open up again. 

""When Covid hit, supply got constrained, demand goes up and I think the team did what I think anybody would do. Shift product over to digital commerce and all of a sudden that takes off. Double revenue, double margins and it's a winning strategy,"" said Hill.

""Then of course everything normalized,"" he said. ""Physical retail started to open back up and we continued on with that strategy … and I think over time it ended up hurting the brand because there's a certain set of consumers that want to shop choice, and they want to shop across each of the different channels of distribution."" 

Hill said the company has made strides toward taking back the shelf space it lost. Nike is also trying fresh partners, such as Aritzia, to win over new, female shoppers. 

Hill is also changing the way the business is segmented and returning it to its historical roots. Instead of dividing the company into women's, men's and kid's, Donahoe's strategy to drive lifestyle sales, Hill is reworking the corporate structure so the company's departments are focused on individual sports. 

""They have small cross-functional teams in each of those segments, if you will, of business and the idea is that the consumers in each of those segments and the competition in each of those segments is different and so by having these small cross-functional teams … that's really helped us get sharp in a couple of areas,"" said Hill.

Under Donahoe, Nike faced criticism for falling behind on innovation and losing market share because it was so focused on driving sales of classic styles, like the Air Force 1 and Nike Dunks. Changing the company structure is one of the ways Hill plans to reignite innovation because the teams will be squarely focused on the individual needs of different athletes, allowing them to create and deliver better products for those consumers. 

Many industry insiders expect Nike to make a complete recovery, but larger macroeconomic challenges will make a tough turnaround that much harder. 

When reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings last week, Nike warned that it now expects tariffs to cost it $1.5 billion in its current fiscal year, up from the $1 billion it projected in June. Those costs are expected to impact its gross margin by 1.2 percentage points in its current fiscal year, up from the 0.75 percentage point it originally forecast. 

Hill told Eisen the company is working to offset the cost of tariffs by leaning on its suppliers, factories and retail partners. Nike also recently implemented certain price increases, which could help blunt the impact of the new duties. 

Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Aritzia.

Related Stories

Companies like Starbucks, Paramount and Microsoft are among the latest to issue new return-to-office requirements, but mass RTO has been a years-long push across Corporate America. Getting workers back in hasn't been so easy.

People are spending about 25% of their days working from home, and that share hasn't budged since spring 2023, says Nick Bloom, a Stanford professor and leading researcher on remote work trends, and based on a recurring survey of 10,000 Americans from his team at WFH Research.

Work-from-home rates have persisted, Bloom tells CNBC Make It, even as the labor market sours, people cling to their jobs and leverage swings back in the direction of CEOs making RTO calls.

What gives?

Bloom points to a few factors. First is a ""growing compliance gap.""

""Firms are announcing RTOs,"" he says. ""It just does not look like employees are following through on the ground.""

He thinks of it as passive resistance: CEOs make a big announcement, but the middle managers tasked with enforcing the rule don't want to follow it themselves, much less make direct reports do so.

Managers are typically assessed on the performance of their team, and if they're performing well enough, they're unlikely to see the benefit of an increased attendance rule, Bloom says. Senior leaders may overlook any rule-bending too.

Many businesses are also shrinking their layers of middle management. This can lead to burnout among the bosses who remain, which in turn can result in less enforcement of these RTO mandates.

Then, there's the issue of tracking whether people are in for the actual number of days required by company policy.

Take a company that has a four-day office policy, but most people only go in for three. It can be hard to track exactly why someone didn't meet the attendance requirement for a given week. They could be out taking client meetings, at a conference, at an appointment, taking a sick day or just on vacation, Bloom says.

One Fortune 100 company Bloom spoke with has a three-day attendance policy, but over an eight-week rolling average, they only flag if someone is in fewer than one-and-a-half days per week. The company's HR chief chalked up the missing in-office time to people being out on business travel, Bloom says.

Other workers are showing up for the required number of days, but experimenting with how long they actually have to be there. Some 43% of hybrid workers partake in coffee badging, or going to the office for a few hours just to show their faces, and 12% want to give it a try, according to Owl Labs' recent survey of 2,000 full-time workers. Among those who've been caught, more than half say their employer didn't mind the practice.

Coffee badging is down from 2023 levels, but consistent with last year.

The majority of hybrid workers go into the office three to four days a week, which is up from last year, says Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs. At the same time, they're finding ways to maintain flexibility by coffee badging, scheduling personal appointments during the day, or trying what he calls ""micro-shifting"" —working in short, non-linear blocks not bound by a 9-to-5 and instead based on personal energy, responsibilities or productivity patterns.

As far as flexibility goes, ""they're finding it wherever they can,"" Weishaupt says.

Workers quit when they don't get the flexibility they want, or see it being clawed back by their employers, experts say. That could be by design.

""RTO is being used as a bit of a cheap way to reduce headcount"" by avoiding layoffs and paying out severance, Bloom says. Quitters could be scooped up by younger, smaller firms that offer flexibility as a perk when they can't compete with big-company salaries. That could be another reason why work-from-home rates have, on the whole, remained the same.

The problem with using RTO to shrink headcount is ""you don't get to choose who leaves,"" Bloom says.

Previous research from the University of Pittsburgh found that women, senior and skilled employees were most likely to leave companies that enacted new RTO policies.

Businesses say offering remote and hybrid work improves their ability to hire, especially for hard-to-fill roles or in so-called ""talent deserts"" in certain areas of the country, says ZipRecruiter economist Nicole Bachaud.

Around 20% of employers say they're looking to hire fully remote workers this year, and a similar share are on the hunt to hire candidates in a hybrid role, according to ZipRecruiter data.

""There is still demand for these types of roles within companies,"" Bachaud says, ""but a smaller share than we've seen in the past, for sure.""

Top House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries challenged Speaker Mike Johnson to a live public debate about the government shutdown, which entered its sixth day on Monday with no off-ramp in sight.

But the Republican leader quickly brushed off Jeffries' request, accusing the New York lawmaker of making ""desperate pleas for attention.""

In a letter to Johnson, Jeffries told the Louisiana Republican that he is game to debate on the House floor ""any day this week in primetime, broadcast live to the American people.""

""Given the urgency of the moment and the Republican refusal to negotiate a bipartisan agreement, a debate on the House Floor will provide the American people with the transparency they deserve,"" Jeffries wrote.

""It will also give you an opportunity to explain your my way or the highway approach to shutting the government down, when Democratic votes are needed to resolve the impasse that exists,"" he wrote.

Johnson, at a news conference later Monday morning, accused Jeffries of issuing the debate challenge in desperation because of unfavorable polling on Democrats' shutdown messaging.

But multiple recent polls show Americans are more likely to blame the shutdown on President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans, who hold majorities in both chambers of Congress, than on Democrats.

Johnson said lawmakers previously debated on the House floor before passing a Republican-proposed stopgap funding measure, which has so far failed to pass in the Senate.

""I'm not going to let Hakeem try to pretend for these theatrics,"" Johnson said, adding, ""We all know what he's trying to do.""

The House is out of session this week.

The Senate is set to vote again on Republicans' stopgap, which would resume funding at current levels through Nov. 21, and Democrats' alternative, which includes additional health-care funding and other measures, after 5:30 p.m. ET.

Those same funding bills have already failed multiple times to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome the Senate filibuster. The latest attempts are also expected not to succeed.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones believes the conditions are set for a powerful surge in stock prices before the bull market tops out.

""My guess is that I think all the ingredients are in place for some kind of a blow off,"" Jones said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""History rhymes a lot, so I would think some version of it is going to happen again. If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999.""

The founder and chief investment officer of Tudor Investment said today's market is reminiscent of the setup leading up to the burst of the dot-com bubble in late 1999, with dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones said the circular deals or vendor financing happening in the artificial intelligence space today also made him ""nervous.""

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. The rally has been driven by megacap tech giants, which have invested billions in AI and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era.

The difference between now and 1999 is the U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, Jones noted. The Federal Reserve had just begun a new easing cycle, whereas rate hikes were on the way before the market top in 2000. The U.S. is now running a 6% budget deficit, while in 1999, there was a budget surplus of $99,000, Jones said.

""That fiscal monetary combination is a brew that we haven't seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early '50s,"" he said.

The longtime investor highlighted the tension at the heart of every late-stage bull market — the eagerness to capture outsized gains and the inevitability of a painful correction.

""You have to get on and off the train pretty quick. If you just think about bull markets, the greatest price appreciations always [occurs] the 12 months preceding the top,"" Jones said. ""It kind of doubles whatever the annual averages, and before then, if you don't play it, you're missing out on the juice; if you do play it, you have to have really happy feet, because there will be a really, really bad end to it.""

To be sure, Jones isn't predicting an immediate downturn. He believes the bull market still has room to run before it reaches its final phase.

""It will take a speculative frenzy for us to elevate those prices. It will take more retail buying. It'll take more recruitment from a variety of others from long short hedge funds, from real money, etc.,"" he said.

He said he would own a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies and Nasdaq tech stocks between now and the end of the year to take advantage of the rally fueled by the fear of missing out.

Jones shot to fame after he predicted and profited from the 1987 stock market crash. He is also the co-founder of nonprofit Just Capital, which ranks public U.S. companies based on social and environmental metrics.

Correction: The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has bounced 55% from its April bottom to consecutive record highs. A previous version misstated the percentage.

Oops, something went wrong

Paul Tudor Jones, a billionaire hedge fund manager well-known for shorting an overheated stock market ahead of its historic collapse on Black Monday in 1987 to earn an estimated $100 million, is signaling alarm bells along with opportunity calls once again.

Jones is also the founder of the Robin Hood Foundation, a philanthropy organization founded in 1988 to reduce poverty.

Credited with one of the greatest trades in financial history, he recently stated on CNBC that markets resemble the 1999 dot-com melt-up, not the early stages of a cycle, but ""the final explosive months."" He cautioned that a setup of this nature could result in ""massive price appreciation across risk assets,"" yet urges investors to stop and ""jump off the train before it crashes.""

""The biggest winners right now are gold — up 46% — and Bitcoin — up 50 to 60%,"" said Jones. He also commented that retail-driven assets, which include meme stock baskets, are up almost 70%, suggesting that an inflation trading experience is underway.

His recommendation is to own gold, cryptocurrency, and the Nasdaq, and hold until it dips below the ""ultimate truth serum"", the 200-day moving average.

“I'd want to have a combination of gold, crypto, and probably the NASDAQ. I think I want to say that. I've said that before, and I think that's still the right one. And I think whatever the fastest horse is at this point in time probably has a good chance of being that on deck.”

Jones asserted that today's conditions are much more combustible than previous bubbles created by speculation, such as rate cuts instead of hikes, fiscal deficits rather than surpluses, and record leverage incorporated into ETFs rather than in traditional margin.

""It's 1999 with gasoline thrown on top,"" he said, noting both institutional flows and retail speculation are heading in the same direction for both Bitcoin and other proxies for digital assets.

However, he warned, the genuine disorder will not come from crypto; it will come from bonds. Labeling sovereign debt the ""biggest bubble of all time,"" Jones claimed central banks have artificially postponed the inevitable through easing, but that when they cease cutting rates, the bond markets could snap.

Something went wrong

Morgan Stanley has updated its investment guidance and is now suggesting that some clients allocate a small slice of their portfolios to Bitcoin. If taken seriously, that shift could send as much as $40 to $80 billion into the crypto market. The bank is now referring to Bitcoin as a “scarce asset similar to digital gold” and is recommending allocations between 2 and 4 percent, depending on how much risk a client is willing to take on.

The new guidance comes from Morgan Stanley's Global Investment Committee. It breaks things down based on the type of portfolio. For example, portfolios focused on “Opportunistic Growth” may go up to 4 percent in Bitcoin or similar digital assets. Those with a “Balanced Growth” approach might go as high as 2 percent.

Meanwhile, portfolios centered around income or wealth preservation are being told to skip crypto entirely. While the bank still acknowledges that Bitcoin can be volatile during times of macro stress, it also notes that its overall volatility has been declining over time.

This change matters because of the sheer size of Morgan Stanley's client base. The bank advises around 16,000 financial advisors who collectively manage close to $2 trillion in assets. Even if only a portion of those clients follow the new guidance, it could easily result in tens of billions flowing into Bitcoin.

That's where the $40 to $80 billion estimate comes from, based on what a 2 to 4 percent allocation from that total pool could look like. The bigger story here is the shift in tone. Just a few years ago, crypto access was limited mostly to high-net-worth clients or those with a special interest. Now it is being folded into standard portfolio advice.

This puts Morgan Stanley in line with other major players who are starting to open up more to digital assets. BlackRock, for example, has already said that a small Bitcoin allocation can make sense in a long-term portfolio.

Many in the industry see Morgan Stanley's move as a sign that crypto is no longer stuck on the sidelines. It is becoming a real option for a much wider range of investors.

DISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 

Of course, the bank is not ignoring the risks. The guidance points out that Bitcoin can act unpredictably when the broader market is under pressure. Correlation patterns can also shift, making it harder to forecast behavior. Morgan Stanley also advises clients to use regulated ETFs or structured financial products rather than hold crypto directly, mostly to simplify operations and reduce risk.

It also makes clear that crypto exposure is not for everyone. Risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and personal financial goals still play a huge role in whether this guidance fits a specific client.

The big question now is how many advisors and clients will actually take this advice. The final impact on Bitcoin will depend entirely on how much capital ends up flowing in. It will also be worth watching whether the bank starts offering similar guidance for other digital assets. On the market side, the key is whether Bitcoin can handle large-scale inflows without major price swings.

If Morgan Stanley's clients begin to act in unison, we could be looking at one of the biggest waves of institutional adoption in Bitcoin's history. This may only be a small percentage on paper, but when that small percentage is applied to trillions of dollars, the effects can be massive.

Oops, something went wrong

Last week, Strategy drew attention not for scooping up more Bitcoin, but for stepping back and taking a breather. Despite that pause, the company still pushed ahead with $140 million in dividend payments. That's unusual, given how consistent its buying streak has been over time. The decision seems to be part of a deliberate and well-timed approach to managing its large Bitcoin treasury.

This marks the first time since the end of July that Strategy decided not to add to its Bitcoin holdings. Internally, the company framed it as a temporary pause rather than any shift in direction. Meanwhile, dividend payouts continued without interruption.

At the time the pause took place, the firm's Bitcoin stash was worth about 80 billion dollars and totaled around 640,000 BTC, showing the scale it's operating at.

Even though there were no new purchases, Strategy kept its dividend commitments. That $140 million payout reflects how it continues to deliver returns to shareholders. In the background, some preferred share classes like STRC and STRD did not receive direct payments but instead began accruing interest.

In just one quarter, that added up to around 22.4 million dollars for STRC and 37.6 million dollars for STRD. The dividend engine kept running, even if the buying engine paused.

This isn't the first time Strategy has taken a break from accumulating Bitcoin. Past pauses occurred near the ends of the first and second quarters, which makes this latest move feel more like a recurring pattern than a surprise.

Some analysts believe these gaps give the company space to evaluate market conditions or prepare for larger moves. This most recent pause also came as Bitcoin edged closer to its recent highs, which might have influenced the timing.

Investors didn't panic. In fact, the market responded with a 2.8 percent bump in Strategy's share price, bringing it to around 361 dollars. For the year, the stock is up about 25 percent. That's despite the usual ups and downs that come with Bitcoin exposure.

One reason for the calm may be the company's transparency and strong numbers. It reported a gain of 3.9 billion dollars in the fair value of its Bitcoin holdings for the third quarter, which helped settle any nerves.

DISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in 

The decision to pause and still pay dividends shows that Strategy is balancing growth with returns. It is not blindly buying at all times. Instead, it seems to be managing cycles thoughtfully. The repeat pattern of pausing around quarter ends supports the idea that this is part of a larger plan.

The big question now is when the buying will start again. Will Strategy jump back in soon or stretch this pause a bit longer? Market reactions to any restart will be worth watching.

Also worth noting is how the preferred shares evolve during this time, since their dividend accruals give some insight into how Strategy handles its cash. If accumulation resumes in the coming weeks, it may reinforce that the long-term Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury firm led by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, continued to buy ether ETH$4,005.03 adding 179,251 tokens to its balance sheet through last week, worth roughly $820 million at current prices.

With the latest purchase, the firm's ETH stash surpassed 2.83 million tokens, more than 2% of the second largest cryptocurrency's supply, according to a Monday press release.

Shares are up 4% premarket alongside the weekend gains in crypto prices.

The company said total crypto and cash reserves stand at $13.4 billion, including $456 million in cash, 192 bitcoin BTC$111,480.33, and a stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS), a digital asset treasury vehicle focused on WLD$1.3077.

BMNR stock was up 4.3% pre-market at just over $59, its strongest level in two weeks.

Since the firm's June pivot, BitMine is part of the digital asset treasury trend where publicly-traded firms raise funds to accumulate cryptocurrencies, following the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate bitcoin owner.

BitMine aims to corner 5% of ether's supply and generate yield by staking the tokens. The firm currently ranks as the largest listed ETH treasury firm and only trails the bitcoin-focused Strategy's BTC holdings among all crypto treasury firms.

""We remain confident that the two supercycle investing narratives remain [artificial intelligence] AI and crypto,"" chairman Thomas Lee said in a statement. ""Since ETH's price is a discount to the future, this bodes well for the token and is the reason BitMine's primary treasury asset is ETH.""

BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm, announced Monday that it boosted its total ETH holdings to $13 billion with a sizable purchase last week.

The company acquired 179,251 ETH over the last week, or about $823 million worth at the current price. The firm now holds 2.83 million ETH, valued at around $13 billion as of this writing.

In addition to its ETH treasury, BitMine holds 192 Bitcoin (nearly $24 million worth), a $113 million stake in Eightco Holdings, and cash holdings of $456 million. Its ETH was acquired at an average price of $4,535 per token, or below Ethereum's current price of $4,625. The price of ETH has jumped by nearly 13% over the last week, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGekco.

BitMine holds the world's largest Ethereum treasury, ranking well ahead of runner-up SharpLink Gaming, which has amassed approximately $3.85 billion worth of ETH. Overall, BitMine is the second-largest crypto treasury behind Bitcoin giant Strategy with $80 billion in BTC.

The price of BMNR shares rose Monday morning following the news, currently up more than 5% to a price of $59.78. BitMine's stock has climbed 37% over the last month, according to data from Yahoo Finance.

In a press release, BitMine Chairman Tom Lee highlighted the company's strategic focus following meetings at Token2049 in Singapore.

“The BitMine team sat down with Ethereum core developers and key ecosystem players and it is clear the community is focused on enabling Wall Street and AI to build the future on Ethereum,” he said. “We remain confident that the two supercycle investing narratives remain AI and crypto.”

Oops, something went wrong

U.S. investors in exchange-traded funds tracking Ethereum's spot price can receive staking rewards for the first time.

Grayscale has introduced this functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-largest such fund on Wall Street with assets of $4.82 billion, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH).

The firm, which filed its staking addendum with the SEC on Monday, will rely on institutional custodians like Coinbase and a “diversified network of validator providers” to stake its Ethereum.

Staking has also been activated within the Grayscale Solana Trust, which is awaiting regulatory approval to be turned into an ETF. The move is a significant development, given that institutional investors have only been able to capitalize on ETH's price gains until now.

Ethereum made an ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022, meaning validators voluntarily lock ETH away and receive rewards for taking a role in securing the network. It's a much less energy-intensive approach than the previous proof-of-work consensus model, which Bitcoin and some other chains still use.

Grayscale's Ethereum exchange-traded products were among the first to hit the traditional financial market, with its trust-style product ETHE dating back to 2017. Last year, after Ethereum spot ETFs gained SEC approval, the firm successfully converted its products into spot Ethereum ETFs in July. 

The absence of staking rewards in ETFs have been cited as a key factor in the slower adoption of Ethereum funds since they launched in the summer of 2024.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana ETFs Surge as Crypto Funds Pull in Record $5.95 Billion

Data from SoSoValue shows the total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs currently stands at $164.5 billion—equivalent to 6.7% of its market capitalization. Ethereum ETFs lag behind with net assets of $30.5 billion, 5.6% of this cryptocurrency's valuation.

However, demand has been growing in recent months—driven by ETH's outperformance in the crypto market. Ethereum has surged by 156% over the past six months, compared with BTC's gains of about 50%, and set a new all-time high price mark shy of $5,000 in September.

In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking was ""exactly the kind of first-mover innovation"" that the company was designed to deliver.

“As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors,"" he added.

Grayscale says it plans to roll out staking to more of its products ""as the digital asset ecosystem evolves."" The unique selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominate the market.

Crypto exchange-traded products just capped off a record week, pulling in a total of $5.95 billion worth of investments last week, according to CoinShares. That tally included $1.48 billion worth of inflows into Ethereum funds, with both Bitcoin and ETH funds rebounding after being in the red the previous week.

With Bitcoin hitting an all-time high, all eyes are now on XRP as the next potential token to achieve a historic all-time high. Dive into the analysis.

Written by Charles Ledoux

Translated on October 6, 2025 at 14:38 by                                        Simon Dumoulin


Bitcoin (BTC) recently reached a new all-time high, energizing the entire crypto ecosystem. In its wake, XRP is also showing particularly encouraging momentum. Currently trading around $2.99, the token faces a key resistance at $3.10. If breached, targets are identified at $3.30 and then $3.40.

On the downside, a strong support threshold is observed at $2.83, a pivotal level for preserving the asset's current bullish structure.

XRP benefits from a particularly favorable technical context in the medium term:

A similar pattern occurred earlier this year, preceding a lightning rally for XRP from $0.60 to over $3.50 in less than three months. An identical scenario could well unfold again.

Analysis of the 3-day data shows that the market favors a bullish scenario. The weekly close will be the decisive element: if XRP ends the week above $2.73, it would strengthen its positive momentum.

In this case, the next technical resistances to watch would be $3.10, $3.30, and $3.40. In the longer term, the potential target zone would be around $4.5. Which is the level of the upper Bollinger band of the FBB.

However, a close below $2.73 would call into question the current structure and could signal a short-term technical reversal, with a possible pullback towards $2.50.

If $3.1-3.17 is firmly breached with volume, a new ATH will be almost certain for XRP.

As Bitcoin has officially renewed its all-time highs, the logic of capital rotation in crypto markets suggests a rise in altcoins.

With solid technical momentum and bullish signals from Bollinger bands, XRP now stands as a serious contender for the next all-time high.

Bitwise's CEO, Matt Hougan, believes that ‘Solana is the new Wall Street', as the ecosystem is quickly becoming an investor favorite for tokenization and stablecoin-related activity.

The statement came during a discussion with Akshay Rajan from Solana Labs, during which Hougan also said that:

And then they (people) wanna ask how they invest. […] And when they evaluate the different blockchains, the speed, the throughput, the finality of Solana makes it seem extraordinarily attractive.

—Matt Hougan, Official interview

For Hougan, Solana's biggest selling point is its unmatched finality speed, set between 400 microseconds and 150 microseconds. This alone makes the Solana ecosystem the best option for institutional investors, who often demand high throughput and ultra-fast finality.

This optimism seeps into top altcoins, too, with fresh contenders like Snorter Token's ($SNORT) experiencing a surge in investor interest in its bid to make meme coin hunting both fun and lucrative.

Solana is already looking bullish for Q4 2025, with several factors contributing to the increase in investor confidence and participation.

The upcoming ETF list awaiting SEC approval is the most impactful one, especially with Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas placing the approval odds at 100%.

But $SOL is also gaining massive ground thanks to Solana's increased appeal to investors. CoinGecko's list of the top Solana treasuries is quite telling in this sense.

The last 30 days have been highly fruitful for the ecosystem, with over $1.7B worth of $SOL moving into treasuries like Forward Industries, DeFi Development, and Upexi.

Forward Industries alone has invested over $1.5B in $SOL, purchasing 6,822,000 tokens, or 1.251% of the total supply.

These factors put $SOL on an upward trajectory for 2025's Q4, which could give us a new ATH by the end of October.

Oops, something went wrong

Swiss gambling watchdog tests FIFA's blockchain ticket plan, putting a spotlight on where digital collectibles end and gambling begins.

According to Swiss information, Switzerland's gambling authority, Gespa, has initiated a preliminary investigation into FIFA's blockchain-based “Right-to-Buy” ticket scheme for the 2026 World Cup, examining whether the product falls under Swiss gambling law.

The tokens, sold on FIFA's Collect marketplace, give holders a guaranteed window to buy match tickets once sales open.

They can also be traded on a secondary market. Gespa said it is currently gathering information before deciding if further action is needed.

DISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2025

FIFA's Right-to-Buy (RTB) is described as a digital asset that grants permission to purchase tickets for specific matches or stages, but it does not include the ticket itself.

Official listings show RTB drops tied to host cities and match phases, with some already sold out.

The system operates on the new FIFA Blockchain, which was built in partnership with Modex and is based on Avalanche's EVM-compatible network.

In an emailed statement, Gespa director Manuel Richard said it “cannot be ruled out that the offering on collect.fifa.com may be relevant under gambling legislation,” adding that the regulator will conduct additional fact-finding.

Under Swiss law, Gespa can order local internet providers to block access to non-compliant sites and alert prosecutors if violations are found. FIFA has not commented publicly on the matter, according to reports from Swiss media.

The review marks one of the first tests of how tokenized sports products will be treated under gambling and consumer protection rules ahead of the next World Cup.

Market activity around FIFA's blockchain ticket scheme remains strong. Data from recent listings show Right-to-Buy (RTB) tokens priced from approximately $149 for early group-stage options to more than $7,000 for high-demand matches, such as the Azteca opener. An England “Right-to-Final” token, listed at $999, sold out quickly.

Reports suggest that FIFA has already generated eight-figure revenue from RTB sales, even before general ticket sales have opened.

The inquiry comes as fans question FIFA's ticket pricing model. The Football Supporters' Association called the costs “astonishing” after first-release final tickets started above $2,000.

On the resale side, FIFA's official marketplace charges fees to both buyers and sellers, while dynamic pricing has sent some listings to several times their face value.

Technically, FIFA has shifted its Collect marketplace from earlier chains to its own Avalanche-based Layer 1 network, using USDC on the Avalanche C-Chain for transactions.

Modex is listed as the technology provider on FIFA's site.

DISCOVER: 20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025

There is no FIFA cryptocurrency or tokenized payment system involved. RTBs act as utility collectibles digital passes that give holders the right to buy tickets later.

Payments are made in regular currencies or USDC, making the tokens more of an access right than a form of money.

Gespa's preliminary review will decide if any enforcement action is needed.

The outcome could shape how FIFA manages tokenized ticket rights for the upcoming North American World Cup and set a broader precedent for blockchain ticketing in global sports.

Senior Writer, ARTnews


	A federal judge recently dismissed a class action lawsuit that alleged Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Apt Yacht Club collection of NFTs, colluded with several celebrities to inflate the prices of its products.


	On October 1, US District Judge Fernando Olguin found the plaintiffs Adonis Real and Adam Titcher failed to show that the digital assets created by Yuga Labs, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and cryptocurrency ApeCoin, were securities. The judge's ruling was first reported by the Courthouse News Service last week.

	The Bored Ape Yacht Club was among the most successful NFT collections, with celebrity endorsements from Justin Bieber, Madonna, Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry, as well as media personality and businesswoman Paris Hilton.


	Real and Titcher filed the class action lawsuit in 2022, claiming that six types of digital assets sold by Yuga Labs are unregistered securities and the celebrities who promoted Yuga Labs' products violated federal and state securities laws. The lawsuit also alleged that Yuga Labs colluded with talent agent Guy Oseary and MoonPay, a platform used to buy and sell cryptocurrency, in order to misleadingly promote and sell the NFTs and cryptocurrencies.


	In addition to Bieber, Madonna, Curry, and Hilton, the lawsuit's list of defendants also included Mike Winkelmann (the American digital artist known as “Beeple“), Reddit founder and venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, NFT collector Amy Wu, Adidas America, Inc., as well as Sotheby's.


	Judge Olguin found that Yuga Labs' products did not meet the Howey test, a legal framework created by the Supreme Court which requires “1) an investment of money 2) in a common enterprise 3) with an expectation of profits produced by the efforts of others” in order to label something a security.


	However, the judge did side with Real and Titcher on the issue of whether the profits from the Yuga Labs digital assets would come from the efforts of others.


	“In short, despite satisfying this sub-prong, the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy the other Howey prongs and therefore fail to allege that any, some, or all of defendants' digital assets are a security,” Judge Olguin wrote.


	Plaintiffs Real and Titcher have until October 10 to file a third amended complaint.




	Representatives for Yuga Labs declined to comment to Courthouse News Service, and representatives for Real and Titcher did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Remember when NFTs were a thing? Of course you don't. Here's why: Despite all the buzz, sparkly celebrity testimonials and gushing press releases, they were never, really, in terms of safe investments or common sense, a thing.



Now, Arnold Worldwide pokes non-fungible fun at such “valuable” collectibles—digital and IRL—in cute, quickie spots for PNC Bank.



We're assured that PNC's not moved by fads. It's all about helping folks make wise choices and avoiding unnecessary risk.



Would a banana in sunglasses lie?





“Our feeds are already crowded with influencers who prey on financial fears,” says James Bray, ECD at Arnold Worldwide, which developed the ads as part of its broader “Brilliantly Boring” campaign.



“So we thought, what if we created a few of our own—each one embodying a questionable investment plan—to show the value of a safer, smarter choice: boring banking.”



But, creepy porcelain figurines are OK, right? They'll appreciate over time no matter what—yes?





Ah well. Guess my Queen Victoria will still fetch a few bucks on eBay.



“By bringing these over-the-top investment characters to life, we're holding up a mirror to the kinds of financial fads people see every day,” says Dresdyn Hefferen, an SVP and director of brand marketing at PNC.



The adverts offer a simple message, well stated with a suitably light touch. The USP's clear with no room for confusion. (Not that NFT purveyors ever tried to confound consumers to maximize profits—perish the thought!)



“It's a playful reminder that while flashy trends come and go, smart, steady choices stand the test of time.”

Switzerland's gambling regulator is looking into whether ""right-to-buy"" tokens sold by global soccer organizing body FIFA ahead of the 2026 World Cup tournament comply with rules that govern gambling, Bloomberg reported. No wrongdoing has been alleged.

Gespa is assessing whether the tokens, which can be bought, sold and traded on FIFA's non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, are gambling-like or represent conditional purchase rights. FIFA stands for Fédération Internationale de Football Association.

The authority has not alleged wrongdoing nor had it received any reports of wrongdoing, and is gathering facts to determine whether any action is warranted, director Manuel Richard told Bloomberg on Monday.

According to FIFA's website, RTB tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that reserve a dedicated purchase window for a specific match. They aren't tickets, but they allow holders to buy tickets at face value if conditions are met. 

FIFA first rolled out “Right-to-Buy” (RTB) tokens for the World Cup Final in 2024, announcing 1,000 RTB opportunities for fans. Team-linked RTBs activate only if the chosen team qualifies, and they can be sold on the secondary market via FIFA's native marketplace powered by its Web3 partner, Modex.

For the 2026 World Cup hosted by the US, Canada,and Mexico, “Right to Final” tokens range from $299 to $999, depending on the team. Many tokens are already sold out, with prices determined by odds — long shots are cheaper, while favorites such as Argentina, Brazil and England are at the higher end. 

FIFA said RTBs were created to address extreme demand for tickets at specific matches and tournaments. At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, for example, there were 3.4 million tickets available for around 23 million requests, according to FIFA.

Cointelegraph reached out to FIFA for comment, but had not received a response at time of publication.

FIFA's bet on NFT technology

NFTs are unique blockchain tokens that verify ownership and authenticity of a specific asset. While the wider NFT boom peaked in 2021–22, FIFA has continued using NFT technology for digital collectibles, ticket-access rights, and gaming.

Soccer's world governing federation first began experimenting with Web3 and NFTs back in 2022, when it announced plans to launch its native platform, FIFA Collect, on the Algorand blockchain.

In Dec. 2023, before the Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia, FIFA and Modex launched 1,000 NFTs — 100 offering a chance to win tickets to the 2026 World Cup finals and 900 additional collectibles minted on Polygon.

FIFA also moved into Web3 gaming in 2024 with FIFA Rivals, built with Web3 gaming studio Mythical Games. The free-to-play mobile title that launched in June 2025 lets players run clubs, compete, and trade NFT player cards on the Mythos blockchain.

In May, FIFA decided to leave Algorand and migrate its NFT marketplace and collection to Avalanche, which it would use to power its own layer-1 blockchain.

Francesco Abbate, CEO of Modex and FIFA Collect, said AvaCloud's EVM-compatible stack makes connecting FIFA Collect with mainstream wallets and DApps easier.

With an estimated fan base of over five billion globally, Avalanche Subnets will let FIFA run a dedicated, tunable chain that can be adjusted independently of the Avalanche network to handle event-driven surges, such as the World Cup.

Key Takeaways

DeFiLlama removed the trading volume for Aster DEX from its dashboard due to wash trading concerns.

The perpetual futures volume on Aster was found to be almost perfectly correlated with the volume on Binance, suggesting non-organic trading.

Aster was delisted until it provides more transparent data to verify its trading activity.

DeFiLlama, a leading DeFi data aggregator, has delisted the trading volume for Aster DEX from its dashboard. The action was taken following the discovery of highly unusual volume patterns that strongly suggest wash trading, which is a form of market manipulation in which an entity simultaneously sells and buys assets to inflate market activity.

The delisting quickly impacted the ASTER token, dropping 10% from its previous trading level of $2.00 (with a market cap of $3.31 billion, according to CoinMarketCap). The incident raises concerns over data verification within the rapidly evolving decentralized exchange sector which is inherently supposed to solve transparency issues in finance.

According to 0xngmi, the founder of DeFiLlama, the team detected an abnormal phenomenon during a routine data audit on X.

The volume of perpetual futures traded on Aster DEX was found to be in near-perfect synchronization with the volume recorded on Binance, especially in major trading pairs like XRPUSDT. Recently, XRP has shown strong price momentum with significant on-chain accumulation, attracting a lot of attention.

The XRPUSDT trading pair's volume on Aster witnesses a 1:1 correlation with Binance – Source: 0xngmi on X

The ratio between Aster's volume and Binance's was approximately 1:1. This is highly unusual for decentralized exchanges, as user behavior and liquidity pools naturally cause different trading fluctuations compared to a centralized platform, especially CEX giants like Binance.

In contrast, Hyperliquid, another perp DEX, shows a more natural data variation, or decorrelation, compared to Binance. This means Hyperliquid's volume varies at different times, reflecting more organic trading activity.

The volume of XRPUSDT on Hyperliquid shows a more organic activity. Source: 0xngmi on X.

The issue results from Aster DEX's lack of granular data reporting. DeFiLlama's team was unable to verify the legitimacy of the volume because Aster failed to provide low-level transaction details, such as the addresses of takers, makers, or specific transaction IDs.

DeFiLlama stated the volume data for Aster will remain delisted until the DEX can provide the necessary transparent data to prove its liquidity is organic and its figures are accurate.

As per CoinMarketCap, Aster's token is now trading at $1.84, raising over 2089% in just the last 30 days.

The Information Commissioner's Office held an Awards Breakfast for Information Officers.

A spokesperson said, “The Information Commissioner's Office recently hosted an ‘Awards Breakfast for Information Officers' to recognise International Day for Universal Access to Information and in celebration of ten years of public access to information [PATI] in Bermuda. Five information officers and two public authorities received Information Commissioner's Awards from the Information Commissioner, Jason Outerbridge.

“Awardees were recognised from among more than one hundred and twenty information officers across two hundred public authorities, honoured for their outstanding service and commitment to excellence in delivering public access to information. They each have made a significant impact on the PATI regime in Bermuda over the past ten years.

“The awardees were:

“The Head of Public Service, Ms. Cherie-lynn Whitter co-presented the awards. She offered congratulations to the awardees on behalf of the Government of Bermuda and thanked all information officers for their invaluable contribution to the success of PATI. In addition, a commemorative pin was presented to each information officer in attendance.”

Commissioner Outerbridge noted, “Information officers are the frontline of PATI. This has not always been an easy experience for some information officers, especially those who try to get it right as they manage their day-to-day responsibilities while also processing PATI requests. Information officers are unsung heroes of the public service because they have taken on this tremendous statutory role without any additional compensation.

“Their collective labour has helped shift the culture from one of secrecy to one where transparency and openness are expected from public authorities. My team and I thank everyone who joined us for the celebration of these officers and public authorities, and we thank all information officers for their continued dedication and commitment to PATI into the future.”

Written & Edited byLandon Manning

Government officials from India and Nigeria both made statements on crypto today, but they took surprisingly different directions. Both explicitly acknowledged pros and cons, yet their speeches have many key differences.

India's Minister of Commerce and Industry focused on the negatives of Web3, although he alluded to a CBDC. Nigeria, meanwhile, is forming a Committee to profitably engage with this risky yet lucrative industry. 

As the Web3 industry keeps growing and growing, jurisdictions around the world are forced to grapple with the questions of crypto regulation. 

Today, two major regional economies, Nigeria and India, both saw high-level government officials make statements on crypto regulation, but they went in two different directions.

Piyush Goyal, India's Minister of Commerce and Industry, made a few statements during trade negotiations in Doha, capital of Qatar. He claimed that India has not been encouraging the crypto industry, levying “very heavy” taxes on its users. 

Apparently, he instead alluded to launching an Indian CBDC:

“India has also announced that we will be coming out with a digital currency, which will be backed by a Reserve Bank of India guarantee. We don't encourage [crypto] because we don't want anybody to be stuck…with a [token] that has no backing and nobody at the backend,” Goyal claimed. 

It's a little unclear what he meant by this. Strictly speaking, India already has its own crypto, launching the digital rupee in 2022. However, this CBDC has been criticized for its lack of popular appeal, reaching a total circulation of $114.5 million after three years. 

This may seem impressive, but it really isn't for a country with over 1 billion people. To put this in perspective, India is a regional leader in terms of crypto adoption, with over $300 billion in on-chain transactions last year. $100 million is practically nothing compared to this. 

Goyal may be alluding to resurrecting the digital rupee, or he may be announcing a new project. Either way, his statements seemed overtly hostile. 

Nigeria, meanwhile, is no stranger to prominent crypto scams, but the nation still seems interested in friendly regulation. Abbas Tajudeen, Nigeria's Speaker of the House, recently inaugurated a Committee on cryptocurrency. 

Despite addressing fears of criminal activity, he gestured towards the industry's economic benefits:

“We have been entrusted with a task of national significance: to review the economic, regulatory and security implications of cryptocurrency. Across the world, financial systems are being reshaped by technology. In Nigeria, cryptocurrency and POS operations have grown rapidly, creating new opportunities for commerce, financial inclusion, and innovation,” Tajudeen said. 

In other words, although Tajudeen acknowledged the risks, he focused on the benefits that crypto has brought to Nigeria. So far, his nation's crypto industry is less developed than India's, but positive engagement may change this paradigm. 

This “reserved, yet bullish” perspective may prove more fruitful than begrudging participation.

It just goes to show, a successful Web3 industry takes a lot of work. It'll be interesting to see how India and Nigeria both evolve in the crypto space, if these government representatives have their say in policy implementation.

The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) published its semi annual progress report on the adoption of DLT in capital markets. The report highlights the strong growth in US-led sectors such as stablecoins, repo and tokenized money market funds. By contrast, the report shows a decline in fixed income issuance, especially bonds, and attributes this to the Eurosystem's wholesale DLT settlement trials that ended in November 2024. The trials had accounted for almost a third of 2024's figures. 

Several participants in the European settlement trials were hoping that the European Central Bank would allow the trials to roll on in order to maintain momentum. That didn't happen, although the central bank has announced that Project Pontes will launch in a pilot phase in late 2026, with other trials possible before then. 

Total fixed income issuance was €3.25 billion ($3.8bn) in 2024 according to AFME figures, dropping to €1.7 billion ($2bn) for the first three quarters of 2025. The number of issuances  has declined from 55 to 24 during the same periods.

While the United States has turned away from the concept of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), other jurisdictions, such as Europe and China, have embraced it. As has been reported, a digital Euro is in the works with the European Central Bank (ECB) targeting a potential rollout for mid-2029. China has already been testing a digital Yuan live and in the wild.

However, while some European policymakers view a CBDC as beneficial for the European Union (EU) and its citizens, some are expressing concerns about the potential for abuse, including privacy concerns and government intervention. While declarations of commitment not to abuse a digital Euro have been issued by public authorities, concerns persist as governments can change their minds, as the allure of insight and control is simply too strong to resist for a central authority.

On X, Wide Awake Media, an account with over 800,000 followers, has posted a dystopian video about a future where CBDCs are part of a government that seeks authoritarian control by controlling bank accounts and behavior, enabled by CBDCs and digital IDs. It is a scary presentation where a social score guides your existence.

Another commentator, @newstart_2024, who goes by the name Camus, with over 355,000 followers, shares an actual video from the World Economic Forum where the speaker discusses how central governments can use digital currency to guide behavior in an Orwellian example of social engineering. The speaker discusses CBDCs as a conduit for implementing economic policies.

 

They are no longer hiding their plans.

A WEF panelist just laid bare the true, dystopian purpose of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).

He admits, on stage, that this isn't about “convenience.” It's about control.

Here's what he's really saying:

Founded in 2023, Resist CBDC pitches its mission as being anti-communist, anti fascist, advocating for being a liberty maximalist. Resist CBDC, with 71,000 followers on X, states that a CBDC is a “global surveillance industrial complex.” The account attacks the “system of surveillance and control,” which is aided by a Digital ID and CBDC.

 

“The digital Euro is on the move”

Christine Lagarde – ECB

“All European intuitions will be involved to make sure that Europe is equipped with the currency of the future … cash and ‘digital cash'.”

October and the CBDC are here. Will you adopt – or will you resist? pic.twitter.com/kPfd5RFlAP

— Resist CBDC (@Resist_CBDC) October 6, 2025



Lagarde, President of the ECB, explains that European citizens will have the choice between cash and digital currency, and both will be easy to use. Lagarde sees the development of a digital Euro as strategically important to the EU. She recently expressed her frustration with the lack of progress on the digital Euro while stating that privately issued stablecoins may risk eroding the power of central banks. Lagarde commented on stablecoins that “I think it risks undermining our capacity to conduct monetary policy.”

Resist CBDC says that a “CBDC is not a ‘digital version of cash. It's a permissioned coupon with purchase restrictions, travel limits, and an expiration date. Combined with Digital, ID becomes a Social Credit System.”

The account also quotes Klaus Schwab, former head of the World Economic Forum, who left the group following allegations of impropriety, as citing China as the model. The WEF has touted China's development of a digital Yuan (e-CNY). The digital Yuan is said to have “controllable anonymity,” as a central bank can access transaction information for regulatory purposes or to deal with illicit activities (whatever that means). It has been noted that a digital Yuan can also be set to expire, thus leveraging it to drive stimulus or other economic objectives.

The US, with the enactment of the GENIUS Act, set out parameters for private issuers of “payment stablecoins.” These digital assets must hold one-to-one reserves in safe assets, such as US Treasuries. While not without risks of privacy breaches, this requirement creates an arms-length relationship with digital dollar issuers. A retail CBDC issued by the US Federal Reserve appears to be dead on arrival.

Several US states have taken it further; Florida, one of the fastest-growing state economies and the fastest-growing by population, has a law that bans CBDCs. In 2023, legislation was signed into law that prohibits the use of any federally issued CBDC within the state. The governor and the state legislature expressed concerns regarding government surveillance and control over financial transactions, which suited the liberty-minded population of Florida. Other states soon followed Florida's example.

The widely popular Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently commented on X that the UK's push for a digital ID and potential for abuse is unraveling.  There is an uproar in the UK over the issuance of a Digital ID, with a petition against the policy garnering over 2.8 million signatures, as both conservatives and some leftists slam the policy.

DeSantis stated:

“Telltale sign that the Digital ID push in the UK is backfiring… They want more control (and to layer a CBDC over it), and the people are rejecting it.”

This past week, the Bank of England softened its stance on stablecoins in response to public pressure and market-driven demand.

Meanwhile, large jurisdictions such as China and the European Union, along with several other countries including Russia, India, and Brazil, are moving forward with plans for a CBDC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Morocco moves closer to launching central bank digital currency","https://northafricapost.com/91258-morocco-moves-closer-to-launching-central-bank-digital-currency.html","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 15:30:56 GMT","

Morocco is advancing plans to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-Dirham, as part of a broader push to modernize its financial system and boost financial inclusion.

The central bank governor Abdellatif Jouahri said late September that the project had entered an “advanced study phase,” positioning Morocco among more than 100 countries exploring digital currencies, including early adopters like China and Nigeria.

Speaking days later at the African Digital Payment Forum in Rabat, Hakima Alami, BAM's head of payment oversight, described the initiative as a strategic priority. “This is a long-term reflection that must balance modernization with financial stability and public trust,” she said.

Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, the e-Dirham would be issued and backed by the Moroccan central bank, maintaining a one-to-one parity with the physical dirham.

While Bitcoin operates on a decentralized, anonymous model, the e-Dirham would function as a state-guaranteed digital alternative to cash, offering stability and traceability.

One of the central motivations behind the e-dirham is to expand financial access. Nearly a third of Moroccan adults remain unbanked, relying heavily on cash for daily transactions. A digital currency, accessible via a mobile app, could allow users to send, receive, and store money securely without needing a traditional bank account.

The move also aims to reduce the high costs associated with cash handling, including printing, transportation, and security. Digital payments could help curb fraud and the informal economy, while streamlining financial flows.

The e-Dirham could also modernize Morocco's payment infrastructure. Current interbank transfers can take days and often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. A central bank digital currency would enable near-instant transactions with minimal costs and full interoperability between service providers.

For consumers, this could mean paying for groceries, taxis, or utility bills directly from a smartphone, without cash or cards.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) hit another record Monday after climbing above the closely watched $125,000 level over the weekend for the first time ever.


 The largest cryptocurrency by market value has rallied as appetite for risk remains strong and as investors use bitcoin (and gold) to hedge their bets against geopolitical uncertainty and high government debt, in what JP Morgan analysts have referred to as the ""debasement trade."" A growing pool of traders is also buying tokens as more crypto ETFs are launched and cryptocurrencies  become more integrated into financial services. Last week, bitcoin ETFs recorded inflows of $3.2 billion, the second-highest haul since they launched in January 2024.


 Bitcoin's price has soared 34% since the start of the year, outpacing major stock indexes, but trailing safe-haven gold's 50% return over the same period. The digital currency was trading at $125,500 recently, after hitting an all-time high today of around $125,800.


 Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin's weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out major price levels worth watching out for.


 Bitcoin broke out from a two-month descending channel last week, potentially setting the stage for a continuation move to the upside.


 Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish momentum and sits well below its December peak, providing ample room for the cryptocurrency to move further into price discovery before consolidating.


 Let's forecast how a new move higher might look on bitcoin's chart and also identify major support levels worth monitoring during possible downturns.


 Investors can use bars pattern analysis to forecast where bitcoin's trend may be headed next if a new move higher plays out.


 To apply the analysis, we take the uptrend comprising the bars from late April to mid-July and overlay them from the low of last week's breakout bar. This projects a potential bullish move to around $160,000 over a 12-week period if a similar trend occurs on the chart.


 It's worth noting that this earlier trend commenced following a 10% weekly advance from a prior descending channel on the chart, similar in size to last week's breakout from the recent pattern.


 During pullbacks, investors should initially monitor the $107,000 level. This area, currently situated just above the 50-week moving average, could attract buying interest around last month's low and prominent highs that formed on the chart in December and January.


 Selling below this level could see the cryptocurrency's prices test support near $92,000. Investors may look for entry points in this location close to a period of consolidation that developed on chart just below the December and January peaks.


 Finally, a more significant correction in bitcoin's price could trigger a decline to the $74,000 level. The cryptocurrency's price finds a confluence of support in this region from the prominent March 2024 peak and this year's notable April trough.

Bitcoin's price hit new records Monday, as the so-called debasement trade has become more attractive. But Bitcoin mining company stocks rose even quicker, furthering sizable gains seen across the industry in recent weeks.

Top public companies in the mining space—including the Nasdaq-listed HIVE Digital, MARA, and CleanSpark—all shot up on Monday ahead of the closing bell.

HIVE Digital led the pack with a 25% jump to nearly $6 a share by the close of trading, with IREN up more than 14% on the day to $57.75.

MARA finished Monday priced at $21 per share after jumping more than 9%; CleanSpark rose by the same amount and was trading for $17. And Riot Platforms climbed nearly 11% on the day to $21.56.

Mining stocks are also becoming more attractive as companies look to high-powered computing to increase profits. Google last month announced it was backstopping a deal between AI compute company Fluidstack and Bitcoin miner Cipher, giving Google the right to buy a 5.4% stake in Cipher.

“Miners are winning because they're flexing optionality: power, infrastructure, AI revenue, and leveraged exposure to Bitcoin rallies, all packaged in stocks,"" Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher told Decrypt. ""That's giving them an edge over crypto companies whose exposure is narrower or more operationally constrained.""

Bratcher added that some miners are holding onto their mined BTC rather than selling it, giving them a benefit akin to crypto treasury firms, particularly as Bitcoin continues to rise.

""Investors are increasingly viewing miners not just as Bitcoin proxies, but as owners of scarce infrastructure: power contracts, land, grid access, and cooling capacity,"" said Bratcher. ""When crypto is hot, that infrastructure becomes more valuable, especially if grid demand becomes tight.”

Bitcoin was recently up a little over 2% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko, after hitting a new all-time high of $126,080 earlier Monday. It had dropped down slightly to $125,191—still a 9.5% jump over the past week. 

U.S. investors last week plunged a record amount of investment into Bitcoin ETFs to get exposure to the biggest and oldest digital coin. Crypto investment products received $5.95 billion in fresh cash, with the most amount of money ever hitting Bitcoin funds in a single week: $3.55 billion in total.

A report from European asset manager CoinShares said that the lion's share of that investment was directed at Bitcoin ETFs trading in the U.S.

Over the past seven days, the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and an expected October interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve has led the price of Bitcoin, gold, and other cryptocurrencies and precious metals to rally.

Experts dub that kind of move the ""debasement trade""—when investors try to hedge against weakening currencies and geopolitical headwinds.

The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against major world currencies, suffered its worst first half of the year since the early 1970s as President Donald Trump went full steam ahead with his trade war.

Kaz Nejatian, CEO of Opendoor, recently hinted at integrating Bitcoin into the company's home-buying process. His response on X “We will. Just need to prioritize it.” Sparked intense speculation online. The move signals Opendoor's potential entry into the expanding crypto real estate space.

Opendoor operates a digital real estate platform that buys, upgrades, and resells homes directly to buyers. Since the company handles home sales internally, Bitcoin payments can be converted into dollars seamlessly. This model allows crypto transactions without requiring individual sellers to accept Bitcoin.

We will.  Just need to prioritize it.

— Kaz Nejatian (@CanadaKaz) October 6, 2025



Nejatian's statement did not offer a timeline but confirmed Bitcoin transactions are on the company's roadmap. The CEO's public acknowledgment indicates internal discussions on prioritizing crypto support. Bitcoin's inclusion would position Opendoor among firms embracing decentralized finance trends.

Additionally, handling Bitcoin internally could simplify compliance and reduce seller-side volatility concerns. Opendoor could manage conversion, ensuring sellers receive fiat currency. However, any shift would require careful navigation of the legal and tax implications associated with digital currencies.

Other property companies have already embraced Bitcoin, experimenting with crypto-backed transactions and investments. In July, Christie's International Real Estate launched a crypto division in California. That arm now supports listings and sales denominated in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

One featured property, the $118 million “La Fin” mansion in Bel Air, accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment. This listing marked a significant shift toward normalizing high-value crypto transactions. Christie's move reflects growing interest in using Bitcoin to facilitate elite property deals.

Similarly, Grupo Murano in Mexico adopted a Bitcoin-focused financial strategy to hedge currency risks. CEO Elías Sacal announced plans to convert company assets into Bitcoin. Through refinancing and sale-leasebacks, the firm aims to outperform traditional real estate gains using digital currency.

U.S.-based ByteFederal piloted Bitcoin home purchases in Florida earlier this year. Buyers can pay deposits and closing costs in Bitcoin while sellers receive U.S. dollars. The platform manually converts Bitcoin, with automation coming soon to scale the process.

Meanwhile, federal policy is also evolving toward recognizing Bitcoin in housing finance. In 2025, the Federal Housing Finance Agency directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to include cryptocurrency as an asset. Borrowers must hold Bitcoin on regulated exchanges for it to qualify in mortgage evaluations.

This shift further legitimizes Bitcoin in the real estate sector, adding momentum to platforms like Opendoor that are exploring integration. With support from leadership, regulatory openness, and market interest, Bitcoin could soon be a valid option for homebuyers on digital marketplaces.

Yes, Cyprus has quickly become a leading destination for tech-focused companies, particularly in the crypto sector. Several factors contribute to its rise, including attractive tax incentives and a location that enables access to both European and Middle Eastern markets. The government has implemented supportive regulations aimed at fostering growth within the digital economy.

What attracts tech companies to Cyprus?

Cyprus stands out due to its low corporate tax rate of 12.5% and the presence of an IP Box regime that applies a mere 2.5% tax on income derived from intellectual property. This financial landscape is appealing to startups seeking a less burdensome fiscal environment. Additionally, the country is conveniently situated in the Mediterranean, allowing tech firms to easily reach both European and Middle Eastern markets.

How many tech companies operate in Cyprus, and how much do they contribute to the economy?

Cyprus is home to over 1,500 tech and digital companies, contributing to around €6 billion annually to the economy. This growing ecosystem fosters an environment of innovation, making Cyprus an attractive option for businesses in the digital sector.

What strategies are crypto startups employing in their marketing?

Crypto startups in Cyprus are strategically utilizing their location by highlighting the following:

Cyprus as a Gateway to the EU Market: They are emphasizing their proximity to the EU as a base for operations.

Regulatory Compliance: Startups are underlining their adherence to local regulatory frameworks, which brings credibility in a space that is often seen as unregulated.

Alignment with National Digital Initiatives: By aligning with government-backed digital initiatives such as smart cities, these companies enhance their credibility.

Attractive Tech Infrastructure: Marketing their bases in the country as beneficial for scaling their companies.

Recruitment of Quality Talent: They are actively advertising the quality of life and social opportunities as attractive features to recruit top talent.

Who benefits from sponsorship, and why?

Companies that choose to sponsor the Cyprus Digital Marketing Summit will reap multiple benefits:

Networking Opportunities: Sponsors have the chance to connect with over 1,000 senior decision-makers from various sectors, including financial institutions and tech companies.

Enhanced Visibility: Brand placements increase visibility in the fintech community, making sponsors more credible and recognizable.

Lead Generation Insights: Access to lead rank and score dashboards gives sponsors an edge in targeting their leads effectively.

Thought Leadership Positioning: Opportunities to give talks or participate in panels allow companies to present themselves as experts.

Strategic Location: Cyprus serves as a bridge between Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, providing sponsors a broader market reach.

What benefits might SMEs encounter by adopting crypto payment systems?

SMEs stand to gain multiple advantages by integrating crypto payment systems:

Access to Unique Payment Solutions: The appeal of cryptocurrencies may attract a new customer base.

Security Enhancements: The structure of blockchain technology may offer security against fraud.

Targeted Marketing Opportunities: Penetrating niche crypto communities could allow for more authentic engagement with potential customers.

Creative Customer Engagement: Introducing crypto-based loyalty rewards can enhance customer engagement.

Fundraising Potential: Startups can turn to ICOs or STOs for capital.

What challenges do SMEs face when adopting crypto technologies?

Conversely, SMEs may face several challenges:

Navigating Regulations: Meeting compliance standards can be challenging and expensive.

Price Volatility: Fluctuations in crypto prices could complicate financial forecasting.

Operational Framework Needs: Robust compliance frameworks may be required, which could be difficult for smaller businesses to establish.

Limited Insights on Customers: Strict privacy measures may make gathering data on clients more difficult.

Cybersecurity and Fraud Risks: The growing risks associated with fraud and market manipulation may be daunting.

What digital marketing strategies would be beneficial?

San Francisco, CA – October 6, 2025 – Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: OPEN) shares experienced a significant surge today, with the stock jumping a remarkable 13.9% in afternoon trading and closing the day up 14.6%. This substantial uptick was ignited by a positive signal from CEO Kaz Nejatian, hinting at the iBuying giant's imminent foray into accepting cryptocurrency payments for home purchases. The announcement has sent a clear message to investors: Opendoor is positioning itself at the forefront of integrating digital assets into the mainstream real estate market, boosting investor confidence and setting the stage for a potential paradigm shift in property transactions.

The immediate implications of Nejatian's statement are profound. It signals not just a technological upgrade for Opendoor but a strategic pivot that could unlock a multi-trillion-dollar market for digital currencies in real estate. The market's enthusiastic reaction reflects a growing appetite for innovation in an industry traditionally slow to adapt. For Opendoor, this move could solidify its reputation as a forward-thinking leader, attracting a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially reshaping the competitive landscape for years to come.

The catalyst for today's market excitement was a concise yet impactful declaration from Opendoor's CEO, Kaz Nejatian. Responding to a query on X (formerly Twitter) about enabling home buying with Bitcoin and other crypto assets, Nejatian unequivocally stated, ""We will. Just need to prioritize it."" This brief message was enough to spark a buying frenzy, as investors quickly grasped the potential of a major real estate platform embracing digital currency transactions. The company's stock had already seen a remarkable year-to-date performance, skyrocketing over 415% higher in 2025, and this latest news further fueled its upward trajectory.

Opendoor's business model, centered on buying, renovating, and reselling homes directly, uniquely positions it to integrate crypto payments. The company plans to convert Bitcoin into U.S. dollars internally during property transactions, effectively shielding individual home sellers from the complexities and volatility of directly accepting digital assets. This approach simplifies compliance and mitigates risk for sellers, making crypto payments a more palatable option for a broader audience. Beyond the crypto announcement, Opendoor has been undergoing a broader transformation under Nejatian, shifting towards an ""AI-first, agent-led"" platform model dubbed ""Key Connections,"" aimed at improving efficiency and generating higher-margin, capital-light revenue. While these operational improvements are expected to impact financials more significantly in 2026, the CEO's crypto signal on October 6, 2025, provided an immediate and strong boost to investor confidence, highlighting the company's commitment to innovation.

The market's initial reaction was distinctly bullish, characterized by a significant spike in trading volume for Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN). Traders and investors viewed the move as a crucial step towards the mainstream adoption of digital currencies, potentially unlocking a vast, untapped market for real estate transactions. This bold step by Opendoor accelerates the integration of Web3 technologies into everyday life, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in property ownership and exchange.

Opendoor's strategic embrace of cryptocurrency payments is poised to create distinct winners and losers across the real estate and financial sectors, redefining competitive dynamics and market opportunities.

Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN) itself stands as a primary beneficiary. By being an early mover among iBuyers to fully integrate crypto payments, it gains a significant competitive advantage. This move could attract a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers, particularly younger, digital-native generations (Millennials and Gen Z), who are looking to diversify their digital assets into tangible real estate. Opendoor's iBuyer model allows for seamless conversion of crypto to fiat, simplifying the process and mitigating volatility risks for sellers, thus enhancing its appeal and market share.

Beyond Opendoor, several other players are set to win. Cryptocurrency payment processors such as Bitpace, CoinsPaid, Propy, BitPay, WCT Pay, and PassimPay will likely see increased demand for their services. These companies provide the crucial infrastructure for crypto-to-fiat conversions and transaction management. Blockchain technology providers and cryptocurrency custodians (like Coinbase, which Opendoor may partner with) will also benefit from increased adoption and the need for secure digital asset storage and management. Furthermore, crypto-wealthy individuals and investors gain a more direct and efficient avenue to deploy their digital assets into the real estate market, offering diversification opportunities. Forward-thinking real estate developers and agents who embrace crypto payments can also expand their client base globally.

On the other hand, traditional financial institutions and real estate entities that are slow to adapt risk losing market share. Traditional banks and mortgage lenders that do not explore or adopt cryptocurrency integration in real estate may find themselves at a disadvantage as more efficient, crypto-backed alternatives emerge. Similarly, traditional real estate agents and brokerages resistant to technological shifts and crypto transactions might struggle to compete with tech-forward platforms. The inherent speed and efficiency of crypto payments could expose the inefficiencies of traditional, slower transaction methods, pressuring companies reliant on older systems to modernize or face obsolescence. The evolving regulatory landscape and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies also pose risks, meaning companies that fail to manage these aspects effectively could face financial or legal challenges.

Opendoor's move to accept cryptocurrency payments is not an isolated event but a significant indicator of broader industry trends converging around the mainstreaming of digital assets and the integration of Web3 technologies into real estate. This decision aligns with the increasing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, with a growing number of investors recognizing their long-term value. Bitcoin, once primarily a speculative asset, is rapidly gaining traction as a viable medium of exchange, with platforms already facilitating multi-million dollar real estate transactions using digital currencies.

This initiative also propels the ""Web3"" movement in real estate, aiming to leverage blockchain technology for enhanced transparency, security, and efficiency in property transactions. Key aspects include the tokenization of real estate, where physical properties are converted into digital tokens, enabling fractional ownership and increasing liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. Smart contracts are set to automate various real estate processes, reducing intermediaries and streamlining complex procedures. The use of decentralized ownership records on a blockchain promises tamper-proof property information, while DeFi (Decentralized Finance) integration could revolutionize real estate lending and borrowing. These advancements promise to lower transaction costs, increase security, and provide global accessibility to real estate investment.

The ripple effects on competitors like Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) and Zillow (NASDAQ: Z) could be substantial. As a major iBuyer, Opendoor's embrace of crypto sets a precedent, potentially compelling other large real estate companies to explore or fast-track their own digital asset strategies to remain competitive. This could spark a new wave of innovation across the proptech sector, driven by the pursuit of faster, more secure, and cost-effective transactions, as well as access to a new demographic of crypto-savvy buyers.

However, the integration of cryptocurrency into real estate also presents a complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are grappling with establishing frameworks for taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and consumer protection in the digital asset space. The IRS currently treats cryptocurrencies as property, which means crypto transactions can trigger capital gains taxes. Stringent AML and Know Your Customer (KYC) screenings are essential to prevent illicit financial activities, as real estate has historically been a target for money laundering. Furthermore, consumer protection in crypto transactions, especially regarding escrow and the absence of traditional banking guarantees, necessitates robust third-party solutions. Legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act in the U.S. House, are underway to establish regulatory structures, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency has begun considering cryptocurrency as an asset for mortgage evaluations.

Historically, the real estate industry has been transformed by disruptive technologies, from the introduction of the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) to the rise of online marketplaces like Zillow and the iBuyer model itself, pioneered by companies like Opendoor. Each shift introduced superior attributes like efficiency, speed, or accessibility, ultimately reshaping the market. Opendoor's adoption of crypto payments is another such wave, promising faster settlements, reduced transaction costs, and increased global access, underscoring the imperative for traditional industries to adapt or risk being left behind.

Opendoor's commitment to integrating cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment, ushering in both short-term adjustments and long-term transformations for the company and the broader real estate market.

In the short term (October 2025 - mid-2027), Opendoor is poised to attract a niche market of crypto-rich buyers and investors, leveraging its iBuyer model to internally convert digital assets to fiat, thereby insulating sellers from volatility. An initial focus on widely recognized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins (e.g., USDC) is likely to mitigate risk. Strategic partnerships with established crypto custodians and payment processors will be crucial for building the necessary technical and financial infrastructure. This move also aligns with Opendoor's ongoing ""AI-first, agent-led"" pivot, enhancing its technology-driven efficiency and potentially bolstering offerings like its ""Key Agent"" app. However, navigating the still-evolving regulatory landscape will be a significant challenge, requiring careful compliance and adaptation.

Looking further ahead (beyond mid-2027), Opendoor's crypto adoption could lead to more profound changes. Enhanced liquidity and global accessibility, facilitated by faster cross-border transactions and lower fees, could significantly expand Opendoor's market reach, particularly with international buyers. The company might eventually explore tokenized real estate, dividing property ownership into digital tokens for fractional ownership and broader investor access. The development of crypto-backed financial products, such as mortgages or lending where digital assets serve as collateral, could attract a new segment of buyers. Ultimately, successful integration could establish Opendoor as a leader in crypto-enabled real estate, driving down transaction costs and increasing security through blockchain technology, thereby compelling competitors to follow suit.

Market opportunities include tapping into new buyer demographics (tech-savvy Millennials, Gen Z, and international investors), increasing transaction speed and efficiency, and spurring innovation in real estate finance. However, significant challenges persist, including the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies, ongoing regulatory uncertainty across jurisdictions, and consumer distrust or education gaps. The complexity of integrating blockchain technology with legacy systems and the tax implications of crypto transactions will also require robust solutions. Despite growing interest, the mainstream adoption of crypto in real estate is still nascent, with many sellers preferring traditional fiat transactions dueposing a barrier to widespread acceptance.

Potential scenarios range from gradual integration and niche success, where Opendoor gains a competitive edge with tech-savvy buyers but broader adoption remains slow due to regulatory hurdles, to a transformative disruption where Opendoor becomes a catalyst for widespread crypto adoption, leading to integral blockchain use in property registries and financing. A third scenario involves significant hurdles, where volatility, regulatory complexities, and consumer distrust limit the impact of crypto payments on Opendoor's transaction volume. Given the current date, October 6, 2025, and the recent nature of the CEO's comments, the market is in an anticipatory phase. Opendoor's execution, the evolution of crypto regulation, and broader market acceptance will determine the long-term trajectory.

Opendoor's (NASDAQ: OPEN) bold announcement regarding cryptocurrency payments marks a pivotal moment for the real estate industry, signaling a decisive step into the digital asset era. The significant stock jump on October 6, 2025, underscores investor confidence in CEO Kaz Nejatian's vision to integrate cutting-edge technology into traditional property transactions. This move is more than just a new payment option; it's a strategic embrace of Web3 principles, promising enhanced efficiency, security, and global accessibility for home buying and selling.

The key takeaway is that Opendoor is positioning itself as an innovator, aiming to capture a new demographic of crypto-wealthy buyers and potentially redefine the competitive landscape. While the path ahead is fraught with challenges—including navigating regulatory complexities, managing crypto volatility, and overcoming consumer skepticism—the potential rewards are immense. Opendoor's internal conversion mechanism for crypto to fiat offers a smart solution to mitigate risks for sellers, making the process more palatable for mainstream adoption.

Moving forward, the market will be keenly watching several developments. Investors should monitor Opendoor's progress in implementing its crypto payment system, including details on which cryptocurrencies will be accepted, the underlying technological infrastructure, and initial transaction volumes. The evolution of cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning real estate transactions, will also be critical. Any clarity or new frameworks from government bodies could either accelerate or hinder widespread adoption. Finally, observing the reactions and strategies of Opendoor's competitors, such as Redfin (NASDAQ: RDFN) and Zillow (NASDAQ: Z), will indicate how quickly the rest of the industry adapts to this digital frontier. Opendoor's digital leap has irrevocably altered the market's trajectory, and its lasting impact will be measured by its ability to turn this ambitious vision into a seamless reality for homebuyers and sellers alike.

AtomOne (ATONE) emerged as a community-driven fork of the Cosmos Hub, created after disputes over governance and validator dominance. Its goal is to restore decentralization through a minimal IBC/ICS hub, a written constitution, and a dual-token system that separates governance (ATONE) from transaction utility.

While AtomOne trades near $1.60 with rising volume, its influence comes less from price action and more from its disruptive architecture. XRP Tundra is drawing comparisons for similar reasons. Instead of reinventing Cosmos governance, it introduces a dual-chain model across Solana and XRPL, while giving presale buyers fixed launch prices, staking rights, and audited security guarantees.

AtomOne's core disruption lies in its constitution and governance model. It rejects delegation-heavy voting, empowers individual stakers, and isolates fee volatility from staking security with its two-token design. The project also embraces Interchain Security, promising resilience as a hub that minimizes complexity while maximizing decentralization.

XRP Tundra is not a governance fork, but the logic is similar: create structural separation in token roles to ensure both utility and stability. Where AtomOne splits governance and fees, Tundra splits yield and governance across chains.



Each presale entry gives investors two assets: TUNDRA-S, a Solana-based utility/yield token, and TUNDRA-X, an XRPL governance/reserve token. In Phase 5, TUNDRA-S costs $0.091, buyers receive a 15% bonus, and free TUNDRA-X allocations valued at $0.0455. Launch prices are fixed at $2.50 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X.

That fixed model echoes AtomOne's separation of functions: governance stability paired with yield capacity. For presale buyers, it also creates measurable ROI. A $500 entry translates into thousands of tokens whose listing value is already defined.

Where AtomOne promotes legitimacy through constitutional governance, Tundra delivers assurance through third-party validation. Its contracts and tokenomics have been audited by Cyberscope, Solidproof, and Freshcoins. Team identity has been verified via Vital Block KYC, with certification published openly.

These steps anchor investor confidence. For a presale environment often criticized for opacity, Tundra's willingness to submit to multiple audits and disclose team credentials is a defining advantage.

AtomOne's innovation is governance, but it does not reward external participants with yield beyond staking ATONE. Tundra expands the value proposition with Cryo Vaults for XRP holders. Vaults lock XRP from 7 to 90 days, with APY boosted via Frost Keys, NFT multipliers that can shorten lock-ups or enhance payouts. Maximum returns reach 30% annually.



Staking is not yet live, but presale participants secure vault slots in advance. This mirrors AtomOne's governance inclusivity: early contributors shape the system's benefits long before broad adoption.

AtomOne minimized governance risk by simplifying its hub role. Tundra minimizes launch risk through Meteora's DAMM V2 pools. Dynamic fees start high (around 50%) and decrease over time, making dumping and bot activity costly. Liquidity positions are NFT-based, giving providers flexibility, while permanent lock options guarantee depth.

Trading fees are redirected into Cryo Vault staking, meaning trading activity funds long-term rewards. This ensures that early volatility reinforces, rather than undermines, investor confidence.

AtomOne's disruption lies in governance reform across the Cosmos ecosystem. XRP Tundra's disruption lies in presale economics: dual tokens across chains, fixed launch valuations, staking rights, and independently verified oversight. Both projects signal that structural innovation — not meme hype — defines the next wave of crypto adoption.

Independent commentators, such as Crypto Goat, frame Tundra's presale as a rare chance to replicate AtomOne-level disruption but with multipliers locked in from the start.



AtomOne's constitution shows how governance innovation can shape ecosystems. XRP Tundra offers investors their own disruptive pathway: Solana + XRPL integration, dual tokens, yield, and fixed multipliers backed by audits and KYC. With Phase 5 allocations nearly exhausted, the presale window is closing fast.

ARK Invest, the asset management firm led by CEO Cathie Wood, is leaning into the tokenization boom by taking a stake in tokenization specialist Securitize as Wall Street races to bring assets onchain.

The ARK Venture Fund (ARKVX), ARK's closed-end, actively managed fund that invests in public and private companies, held 3.25% of its assets in Securitize, making the firm the fund's eighth largest position following artificial intelligence (AI) companies X.AI and Anthropic, according to the fund's latest disclosure dated September 30.

Based on the fund's $325.3 million in net assets under management as of September 30, Ark's stake in Securitize should be valued at roughly $10 million, according to CoinDesk's calculation.

ARK's investment comes as tokenization emerges as one of the hottest trends in crypto, bringing traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and stocks onto blockchain rails. Global banks and asset managers are exploring tokenization to cut settlement times, broaden investor access and keep markets open around the clock. 

It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market has grown 112% to $33 billion year-to-date, RWA.xyz data shows, and could swell to $18.9 trillion by 2033, Ripple and BCG projected earlier this year.

Securitize, founded in 2017 and led by CEO Carlos Domingo, is one of the early pioneers of the tokenization space. It issued $4.6 billion in tokenized assets working with traditional finance giants such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and Apollo. It is also known as the issuer behind BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) that's leading the tokenized U.S. Treasury sector with $2.8 billion in assets. 

The firm is also active in equity tokenization, creating on-chain shares of listed wallet provider Exodus in 2022 and entering into an agreement with ether ETH$4,005.03 treasury firm FG Nexus (FGNX) to introduce its common and preferred stock to the Ethereum blockchain.

Ark's investment follows Securitize's $47 million fundraising round last year, led by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane (HLNE), with ParaFi Capital and Tradeweb Markets (TW) also participating.

The wave of massive contracts in the artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC) sector continues, with the latest coming from OpenAI, which has agreed to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). 

The deal, according to the Financial Times, could also see OpenAI acquire up to a 10% stake in AMD over time. AMD shares surged around 30% currently changing hands at about $225.

The chips purchased under this agreement will provide a total computing power capacity of 6 gigawatts (GW). OpenAI executives estimate that 1 GW of capacity costs roughly $50 billion to develop, including chips and the necessary supporting infrastructure, according to the article. 

As a result, shares of AI and HPC-focused miners often rally on the back of such large-scale deals and infrastructure buildouts. During Monday's U.S. open: Bitfarms (BITF) gained 8%, IREN (IREN) rose 12% to trade at all-time highs around $56, Hive Digital (HIVE) advanced 12%, Cipher Mining (CIFR) climbed 7%, CleanSpark (CLSK) added 5%, and TerraWulf (WULF) was also up 5%.

Galaxy Digital (GLXY) has emerged as a key beneficiary of the rapid re-pricing in the AI and HPC infrastructure sector, having converted its Helios campus into a large-scale AI/HPC data center. 

In August, the company secured $1.4 billion in project financing to retrofit the facility and signed a long-term lease with CoreWeave (CRWV) covering up to 800 MW of compute capacity.

It's shares were also higher by 5% on Monday as the AMD news combined with the company's launch of GalaxyOne, a new wealth management platform offering 4% yield on FDIC-insured cash and seamless auto-investment into crypto and U.S equities. 

GLXY shares are now up 116% year-to-date.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), the Ethereum-focused digital asset treasury firm led by Fundstrat's Thomas Lee, continued to buy ether ETH$4,005.03 adding 179,251 tokens to its balance sheet through last week, worth roughly $820 million at current prices.

With the latest purchase, the firm's ETH stash surpassed 2.83 million tokens, more than 2% of the second largest cryptocurrency's supply, according to a Monday press release.

Shares are up 4% premarket alongside the weekend gains in crypto prices.

The company said total crypto and cash reserves stand at $13.4 billion, including $456 million in cash, 192 bitcoin BTC$111,480.33, and a stake in Eightco Holdings (ORBS), a digital asset treasury vehicle focused on WLD$1.3077.

BMNR stock was up 4.3% pre-market at just over $59, its strongest level in two weeks.

Since the firm's June pivot, BitMine is part of the digital asset treasury trend where publicly-traded firms raise funds to accumulate cryptocurrencies, following the playbook of Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate bitcoin owner.

Shares of Galaxy Digital rose 8% in premarket trading Monday as the company rolled out GalaxyOne, a mobile and web platform built to give retail investors access to a blend of cash, crypto, and equity investing tools, with yield at the core.



The app gives users access to FDIC-insured high-yield cash accounts, crypto trading, and U.S. equities and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the company announced in a press release. Galaxy says it's offering 4% annual returns on regular cash deposits and up to 8% for accredited investors through its Galaxy Premium Yield product. Both rates are powered by the company's institutional lending business, which manages a loan book of more than $1.1 billion.



Beyond passive yield, GalaxyOne users can trade across digital assets like bitcoin BTC$111,480.33, ether ETH$4,005.03 and solana SOL$232.53, as well as stocks listed on major U.S. exchanges. Galaxy also offers automated reinvestment of earnings into crypto or cash, aiming to simplify compounding returns, the company said.



The launch puts Galaxy in direct competition with Robinhood (HOOD) and Coinbase (COIN), two of the dominant players among digital-first retail traders in the U.S. Both have launched new services this year — including crypto staking, margin trading and retirement accounts — as they try to lock in more users and increase assets held on their platforms.



HOOD and COIN are both trading about 2% higher in pre-market trading alongside a general rise in stock and crypto markets.



Galaxy's move is notable in part because of its institutional background. The company went public on Nasdaq in May and its stock is up 100% since the listing. Originally built on the infrastructure of Fierce, a fintech platform Galaxy acquired last year, GalaxyOne signals a broader push into consumer finance from a firm historically focused on institutional clients.



Galaxy said more features are on the way, including business accounts, crypto staking and expanded lending products.

 Grayscale became the first US crypto fund issuer to feature staking for its Ethereum and Solana exchange-traded products. 

Crypto asset manager Grayscale has introduced staking for its exchange-traded products (ETPs), becoming the first US-based crypto fund issuer to offer staking-based passive income opportunities.

Grayscale said on Monday its Ether (ETH) ETFs — the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) — are now the first US-listed spot crypto funds to offer staking, calling the development “another first-mover milestone.”

Grayscale's Solana (SOL) fund, the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), has also enabled staking and is awaiting regulatory approval for uplisting to an ETP, which would make it one of the first spot Solana ETPs to enable staking, according to the company's Monday X post.

By enabling staking across its Ethereum and Solana products, Grayscale said it aims to give investors exposure to the “long-term value accrual of these networks while maintaining the funds' core objectives.”

“Staking in our spot Ethereum and Solana funds is exactly the kind of first mover innovation Grayscale was built to deliver,” said Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors.”

Both ETHE and ETH are exchange-traded products registered under the Securities Act of 1933, not the Investment Company Act of 1940, the latter being the regulatory framework used for traditional mutual funds. 

This makes them structurally different from ETFs governed by the 1940 Act, though they follow the same legal framework used for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether ETFs.

“ETHE and ETH hold digital assets; however, an investment in ETHE and ETH is not a direct investment in digital assets,” Grayscale said.

Grayscale said it will stake via institutional custodians and a diversified network of validator providers and that investors can access the products through standard brokerage accounts

Grayscale reported about $35 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30.

The news comes as the industry awaits US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulatory approval of the first US-listed Ether staking ETFs.

The approval of the first Ether staking ETF may bring significant new institutional capital for the crypto industry, according to 10x Research's head of research, Markus Thielen.

“This would mark a monumental structural shift in how institutional capital flows into Ethereum, unlocking a new era of yield-driven participation,” Thielen told Cointelegraph.

The development comes three months after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF debuted on the Cboe BZX Exchange, recording $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in inflows on its opening day, Cointelegraph reported on July 3.

Rex-Osprey's fund was the first to launch a Solana staking ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allows crypto ETFs to hold the majority of their spot assets directly and distribute staking rewards where applicable.

More broadly, spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs in the US have been approved through exchange rule filings (Rule 19b-4) and Securities Act registration, not under the 1940 Act. The SEC has also recently permitted in-kind creations and redemptions for some crypto ETPs.

 Analysts predict further gains to $150,000 after Bitcoin surged to a record high, driven by massive ETF inflows and a weakening US dollar. 

Bitcoin could be poised for further gains in the weeks ahead after clocking a new record high on Sunday, according to analysts. 

“Now that we've made new ATHs in an impulsive manner, the next leg to $150k+ has begun,” said crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto on Sunday, following Bitcoin's (BTC) surge to a record high of $125,700. 

The analyst said we'll “blast through” this current level, suggesting that another high could come this week, though didn't rule out a pullback to the $108,000 to $118,000 zone. 

Long-term crypto trader Crypto Chase echoed the sentiment, predicting on Sunday that “a new leg up seems likely.” If Bitcoin is truly strong, “the pullbacks will be minor at best,” they added.

“I feel like BTC is about to see another ATH within hours,” said Hyperliquid whale trader James Wynn, who added, “I believe price discovery mode has started. It's taken a long time due to price suppression, and gold and stocks are grabbing all the attention.”

Meanwhile, Bitcoin had just printed its highest weekly close in history at $123,543, according to TradingView. 

Several factors have been attributed to the 11% surge over the past week, including the US government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1. 

“We think that because of the US government shutdown and other monetary pressures, investors could be seeing Bitcoin as a safe haven, giving them another vehicle to diversify away from the US dollar and Treasurys,” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at the BTSE exchange, told Cointelegraph. 

He added that the US dollar is depreciating and is likely to depreciate even more if interest rates decline further, “it only makes sense that investors allocate more capital to other currencies and Bitcoin.”

Bitcoin's record high comes at the same time as the US dollar is seeing its worst performance for decades. The US Dollar Index, which measures the US dollar against a basket of currencies, has declined by more than 12% since the beginning of this year. 

Meanwhile, venture capital investor Will Clemente said the big Bitcoin move wasn't driven by digital asset treasuries or derivatives trading, but spot exchange-traded funds, which were “viewing BTC as a rotation from commodities and small caps.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw “ridiculous numbers” last week with $3.2 billion in inflows, resulting in their second-best week since launch, observed Nova Dius President Nate Geraci.

The combination of these influences and bullish seasonality — BTC has gained in eight out of 12 past fourth quarters and 10 of the past 12 Octobers — could lead to another rally this month. 

“It's incredibly strong that we go from $110K to $125K in a single week,” said crypto YouTuber Michaël van de Poppe on Sunday.

Last week, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards predicted that Bitcoin's breakout above $120,000 would lead to a “very quick move” to $150,000.

 Traditional banks will be battling with stablecoin issuers for retail depositors when the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act takes full effect in a win for everyday people. 

The stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, which was enacted in July, will trigger an exodus of deposits from traditional bank accounts into higher-yield stablecoins, according to the co-founder of Multicoin Capital.

“The GENIUS Bill is the beginning of the end for banks' ability to rip off their retail depositors with minimal interest,” Multicoin Capital's co-founder and managing partner, Tushar Jain, posted to X on Saturday.

“Post Genius Bill, I expect the big tech giants with mega distribution (Meta, Google, Apple, etc) to start competing with banks for retail deposits,” Jain added, arguing that they would offer better stablecoin yields with a better user experience for instant settlement and 24/7 payments over traditional banking players.

He noted that banking groups tried to “protect their profits” in mid-August by calling on regulators to close a so-called loophole that may allow stablecoin issuers to pay interest or yields on stablecoins through their affiliates.

The GENIUS Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from offering interest or yield to holders of the token but doesn't explicitly extend the ban to crypto exchanges or affiliated businesses, potentially enabling issuers to sidestep the law by offering yields through those partners. 

US banking groups are concerned that the wide adoption of yield-bearing stablecoins could undermine the traditional banking system, which relies on banks attracting deposits to fund lending.

Mass stablecoin adoption could trigger around $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows from the traditional banking system, the US Department of the Treasury estimated in April.

“The result will be greater deposit flight risk, especially in times of stress, that will undermine credit creation throughout the economy. The corresponding reduction in credit supply means higher interest rates, fewer loans, and increased costs for Main Street businesses and households,” the Bank Policy Institute said in August.

To stay competitive, “banks are going to have to pay more interest to depositors,” Jain said, adding that “their earnings will significantly suffer as a result.”

The average interest rate for US savings accounts is 0.40%, and in Europe, the average rate on savings accounts is 0.25%, Patrick Collison, CEO of online payments platform Stripe, said last week.

Meanwhile, rates for Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC) on the borrowing and lending platform Aave currently stand at 4.02% and 3.69%, respectively.

Jain's bet on the Big Tech giants follows a Fortune report in June stating that Apple, Google, Airbnb, and X were among the top companies exploring issuing stablecoins to lower fees and improve cross-border payments. There haven't been any further developments since.

The stablecoin market currently sits at $308.3 billion, led by USDT and USDC at $177 billion and $75.2 billion, CoinGecko data shows.

The Treasury Department predicts the stablecoin market cap will boom another 566% to reach $2 trillion by 2028.

Prime Numbers Show Unexpected Patterns of Fractal Chaos

Mathematicians have found a new way to predict how prime numbers behave

By Lyndie Chiou edited by Clara Moskowitz

Prime numbers are sometimes called math's “atoms” because they can be divided by only themselves and 1. For two millennia, mathematicians have wondered if the prime numbers are truly random, or if some unknown pattern underlies their ordering. Recently number theorists have proposed several surprising conjectures on prime patterns—in particular, probabilistic patterns that show up in large groups of the mathematical atoms.

The patterns in the primes trace back to an 1859 hypothesis involving the legendary Riemann zeta function. Mathematician Bernhard Riemann derived a function that counts the number of primes up to a number x. It includes three main ingredients: a smooth estimate, a set of corrective terms coming from the Riemann zeta function, and a small error term.

Much has been written about the Riemann zeta function, but the most important thing to know is that it provides a correction to the smooth estimate. To do so, it takes on a wavy pattern, sometimes raising the count, sometimes lowering it. These corrective oscillations are determined by the locations of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. In fact, the celebrated Riemann hypothesis claims that all such zeros lie on a “critical line” where the real part equals 1⁄2.

The zeros intrigue mathematicians for two reasons. First, they imply that the zeta function is encoding as-yet-unknown information about the primes. Second, they suggest that the spacing of the primes, despite irregularities, is as orderly as possible; smaller fluctuations would contradict the density of the primes.

Taken together, this means the error in Riemann's prime counting formula is as minimal as possible.

The hypothesis has been verified all the way into the trillions—but never proven. It would only take a single counterexample to upend much of modern number theory, so proving the hypothesis has been a priority in mathematics for decades.

For the century following Riemann's discovery, however, mathematicians were stymied by the seemingly random structure of the prime numbers. The problem was so difficult and so important that in 2000 the Clay Mathematics Institute set up a million-dollar bounty for anyone who could prove Riemann's hypothesis.

In particular, the prime numbers were shown to obey certain random measures. In math, a measure is concerned with the statistical behavior of a large number of things. For instance, a single particle of gas might be easy to model, but to predict the behavior of a large cloud of billions of particles would be beyond today's computational power. Instead the overall statistics of the cloud's movements can be captured as a particular type of random measure.

Northwestern University mathematician Maksym Radziwill calls the technique a probability oracle. “I can quickly get the truth out of probability,” he says. “I can find the right model, and then I can figure out what is the right answer for pretty much any question.” But the oracle fails to explain the deeper meaning behind that answer, leaving mathematicians with few insights for how to prove their new discoveries.

To be clear, the primes are not random numbers; they are completely deterministic. But if you choose a large number of primes, their distribution—theway they are spread across the number line—behaves statistically like certain types of random sequences. But what kinds?

The first measure of the primes was found in the 1970s during a chance discussion between University of Cambridge Ph.D. student Hugh Montgomery and famed physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study. Montgomery was wary of bothering the venerable Dyson but diffidently told him about his work, says Jon Keating, a mathematical physicist at the University of Oxford familiar with the story. Dyson reacted with extreme excitement, realizing that Montgomery's ideas tied into projects he was already working on.

Dyson was well versed with random measures because of a collaboration with Nobel Prize–winning physicist Eugene Wigner to understand the mathematics of the nuclei of heavy atoms. Directly calculating the allowed energies of such heavily populated nuclei was too complex, so Wigner statistically predicted the energy levels. The results showed energies that fell on “regularly” irregular spacings; they weren't clumped tightly together or extremely far apart.

Montgomery happened to find strikingly similar behavior in the prime numbers— specifically, the correlations between the positions of the notorious zeros of the Riemann zeta function. They weren't evenly spaced, but neither were they completely uncorrelated.

In a discovery as shocking as it was beautiful, the spacings between the zeros of the Riemann zeta function were shown to match the same type of random measure that described quantum systems. For the prime numbers, it hinted at subtle patterns woven into otherwise murky statistics.

Since then, close to a dozen random measures have been linked to the primes, but many of the findings amount to conjectures. “A lot of these results really build your intuition,” Radziwill says. “They tell you what a typical object looks like, but they don't actually prove results by themselves.”

At a September 2025 conference, Adam Harper, a number theorist at the University of Warwick in England, presented a proof of a different random measure's suitability in the quest to find prime patterns. Gaussian multiplicative chaos captures highly fluctuating, scale-invariant randomness, which describes various chaotic systems, from turbulence to quantum gravity and even financial markets. Because fractals are scale-invariant, it is sometimes also referred to as a “random fractal measure.” Surprisingly, Harper's proof showed that statistics associated with the zeros of the zeta function could also be captured by random fractal measures.

Furthermore, Harper, Max Wenqiang Xu of New York University and Kannan Soundararajan of Stanford University found a way to predict when this chaotic behavior emerged in the primes. Random measures describe large collections of prime numbers. But as you consider smaller and smaller collections, the statistics change, losing their probabilistic patterns and reverting to pure, unstructured randomness. The group announced during a 2025 summer conference that if random fractal measures described the numbers up to x, then for all the intervals in a transition period (x to x + y, where y is small) they could calculate the exact mix of randomness and chaos. Following this interval, the statistics reverted to random fractal measures.

When mathematicians tried to look at the short interval (x to x + √x), they were thrust into deeper mathematical waters dubbed “beyond the square root barrier.” Inside this small stretch, Harper conjectured in a 2023 paper that, after 200 years, he had found a better way to count prime numbers than Riemann's historic equation. And indeed, in a 2025 paper, Xu and Victor Wang, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics in Taiwan, demonstrated that Harper's conjecture was true. The derivation fell short of a complete proof because it relied on a separate conjecture imported from physicists. “That's the very funny part,” Xu says. “I'm personally not a big fan of physics, but my work relies on their intuition.”

But what do all these findings really say about the primes? Radziwill is cautious. “If I have a random number generator on a computer, it's not random to me,” he says. “But if you don't know how it's functioning, it's random to you.” In other words, just as a cloud of gas particles could be described deterministically if a powerful enough computer existed, there may be a highly complex deterministic method that can describe the primes. Until then, mathematicians (and physicists) continue to grapple with the meaning behind the many profound probabilistic patterns.

Enceladus's Alien Ocean, Ancient Fungi and the Flavor of Influenza

Saturn's moon Enceladus shows signs of life-supporting chemistry, fungi may have shaped Earth before plants, and repeat COVID infections raise long-term health risks for kids.

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed.

First, some exciting space news. According to a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, the ocean of Saturn's moon Enceladus contains complex organic molecules that indicate the environment could potentially support life.

Enceladus is a moon about as wide across as the state of Arizona. Back in 2005 the Cassini spacecraft caught plumes of water vapor and frozen particles shooting up from tiger-stripe-like fissures in the planet's icy crust. Subsequent analysis of gravity measurements captured by Cassini confirmed the presence of a subsurface ocean near the moon's south pole about a decade later.

Cassini's mission ended in 2017, but new analysis of data from a 2008 flyby just yielded additional insights into the frosty moon's watery reservoir. In flying through one of Enceladus's water plumes the spacecraft exposed its Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument to tiny, freshly ejected grains of ice.

After years of studying data from different flyby events to understand how Cassini's instruments behaved under different conditions, scientists were able to apply their findings to old data and find new patterns.

The new study determined that several sophisticated carbon-based structures, including esters and ethers, can be found in the subsurface waters of Enceledus. That's important because these structures are identical to substances considered to be vital chemical building blocks for living organisms on Earth. And that adds to evidence the moon could be a compelling candidate for hosting some kind of life—or at least allowing us to gain a better understanding of how life evolved on our own planet.

Speaking of life as we know it—and how the heck it got here—a study published last Wednesday in Nature Ecology & Evolution suggests that for hundreds of millions of years before plant life made it onto land, fungi may have dominated the planet.

The delicate filaments of mycelium that typically make up the bodies of fungi don't tend to fossilize well, and the fossils they do leave behind are often microscopic and hard to identify. This new study aimed to overcome that issue with the help of a “molecular clock.” Essentially, scientists can plot out the timeline of one species's divergence from another by tallying up the difference in their respective numbers of genetic mutations, which happen at fairly regular intervals as organisms evolve.

Counting the ticks of a molecular clock is only possible if you have regular anchor points from the fossil record to calibrate them, which is tricky for fungi. The researchers behind the new study got around that by integrating instances of horizontal gene transfer between species, along with mutations passed down from one generation to the next. Tracking when a gene moved from one lineage to another helped the scientists pinpoint which organisms emerged when, which they say has allowed them to tighten up the timeline of fungal evolution. The study suggests that fungi evolved from a common ancestor dating back to roughly 1.4 to 0.9 billion years ago, which is about half a billion years or more before land plants evolved. The researchers argue that fungi may have paved the way for plants by breaking down rocks and cycling nutrients to create the first soils.

Now for some health news. According to a study published last week in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, the risk of children and young adults developing long COVID could be twice as high with a second infection than with the first. Looking at 2022 and 2023 data from about 465,000 children and adolescents , the researchers found an increased risk of chronic symptoms potentially related to the condition such as severe fatigue, headaches, kidney damage, abdominal pain, cognitive issues and abnormal heartbeats after a second COVID infection. Blood clots were more than twice as likely with a repeat COVID case, and the risk of myocarditis—a potentially lethal swelling of the heart—actually more than tripled. The study authors noted that long COVID cases weren't necessarily linked to severe illness during the acute COVID infection. The researchers argue that this highlights the need for ongoing immunization of young people.

In some lighter respiratory infection news a study published last Wednesday in ACS Central Science hints that we might one day have access to an easy, surprisingly tasty method of diagnosing the flu at home. The researchers behind the new study have reportedly created a molecular sensor that reacts to the presence of flu virus by producing a distinct flavor.

The sensor responds to neuraminidase, which is a glycoprotein that the influenza virus uses to infect cells. The synthesized substance used in the sensor is attached to a molecule of thymol, which is found in the herb thyme and produces a strong taste. In lab tests using vials of human saliva the presence of influenza caused the thymol to break off on its own. In a human mouth that reaction should lead to a distinct herbal flavor. The researchers say they hope to conduct human clinical trials of a flu test in roughly the next couple of years.

Speaking of surprisingly delicious things, a study published last Friday in iScience shows how a traditional recipe for yogurt used a rather unusual secret ingredient to kick-start fermentation: ants.

Yogurt forms when microorganisms ferment milk and create lactic acid, which thickens the dairy and gives it a tangy taste. In the early 20th century scientists isolated some of the bacterial strains capable of accomplishing this, and now yogurt production largely relies on just a couple species of bacteria.

A lot of traditional yogurt-making methods fell by the wayside as production became standardized, including a traditional practice from the Balkans and Turkey involving red wood ants. The authors behind the new study decided to take a closer look at that recipe.

Under the guidance of the Bulgarian family of one of the study's co-authors, along with other locals, the researchers placed four ants into a vessel of warm milk and covered the jar with a piece of cheesecloth. The researchers then buried it in an ant mound overnight, where the heat produced by the colony's activity served as an incubator for fermentation. By the next day the sample showed early signs of fermentation, with the milk coagulating, becoming more acidic and taking on a slightly sour taste.

Back in the lab the team confirmed that the red wood ants carry lactic and acetic acid bacteria, including a type similar to one found in commercial sourdough. The scientists also found that the formic acid ants produce as a defense mechanism serves to acidify the milk and , probably helps create a better environment for the microbes.

The researchers even partnered with chefs from a two-star Michelin restaurant to create dishes such as ant-powered ice cream and soft cheese. But don't go digging around in your backyard to find fermentation buddies just yet: the scientists do warn that live ants can carry parasites, while frozen or dehydrated ants come with their own potential risks. That can add an element of danger to the process if you don't have the right equipment and knowledge to confirm the yogurt is safe to consume.

That's all for this week's science news roundup. Tune in on Wednesday to hear how one of the Internet's most famous astronauts is using his experience in spaceflight to write alternate-history thrillers.

See Stunning Feline Photography Revealing the Science of Cats

Tim Flach captures his fascination with the science of cats in stunning photographs from his new book Feline

By Liz Tormes & Meghan Bartels edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Cats with pale blue eyes carry a mutation that prevents color pigments from forming and spreading through the body before birth. In eyes without pigments, light can only bounce off tiny stray particles in the iris that reflect only blue light's very short wavelengths.

Tim Flach

Photographer Tim Flach's new book is unusually personal: it includes images not only of his cat—a regal orange-and-white former barn kitten named Loki—but also of his brain, thanks to MRI scans gathered as he looked at cute images.

The photographer has dedicated previous books to horses, dogs and endangered species—and shot photos of songbirds for Scientific American—but had been hesitant to take on the notoriously uncooperative felines. “My publishers from day one have been wanting me to do a cat book,” Flach says. “My problem was, how can I do a cat book and come out with dignity?” But he persevered, producing a book called Feline (Abrams) that combines his images with text by Jonathan Losos, an evolutionary biologist at Washington University in St. Louis.

As the book came together, Flach was fascinated to learn what science knows—and doesn't know—about felines of all forms and the long evolutionary history of cats. “Thirty million years back, we'd have recognized a cat,” he says, “whereas we wouldn't recognize [human ancestors] somewhere, arboreally going up some tree.”

The book also nods to conversations about photo manipulation and generation, including by artificial intelligence, as Flach and the rest of us attempt to navigate a world of doctored images.

“The problem in the past used to be just getting the cat to stay on the table,” he says. “Now the problem is proving it was ever there in the first place.”



Tim Flach

This Persian cat named Atchoum became an Internet star because of his hypertrichosis, a condition that causes excess hair growth and claw thickening. The condition more often occurs in humans—it can be either genetic or a side effect of certain medications.

This image shows off the talents of athletic Savannah, a cross of the domestic cat with a small African cat called a serval, nicknamed the “giraffe cat.”



Tim Flach

Flach worked with a Devon Rex cat named Gobbilino—and a rare camera lens he says he had to fly in just for the shoot—to capture this unique image highlighting the tapetum lucidum, a sheet of reflective cells behind the retina of the cat's eye. These specialized cells contain crystals that reflect the light that reaches them back into the retina, increasing the amount of light the eyes can absorb. The tapetum lucidum also produces the eerie “eyeshine” that makes a cat's eyes appear to glow in the dark—this is the light reflected off the crystals that is not absorbed by the retina. The image also shows how dramatically a cat can dilate its pupil, with the thin golden ring of the iris circling its vast extent.



Tim Flach

Feline includes images of both beloved house cats and their wild compatriots, such as the Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul) pictured here. These cats range across Central Asia (they are called “manul” in the Kyrgyz language) and are specialized for life in in cold habitats, including at elevations as high as 16,000 feet. The Pallas's cat is about the same size as a domestic cat but has particularly densely packed hairs that are the longest of any feline species, which make it appear larger. Another adaptation to their climate is the small size of their ears, which reduces heat loss.



Tim Flach

Flach also traveled to South America's massive Pantanal wetlands to photograph perhaps the region's most regal resident: the jaguar (Panthera onca). The animals turned out to be surprisingly cooperative, Flach says. Traditionally nocturnal, these cats have lately become visible in the Pantanal during the day because they have learned the value of hunting local sunbathing reptiles called caimans, he says. “I got more shots in a day than I did of the domestic cats,” Flach says of the jaguars he photographed.

A litter of six 10-week-old Devon Rex kittens. The breed, which some say inspired the cinematic alien E.T., is known for expressive tail wags as well as furry legs and ears. The kittens are born with a plush “kitten coat” that they lose by around 11 weeks old, leaving them temporarily bald until their adult fur grows in.



Tim Flach

Flach enlisted his assistant April Ironside's cat Poppy, who enjoys drinking from the faucet, to show off the feline tongue. Cat tongues are characterized by tiny spines called papillae, which are made of the same compound as human fingernails, keratin.



Tim Flach

Flach has extensively photographed wild species, especially for his previous book Endangered. One of his core aims is connecting viewers with the natural world. “It's not about a distant nonhuman world,” he says. “It's about making it personal, characterful and relatable.”



Tim Flach

All cats are cute, but some are particularly cute—such as this Scottish fold named George, whose tiny ears and rounded face are exaggerated features that humans find appealing. (George appears in the same section of the book as the scans of Flach's brain as he viewed baby photos.)



Tim Flach

Gracing the cover of Feline is a cat named Boy, who lives in Indonesia and has found Internet fame because of his facial markings, which give him the appearance of a masked hero. “We're unmasking what it is to be feline [in this book], and he seemed the perfect model,” Flach said in a video on his website in which he shared the experience of photographing the feline celebrity. “Boy was pretty professional,” he said. “I feel very, very lucky to have such a cool cat on the cover of my book.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Women Live Longer Than Men. Scientists Might Finally Know Why.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a68805403/women-live-longer-than-men/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:45:00 GMT","

Researchers who analyzed data from zoo animals found that it is not only genetics, but mating pressures that may determine which sex has the longer lifespan.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

While people are living longer than ever, women almost always have the higher average life expectancy than men—and this is not exclusively a human phenomenon. Mammalian lifespans usually favor females—with some exceptions, they tend to live about 12 percent longer than males. But the opposite is seen in many species of birds, insects, and reptiles, where males often outlive females. 

Genetics may be the reason behind this. It is though that the two X chromosomes of female mammals—which make them monogametic—may actually protect them from detrimental genetic mutations that heterogametic males do not have as much of a defense against, as they only have one X and one Y chromosome. This reverses in birds, where males are the monogametic sex and females are heterogametic.

But genetics are not necessarily the only reason female mammals (and male birds) have an advantage. To try and solve the rest of the puzzle, an international team of researchers—led by Johanna Stärk from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany—investigated what factors can lengthen or shorten male and female lifespans. Zoo records from over a thousand bird and mammal species appeared to support what is known as the heterogametic sex hypothesis, and so did data from species in the wild. But it could still not explain exceptions, such as female birds of prey being longer-lived than males. 

As it turns out, sexual selection might be what determines who gets to live longer—one sex of a species may ultimately drain potential lifespan by using too many resources to develop and maintain traits that give them an edge in attracting mates. It is also possible that reproduction itself can take years off the life of one sex. Survival rates can be reduced by the stresses of gestation, giving birth or laying eggs, and caring for offspring, though this doesn't seem to affect the average lifespans of human females. Stärk's team focused mostly on data from zoo populations because animals living in a zoo are not exposed to the added pressures of predators, illness, injury, or starvation. 

“Species often live considerably longer in zoos than in the wild, and abundant resources and managed reproduction in zoos may lower individual survival costs associated with growth and reproduction,” the team said in a study recently published in the journal Science Advances. “For example, the influence of sexual size dimorphism on male survival tends to be lower, and the individual cost of producing offspring appears to have no effect on female survival in zoo settings.”

In zoos, female mammals had an even greater lifespan advantage of 16 percent, with male birds at 6 percent. But it was even more surprising that male birds lived an average of 5 times longer in the wild, and female mammals lived 1.5 times longer. There were still some mammals that defied the odds—about 5 percent of male mammals in zoos and 7 percent in the wild outlived females, and the same went for 4 percent of female birds in zoos and slightly over 2 percent in the wild that outlived the males of their species. The female advantage was especially high in ungulates such as hippos, rhinos, antelope, and zebras, while there was more of a male advantage in carnivorous mammals.

Monogamy and polygamy may also have something to do with how long males and females live. Males of polygamous species of mammals often experience intense competition for a mate. As a result, a larger body size and built-in weapons like teeth and claws may give them the advantage with females, but they also may use up enough energy and other body resources to shorten their lifespans. More birds tend to be monogamous (compared to mammals), and without as much pressure to show off for mates, male birds that are not sexually dimorphic often have longer lives. 

There are some outliers, however. Male birds of paradise have flamboyant plumage (never mind elaborate mating dances), and most species are polygamous,—all factors which may lower lifespan. But males are still living longer overall across bird species, while females have the longer lifespans among mammals.

“Our findings may help explain why differences in [average life expectancy] between men and women are so consistent across time and cultures,” Stärk said. “Specifically, female-biased [average lifespan] appears to be common to chimpanzees and gorillas, suggesting that longer life expectancies for females are a characteristic long embedded in our evolutionary history.”

The sun-drenched paradise of Thailand's Phi Phi islands isn't the usual starting point for a PhD. But for Sarah Sajedi, those soft, sandy beaches - or rather, what she found under them -inspired her pivot from a business career to an academic one.

""I was standing there looking out at this gorgeous view of the Andaman Sea, and then I looked down and beneath my feet were all these pieces of plastic, most of them water bottles,"" she says.

""I've always had a passion for waste reduction, but I realized that this was a problem with consumption.""

Sajedi, BSc '91, decided to return to Concordia to pursue a PhD with a focus on plastic waste. As the co-founder of ERA Environmental Management Solutions, a leading provider of environmental, health and safety software, she brought decades of experience to complement her studies.

Her latest paper, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, looks at the science around the health risks posed by single-use plastic water bottles. They are serious, she says, and seriously understudied.

Tiny threats, little known

In her review of over 140 scientific articles, Sajedi writes that individuals on average ingest between 39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles per year, and bottled water users consume 90,000 more particles than tap water consumers.

The particles are usually invisible to the naked eye. A microplastic particle can range between one micron -- a thousandth of a millimeter -- to five millimeters; nanoplastics are smaller than one micron.

They emerge as bottles are made, stored, transported and broken down over their lifespans. Because they are often made from low-quality plastic, they shed tiny pieces every time they are manipulated and exposed to sunlight and temperature fluctuations. And unlike other types of plastic particles, which enter human bodies through the food chain, these are ingested directly from the source.

As Sajedi notes, the health consequences can be severe. Once inside the body, these small plastics can cross biological boundaries, enter the bloodstream and reach vital organs. This can lead to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress on cells, hormonal disruption, impaired reproduction, neurological damage and various kinds of cancer. However, the long-term effects remain poorly understood due to a lack of widespread testing and standardized methods of measurement and detection.

Sajedi identifies multiple methods researchers have used to measure nano- and microplastics, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some, for instance, can detect very small particles but cannot identify their chemical composition. Others can provide details about their makeup but miss the smallest plastics. And the best, most advanced and most reliable tools are often extremely costly and not always available.

Education is the best prevention

Sajedi is encouraged by the legislative action that has been adopted by governments around the world aimed at limiting plastic waste. However, she notes that the most common targets are single-use plastic bags, straws and packaging. Very few address the pressing issue of single-use water bottles.

""Education is the most important action we can take,"" she says. ""Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency but it is not something that should be used in daily life. People need to understand that the issue is not acute toxicity -- it is chronic toxicity.""

Chunjiang An, associate professor, and Zhi Chen, professor, in the Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science contributed to this paper.

Key Takeaways

New study findings show that over 40% of drivers who died in motor vehicle collisions tested positive for active delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in their system, with average blood levels far exceeding those considered to cause impairment. The research highlights a significant and persistent public health risk that is unchanged by the legalization of recreational cannabis, the authors said.

The research will be presented at the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Clinical Congress 2025 in Chicago, October 4-7.

Researchers analyzed coroner records from Montgomery County in Ohio from January 2019 to September 2024, focusing on 246 deceased drivers who were tested for THC following a fatal crash. When autopsies are performed, drug screening is typically part of the process. The study period included the state's legalization of recreational cannabis in 2023.

""I was surprised to see that level,"" said lead author Akpofure P. Ekeh, MBBS, FACS, a professor of surgery at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. ""An average level of 30.7 ng/mL generally means those people must have consumed marijuana at some time close to driving. This isn't about residual use; it's about recent consumption.""

Key Study Findings

The study notes that blood THC levels are typically drawn by the coroner within hours of death, providing an accurate snapshot of a driver's state at the time of the crash. Most states that have set legal limits for driving range from 2 to 5 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) -- a threshold the average level in this study (30.7 ng/mL) far exceeded.

""The messaging over the last few years has been just the push towards recreational legalization,"" Dr. Ekeh noted. ""The problem is that from a public health standpoint, there has not been enough emphasis on some of the downsides and the dangers that can occur. People should treat smoking marijuana just like they treat alcohol: don't smoke and drive.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists find hidden brain damage behind dementia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251005085637.htm","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:24:45 GMT","

Vascular dementia -- cognitive impairment caused by disease in the brain's small blood vessels -- is a widespread problem, but it has not been as thoroughly studied as Alzheimer's disease, in which abnormal plaques and protein tangles are deposited in neural tissue.

One researcher at The University of New Mexico hopes to change that.

In a newly published paper featured by the editors of the American Journal of Pathology, Elaine Bearer, MD, PhD, the Harvey Family Endowed and Distinguished Professor in the UNM School of Medicine's Department of Pathology, sets out a new model for characterizing and categorizing different forms of vascular dementia.

She hopes this approach will help researchers to better understand the various forms of the disease and find effective treatments.

Conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes have been linked to vascular dementia, but other contributing causes, including the recent discovery of significant quantities of nano- and microplastics in human brains, remain poorly understood, Bearer said.

""We have been flying blind,"" she said. ""The various vascular pathologies have not been comprehensively defined, so we haven't known what we're treating. And we didn't know that nano- and microplastics were in the picture, because we couldn't see them.""

Bearer identified 10 different disease processes that contribute to vascular-based brain injury, typically by causing oxygen or nutrient deficiency, leakage of blood serum and inflammation or decreased waste elimination. These cause tiny strokes that harm neurons. She lists new and existing experimental techniques, including special stains and novel microscopy, to detect them.

For the paper, Bearer used a specialized microscope to meticulously study tissue from a repository of brains donated by the families of New Mexicans who had died with dementia, employing stains that highlighted the damaged blood vessels. Surprisingly, many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease also had disease in the small blood vessels of the brain.

""We suspect that in New Mexico maybe a half of our Alzheimer's people also have vascular disease,"" she said.

Bearer contends a methodical approach to identifying different forms of vascular dementia will help neurologists and neuropathologists more accurately score the severity of the disease in both living and deceased patients and advance the search for potential treatments -- and even cures. To make that happen, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has raised the possibility of forming a consensus group of leading neuropathologists to work out a new classification and scoring system, she said.

Meanwhile, a fresh area of concern is the unknown health consequences of nano- and microplastics in the brain, Bearer said.

""Nanoplastics in the brain represent a new player on the field of brain pathology,"" she said. ""All our current thinking about Alzheimer's disease and other dementias needs to be revised in light of this discovery.""

""What I'm finding is that there's a lot more plastics in demented people than in normal subjects,"" she said. ""It seems to correlate with the degree and type of dementia.""

The quantity of plastics also was associated with higher levels of inflammation, she said.

Bearer's work builds on years of collaboration with Gary Rosenberg, MD, professor of Neurology and director of the UNM Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), which won a five-year $21.7 million NIH grant in 2024 that supported Bearer's research. Rosenberg, a longtime chair of the UNM Department of Neurology and also director of the UNM Center for Memory & Aging, has published extensively on the association of vascular disease with dementia symptoms.

""When we started thinking about putting this ADRC together, I thought one of the things I should look at is the vasculature, because nobody's done it systematically and comprehensively, and we have a world's expert here at UNM,"" Bearer said.

""Describing the pathological changes in this comprehensive way is really new. What I'm hoping will come out of this paper is working with other neuropathology ADRC cores across the country to develop consensus guidelines for classifying vascular changes and the impact of nano- and microplastics on the brain.""

Key Results

In the Wang Lab, it's not unusual for worms to live for a long time.

HHMI Janelia Research Campus Senior Group Leader Meng Wang and her team study longevity. They've shown that by overexpressing an enzyme in the lysosomes of the roundworm C. elegans, they can extend the worm's life by up to 60 percent.

But surprisingly, the team found the worms' progeny without this genetic modification were still living longer than normal. When they crossed their long-lived worms with ""wild-type"" worms that weren't overexpressing the enzyme -- a routine lab procedure used to wipe clean any genetic manipulations -- they saw that the offspring also lived longer than normal worms. Somehow, the longevity markers were being transferred from generation to generation, even four generations later.

In new research, Wang and her team uncover how changes in the worm's lysosomes that promote longevity are transferred from cells in its body to its reproductive cells through histones -- proteins that play a key role in organizing and regulating DNA. In reproductive cells, these histone messengers cause modifications in the worm's epigenome -- a collection of chemical tags that regulate gene expression -- enabling the lysosomal changes to be passed from generation to generation without changing the underlying DNA.

The findings have repercussions well beyond longevity. Epigenetic modifications can help organisms cope with many different types of environmental stressors -- from diet changes to pollutant exposure to psychological stress -- and the new work shows how these advantages could be conferred from parents to their offspring.

""You always think that your inheritance is in the nucleus, within the cell, but now we show that the histone can go from one place to another place, and if that histone carries any modification, that means you are going to transfer the epigenetic information from one cell to another,"" Wang says. ""It really provides a mechanism for understanding the transgenerational effect.""

Uncovering inheritance

The researchers found that one type of histone modification -- a type of epigenetic change -- was elevated in long-lived worms compared to those with normal lifespans. They wanted to see how this modification related to lysosomal changes that promote longevity.

Using a combination of genetic tools, transcriptomics, and imaging, they found that changes in lysosomal metabolism affecting the worms' longevity activate a series of processes inside the cell. These actions trigger an increase in a specific histone variant, which is transported from the worm's somatic or body tissues to its germline or reproductive cells through proteins that deliver nutrients to developing eggs. In the germline, the histone is modified, allowing the information from the lysosome to enter the germline and be passed from parent to child.

The researchers show that this pathway is activated during fasting, which causes a change in lysosomal metabolism -- providing a link from the physiological phenomenon to the changes in the germline.

The new work adds to a growing body of evidence that lysosomes, once thought to only act as the cell's recycling centers, also function as a signaling hub to control different processes in the cell and now are shown to affect generations.

The new research also unveils a new mechanism for transporting information from somatic to germline cells through histones, which could help explain how other types of inherited information are passed from parent to offspring.

By providing a mechanism for understanding how environmental changes to somatic cells are passed through the germline, the new work could help researchers better understand transgenerational effects that have been previously observed, like the malnutrition of a parent affecting its offspring.

""We now show that the soma and the germline can be connected by the histone and can carry memorable genetic information for generations,"" Wang says.

This is a sparkling scene of star birth captured by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. What appears to be a craggy, starlit mountaintop kissed by wispy clouds is actually a cosmic dust-scape being eaten away by the blistering winds and radiation of nearby, massive, infant stars.

Called Pismis 24, this young star cluster resides in the core of the nearby Lobster Nebula, approximately 5,500 light-years from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. Home to a vibrant stellar nursery and one of the closest sites of massive star birth, Pismis 24 provides rare insight into large and massive stars. Its proximity makes this region one of the best places to explore the properties of hot young stars and how they evolve.

At the heart of this glittering cluster is the brilliant Pismis 24-1. It is at the center of a clump of stars above the jagged orange peaks, and the tallest spire is pointing directly toward it. Pismis 24-1 appears as a gigantic single star, and it was once thought to be the most massive known star. Scientists have since learned that it is composed of at least two stars, though they cannot be resolved in this image. At 74 and 66 solar masses, respectively, the two known stars are still among the most massive and luminous stars ever seen.

Captured in infrared light by Webb's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera), this image reveals thousands of jewel-like stars of varying sizes and colors. The largest and most brilliant ones with the six-point diffraction spikes are the most massive stars in the cluster. Hundreds to thousands of smaller members of the cluster appear as white, yellow, and red, depending on their stellar type and the amount of dust enshrouding them. Webb also shows us tens of thousands of stars behind the cluster that are part of the Milky Way galaxy.

Super-hot, infant stars -some almost 8 times the temperature of the Sun - blast out scorching radiation and punishing winds that are sculpting a cavity into the wall of the star-forming nebula. That nebula extends far beyond NIRCam's field of view. Only small portions of it are visible at the bottom and top right of the image. Streamers of hot, ionized gas flow off the ridges of the nebula, and wispy veils of gas and dust, illuminated by starlight, float around its towering peaks.

Dramatic spires jut from the glowing wall of gas, resisting the relentless radiation and winds. They are like fingers pointing toward the hot, young stars that have sculpted them. The fierce forces shaping and compressing these spires cause new stars to form within them. The tallest spire spans about 5.4 light-years from its tip to the bottom of the image. More than 200 of our solar systems out to Neptune's orbit could fit into the width its tip, which is 0.14 lightyears.

In this image, the color cyan indicates hot or ionized hydrogen gas being heated up by the massive young stars. Dust molecules similar to smoke here on Earth are represented in orange. Red signifies cooler, denser molecular hydrogen. The darker the red, the denser the gas. Black denotes the densest gas, which is not emitting light. The wispy white features are dust and gas that are scattering starlight.

The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).

This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to three scientists for discovering a class of immune cells that help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. 

Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, Fred Ramsdell, a scientific adviser at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in Bainbridge Island, Washington, and immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, will share the prize of 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million) “for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.

Drug companies flock to supercharged T-cells in fight against autoimmune disease

The trio “have provided fundamental knowledge of how the immune system is regulated”, said Nobel committee member Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference announcing the prize. Their discoveries help to explain “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”. 

The findings led to the development of a range of therapies for autoimmune diseases that are now in early clinical development, says Samantha Bucktrout, an immunologist at Greywolf Therapeutics in Oxford, UK, who has previously worked with Ramsdell. 

“If it wasn't for these initial findings — and all of this whole field that these individuals started — we would never be at this place now where we can talk about cures,” she says. Autoimmune conditions — which include type 1 diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis — affect around one in ten people1.

White blood cells called T cells play a crucial part in the body's immune system by attacking infected or cancerous cells. But in 1995, Sakaguchi and his colleagues discovered a previously unknown subtype of T cells — called regulatory T cells2. These rare cells serve as crucial brake on the immune system — suppressing it and preventing it from over-reacting. Bucktrout likens the cells to an elite police force that represent only 1–2% of all T cells, but are highly effective at “keeping everyone in order”. At the site of immune reaction in the body they arrive and “shut the whole thing down”, she says. “They really mop everything up and dampen inflammation very effectively.”

In experiments using a marker for regulatory T cells, Sakaguchi showed that mice lacking these cells developed autoimmune conditions of the thyroid, pancreas and other organs, and that giving the animals a solution containing regulatory T cells stopped disease progression. Scientists had suspected that the immune system contained its own built-in brake for decades, but had not been able to prove it.

This discovery allowed researchers to isolate and work on regulatory T cells for the first time, and other research teams began to identify different types of regulatory T cell with different kinds of immune-suppressing properties. 

Later, in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered3 a mutation in the gene Foxp3 that caused fatal autoimmune disease in mice. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene caused a rare genetic autoimmune disease4. “It was really a molecular slog to get to that exact mutation, because it was just a very small genetic alteration that results in quite a profound change in the immune system,” said Brunkow in a telephone interview shortly after the prize announcement. “It takes a bunch of different brains all working on it together.” 

In 2003, follow-up studies by Sakaguchi and his colleagues showed that Foxp3 is specifically expressed in regulatory T cells and is required for their development5.

The work “really changed our view of a lot of conditions and is still changing our view”, says Anne Pesenacker, an immunologist at University College London. The discovery of regulatory T cells, and the markers to identify them, “has helped us so much to understand autoimmunity”, she says. “We're starting to look at can we boost this regulation.”

Studies have found that people with some autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, often have too few regulatory T cells in their blood or ones that do not function properly. And even early experiments on mice showed that there was potential to use regulatory T cells in treatments for such conditions, says Pesenacker.

Achieving efficient red and near-infrared (NIR) emission in boron cation-based emitters remains challenging owing to their intrinsic instability, strong electrophilicity of the boron centre and pronounced non-radiative decay governed by the energy gap law. Here we report a family of air- and moisture-stable carbodicarbene (CDC)-borabenzo[c]anthanthrenium ions exhibiting solid-state red-to-NIR luminescence (maximum emission wavelength up to 730 nm) with competitive quantum yields. Crystallographic, photophysical and computational analyses reveal that the CDC ligand plays a dual role by electronically stabilizing the boron centre and directing ion-pair assembly via charge localization, thereby modulating exciton coupling and aggregate-state emission. These cationic π-extended boron frameworks represent rare examples of monoboron-doped luminophores displaying deep-red-to-NIR emission. Our findings highlight that the combination of π-extension, a charge-directing CDC ligand and ion-pair assembly constitutes an effective strategy to access efficient red/NIR emitters, providing guiding principles for the design of functional long-wavelength emitting main-group materials.

The design of folded proteins has advanced substantially in recent years. However, many proteins and protein regions are intrinsically disordered and lack a stable fold, that is, the sequence of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) encodes a vast ensemble of spatial conformations that specify its biological function. This conformational plasticity and heterogeneity makes IDP design challenging. Here we introduce a computational framework for de novo design of IDPs through rational and efficient inversion of molecular simulations that approximate the underlying sequence–ensemble relationship. We highlight the versatility of this approach by designing IDPs with diverse properties and arbitrary sequence constraints. These include IDPs with target ensemble dimensions, loops and linkers, highly sensitive sensors of physicochemical stimuli, and binders to target disordered substrates with distinct conformational biases. Overall, our method provides a general framework for designing sequence–ensemble–function relationships of biological macromolecules.

Artificial intelligence models are starting to succeed in science. In the past two years, they have demonstrated that they can analyse data, design experiments and even come up with new hypotheses. The pace of progress has some researchers convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) could compete with science's greatest minds in the next few decades. 

ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI

ChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI

In 2016, Hiroaki Kitano, a biologist and chief executive at Sony AI, challenged researchers to accomplish just that: to develop an AI system so advanced that it could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel prize. Calling it the Nobel Turing Challenge, Kitano presented the endeavour as the grand challenge for AI in science1. A machine wins if it can achieve a discovery on a par with top-level human research. 

That's not something current models can do. But by 2050, the Nobel Turing Challenge envisions an AI system that, without human intervention, combines the skills of hypothesis generation, experimental planning and data analysis to make a breakthrough worthy of a Nobel prize.

It might not even take until 2050. Ross King, a chemical-engineering researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an organizer of the challenge, thinks such an ‘AI scientist' might rise to laureate status even sooner. “I think it's almost certain that AI systems will get good enough to win Nobel prizes,” he says. “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.”



But many researchers don't see how current AI systems, which are trained to generate strings of words and ideas on the basis of humankind's existing pool of knowledge, could contribute fresh insights. Accomplishing such a feat might demand drastic changes in how researchers develop AI and what AI funding goes towards. “If tomorrow, you saw a government programme invest a billion dollars in fundamental research, I think it would advance much faster,” says Yolanda Gil, an AI researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Others warn that there are looming risks to introducing AI into the research pipeline2.

The Nobel prizes were created to honour those who “have conferred the greatest benefit” to humankind, as its namesake, Alfred Nobel, wrote in his will. For the science prizes, Bengt Nordén, a chemist and former chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, considers three criteria: a Nobel discovery must be useful, be rich with impact and open a door to further scientific understanding, he says.

Although only living people, organizations and institutions are currently eligible for the prizes, AI has had previous encounters with the Nobel committee. In 2024, the Nobel Prize in Physics went to machine-learning pioneers who laid the groundwork for artificial neural networks. That same year, half of the chemistry prize recognized the researchers behind AlphaFold, an AI system from Google DeepMind in London that predicts the 3D structures of proteins from their amino-acid sequence. But these awards were for the scientific strides behind AI systems — not for ones made by AI.

For an AI scientist to claim its own discovery, the research would need to be performed “fully or highly autonomously”, according to the Nobel Turing Challenge. The AI scientist would need to oversee the scientific process from beginning to end, deciding on questions to answer, experiments to run and data to analyse, according to Gil.

Gil says that she has already seen AI tools assisting scientists in almost every step of the discovery process, which “makes the field very exciting”. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can help to decode the speech of animals, hypothesize on the origins of life in the Universe and predict when spiralling stars might collide. It can forecast lethal dust storms and help to optimize the assembly of future quantum computers.

AI is also beginning to perform experiments by itself. Gabe Gomes, a chemist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues designed a system called Coscientist that relies on large language models (LLMs), the kind behind ChatGPT and similar systems, to plan and execute complex chemical reactions using robotic laboratory equipment3. And an unreleased version of Coscientist can do computational chemistry with remarkable speed, says Gomes.

AI is dreaming up millions of new materials. Are they any good?

AI is dreaming up millions of new materials. Are they any good?

One of Gomes's students once complained that the software took half an hour to work out a transition state for a reaction. “The problem took me over a year as a graduate student,” he says.

The Tokyo-based company Sakana AI is using LLMs in an attempt to automate machine-learning research4. At the same time, researchers at Google and elsewhere are exploring how chatbots might work in teams to generate scientific ideas. 

Most scientists who are using AI turn to it as an assistant or collaborator of sorts, often appointed to specific tasks. This is the first of three waves of AI in science, says Sam Rodriques, chief executive of FutureHouse — a research lab in San Francisco, California, that debuted an LLM designed to do chemistry tasks earlier this year. It and other ‘reasoning models' learn to mimic step-wise logical thought, using a trial-and-error process that involves training on correct examples.

The existing models are helpful collaborators that can make predictions on the basis of data, and accelerate otherwise painstaking sorts of computation. But they tend to need a human in the loop during at least one stage.

Next, says Rodriques, AI will get better at developing and evaluating its own hypotheses by searching through literature and analysing data. James Zou, a biomedical data scientist at Stanford University in California, has begun moving into this realm. He and his colleagues recently showed that a system built on LLMs can scour biological data to find insights that researchers miss5. For instance, when given a published paper and a data set of RNA sequences associated with it, the system found that certain immune cells in individuals with COVID-19 are more likely to swell up as they die, an idea that hadn't been explored by the paper's authors. It's showing “that the AI agent is beginning to autonomously find new things”, Zou says.

He's also helping to organize a virtual gathering called Agents4Science later this month, which he describes as the first AI-only scientific conference. All papers will be written and reviewed by AI agents, alongside human collaborators. And the one-day meeting will include invited talks and panel discussions (from humans) on the future of AI-generated research. Zou says he hopes that the meeting will help researchers to assess how capable AI is at doing and reviewing innovative research.

There are known challenges to such efforts, including the hallucinations that often plague LLMs, Zou says. But he says these issues could be mostly remedied with human feedback.

Rodriques says that the final stage of AI in science, and what FutureHouse is aiming for, is models that can ask their own questions and design and perform their own experiments — no human necessary. He sees this as inevitable, and says that AI could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel “by 2030 at the latest”.

The most promising areas for a breakthrough — by an AI scientist or otherwise — are in materials science or in treating diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, he says, because these are areas with big open challenges and an unmet need.

In the 1960s, scientists classed chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans as a distinct family (Pongidae), thinking that these great apes had long diverged from humans. Few scholars expected that, in nature, these apes would display strikingly human-like behaviour. Jane Goodall, who has died aged 91, overturned this view with her groundbreaking observations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).

Jane Goodall's legacy: three ways she changed science

Jane Goodall's legacy: three ways she changed science

Her discoveries foreshadowed the genetic evidence showing that chimpanzees, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and humans are more closely related to one another than to gorillas (Gorilla spp.) and orangutans (Pongo spp.). The findings had a major role in shifting perceptions towards recognizing the importance of emotions, personalities and complex cognition, reshaping scientific and public understanding of human evolution. She was a tireless advocate for conservation, the welfare of captive chimpanzees and the protection of habitats — work now carried forwards through the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, DC.

Her fascination with animals began early. Born in north London in 1934, she famously disappeared during a Second World War air raid when she was around six years old, only to be found sitting quietly in a chicken coop, watching a hen lay an egg. She often told this story to illustrate the patience and curiosity that defined her life's work.

In 1957, after working as a secretary for some years, Goodall accepted a friend's invitation to visit Kenya. In Nairobi, she sought out the renowned palaeontologist Louis Leakey, who invited her to join him and his wife Mary on a fossil-hunting expedition in Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, known as the Cradle of Humankind for its rich deposit of early hominid fossils and stone tools. During the trip, she committed to studying chimpanzees in what is now called Gombe National Park in Tanzania — a small, 35-square-kilometre patch of forest that Leakey had long hoped to investigate.

Biggest ever study of primate genomes has surprises for humanity

Biggest ever study of primate genomes has surprises for humanity

To prepare, she persuaded John Napier, a leading anthropologist, to tutor her privately in primatology. She was dismayed to learn that the main chimpanzee study of the time, conducted in 1929–30, had lasted for only four months and had been done by a large, intrusive expedition operating in classic colonial excess. She was not surprised that it had produced few results.

By contrast, when she arrived in Gombe in July 1960, she spent many months patiently tracking chimpanzees in the hills, sometimes sleeping alone in the park. By her fourth month, she had made her first world-shaking discoveries: chimpanzees not only ate and shared meat but also fashioned tools. The tools were modified grass stems that were then used to extract edible termites from their mounds (J. Goodall Nature 201, 1264–1266; 1964).

Her findings earned her long-term support. In 1961, she began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, under zoologist Robert Hinde, who encouraged her to focus on social relationships, individual personalities and the expression of emotions. She gained intimate access to chimpanzees by providing them with bananas, which allowed her to document their lives in unprecedented detail. She observed their political manoeuvring, deception, coalitional aggression and cooperation outside family groups — behaviours that indicated previously unsuspected levels of social intelligence.

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can automate a growing number of biomedical tasks, ranging from clinical decision support to design and analysis of research studies. GAI uses machine learning and transformer model architectures to generate useful text, images and sound data in response to user queries. While previous biomedical deep-learning applications have used general-purpose datasets and enormous volumes of labeled data for training, evidence now suggests that GAI models may perform better while requiring less training data—for example, using smaller, domain-specific datasets. Moreover, AI techniques have progressed from fully supervised training to less label-intensive approaches, such as weakly supervised or unsupervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Recent iterations of GAI, such as agents, mixture-of-expert models and reasoning models, have further extended their capabilities to assist with complex and multistage tasks. Here, we provide an overview of recent technical advancements in GAI. We explore the potential of the latest generation of models to improve healthcare for clinicians and patients, and discuss validation approaches using specific examples to illustrate challenges and opportunities for further work.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","OpenAI Wants ChatGPT to Be Your Future Operating System","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-dev-day-sam-altman-chatgpt-apps/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 19:34:00 GMT","

On Monday, OpenAI unveiled a new way to embed third-party apps directly into ChatGPT. At the company's annual developer conference in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman said the move would “enable a new generation of apps that are adaptive, interactive, and personalized, that you can chat with.”

Starting today, some developers will be able to use a preview version of a new apps software development kit (SDK) to build apps within ChatGPT using open standards. The ability to distribute these apps is currently limited to a handful of big partners. Altman showed off several examples of how these apps would ultimately work within ChatGPT. The demo featured Spotify, Canva, and Zillow apps appearing inside a chat and responding to typed commands.

In one example, OpenAI software engineer Alexi Christakis launched a chat directed at the Canva app and prompted Canva to draw up posters for a dog-walking business. From there, he asked for a pitch deck in order to raise capital for the business.

Christakis then asked ChatGPT to suggest a city that would be ideal to expand the business into (it offered Pittsburgh, for those wondering). Next he called up a Zillow ChatGPT app and asked it to show homes for sale in the city. This brought up an interactive map showing houses for sale. Christakis asked ChatGPT to refine the results to just three-bedroom houses with a yard.

Altman said that OpenAI plans to introduce new ways for developers to monetize their ChatGPT apps, including methods for buying things through the chatbot. “Soon we'll offer an agentic commerce protocol, with instant checkout from right within ChatGPT,” Altman said.

This is not OpenAI's first effort to introduce ChatGPT apps. The company announced a way to build custom widgets or GPTs at its developer conference two years ago. When the GPT Store officially launched in January 2024, OpenAI said that developers had created over 3 million custom GPTs. Ultimately, however, the widgets did not prove a big hit.

OpenAI didn't share details around any revenue-share agreements with Canva, Zillow, Spotify, and the other apps it highlighted today.

The new SDK announcement signals a deeper commitment to working with established enterprises and app makers—and an emphasis on keeping users within ChatGPT itself. If the web and mobile eras of the past 30 years were defined by users browsing the web or being locked into a mobile app experience, OpenAI is now combining the two into its own kind of chat-driven operating system.

Nick Turley, OpenAI's head of product for ChatGPT, said in a briefing after the keynote that the company “never meant to build a chatbot; we meant to build a super assistant, and we got a little sidetracked.” He indicated that OpenAI is most excited about what it has achieved in natural language processing, but that the $500 billion startup will continue to experiment with different user interfaces around that.

“Will people spend all of their time in ChatGPT? I don't think so,” Turley said. “I can imagine you starting your day with ChatGPT,” then being guided toward other apps and websites.

Beyond reimagining existing apps, OpenAI hopes to put itself at the center of efforts to build agents that use AI to complete tasks on a user's behalf. The company unveiled several tools for building agents including AgentKit, a drag-and-drop interface for building advanced AI tools.

Capturing developer mind-share is also, of course, about coding tools. At Monday's event, OpenAI announced that Codex, a model optimized to write code, would come out of research preview and become generally available. The company also announced new Codex tools, including a way to ask questions about code and edit it via Slack messages, an SDK for the Codex model, and new analytics tools to allow companies to monitor their employees' Codex usage.

OpenAI is competing with Google, Anthropic, and Amazon in trying to lure developers to its services. The company is also under pressure as rivals like Meta and DeepSeek launch capable open source models, which allow developers to fine-tune premier models for their needs, without having to pay for access to OpenAI's APIs.

This August OpenAI released its first open source model in several years, GPT-OSS, and also made a long-awaited new flagship model, GPT-5, available through its regular API. OpenAI also upgraded its coding model for developers in September, a move seemingly designed to respond to very capable coding models from both Anthropic and Google. OpenAI debuted tools for building agents in March.

At last year's developer day, OpenAI announced an API for low-latency voice interactions, ways of fine-tuning vision models, and a tool for fine-tuning small models using OpenAI's more powerful ones.

OpenAI is also building a vast empire of data centers at a time when questions have begun to swirl about the economic viability of generative AI. This morning, the company announced a major deal to acquire 6-gigawatts' worth of AMD chips in a move that may also see the company take a 10-percent stake in the chipmaker.

During today's keynote, Altman suggested that OpenAI was already helping software developers reach new levels of productivity—a fact that might help ramp up demand for all that compute.

“This is the best time in history to be a builder,” Altman said. “It has never been faster to go from idea to product. You can really feel the acceleration at this point.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","OpenAI's Blockbuster AMD Deal Is a Bet on Near-Limitless Demand for AI","https://www.wired.com/story/openai-amd-deal-data-center-chips/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:31:00 GMT","

OpenAI announced on Monday that it will acquire several data centers' worth of chips from AMD in a blockbuster deal that could also give OpenAI the option to acquire a roughly 10 percent stake in the chipmaker.

It's another bold bet from OpenAI that demand for generative artificial intelligence will continue rising—bubble be damned.

“Excited to partner with AMD to use their chips to serve our users!” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on X, adding that the company will also ramp up its investments in Nvidia chips. He added: “The world needs much more compute …”

OpenAI said in a blog post this morning that it would commit to purchasing 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD chips over the next several years. The first deployment of a gigawatt worth of AMD Instinct MI450 GPUs will take place in the second half of 2026, the company said.

The deal also involves AMD issuing OpenAI the right to purchase up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock (roughly a 10 percent stake). OpenAI will be able to acquire the stock as it deploys AMD's chips.

""Our view is that we're nowhere near the top of the demand curve as every major enterprise, cloud provider, and sovereign initiative is scaling AI infrastructure in parallel,"" says Forrest Norrod, an executive vice president at AMD. He added: ""we see this as the foundation of a long-term growth cycle for AI infrastructure, not a short-term surge.”

Today's announcement should also help AMD challenge Nvidia in supplying chips for AI training and inference.

“This is a breakthrough achievement for AMD,” Patrick Moorhead, a prominent chip industry analyst, wrote on X in response to today's news. “It will be a strategic supplier for the leading AI company and this will attract even more tier 1 customers.""

This deal is just the latest in a string of data center investments involving OpenAI and other tech firms. Shortly after his inauguration in January, US president Donald Trump announced that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle would invest $100 billion in building AI data centers on US soil and would pour up to $500 billion into AI infrastructure over time.

The data center gold rush hinges in part on the idea that models will improve in line with the laws of scaling—so long as they're trained on more data and compute. “There's this basic story that scale is the thing, and that's been true for a while, and it might still be true,” Jonathan Koomey, a visiting professor at UC Berkeley who studies computing and data center efficiency, told WIRED in September, talking about an OpenAI-Oracle deal to create three new data center sites. “That's the bet that many of the US AI companies are making.”

Derek Thompson, a prominent economics reporter, noted in a recent post that the tech industry is projected to spend around $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year—while demand for AI services from US consumers stands at just about $12 billion a year, according to one study.

OpenAI had a strategic relationship with AMD prior to today's announcement. At AMD's Advancing AI event in Silicon Valley in June, Altman briefly joined AMD CEO Lisa Su on stage. Su said that AMD has been getting feedback from customers for a few years as the company has been designing the upcoming MI400 series of chips, and that OpenAI is one of those marquee customers.

Altman noted on stage that the industry's move toward reasoning models has been putting pressure on AI model makers in terms of efficiency and long-context rollouts and that OpenAI needs “tons of compute, tons of memory, and tons of CPUs,” in addition to the Nvidia GPUs that the generative AI industry is so reliant on.

Su, at that event, described Altman as a “great friend” and an “icon in AI.”

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's Director of Business and Industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week. Including our scoop of how OpenAI just launched a social app dedicated completely to AI-generated videos. I'm joined today by our Senior Culture Editor, Manisha Krishnan. Manisha, welcome to Uncanny Valley.

Manisha Krishnan: Hi Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: Our first story is about the thing that I feel like our whole newsroom is talking about, possibly the whole country is talking about. It's the government shutdown. As of Wednesday this week, the US government has officially shut down, at least for now, and many federal workers are being furloughed until the government reopens. Our colleague, Vittoria Elliott learned this week that employees at the Small Business Administration or SBA received a template from HR with language for their out-of-office email, and they were advised to blame Democrats.

Manisha Krishnan: Of course they were. How explicit was this template?

Zoë Schiffer: Well, let me just read a little bit of it to you. So it says, ""I am out of office for the foreseeable future because Senate Democrats voted to block a clean federal spending bill, leading to our government shutdown that is preventing the US Small Business Administration from serving America's 36 million small businesses."" So pretty explicit, I guess is what I would say.

Manisha Krishnan: Yeah, if I got that as an out-of-office, I'd be like, I'm not reading all that. That's very wordy.

Zoë Schiffer: It's petty, it's kind of funny, but it's also dark. It just feels like yet another example of how explicit the government is. There's no semblance of even trying to unite the country or the two parties anymore.

Manisha Krishnan: I know federal workers are supposed to be boring. We're not supposed to be hearing these takes from them. And one thing that Tori pointed out in the story was that this actually could violate the Hatch Act. And that is a law that sets limits on the kinds of political activities that government employees can engage in. And so by forcing them to do this out-of-office, it could actually be forcing them to break the law.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, and I just think for a few years now, we've heard a lot about the ""deep state"" like this idea that these federal employees are really political and they're trying to push their political agenda. Obviously when you actually report on this stuff, you talk to people, they're like, ""We've worked here throughout many different administrations. Our job is not to weigh in on political issues. Our job is to do this stack of boring paperwork or whatever."" And that seems like it's starting to change. They're being asked to almost take aside. So employees at other agencies have received more standard out-of-office directives. But also a lot of these agencies are still using this kind of spicy political language themselves. There's pop-up banners on their websites blaming the Democrats. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has one that says, ""The radical left in Congress shut down the government. The agency will be using available resources to help Americans in need."" And the DOJ website has a pretty similar banner.

Manisha Krishnan: Yeah, to see that from the Department of Justice, I think it just kind of shows you where we are right now. Because these messages, they're insane, but they're becoming so normalized. And I feel bad for the federal workers. I mean, you would know better than me because you guys did that brilliant feature speaking to federal workers who are impacted by DOJ. They're losing their jobs, they're being forced to put out these super politicized messages. It's just so ... I mean, uncomfortable doesn't even begin to kind of describe it.

Zoë Schiffer: I think one thing that they talk about a lot is just how quickly the norms of government have changed. There was a standard way of operating previously. It didn't always happen. Like there were people here and there who flouted the norms. But for the most part, it was like if you were a federal worker, you weren't supposed to be super outspoken. You weren't supposed to be wildly political in public, necessarily, as part of your job. And those things have changed really fast. And I think even the people who've kept their jobs feel like something real has been lost in the process.

Manisha Krishnan: I'm not normally one to cape for decorum in etiquette. But I mean in this situation, I really wish that some sense of normalcy would return.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. Our next story is kind of a doozy, and I am specifically very curious to get your take on this. WIRED contributor, Laura Bullard wrote a deep dive on Peter Thiel's obsession with the Antichrist. So for a few years now, Thiel has been going around giving lectures about his doomsday theory of how we're all way too concerned with technology. And as a result, we've failed to pay attention to the far greater threat, which is the coming of the Antichrist. This figure will allegedly unify humanity under one rule before delivering us to the apocalypse. So I am very curious to hear what you think.

Manisha Krishnan: I mean, I certainly think it's convenient that he's trying to be like, oh yeah, don't worry about technology. The apocalypse is coming, that's what you should be worried about. It reminds me of that. I think you should leave meme where he's like in the hot dog and trying to pretend he didn't cause the car crash. I mean, I guess each of us are free to have our own apocalypse theories. I kind of feel like we might be in it right now. But the difference is that Thiel is one of the most powerful men in the world as the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and an active Republican Party supporter.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah. Just to give you a little bit more backstory, so Laura traced Thiel's belief to his relationship with an Austrian theologist, who in turn was influenced by the writings legal theorist Carl Schmitt. Who himself was tapped by the Nazis back in the forties to justify Germany's slip from democracy to dictatorship. Schmitt believed as Thiel seems to, that the Antichrist's evil is an attempt to unify the world. And this, although it sounds positive, is actually quite negative in their view. This unity would lead us to be brainwashed and eventually it would be our downfall. Now, the irony of the co-founder of a data and surveillance technology company having these societal control fears has not gone unnoticed. Thiel recently had a conversation with the New York Times journalist, Ross Douthat, and there was a very awkward moment where this was brought up.

Ross Douthat [Archival audio]: My very specific question for you is that you're an investor in AI, you're deeply invested in Palantir, in military technology, in technologies of surveillance, in technologies of warfare and so on. And it just seems to me that when you tell me a story about the Antichrist coming to power and using the fear of technological change to sort of impose order on the world, I feel like that Antichrist would maybe be using the tools that you were building, right? Wouldn't the Antichrist be like, ""Great, we're not going to have any more technological progress. But I really like what Palantir has done so far."" Right? I mean, isn't that a concern? Wouldn't that be the irony of history would be that the man publicly worrying about the Antichrist accidentally hastens his or her arrival?

Peter Thiel [Archival audio]: Look, there are all these different scenario ... I obviously don't think that that's what I'm doing.

Ross Douthat [Archival audio]: I mean, to be clear, I don't think that's what you're doing either.

Manisha Krishnan: Oh.

Zoë Schiffer: Oh.

Manisha Krishnan: I wish that Ross didn't chime in at the end there where he was like, ""I don't think that's what you're doing."" Just let him be awkward because he was stumbling. He obviously felt very uncomfortable with that. But you have to wonder who is he worried that is going to be uniting this extremely rich, powerful figure? Is he just worried that normal people might try to take back some power? And I think that this does raise a really interesting point about our level of media literacy right now, and all the slop that we're being fed, and how ... I mean, I've seen it in my own family. My dad, just to be honest with you, like the things that he believes that are real now. And so, yeah, I think there is absolutely a danger to all of the slop that we're putting out there, combined with a lack of education.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. Yeah, no, I completely agree. I mean, I had two thoughts. I listened to this podcast when it came out because I have a brain disease that makes me really like this type of content. And one of my takeaways was just having reported on Elon Musk for years and years and years, I was really struck by how ... when you listen to Elon, you can tell that even if you disagree with every single thing that comes out of that man's mouth, he does seem to believe what he is saying, no matter how nuts it sounds. I did not have that feeling with Peter Thiel. I was like, ""I can't tell if this is a genuine belief."" I also just on a literal note was like, ""Is this whole thing a metaphor or were you like a literal person is going to come?"" I just was so confused. And Ross was taking it very literally, very seriously.

Manisha Krishnan: I know I haven't heard that much Antichrist talk since Catholic school. And even then I was mostly disassociating. Something else that Laura's reporting brought up was this idea of the counter figure of the Antichrist, the catacomb. And it's supposedly a figure that can withhold the Antichrist and the end times. And when Thiel was asked if Trump was the catacomb, he refused to answer. Who would be your personal catacomb, Zoë?

Zoë Schiffer: I really struggled with this because I don't know, that's a lot to put on one person right now. It's hard to think about someone who could unite the country, much less the world at this point. I did think of two different things. One was when the astronomer CEO was caught on a kiss cam at a Coldplay concert, snuggling with his Head of HR. I felt like that moment really did bring the country together. Everyone was kind of united and laughing and interested, and there wasn't a lot of different takes. It was just kind of like everyone was on the internet watching this thing play out. The other thing, I don't actually watch South Park, but I was just listening to a podcast with Wesley Morris last night about it. And it does sound like the South Park audience seems to kind of cross political lines, although the show itself is extremely political.

Manisha Krishnan: Yeah, this season has ... I mean, this is the first time I've watched in 15 years. But this season has been pretty spot on. It's almost like they're reading WIRED and satirizing everything. I feel like if Trump and Eric Adams started a talk show, maybe that could be the catacomb.

Zoë Schiffer: I like that.

Manisha Krishnan: Because everyone would find it funny across political lines.

Zoë Schiffer: So maybe South Park will save us after all. Switching gears literally for our next story. Our colleague Aarian Marshall reported that Tesla has been encouraging drowsy drivers to use the full self-driving or FSD mode on their cars. Contrary to its name, this feature does not actually allow cars to drive themselves, it just assists drivers in doing a variety of basic tasks. The manual for the car says that the driver needs to be ready to take over at all times. But drivers are reporting that in-car messages are appearing to tell them to do just the opposite. The messages say things like ""Drowsiness detected, stay focused with FSD."" Or, ""Lane drift detected, let FSD assist you so that you can stay focused.""

Manisha Krishnan: Yeah, that sounds dangerous. It sounds like they're kind of like, ""Hey, you want to take a nap right now? Let FSD kick in."" No, they should be blasting music, blasting the AC, make it like a spin class in there to wake you up. Tesla has made changes to its technology to make it more difficult for inattentive drivers to use FSD. Back in 2021, the company started using in-car driving monitor cameras to determine where their drivers were sufficiently paying attention while using FSD.

Zoë Schiffer: It seems at odds with their past efforts to build more safety around their self-driving features. This is like a pretty delicate time for Tesla. For years, the company has been accused of making products that can be allegedly defective in certain ways. This past August, a Florida jury found that the company was partly liable for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman. The crash occurred when a Tesla model S driver was using an older version of the company's driver assistant software called Autopilot. At the same time, Elon Musk and the company's board of directors have put FSD at the center of the automakers strategy. So Musk has promised that the feature will transform into a truly autonomous driving system by the end of the year, although that's looking unlikely. And Elon Musk is generally known for promising pretty aggressive timelines that then he blows pass again and again. One more before we go to break. WIRED Science reporter, Emily Mullin reported this week that scientists made human eggs from skin cells, and use them to form embryos. This is a huge deal because it could mean a new way to treat infertility for people who want kids. But to be clear, none of the embryos were actually used to try and establish pregnancy. And it's unlikely that they would've developed much further than the womb. But it's still a really big deal because it could one day be used as an alternative to IVF.

Manisha Krishnan: I mean, that's pretty incredible, but how would it work exactly?

Zoë Schiffer: Well, one of the reasons IVF can fail is because of poor egg quality. I feel like you and I probably both know people who've been in this scenario, who've tried to go through egg retrieval and just couldn't get viable eggs. Because the quality of eggs declines with age, and it's obviously a major factor in infertility. But if IVF patients could have a ready supply of eggs generated in a lab from a sample of their skin, it could vastly improve the success of IVF, and allow more people to have babies. But this potential new method also raises significant ethical questions about how the technology should be used. In a 2017 editorial on the Journal Science Transnational Medicine bioethicists warned that it might raise embryo farming to a scale that is currently unimaginable.

Manisha Krishnan: I mean, I think on one hand, you're absolutely right, I do have friends who've struggled with infertility, and so it is really fascinating to see what new options could on the table. But you also do have to wonder, we're in this time right now where especially among the ultra wealthy, there seems to be a lot going on in terms of fertility and trying to have the best genes in your children. And I just kind of wonder how this could play into that, how this could be potentially used unethically and who might be hurt by that or even exploited by that.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, I think it's a really good question. I mean, this is a big thing like you mentioned, the Silicon Valley Elite, in addition to being kind of obsessed with longevity, are pretty into some of these new methods for selecting embryos or testing them in different ways. I think Sam Altman has actually invested in a startup that is doing something similar. In certain ways, I think all of the embryo selection stuff, there's a certain degree that I totally get about it. And then when you take it too far, I personally feel like it's just a misunderstanding of what creates a good life. There's no guarantee that if you select the embryo that is the chart topper on all of these specific tests, that it'll necessarily be happier or better off than one that ranks a little lower.

Manisha Krishnan: Wow. That was very deep and philosophical, and I agree with you, though.

Zoë Schiffer: Coming up after the break, OpenAI just launched a social app for AI-generated videos. We'll talk more about that scoop in a minute. Stay with us. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer. I'm joined today by Senior Culture Editor, Manisha Krishnan. Let's dive into our main story. So earlier this week, my colleague Louise Matsakis and I learned that OpenAI was preparing to launch a social app for AI-generated videos. This app has now come out a day after we broke the story, it actually launched. It's a standalone app that uses the video generation model Sora 2. I've been using the app a little bit since it came out, and it has some pretty familiar features, like a vertical video feed with swipe to scroll navigation, and a tab that has a for you recommendation page. So it's basically TikTok, except everything you're looking at is generated by AI.

Manisha Krishnan: Okay. First of all, congrats on this scoop. This story is so crazy. I just kind of want to know how you felt using it. Because I saw some of the videos that you were posting in Slack, and honestly I was like, is that Zoë?

Zoë Schiffer: So a couple things. Basically, you open the app and it really encourages you to create content because it doesn't want people just mindlessly scrolling. So if you press this plus button, it asks you to verify your identity. And you do that by filming a video of yourself, essentially, reading out these numbers on the screen. Which allows the app to generate your likeness, like a digital avatar of your face and body, and also your voice. And then it's pretty easy. You just put in a prompt, it kind of has the ChatGPT issue where you're creating a good prompt is just actually harder than you would think.

Manisha Krishnan: Okay. So obviously there's a novelty to being able to sort of create your own likeness and make it do weird things. But do you think it could sustain your interest in the same way that TikTok does? Because I don't know. One of the things with social media, which our culture writer Jason Parham was talking about, we kind of built our followings by leaning into being authentic and having a personality. And this just seems like such a radical departure from that because you're not even using your own content.

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, it's weird. I mean, it unlocked something because Meta tried to roll out AI generated video app recently, and it's a complete ghost town. It was a total flop. I actually think that there's reporting that the company might have rushed up the release because they heard that OpenAI was working on the Sora 2 app. But regardless, people weren't really using it. I think one thing that OpenAI did really well is that it put you and your friends at kind of the center. And there is a real novelty to watching you and your friends in AI generated invented scenarios. And you can make it look realistic, you can make you and all your friends like mermaids swimming in the sea. And there's something funny and interesting about it. That said, when you look at the actual feed right now, at least my feed is mostly OpenAI employees. And the main character of the app completely is OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. He's in like every other video.

Manisha Krishnan: Yeah, I don't think anyone really wants a CEO to be a main character. Are there guardrails in place for ... I mean, obviously I'm thinking of deep fake porn and just things like that. What's the deal with that?

Zoë Schiffer: Yeah, so it does have guardrails in place for that. You can't generate a nude image or video of someone. I think if you even try and prompt explicitly romantic scenarios, it could block that. You also can't add someone else to a video. I couldn't create a video with Sam Altman unless he had set his settings to say, anyone can generate my likeness. My personal settings are set so that only I can generate my likeness because I just feel like that's a really scary genie to let out of a bottle. But you do get a bit of control. Interestingly, copyright seems like it's a bit of an open question for the app. Reese tried to generate a video of Taylor Swift or Darth Vader, and the app blocks you saying that it violates the platform's rules. But then people were able to generate videos with Pikachu in them or other kind of famous copyrighted characters.

Manisha Krishnan: I wonder if they base it on who they think is going to be most litigious.

Zoë Schiffer: I don't know. I'm so curious how they came up with these rules. But I think we'll keep reporting on it because it does seem like the copyright concerns are obviously going to be front and center. And also people are just going to be trying to like ... for example, I saw some people trying to create videos with different people promoting crypto coins and stuff. That seems like it's currently ... you're able to at least get around certain filters. So I feel like OpenAI is going to be playing Whack-a-Mole a little bit for the next few weeks as it sees different ways that people are trying to get around the current rules and generate videos that could be problematic.

Manisha Krishnan: I'm curious how it's going to end up competing with TikTok and also will it change behavior? TikTok has literally changed how people act in public. And so I'm kind of curious your take on what do you think they're trying to do with this, essentially?

Zoë Schiffer: That's a really good question. I mean, I feel like a bunch of AI firms are looking at AI entertainment as kind of a future of social media. Interestingly, TikTok has really leaned away from AI generated content. It doesn't seem like it's something the platform is trying to invest in significantly at all. And so I think, again, OpenAI took a step forward by saying, oh, yeah, allowing people to put themselves and their friends in these scenarios, in these videos, could be somewhat of an unlock. But it's very much TBD whether this will actually take off.

Manisha Krishnan: Well, I will be following your recording. And I want to try it myself, I'm not going to lie. I do.

Zoë Schiffer: No, you should. You should. I know. Okay, Manisha, thank you so much for coming on today.

Manisha Krishnan: Thanks for having me.

Zoë Schiffer: That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes. Make sure to check out Thursday's episode of Uncanny Valley, which is about how delivery apps like DoorDash are betting on robots being the future of delivery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Vibe Coding Is the New Open Source—in the Worst Way Possible","https://www.wired.com/story/vibe-coding-is-the-new-open-source/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Just like you probably don't grow and grind wheat to make flour for your bread, most software developers don't write every line of code in a new project from scratch. Doing so would be extremely slow and could create more security issues than it solves. So developers draw on existing libraries—often open source projects—to get various basic software components in place.

While this approach is efficient, it can create exposure and lack of visibility into software. Increasingly, however, the rise of vibe coding is being used in a similar way, allowing developers to quickly spin up code that they can simply adapt rather than writing from scratch. Security researchers warn, though, that this new genre of plug-and-play code is making software-supply-chain security even more complicated—and dangerous.

“We're hitting the point right now where AI is about to lose its grace period on security,” says Alex Zenla, chief technology officer of the cloud security firm Edera. “And AI is its own worst enemy in terms of generating code that's insecure. If AI is being trained in part on old, vulnerable, or low-quality software that's available out there, then all the vulnerabilities that have existed can reoccur and be introduced again, not to mention new issues.”

In addition to sucking up potentially insecure training data, the reality of vibe coding is that it produces a rough draft of code that may not fully take into account all of the specific context and considerations around a given product or service. In other words, even if a company trains a local model on a project's source code and a natural language description of goals, the production process is still relying on human reviewers' ability to spot any and every possible flaw or incongruity in code originally generated by AI.

“Engineering groups need to think about the development lifecycle in the era of vibe coding,” says Eran Kinsbruner, a researcher at the application security firm Checkmarx. “If you ask the exact same LLM model to write for your specific source code, every single time it will have a slightly different output. One developer within the team will generate one output and the other developer is going to get a different output. So that introduces an additional complication beyond open source.”

In a Checkmarx survey of chief information security officers, application security managers, and heads of development, a third of respondents said that more than 60 percent of their organization's code was generated by AI in 2024. But only 18 percent of respondents said that their organization has a list of approved tools for vibe coding. Checkmarx polled thousands of professionals and published the findings in August—emphasizing, too, that AI development is making it harder to trace “ownership” of code.

Open source projects can be inherently insecure, outdated, or at risk of malicious takeover. And they can be incorporated into codebases without adequate transparency or documentation. But researchers point out that some of fundamental backstops and accountability mechanisms that have always existed in open source are missing or severely fragmented by AI-driven development.

“AI code is not very transparent,” says Dan Fernandez, Edera's head of AI products. “In repositories like Github you can at least see things like pull requests and commit messages to understand who did what to the code, and there's a way to trace back who contributed. But with AI code, there isn't that same accountability of what went into it and whether it's been audited by a human. And lines of code coming from a human could be part of the problem as well.”

Edera's Zenla also points out that while vibe coding may seem like a low-cost way to create bare-bones applications and tools that might not otherwise exist for low-resource groups like small businesses or vulnerable populations, the ease of use comes with the danger of creating security exposure in these most at-risk and sensitive situations.

“There's a whole lot of talk about using AI to help vulnerable populations, because it uses less effort to get to something usable,” Zenla says. “And I think these tools can help people in need, but I also think that the security implications of vibe coding will disproportionately impact people who can least afford it.”

Even in enterprise, where financial risk largely falls to the company, the personal fallout of a widespread vulnerability introduced as a result of vibe coding should weigh heavily.

“The fact is that AI-generated material is already starting to exist in code bases,” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and current vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “We can learn from advances in open source software-supply-chain security—or we just won't, and it will suck.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Autism Is Not a Single Condition and Has No Single Cause, Scientists Conclude","https://www.wired.com/story/autism-is-not-a-single-condition-and-has-no-single-cause-scientists-conclude/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

New research from the University of Cambridge suggests that autism should not be understood as a homogeneous condition with a single cause. Scientists found that people diagnosed in early childhood often have a different genetic profile than those diagnosed later in life, broadening the understanding of how the condition develops.

The study analyzed the behavior of autistic people during childhood and adolescence in the United Kingdom and Australia. It also evaluated genetic data of more than 45,000 patients with the condition from diverse cohorts in Europe and the United States.

By linking genetic information to age at diagnosis, the researchers observed that the profiles of those identified early with the condition differed from those who received confirmation at later stages. They found only a slight overlap between the two groups, indicating that the biological mechanisms associated with autism in childhood may be different from those linked to autism identified in adolescence or adulthood.

The analysis, published last week in the journal Nature, showed that children diagnosed before the age of 6 were more likely to have behavioral difficulties—such as problems with social interaction—from an early age. In contrast, those diagnosed after the age of 10 were more likely to experience social and behavioral difficulties during adolescence. They also had a greater predisposition to mental health conditions, such as depression.

The study adds that the average genetic profile of those diagnosed later was closer to that of ADHD and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder than to that of “classic” autism identified in early childhood.

The study concludes that the timing of diagnosis is not entirely random but reflects underlying genetic differences that, in some cases, coincide with risk for other conditions.

“For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles,” said Varun Warrier, a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge and lead author of the paper, in a press statement. “The term ‘autism' likely describes multiple conditions.”

The researchers stress that their intention is not to create new subtypes of autism, but to understand the different developmental processes of the condition in order to improve therapies. “Some of the genetic influences predispose people to show autism traits from a very young age that may be more easily identified, leading to an earlier diagnosis,” Warrier says. “For others, genetic influences may alter which autism features emerge and when. Some of these children may have features that are not picked up by parents or caregivers until they cause significant distress in late childhood or adolescence.”

While acknowledging their work's limitations, such as the sample size and reliance on caregiver reports rather than clinical assessments, the authors contend that the study expands understanding of how autism characteristics emerge at different stages and their relationship to genetic profiles. This information could improve diagnostic mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

“An important next step will be to understand the complex interaction between genetics and social factors that lead to poorer mental health outcomes among later-diagnosed autistic individuals,” says Warrier.

Uta Frith, an emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, who was not involved in the study, said that the great contribution of the research is to demonstrate that autism is not a single condition. “It is time to realize that ‘autism' has become a ragbag of different conditions,” she said in a statement to the Science Media Centre. “If there is talk about an ‘autism epidemic,' a ‘cause of autism,' or a ‘treatment for autism,' the immediate question must be, which kind of autism?”

As part of Best Buy's “Techtober” sales event, I stumbled upon the best laptop deal I've seen in a while. It's for $450 off the Acer Swift 16 AI (8/10, WIRED Recommends), costing $800. Now, I'm not saying $800 qualifies this as a “budget” laptop, but you have to check out the specs on this thing to see why I'm raving about the discount.

The laptop not only comes with 16 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage, but also a 16-inch OLED screen with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution. That OLED screen even has a 120-Hz refresh rate. You won't find a 16-inch laptop with a display this gorgeous at this price anywhere else. Importantly, it also comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V CPU, an efficient processor known for getting great battery life and decent performance. Our own testing resulted in 13 hours of YouTube video playback, which isn't quite as long as other laptops with this chip. But as our reviewer put it, it's likely good enough for most users.

Look, the Acer Swift 16 AI wouldn't be my first choice based on looks alone. It's a bit chunkier than I'd prefer at 0.79 inches thick. There are certainly more attractive and portable 16-inch laptops out there, such as the LG Gram Pro 16 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed). Another really solid option I'm seeing is the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $900. It has a slightly smaller 15.3-inch screen, but it's a match with the Acer Swift 16 for specs, including the CPU and OLED display. The advantage is a prettier design and a much thinner chassis, at only 0.55 inches.

Best Buy's Techtober runs through October 12, which just so happens to align with Amazon's October Prime Day sales event, also known as Big Deal Days. That being said, there will be a lot of great laptops on sale during Prime Day, so make sure to check back for the list I curated of all the best laptop deals happening this week.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","The Android PC: Google's Second Shot at the Unified Computing Dream","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-android-pc-googles-second-shot-at-the-unified-computing-dream-179947.html","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 23:59:59 GMT","

The holy grail of personal computing has always been a single, seamless experience that follows you from your pocket to your desk. For decades, this dream has been a graveyard of ambitious failures.

Now, in the fall of 2025, the whispers are growing louder: In partnership with Qualcomm, Google is making a serious play to bring Android-based PCs to the mainstream. Google's effort isn't just another Chromebook; it's a full-fledged effort to scale the world's dominant mobile operating system into the laptop form factor.

Google's Android PC initiative represents a direct assault on the traditional Windows PC market and a strategic challenge to Apple's carefully segregated ecosystem. However, to succeed where others have so spectacularly failed, Google must learn from the ghost of its most notable predecessor: Microsoft's Windows 8. Google's strategy is different — scaling up from the phone rather than down from the desktop — but the potential pitfalls, especially in marketing, look eerily familiar.

Let's talk about the Android PC this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: a new OLED tablet from Wacom that could bring back some excitement into the market.

To understand why Google's new venture has a fighting chance, one must first diagnose the fatal flaws of Microsoft's attempt at a unified OS with Windows 8 and the Windows Phone.

Microsoft's strategy was to take the dominant desktop OS, Windows, and shrink it to fit on a phone, while simultaneously forcing its touch-centric “Metro” interface onto a billion mouse-and-keyboard users. It was a bold, top-down strategy that backfired for two critical reasons.

First and foremost was the catastrophic “app gap.” An operating system is only as good as its software library. Developers for mobile were overwhelmingly focused on iOS and Android, and they had little incentive to rebuild their apps for the sliver of the market using Windows Phone.

The platform became a wasteland of missing apps — no Snapchat, no native Gmail, and a constant stream of major services pulling their support. Without the apps people used every day, the hardware was irrelevant.

Second was the jarring user experience. The Metro UI, with its live tiles, was actually quite innovative for a phone. However, on a 27-inch desktop monitor operated with a mouse, it was an inefficient and confusing mess that alienated a generation of Windows power users.

Microsoft attempted to build a single OS that was a master of two worlds, but ended up being a jack of all trades and a master of none. The failure of the Windows Phone was a brutal lesson that you cannot force a desktop-first paradigm into a mobile-first world.

Google's approach is the inverse of Microsoft's, and that is its greatest strength. Instead of shrinking a desktop OS down, it is scaling a mature, app-rich mobile OS up.

Google's smartphone-first strategy holds a fundamental advantage: It already has absolute victory in the app war. The Google Play Store contains virtually every application and service a consumer could want. The challenge is not attracting developers from scratch but instead encouraging them to optimize their existing Android apps for a larger, landscape-oriented screen with keyboard and mouse input — a far simpler task.

Furthermore, the user base is already trained. Billions of people are intimately familiar with Android's navigation, notification system, and settings menus. There is no steep learning curve. An Android PC would feel like a natural, more powerful extension of the device they already use for hours every day. That familiarity with Android creates a powerful, low-friction pathway for adoption that Microsoft never had.

For all its engineering prowess, Google's history is littered with the corpses of brilliantly engineered products that were crippled by inept marketing and a confusing brand message: Google+, Stadia, Allo, and the convoluted early branding of its Pixel phones. The list is long. Google's marketing problem is a persistent blind spot. It often fails to tell a simple, compelling story about why a consumer should choose its product.

The marketing challenge is where the parallel to Microsoft's failure becomes alarming. Microsoft never articulated a clear, compelling reason for consumers to abandon their iPhones or Android devices for a Windows Phone. Google now faces the same challenge. Why should a consumer buy an Android PC for $700 when they can get a perfectly good Windows PC for the same price or a simpler Chromebook for half of that?

Without a massive, clear, and sustained marketing campaign that highlights a unique value proposition — perhaps seamless app continuity with your phone, unlike anything else — these devices could easily get lost in a crowded market, repeating the mishaps of the past.

If Google can overcome its marketing hurdles, an Android PC could accelerate the inevitable blurring of lines between smartphones and personal computers. The true endgame may not be an “Android PC” at all, but the death of the PC as a separate device. We are nearing the point where the smartphone is the only computer you need — a “primary brain” that docks into various “shells” to suit the context.

Imagine your phone holding all your apps, data, and processing power. At your desk, you place it into a dock connected to a monitor and keyboard, and the UI instantly expands into a full desktop experience. In a hotel, you connect it to a lightweight laptop shell for productivity on the go.

Samsung has been experimenting with this concept for years with its DeX platform, but with Google's full OS-level backing, it could become the standard. A dockable, smartphone-centered form factor would make the separate, dedicated PC obsolete for a vast majority of users, transforming it from a core device into a mere peripheral for the phone.

The rise of Android PCs as a smartphone-first computing platform exposes a strategic vulnerability for Apple, which maintains three largely separate operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, and macOS — on hardware that increasingly uses the same silicon, resulting in redundant development and creating a less-than-seamless user experience. While this separation allows Apple to sell you an iPhone, an iPad, and a MacBook, it is an inefficiency born of a hardware-centric business model.

Google, whose revenue is driven by advertising and services, doesn't care what device you use as long as you are logged into its ecosystem. Its ad-driven business model gives Google the freedom to merge its platforms without cannibalizing its core business.

For Microsoft, the threat is more direct. An army of affordable, capable Android PCs powered by efficient Qualcomm chips directly attacks the heart of the Windows laptop market. To mitigate this, Microsoft must ultimately refine its own Windows on Arm experience, ensuring seamless performance and compatibility with legacy apps.

More importantly, it must lean into its core strengths: the deep integration with enterprise and the unparalleled library of powerful, professional software that will not be coming to Android anytime soon. Windows must become the undisputed OS for serious work, ceding the casual consumer market if necessary.

Google's venture into Android PCs with Qualcomm is the most credible attempt yet at creating a unified computing platform. The smartphone-up strategy is fundamentally sound, leveraging an unbeatable app ecosystem and a user base of billions.

However, the project's success hinges on Google's ability to do something it has historically struggled with: market a product with clarity, passion, and persistence. If it can, this initiative won't just create a new category of laptops; it could fundamentally reshape our concept of a “personal computer,” putting immense pressure on both Apple and Microsoft to adapt or risk being rendered obsolete by the tiny computer in everyone's pocket.



For years, digital artists have been caught in a frustrating compromise. Do you choose the slick, consumer-friendly experience of an Apple iPad, with its beautiful screen but glossy, imprecise drawing surface? Or do you opt for a dedicated Wacom tablet, sacrificing portability for professional-grade pen technology?

With the release of Wacom's MovinkPad 11, that compromise is officially over. This device isn't just another tablet; it's a focused, masterfully engineered tool that sets a new benchmark for portable digital creation.

The star of the show, without question, is the 11-inch OLED display. While Apple's “Liquid Retina” screens are excellent for watching movies, they are fundamentally backlit IPS panels. The MovinkPad's OLED screen is a different class entirely for artists. Because each pixel is its own light source, it can achieve perfect, absolute blacks. This creates a level of contrast and color vibrancy that makes digital paintings pop with a depth and accuracy an iPad simply cannot match. For professionals whose work depends on precise color grading and value control, this isn't a luxury; it's a necessity.

Wacom's legendary industrial design is on full display. The MovinkPad 11 feels less like a fragile media device and more like a durable piece of studio equipment. The back has a comfortable, grippy texture, and the display itself features a subtly etched surface. This isn't the slick, glass-on-glass feeling of an iPad; it provides a satisfying, paper-like resistance that gives artists the tactile feedback needed for precise linework. Paired with Wacom's latest Pro Pen 3, which uses battery-free EMR technology and boasts an imperceptible level of latency, the drawing experience is second to none.

At a retail price of $449.95, the MovinkPad 11 is a serious investment positioned squarely against a mid-tier iPad Air. But the comparison is misleading. An iPad is a general-purpose computer that can also be used for artistic purposes. The MovinkPad is a dedicated professional art tool from the ground up. For that price, you are getting a display technology and a pen experience that far surpasses what Apple offers for creative work.

So, who is this for? The ideal customer is the serious creative professional or the dedicated hobbyist who prioritizes the drawing experience above all else. This is for the digital illustrator who needs perfect color on the go, the comic book artist storyboarding in a cafe, or the animator sketching out keyframes on the train.

While the iPad tries to be everything to everyone, the Wacom MovinkPad 11 is unapologetically for the artist. It is, without a doubt, the ultimate portable canvas. While I'm not an artist, my mother was, and I think she would have loved this tablet, so I'm making it my Product of the Week.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


by Todd Bishop on Oct 6, 2025 at 8:30 amOctober 6, 2025 at 8:53 am

The new CEO of Smartsheet is Rajeev “Raj” Singh.

That news elicited a murmur of surprise when it reached the GeekWire newsroom, just as we suspect it might for others familiar with Singh, Smartsheet, and Seattle tech as it's announced this morning.

Singh, the co-founder of Concur, has spent his career doing the heavy lifting of founding and building major enterprise software companies from early stages to massive exits. He most recently served as CEO of Accolade, leading the health benefits tech company through IPO and acquisition.

We didn't peg him as next in line to run a 20-year-old enterprise tech company that has already gone public, been acquired by private equity, and is now navigating its next phase of growth against entrenched competitors and an aggressive slate of AI-native startups. 

But when we expressed as much to him in an interview about his new role, Singh explained that the decision was driven by a combination of several business and personal factors.

First, he pointed to the company's “exceptional bones” — an iconic Seattle company with a large customer base of major businesses, more than $1 billion in revenue, and significant headroom for growth in the field of enterprise work management. 

A self-described product-focused leader, Singh emphasized this point. “I won't work at a company that I don't believe has the capacity to build a great product,” he said, noting the “incredible love and affinity that comes from users.”

As a sentimental bonus, Smartsheet's HQ is across the street from Concur in Bellevue. The expense management company has been part of SAP since its $8.3 billion acquisition in 2014.

Second, Singh was drawn to what he called an “extraordinary” opportunity to implement AI in a tangible way. He believes incumbent companies with established customers, deep integrated workflows, and incredible data sets have a unique advantage in creating AI solutions. 

“The opportunity to get my hands on the wheel of a company that I think can have an incredibly tangible impact on business with AI just seemed like a lot of fun,” Singh said. “I think you know me: I'm looking for work where I can have a great time and enjoy myself.”

Finally, the decision was personal. “I want to work with people that I love,” Singh said, citing his longstanding respect for former Smartsheet CEO Mark Mader and his excitement to partner again with Sunny Gupta, who is the company's executive chair. 

The working relationship between Gupta and Singh includes their time at enterprise tech company Apptio, where Gupta was CEO and Singh was a board member, prior to its acquisition by IBM for $4.6 billion in 2023. Gupta was named to be Smartsheet's acting CEO when the company announced in August that Mader would be retiring at the end of September.

At Smartsheet they're going to “flip the script,” Singh said, explaining that he's “excited about partnering up with Sunny one more time to go after something big.”

They face no shortage of competition. Smartsheet operates in a crowded and rapidly evolving technology landscape. Legacy players such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, along with newer challengers including Asana, Monday.com, Airtable, and ClickUp, are all competing for the same enterprise work-management business.

Singh takes the helm less than a year after Smartsheet was acquired by private equity firms Vista Equity Partners and Blackstone in an $8.4 billion deal that took the company private. Being a CEO under private equity ownership comes with unique pressures and constraints.

However, Singh said he spent a significant amount of time with the board members from Vista and Blackstone and found an “open and receptive audience” for his own hypothesis about the company's path forward. He sees the owners as “like-minded people” aligned on the goal of growing the business into one of the most important companies in enterprise software.

Shortly after Mader's departure, Smartsheet laid off more than 120 employees last week. Smartsheet had grown to more than 3,300 people as of a year ago — tripling its headcount over the previous five years, according to its final quarterly filing as a public company.

When asked about the cutbacks, Singh described them as part of a larger transformation happening across the business world, driven by AI and shifting talent needs. 

“There are no businesses that don't need massive transformation right now,” he said. “Anybody who thinks otherwise is missing the story.” In that context, he added, “smart businesses address that proactively… and do it in a smart and humane way.”

Despite the cuts, he said, Smartsheet is a growing business, and he expects the employee base, customer base, and revenue to continue to grow.

As part of the interview, we had to ask the obvious question: What role will Mike Hilton play? 

We were only partly joking. Longtime friends and business partners, Hilton and Singh have been connected for most of their careers. Singh and his brother, Steve Singh, co-founded Concur back in 1993 with Hilton, who later joined Raj Singh at Accolade. 

More recently, Singh and Hilton backed a new Seattle-area startup called SCALA.AI.

When asked if Hilton would join him at Smartsheet, Singh laughed.

“Trust me when I tell you, I've spent a lot of time talking to Mike about this opportunity and getting his advice on the opportunity,” Singh said. “Whether I can lure him away… I don't know, but I promise you this, he'll be a wise counsel and a dear friend through the entire process.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Mary Brunkow of the Seattle-based Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and Fred Ramsdell of Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which has offices in Seattle and South San Francisco, today were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their research on the immune cells that prevent the human body from attacking itself.

Shimon Sakaguchi of Osaka University in Japan will also share the prize for their work identifying regulatory T cells, dubbed the “immune system's security guards.”

“Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,” Olle Kämpe, chair of the Nobel Committee, said in a statement.

In 1995, Sakaguchi made the initial discovery of immune cells that protect the body from autoimmune diseases, but many in the field were skeptical of his conclusions. 

Six years later, Brunkow and Ramsdell were working together at Celltech, a biotech company that previously had an R&D facility in Bothell, Wash. They identified a gene they named FOXP3 that, when damaged, caused severe autoimmune illness in mice. They also showed that a mutation in the human version of this gene caused the rare, life-threatening autoimmune disease IPEX.

The research done by the trio solidified the role of regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, and launched a new field in peripheral tolerance research, which is the study of how the body makes the distinction between dangerous invaders and its own cells. Work in this area has led to therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Brunkow earned her bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Washington, and holds a master's degree and PhD in Molecular Biology from Princeton University.

When the Nobel Committee tried to reach Brunkow today to inform her of the award, she ignored the call, the Associated Press reported.

“My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: ‘That's just, that's spam of some sort,'” Brunkow told the AP. 

“When I told Mary she won, she said, ‘Don't be ridiculous,'” said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.

Brunkow worked at Celltech for a decade, until the United Kingdom-based company closed its Bothell facility in 2004. She has been a senior program manager at ISB for more than 16 years.

“ISB congratulates Dr. Brunkow on this extraordinary honor and celebrates her contributions to science and human health,” ISB President Jim Heath said via email.

ISB is a nonprofit studying cancer, aging, infectious disease, chronic illness and other health challenges. Renowned Seattle scientist Dr. Leroy Hood co-founded the organization in 2000 for research into systems biology, an interdisciplinary field that tackles biology from an integrated perspective. ISB is an affiliate of the Providence health care system.

Ramsdell is based on Bainbridge Island, just west of Seattle. In 2019 he helped co-found Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which opened a new R&D center and office space on Seattle's waterfront last year. The company is focused specifically on Treg cells. It has a partnership with Regeneron to co-develop cell therapies for Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and two undisclosed conditions.

“Like many great scientists, [Ramsdell] spent years working behind the scenes to identify the gene that caused devastating systemic autoimmune diseases in a little-known strain of mice,” Jeff Bluestone, Sonoma CEO and president said in a statement. “The discovery of the gene, FOXP3, changed our understanding of peripheral tolerance and led to a new field of immunotherapy.”

Ramsdell earned his PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of California, Los Angeles and holds a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and cell biology from the University of California, San Diego. 

His career includes roles at Seattle biotech giants Immunex and Zymogenetics, and he spent six years at Celltech. Ramsdell was previously chief scientific officer at Sonoma, and is now chair of the company's scientific advisory board.

The Seattle area is home to numerous companies and organizations working on autoimmune diseases, a list that includes but is not limited to:

The prize was announced today at the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.

Last year, UW biochemist David Baker won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for his research and discoveries about the molecular structure of proteins.

Editor's note: Story updated to correct that Fred Ramsdell is based on Bainbridge Island, Wash., and to add additional information on his career.

Our latest Startup Radar spotlights Seattle-area companies building software for everything from insurance commissions to leadership training.

This regular series features early stage startups across the Seattle region that are getting off the ground with innovative ideas.

Read on for brief descriptions of each company — and a pitch assessment from GPT-powered “Mean VC,” which we prompt to offer both positive and critical feedback.

Check past Startup Radar posts here, and email me at [email protected] to flag other companies and startup news.

CodeChimp

Founded: 2025

The business: A project management platform that aims to turn vibe coding into a “multiplayer experience” by using multi-agent orchestration and other AI-powered tools. Helps developers with code generation, reviews, and automated testing. Part of a newly coined “agentic swarm coding” trend.  Company was originally known as Bili and just joined the latest Plug and Play cohort in Seattle. 

Leadership: Sylviane Zhao recently graduated from Cornell University. Co-founders Tehani Cabour and Shawn Yang both worked at French software giant Dassault Systèmes.

Mean VC: “Riding the ‘agentic swarm coding' wave with a multiplayer twist could make CodeChimp the darling of dev teams sick of solo LLM prompts and endless PR reviews. But buzzwords and cohorts don't ship stable code — unless you prove clear productivity gains and developer trust, you'll drown in the same hype pool as every other AI-coding startup chasing GitHub's shadow.”

EvolvArts

Founded: 2024

The business: CRM designed for nonprofit arts organizations. Handles donor development, ticketing, marketing, communications, class registration, tuition, and more. Self-described as “Ticketmaster for the performing arts.” The company has about 20 customers and is bootstrapped.

Leadership: CEO Christopher Lin was a principal engineer at Numbers Station AI and a research scientist at Meta. Co-founder Max Thayer was a founding member of Anker US and helped lead business development manager at e-commerce agency Oceanwing.

Mean VC: “Targeting arts organizations with a unified CRM and ticketing platform is smart — this niche is underserved, loyal, and still trapped in spreadsheet purgatory. But calling yourself ‘Ticketmaster for the performing arts' is a dangerous flex unless you plan to match its scale, integrations, and uptime — otherwise, you're just a boutique tool with Broadway dreams and community-theater resources.”

Rem

Founded: 2024

The business: AI-powered operating system for insurance distribution that automates commission tracking and reconciliation. Initially focused agents and carriers in healthcare. The company has raised a pre-seed round from AI2 Incubator and other investors. 

Leadership: CEO Jorge Banuelos was head of core prediction at Opendoor and held managerial roles in data science at Meta and Microsoft. Co-founder and CTO Zhongxia Zhou was an engineering manager at Opendoor and Compass.

Mean VC: “Automating commission tracking and reconciliation in insurance is a rare combination of boring and brilliant — exactly where real enterprise value hides. But insurance tech is a graveyard of integrations and edge cases, so unless Rem nails data accuracy and carrier cooperation, it'll spend years debugging spreadsheets instead of scaling revenue.”

Simsola

Founded: 2024

The business: AI training platform built on a developmental psychology framework to help leaders improve how they communicate, coordinate, and collaborate — both internally and with customers. Also partners with training providers to turn their frameworks into AI simulations and coaching tools. Simsola has raised $1 million and is generating revenue.

Leadership: CEO Tammy Wang held data science leadership roles at Korn Ferry and Riviera Partners, and was a senior director at Zillow. Co-founder Dr. Zachary Van Rossum is an organizational psychologist and and adjunct assistant professor at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Mean VC: “Blending developmental psychology with AI-driven leadership training is a clever way to move beyond generic chatbots and into measurable behavioral change. Still, the corporate training market is littered with ‘transformational' tools that never survive budget season — Simsola will need undeniable ROI data, not just eloquent theory, to stay in the lineup.”

Vergent

Founded: 2025

The business: Developing an SDK for spatial AI reasoning and memory. The idea is to allow LLMs to answer questions about 3D space with high degrees of accuracy. The company is pre-launch and has not generated revenue. Vergent recently won a pitch event at AI House in Seattle.

Leadership: CEO Benjamin Liang and CTO Andrew Liang were founding AI engineers at decentralized deepfake detection startup BitMind. They are also twin brothers and both studied computer science at NYU where they co-authored research in computer vision/graphics together.

Mean VC: “Building an SDK that gives LLMs genuine spatial reasoning is ambitious and could open up massive new verticals — from robotics to AR design to autonomous inspection. But ‘pre-launch, no revenue, won a pitch' is startup bingo for ‘impressive demo, unclear business,' and unless Vergent quickly proves a commercial use case, it'll stay more sci-fi than SDK.”

Is Amazon priming little kids for future careers as delivery drivers?

The new, 92-page Amazon holiday gift catalog features a ride-on delivery van suitable for kids ages 2 and up. The blue van with the Prime logo on the side has a seat on top and a handle — perfect for kids to scoot around and deliver packages to other children in the neighborhood.

It does come with three little Amazon boxes which feature wooden toy vehicles inside. The van's cargo area is under the seat. Maybe it can be loaded with books for a real throwback Amazon vibe. Otherwise, pack it with batteries and toilet paper — two of the hottest sellers on the e-commerce site.

The van, by longtime toy wagon maker Radio Flyer, sells for $46 online. Customer reviews average 4.8 out of five stars, with plenty of people commenting about how tickled their kids are while pretending to make deliveries.

Foot power is about as sustainable as it gets, so the vans should help with Amazon's push to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040.

And finally, little 2-year-old delivery drivers are probably still in diapers, so the toy van is unlikely to need one controversial accessory — the alleged (and disputed) driver pee bottles that created such a public relations mess for the company several years ago.

Hat tip to GeekWire contributor Frank Catalano for sharing images and intel from the new catalog.

OpenAI is launching a new way for developers to build applications inside of ChatGPT. Starting Monday, users in ChatGPT will be able to access interactive applications from companies like Booking.com, Expedia, Spotify, Figma, Coursera, Zillow, and Canva. OpenAI is also launching a preview of the Apps SDK, the developer-facing toolkit to build these apps.

OpenAI made the announcement at its annual developer conference, DevDay 2025. 

“We want ChatGPT to be a great way for people to make progress, to be more productive, more inventive, to learn faster, to do whatever they're trying to do in their lives better,” said CEO Sam Altman. “[Apps inside of ChatGPT] will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with.”

You can now chat with apps in ChatGPT. pic.twitter.com/T9Owi3POim

The new system is OpenAI's latest attempt to build an ecosystem of apps around its flagship AI product, ChatGPT. The launch follows OpenAI's previous attempts to let developers build interactive applications, such as through its GPT Store. Unlike that product, which was a separate app store, Monday's launch puts apps directly in ChatGPT's responses and lets users call up third-party tools in their everyday conversations. This gives developers better distribution for the apps they build and aims to make a richer experience for users in ChatGPT.

By typing the names of different apps in ChatGPT, users can draw in content from a variety of services. For example, users can say, “Figma, turn this sketch into a workable diagram” to call up the Figma app. Users can also call up the Coursera app by asking, “Coursera, can you teach me something about machine learning?”

In a demo of Zillow's application, users could prompt ChatGPT in natural language to search for apartments in their area within a specific price range. ChatGPT then pulled up an interactive map showing options, and users could talk with ChatGPT to learn more about each one.

ChatGPT will also surface relevant apps when they could be helpful to a user. If someone asks for a playlist for a party this weekend, ChatGPT may call up the Spotify app in the conversation. In the future, OpenAI says apps like DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, and AllTrails will be available in ChatGPT as well. 

OpenAI says the new system is built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows developers to connect their data sources to an AI system. ChatGPT apps can also trigger actions and render a fully interactive UI in the chatbot's responses. Certain apps are able to display videos in ChatGPT, which will be pinned to the top of the web page and can be altered based on user requests.

If users are already subscribed to a product, they'll be able to log in to their account directly in ChatGPT to access certain features. Altman also says OpenAI will support ways to monetize apps inside of ChatGPT in the future, including through the company's recently launched Instant Checkout feature in ChatGPT.

Key questions around apps in ChatGPT will be privacy, and how much data third-party developers will have access to. OpenAI says developers must “collect only the minimum data they need, and be transparent about permissions.” However, it's unclear whether developers would have access to a user's entire conversation with ChatGPT, the past few messages, or just the prompt that summoned up the app.

It's also unclear how ChatGPT will choose a service between competing companies, such as DoorDash and Instacart. One could imagine how companies could pay to be surfaced in ChatGPT responses, but OpenAI says it plans to prioritize the user experience above all else.

Instagram announced on Monday that it's launching an awards program, with 25 creators set to receive a gold ring next week. The company says the new awards program will recognize creators around the world who shift culture and break barriers. 

The judges panel for the new awards program includes Instagram head Adam Mosseri, director Spike Lee, designer Marc Jacobs, YouTuber Marques Brownlee, actress Yara Shahidi, makeup artist Pat McGrath, and more.

Winners will receive a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile. They'll also be able to design a custom “Like” button that appears when liking feed posts. Notably, winners won't be receiving any sort of monetary prize.

The move comes as Meta has been scaling back its creator payout programs over the past few years. Earlier this year, Meta shut down a program that paid creators for ads placed in their profiles. In 2023, the company stopped offering bonuses to Reels creators on Instagram and Facebook. The company also shut down its affiliate marketing bonuses in 2022. 

The launch of the new awards program also comes as creators saw a 52% decrease in brand deals in 2024, according to a survey from Kajabi. Additionally, Bank of America said last year that along with a slowdown in sponsored partnerships, there's competition in the space, as more paid partnerships are concentrated among the top creators.

Given these recent shifts, it's interesting to see Instagram launch a symbolic awards program that doesn't offer any monetary compensation to recipients. Instead, it's focused on creating an awards program that's supposed to be like the Oscars for content creators (without an actual ceremony). 

The company said in the blog post that the award is “all about celebrating those who aren't afraid to take creative chances and do it their way. Those who bring people together over their creativity, and deserve recognition.”

Winners will be announced on October 16.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Monday announced the launch of AgentKit, a toolkit for building and deploying AI agents, at the firm's Dev Day event.  

“AgentKit is a complete set of building blocks available in the open AI platform designed to help you take agents from prototype to production. It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said.  

The launch highlights OpenAI's push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.

AgentKit was one of several announcements at OpenAI's Dev Day, including the launch of the ability to build apps directly inside ChatGPT, which has hit 800 million weekly active users.  

AgentKit includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman described as like Canva for building agents.  

“It's a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. “It's built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.” 

The second capability of AgentKit is ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.  

“You can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,” Altman said. 

Evals for Agents introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform. 

Finally, AgentKit includes access to OpenAI's connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an “admin control panel” while maintaining security and control. 

To prove how easy it is to use AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.  

“This is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents,” Altman said, noting that OpenAI has already signed on several launch partners that have already scaled agents using AgentKit.

Microsoft is buying 100 megawatts of solar capacity from Japanese developer Shizen Energy, the latest in a string of renewable energy deals designed to power the tech company's growing compute needs. 

The agreement, which the companies announced late last week, covers four different solar developments; one is already operating and three are under construction. The deal covers output from the plants for 20 years.

Seattle-based Microsoft already operates two data centers in Japan. Microsoft's compute capacity is slated to expand as the company invests $2.9 billion in the country over the next year.

Solar has become a favored source of power for tech companies and data center operators in recent years because it is quick and cheap to build. Solar is among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, and projects are generally completed within 18 months. Plus, users can begin drawing power before the entire project is complete. 

Microsoft has been a big buyer of solar in recent months. Since the year began, the company has contracted more than 1 gigawatt of solar capacity.

Think MS is in for a rough ride on Windows. Short of corporate world - Excel/Sharpoint/AD - there is just no moat. Browsers work fine on all platforms, dev work is better on linux anyway and gaming on linux is rapidly becoming usable. And mac side is obviously competitive on various fronts too.

This is partially why major (effective) anti-cheats have migrated to the Kernel. Windows allows the big-budget games, which are often competitive games, to operate with a higher level of game integrity, which leads to more revenue generation.MacOS is not an attainable gaming support platform in general, as the people who are interested in the AAA games are going to need a Pro series or similar quality device which prices a large part of the current windows gaming audience out.As an example: it's not too expensive to buy a laptop that runs valorant, and then be funneled into the skin shop. You can get a lot more sales that way than you can through the crowd of people who are on MBP, though perhaps the MBP crew is more likely to be a whale.note: Valorant is not supported on MacOS due to the anticheat requirement, but the hypothetical still stands.

On the other hand the anti cheat side has been really ratcheting up with newer releases requiring Win 11 and Secure Boot. I somewhat hope and fear we might get a blessed version of SteamOS for the Deck that is heavily locked down and has kernel/hypervisor level anti cheat functions added to it. Essentially allowing for a boot mode similar to current consoles. While it goes against the open spirit of SteamOS, it might serve as an argument to invest a bit more into the Linux side, potentially improving the ecosystem as a whole.Or all of it might be the usual ""year of the Linux desktop"" pipe dream.[1] leaving out the Switch which is heavily focused on Nintendo IP and has comparatively weak hardware

The M5's GPU cores are expected to pick up the same 40% performance boost we just saw in the newly released iPhones.AAA games written for the M4 already work just fine, the extra performance is needed when you are also emulating other graphics APIs and CPU instruction sets to run Windows games.Windows on ARM has the same issues, but Prism isn't as good at x86 emulation.

It's also about the market accessibility and penetration. When the base level MBA at it's lowest RAM settings is reliably running AAA games is when you might see more interest in the platform from those studios because much like the iOS market, people running Mac tend to be more readily monetized, especially through things like in-game cosmetics.

The performance boost is needed when you are running Windows games under emulation.Emulation overhead is also an issue for Proton on Linux or Windows on ARM.

We have decades of training in the consumer market for very simple install patterns using UIs, and minimal messing with configurations. The people in gaming who overclock and tweak their settings are a huge minority in gaming. Those people are the ones most likely to be able to grok switching to Linux, but when they get there and find that most of their favorite apps don't work like they are used to, they go back to Windows or Mac.My hypothesis is that for Linux Gaming to truly take off, you'll need a true desktop (not steamdeck which i use weekly) that makes it a handful of ""clicks"" to get whatever they want installed working. That means you'll need a commercially backed OS where developers maintain all the things needed to support near infinite peripheral connections for a variety of use cases, clear anti-cheat interfaces, and likely clear DRM hooks as well.

After a lifetime of Windows use, I'd even say MacOS is almost on par with Linux for development, while Windows' best feature on this front is WSL so you don't have to use Windows.

reply

IMO the two biggest pains with MacOS is (1) brew is not as good as any other package manager in my experience (mostly in bugs that need manual fixing) and (2) Docker naturally is much worse (not just for performance, but for requiring 'Docker desktop'.) All the other pains are just the myriad niceities I miss from a lifetime of mostly Linux that MacOS just can never have.

Microsoft has a strong cycle of ""applications run on Windows"" -> ""device vendors choose to bundle Windows"" -> ""people use applications on Windows"", but that has been eroded, in part thanks to Wine and the work put in by people at Valve.If someone who uses their computer to browse the web and check the email picked up a laptop pre-installed with Ubuntu, they'd likely be perfectly fine with it.

>but that has been eroded, in part thanks to Wine and the work put in by people at Valve.Eroded even more so by the user-hostile approach of Microsoft itself.Exactly with things like being a complete failure to recognize a strong valid need for general users to only opt-in to an account according to their own personal needs alone.  Not with Microsoft or Google or anybody else known to be a source of unwanted ads or anti-professional annoyances.Why abandon a remaining security element that can protect against PII compromise like no other?It's just sad to lose an essential feature that has always been built-in to Windows since the beginning, which helped make Windows into a far better business machine than would have been otherwise possible.And why now when security is more important than ever?

My plan for years has been to install Linux Mint + Cinnamon for my grandma when she next needs a new laptop... but she still hasn't needed one :(. And she's slowly getting too old for any new computerEvery Windows upgrade was a big change again. The UI would change each time, Windows Live Mail got discontinued, Office got ribbons, etc. Why reinvent the wheel each time? I've replaced:- Windows Live Mail with Thunderbird, that has been stable.- Microsoft Office with Libreoffice, that has been stable.- The next item on the list was going to be Windows itself, since Cinnamon hasn't significantly changed since I started using Linux over ten years ago. It still has a start menu, system tray, window list at the bottom (without the windows collapsing and hiding!), everything made for usability and working as you expect.The only exception is (grand)parents that need custom software. E.g. my mom has custom software (from Hema I think? Or Bruna maybe?) for editing photo albums to then send it to a print shop and get a real photo album. That will be web based nowadays I imagine. I should ask her but that could still be a barrier to switchingEdit: Similar issue on Android btw. There isn't one function that my (grand)parents use, that Android 16 has that Android 4 did not. The only thing that keeps changing under them is UI. Sure, developer APIs got nicer, support for dual-frequency GNSS is there, screens got taller... none of that needed to touch the UI. Sadly Google does a phenomenal job of obsoleting old OS versions quickly so you need to keep buying new. EU law for longer device support doesn't even help because you still need to upgrade that OS and can't simply use an LTS with security updates

The people who will have the hardest time switching to Linux are those who need proprietary software products that are unavailable for Linux and whose needs are not met by open-source alternatives.  Microsoft Office is still the standard for office software, and the Adobe Creative Cloud is still the standard for many creatives.If LibreOffice ever reached 100% compatibility and feature parity with Microsoft Office, and if the Adobe Creative Cloud ever got ported to Linux, then this could spell trouble for Windows.

Buy new overpriced hardware when what they have is fine?People jumped to Windows 7 out of spite; with Linux Desktop marketshare still slowly, steadily rising over the last 10 months. Windows 7 is EOL and no longer receives security patches, so security wise people are a lot worse off than what was anticipated.Here's the thing, I started up an old iPad last night and the e-mail no longer exists nor can be created, so I can't do a lost password, I can't log in, so I can't install apps, or even format the device without some 'Account Lock'I own this iPad, as in: it's mine. Why should I, and why would I want to put MY device's access and security on the whims of company?They want to own our hardware, and our software.I for one preach Linux Desktop, Manjaro XFCE for me. I think people are sticking with Windows 7 despite it being EOL because games and their software will for the most part not run in to issues linux gaming may be facing.That ain't the way. Your computer. Your choice. No cloud accounts/everything being logged on the desktop that people do, no 'requirements' to utilize the new software, and no 'requirements' to connect people to cloud backup systems to later coerce and push people to buy.

Great question! You did configure it that way, so it might be worth asking yourself.

reply

If it has a passcode and you remember the passcode, you should still be able to wipe the device with Apple Configurator?If the situation is that you don't have a passcode, but you do have an iCloud account where you don't remember the password and can't access the email address, and either don't have access to the recovery phone number or never specified one, then yeah. You might need to find your receipt and bring it to an Apple store to be reset.

I wouldn't get too excited about that. That might just be because people are moving off of desktops entirely and now only own mobile devices, a market where Linux may as well not exist (excluding Android). The number goes up, because at large, the portion of people who run Linux desktops are less likely to pivot to using only a mobile phone as they tend to be hobbyists/enthusiasts.

Huh? I certainly care about the latter but not the former, and I doubt I'm in the minority.

And how long would you expect Microsoft to write updates for computers with insecure boot chains, and secure boot chains? How much should they spend on mitigations for classes of attack that you can shut down just by updating? Why would they risk being seen to support a platform, that they consider a potential vector of incredibly bad PR, just for end user convenience? They have been browbeaten into being extremely security conscious, especially after the SMB stuff.Personally, my Win 10 laptops are becoming Debian laptops as god intended.

Not only does it allow you to create a local admin account, but you can also skip all the other setup screens that you want by pre-supplying values. Throw this file into your Windows boot media, do a fresh install (which you should be doing when you get a new machine regardless), and away you go. I use this both personally and my work environment. Not only are you then not relying on modifying OS ISO's or compilations, but an XML file is relatively easy to verify that only the settings you have set are the ones being input into the system if you utilize a third party tool like the one available at schneegeas.de

Seriously considering the move to Linux - I've heard it's getting better, but it would cost me a bit of time getting used to it.  The pain is really starting to seem like a lower cost every day.

reply

What makes Linux especially painful to windows users is they basically need to relearn how to solve the same sort of problems they've forgotten they've been solving all the time in windows, but in Linux. Which makes the effort novel and thus especially noticeable.Basically it takes accepting one is going to get smacked with fractal side quests of searching how to fix problems for a bit, but it does get better fairly quickly.

Projects that get a lot of attention already put up barriers to new contributions, and the ones that get less attention will continue to get less attention.The review process cannot be left to AI because it will introduce uncertainty nobody wants to be held responsible for.If anything, the people who have always seen code as a mere means to an end will finally come to a forced decision: either stop fucking around or get out of the way.An adversarial web is ultimately good for software quality, but less open than it used to be. I'm not even sure if that's a bad thing.

People over Papers was removed by Padlet, the platform it was built on, yesterday. 

People over Papers, a crowdsourcing project that maps sightings of US immigration agents, was taken offline yesterday by Padlet, the collaborative bulletin board platform on which it was built. It's just the latest ICE-tracking initiative to be pulled by tech platforms in the past few days. 

A Padlet customer service representative told Celeste, one of the project's creators, that the map “was trashed due to violations of our Content Policy,” without specifying which policy was violated. Celeste has not disclosed her last name for safety reasons.     

But days earlier, the right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had tweeted at Padlet's CEO about the project. 

“Are you aware that @padlet is being used by radical left wing domestic terrorists, illegal aliens and their supporters to obstruct law enforcement operations and harass ICE agents?” she wrote, “PADLET's Content Policy clearly notes that harassment, stalking, privacy violations, inciting violence, and any other unlawful activity are not on the platform.” 

In the same thread, Loomer claimed responsibility for the removal of several similar apps, including ICEBlock, from Apple's and Google's app stores last week. 

Loomer's remarks echo statements made by officials at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security claiming that ICE-tracking projects are responsible for a “1000%” increase in assaults on ICE agents. 

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has described “violence” against ICE agents as “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations,” while the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, has indicated that the department “will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.”

A previously unreported project is intended to improve how facial recognition algorithms track children over time.

Padlet did not respond to MIT Technology Review's request for comment on why it took the People over Papers project down.

However, Celeste told us she rejects Loomer's claims. “Nothing we are doing is unlawful, and we will continue exercising our right to freedom of speech,” she said. “We do not condone any violence whatsoever.”



Celeste started People over Papers in January, after connecting with other TikTok creators who were also sharing information about ICE raids in their communities. In the 10 months since, it has received over 19 million unique visitors and has been averaging between 200,000 and 300,000 users per day. 

She came up with the idea of mapping the raids “to inform people of what is happening in their communities” and says the project is “documenting history and gathering information about something that will likely be looked back on as an extremely dark time.”

It is among a number of volunteer-led efforts, including the ICEBlock app that was removed from app stores last week and the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network, that map anonymous reports about immigration enforcement agents conducting raids. 

The maps play an important role in “offer[ing] protection, solidarity, and survival strategies in hostile territory,” Allissa Richardson, a scholar at the University of Southern California who studies how marginalized communities use social media, told MIT Technology Review this summer. They serve as “modern-day Green Books for immigrant communities,” she said. “Just as Black travelers once used the Green Book to navigate safely through a landscape of racial terror, these digital tools help Latine families move through spaces marked by surveillance and risk.” 

Pressuring technology platforms to remove the maps is just one part of the administration's strategy to stop efforts to track ICE or identify its masked agents conducting raids. In early September, DHS subpoenaed Meta for the personal information of users behind the Instagram accounts of the Stop ICE Raids Alert Network and a number of other nonprofit organizations and rapid response networks; the subpoena has been temporarily blocked pending a court hearing. 

At least one person has allegedly lost her job in connection to these apps. Carolyn Feinstein, whose husband ran the ICEBlock app, was terminated from her job with the Department of Justice over the summer, which she says was in retaliation for her husband's work. 

“Trying to blunt these efforts to hold federal officers accountable” has the effect of “chilling speech and activism,” says David Greene, the director of civil liberties at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He says that identifying agents does not count as doxxing, because “the idea that law enforcement would be masked and and therefore unaccountable to the people they are serving is really anathema to American values.”  

“Saying the doxxing itself is an act of violence would require a different definition of violence than the one we've traditionally used in regards to legal issues,” says Peter Simi, a sociology professor at Chapman University who studies threats to public officials. 

For its part, the People over Papers map was back online six hours after it was removed from Padlet—this time on its own website, which Celeste's team has been working on since May and had planned to launch next week. 

Celeste says she isn't cowed: “I am personally super stubborn. The more someone tells me I can't do something, the more I want to do it.” 

Besides, “if this information isn't posted on our platform, it will be posted on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and any other social media platform,” she says. “People will continue to inform each other one way or another.”

British polar explorer Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton established his place in the annals of history after ensuring the survival of his entire crew following the shipwreck of Endurance in 1915. A new paper sheds light on the state of the infamous vessel—and what Shackleton knew of it before setting off.

Jukka Tuhkuri, a polar explorer and researcher specializing in ice mechanics and arctic marine technology at Finland's Aalto University, has revealed that Endurance was not as sturdy as widely believed, and that Shackleton knew about its structural shortcomings. His work adds nuance to one of the most famous survival stories over 100 years since the explorer's death and three years since he and the rest of the Endurance22 mission found the shipwreck.

In August 1914, Shackleton and his crew set sail from England. The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition aimed to achieve the first overland crossing of the Antarctic continent. The plan was for a team to hike from the Weddell Sea over the South Pole to the Ross Sea, but the main expedition ship Endurance got stuck in pack ice in 1915 and was eventually crushed, sinking below the water in November. The 28 members of the crew survived on the ice before using boats to reach Elephant Island. From there, a small team including Shackleton sailed 800 miles (1,300 km) to South Georgia Island to get help. By September 1916, the whole Endurance crew had been rescued without losing a single life.

“Even simple structural analysis shows that the ship was not designed for the compressive pack ice conditions that eventually sank it,” Tuhkuri said in an Aalto University statement. “The danger of moving ice and compressive loads — and how to design a ship for such conditions — was well understood before the ship sailed south. So we really have to wonder why Shackleton chose a vessel that was not strengthened for compressive ice.”

According to Tuhkuri, Endurance is widely believed to be the strongest polar ship of its time, but with one failing—a problem with the rudder—that would lead to its unfortunate end. By combining technical analysis and archival research in a study published today in the journal Polar Record, the researcher revealed this to be a flawed perception.

“Endurance clearly had several structural deficiencies compared with other early Antarctic ships,” he said. “The deck beams and frames were weaker, the machine compartment was longer, leading to serious weakening in a significant part of the hull, plus there were no diagonal beams to strengthen the hull. Not only does this challenge the romantic narrative that it was the strongest polar ship of its time, but it also belies the simplistic idea that the rudder was the ship's Achilles' heel.”

Despite investigating Shackleton's diaries, personal correspondence, and other communications from the crew, Tuhkuri isn't sure why Shackleton decided to sail with Endurance. He knew about the ship's problems—Tuhkuri said that the explorer complained about it to his wife before the start of the expedition, wishing for his previous vessel.

“In fact, he had recommended diagonal beams for another polar ship when visiting a Norwegian shipyard. That same ship got stuck in compression ice for months and survived it,” Tuhkuri continued.

As such, the paper prompts an interesting question. Was the ship “ill-fated,” or were bad calls at the heart of it? Tuhkuri, however, chose to leave it unanswered. While he hopes his research will contribute a novel point of view to our understanding of the vessel, he says that it doesn't try to diminish Shackleton and his crew's accomplishment.

“We can speculate about financial pressures or time constraints, but the truth is we may never know why Shackleton made the choices that he made. At least now we have more concrete findings to flesh out the stories,” he concluded.

OpenAI just inked another multibillion-dollar deal.

The AI giant is buying 6 gigawatts and billions of dollars worth of Nvidia-rival chipmaker AMD's latest generation chips to power its next-generation AI infrastructure.

AMD unveiled its next-generation Instinct chips at a launch event in July, when CEO Lisa Su took the stage with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to announce that the AI giant would use the new chips.

The first 1 gigawatt of that deployment is set to begin in the second half of 2026. As OpenAI hits deployment targets, it will also gradually receive a total of 160 million AMD shares at 1 cent each, which translates to a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.

Nvidia is still the leader in the global chip industry, but AMD is its closest rival in the U.S., and Thursday's deal gives the company a huge advantage in its efforts to compete.

The financials of the deal were not disclosed, but AMD chief financial officer Jean Hu said in the press release that the partnership was “expected to deliver tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD while accelerating OpenAI's AI infrastructure buildout.”

This is only the latest multibillion-dollar deal OpenAI has announced recently.

OpenAI and Nvidia announced a huge addition to their long-lasting partnership last month, with a $100 billion investment by Nvidia in OpenAI to support 10 gigawatts of data center and power capacity deployment. Just a few days prior to that, OpenAI also signed a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle, which became one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. Around the same time, OpenAI also inked a reportedly $10 billion deal with Broadcom to create custom in-house AI chips.

“Building the future of AI requires deep collaboration across every layer of the stack,” co-founder and President of OpenAI Greg Brockman said in a press release on Monday.

“We are in a phase of the build-out where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well,” Altman said, per WSJ. “You'll see this on chips. You'll see this on data centers. You'll see this lower down the supply chain.”

The AI industry is a compact family affair. There are a handful of huge names with overlapping interests that ink a seemingly infinite series of multibillion-dollar investments with each other, injecting more money into the system and creating a self-sustaining network that props itself up… for now.

With each deal, the companies also enjoy a huge boost in share prices. On Monday morning, AMD's shares skyrocketed more than 37% when news of the OpenAI deal hit the market.

The biggest players in AI are currently enjoying a ride on an unprecedented gravy train. Nvidia is the first and only company in the world to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. Oracle's chairman, Larry Ellison, was briefly the richest person in the entire world last month. OpenAI is now worth more on paper than Elon Musk's SpaceX and TikTok parent company ByteDance.

But that also creates risk: if one company goes down, they all go down together, and that has only supercharged fears of an AI bubble for skeptics. If there is indeed an AI bubble, then a burst could have catastrophic consequences for the U.S. economy.

Over the past decade, as mass shootings have become depressingly common, school districts have increasingly invested in surveillance systems designed to monitor students' online activity. Recently, one of those systems pinged after a teen in Florida asked ChatGPT for advice about how to kill his friend, local police said.

The episode occurred in Deland, Florida, where an unnamed 13-year-old student attending the city's Southwestern Middle School is alleged to have asked OpenAI's chatbot about “how to kill my friend in the middle of class.” The question immediately set off an alert within a system that was monitoring school-issued computers. That system was run by a company called Gaggle, which provides safety services to school districts throughout the country. Soon, police were interviewing the teen, reports local NBC-affiliate WFLA.

The student told cops that he was “just trolling” a friend who had “annoyed him,” the local outlet reports. Cops, of course, were less than enthused with the little troll. “Another ‘joke' that created an emergency on campus,” the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. “Parents, please talk to your kids so they don't make the same mistake.” The student was ultimately arrested and booked at the county jail, the outlet says. It's unclear what he has been charged with. Gizmodo reached out to the sheriff's office for more information.

Gaggle's website describes itself as a safety solution for K-12 students, and it offers a variety of services. In a blog post, Gaggle describes how it uses web monitoring, which filters for various keywords (presumably “kill” is one of those keywords) to gain “visibility into browser use, including conversations with AI tools such as Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and other platforms.” The company says that its system is designed to flag “concerning behavior tied to self-harm, violence, bullying, and more, and provides context with screen captures.”

Gaggle clearly prioritizes student safety over all other considerations. On its website, the company dispenses with the subject of student privacy thusly: “Most educators and attorneys will tell you that when your child is using school-provided technology, there should be no expectation of privacy. In fact, your child's school is legally required by federal law (Children's Internet Protection Act) to protect children from accessing obscene or harmful content over the internet.”

Naturally, Gaggle has been criticized by privacy rights activists. “It has routinized law enforcement access and presence in students' lives, including in their home,” Elizabeth Laird, a director at the Center for Democracy and Technology, recently told the Associated Press. The outlet also says that many of the safety alerts issued by Gaggle end up being false alarms.

Increasingly, chatbots like ChatGPT are showing up in criminal cases involving mental health incidents. Episodes of so-called “AI psychosis,” in which people with mental health problems engage with chatbots and seem to have their delusions exacerbated, have been on the rise. Several recent suicides have also been blamed on the chatbot. Gizmodo reached out to OpenAI for comment.

Taylor Swift once said, “You deserve to own the art you make.” Apparently, that doesn't apply to the millions of artists who have had their works fed into the data wood chipper that is generative AI tools. In the lead-up to the release of the world's biggest pop star's latest album, “Life of a Showgirl,” fans were treated to easter egg videos designed to build hype. Instead, sharp-eyed Swifties started to spot what appeared to be AI-generated imagery within the teaser videos, and launched full Swift-vestigations into the situation.

The alleged generative AI material appeared in a series of short promotional videos. Those videos were accessed via QR codes that were posted on 12 orange doors located in 12 different cities. The videos, originally uploaded via YouTube Shorts, are no longer available, but Gizmodo reviewed purported re-uploads found online. Each video featured letters which, when put together, provided the phrase, “You must remember everything, but mostly this, the crowd is your king.” But the mystery that Taylor's king took more of an interest in seemed to be, “Why do some of these videos look a little off?”

No one from Swift's camp has confirmed in any way the use of generative AI in the promotional videos, but there is certainly enough on-screen to create suspicion. Users have pointed out clipping and disappearing imagery in some videos that suggest that what you're seeing is created with generative AI. The videos appear to be a part of a partnership with Google, according to a report from The Tennessean, which covered the orange door reveal that appeared in Nashville. Gizmodo reached out to Google for comment regarding its involvement in the videos, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

Others have called out some lettering that appears in different shots that have a distinct AI-generated quality to them, in that they are largely nonsense. A treadmill that appears in one video, for instance, has buttons that read “MOP,” “SUOP,” and “NCLINE,” with letters that are curved and blurred in ways that suggest there's something more than just some wear and tear on the buttons. Another image, a notebook, also appears to contain made-up lettering that a human would be unlikely to make, on account of the fact that a human knows what letters are.

this is ai + either taylor is the powerful woman that has power over every aspect of her art (music, promo etc)so she definitely approved this or she doesn't let's not switch narratives only when it benefits taylors ok? pic.twitter.com/mCkplSDuxw

Not a criticism of Taylor herself, moreso her team/company…. the lettering on this treadmill is a very well known indicator of AI generated text. pic.twitter.com/qCDzoCkufW

— katie ❤️‍🔥 (@13poetsdept) October 4, 2025



Generative AI systems are notoriously bad at generating text because, while these systems have been trained on massive sets of data and images containing text, the model has no concept of what it's actually “looking” at. This is why generative AI models can spit out images of watches and clocks, but it's often hard to get them to display specific times, because the model has no idea how to tell time. It just knows clocks have lines that mark time, not what those lines actually indicate.

The inconsistencies were surprisingly common throughout the videos. Viewers pointed out a squirrel that appears to transform into a chipmunk at one point, and a changing number of lamps that appear in another shot. The Swift diehards took particular offense to an AI-generated version of a piano and guitar that was used on Swift's Eras Tour, which shouldn't be surprising given how big a deal was made of those custom-made instruments at the time.

It doesn't appear that generative AI was used in the creation of Swift's music videos for the new album, and there doesn't appear to be an indication that generative AI was used in the feature film released to mark the launch of the record.  Gizmodo reached out to representatives for Taylor Swift, as well as Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of “Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” for comment regarding the potential use of generative AI in the making of these promotional videos, music videos, and the film. No parties responded on the record at the time of publication.

On its face, this appears to be a pretty major blunder. You can't tell your superfans, who think every word you speak and image you post contains secret messages, to look for clues in an AI-generated video and not expect them to spot inconsistencies. But hey, maybe these weird anomalies are just part of another Easter egg reveal, right?

When it comes to commercial launch providers, the U.S. Space Force clearly has a favorite. On Friday, the military branch assigned the majority of its upcoming national security missions to SpaceX, while Blue Origin fell behind pending the conclusion of a rocket certification process.

The Space Force awarded contracts to SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) worth more than $1 billion as part of its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. SpaceX snagged five of the seven military missions, worth $714 million, while ULA will launch the remaining two, priced at $428 million. Blue Origin, another featured contender, was not eligible to receive missions this time around as the company awaits its New Glenn rocket to become certified.

Earlier in April, the Space Force's Space System Command announced three companies, SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin, as the recipients of its first round of awards for NSSL. The program, meant to procure launch service providers for military missions, includes a total of 54 missions set to launch between 2027 and 2032.

The first batch of missions is scheduled for launch through 2029. Although the majority of payloads on the missions remain classified, the Space Force revealed a few highlights of the upcoming launches. SpaceX's newly assigned missions include launching the 12th Wideband Global Satcom communications satellite, a satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), as well as three undisclosed payloads. ULA's upcoming missions include launching a GPS satellite, as well as another NRO payload.

SpaceX is one of the main launch providers for the Space Force, having launched more than a dozen of its payloads over the past few years. Before Elon Musk's space venture came onto the scene, ULA used to be the primary launch provider for national security missions using its Atlas V, Delta VI Heavy, and Vulcan rockets.

Blue Origin, on the other hand, is relatively new to the game. After several delays, the company's New Glenn rocket finally took flight on January 16. Its inaugural launch wasn't a total success; the rocket reached orbit, but its booster was lost during the attempted recovery landing in the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, the rocket is not yet certified to launch Space Force payloads until it completes two successful orbital flights.

New Glenn is scheduled to launch NASA's ESCAPADE (Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers) mission to Mars later this fall. If all goes well, the company will finally be eligible to enter the running for NSSL launches in the upcoming round in 2027.

SpaceX is expected to receive more than half of the total 54 missions, while ULA is set to launch around 19 of the remaining missions. Blue Origin, pending its certification, can launch up to seven missions.

OpenAI's DevDay 2025 featured a major focus on vibe coding. The company, which boasts that it now has more than 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT, announced a variety of new tools for developers during its annual event in San Francisco. Headlining the announcements: the ability to build with apps directly in ChatGPT (including eventually allowing “mature experiences” once age verification is in place) and the introduction of a toolkit that will help users build and deploy their own AI agents.

In OpenAI's apparent effort to turn ChatGPT into a full-on frontend development environment, the company announced its new Apps SDK (Software Development Kit) that will allow devs to pull in supported third-party apps to complete tasks. In a demo, the company showed ChatGPT working with Zillow to generate a map of homes available for sale in Pittsburgh. Zillow created an interactive map based on the prompt, and the user was able to ask additional questions based on the map. The functionality should allow users to create tools using third-party apps, which they can preview directly within ChatGPT.

According to OpenAI, Apps SDK is available immediately for Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans. Support will be available out of the gate for Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow. The company also said that it plans to offer support for DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, and Uber in the near future. For now, users will only be able to make and use the apps in preview, but it plans to allow developers to submit apps later this year, with a directory for apps planned so that developers can share their vibe-based creations.

There are lots of details yet to come regarding what comes from Apps SDK. Altman promised monetization guidelines, for instance, are in the pipeline. Also on the way: “mature experiences.” According to OpenAI's App developer guidelines, “Apps must be suitable for general audiences, including users aged 13–17. Apps may not explicitly target children under 13.” But that won't be the case forever. “Support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place,” it reads.

The company recently introduced age verification tools designed to shift underage users into a ChatGPT experience with much stricter guidelines following a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the company by the family of a teenager who died by suicide after extensive conversations with the chatbot. It appears that once it hammers out those details, it'll open the floodgates to more “adult” functions.

In addition to Apps SDK, the company also rolled out its AgentKit API (Application Programming Interface), which will allow users to build their own agentic AI tools. It's a significant expansion of OpenAI's Agent, which it introduced earlier with the promise that the system could navigate the web autonomously to complete tasks assigned to it by the user.

Sticking with the vibe coding theme, AgentKit's primary feature is its Agent Builder, which allows users to program their AI agent's functionality through a visual interface. Altman described it as being like Canva for building agents, making it more accessible to those who are less technical.

A landmark deal. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


OpenAI and AMD have announced a multibillion-dollar partnership that will see the companies collaborate on AI data centers powered by AMD processors. OpenAI has committed to purchasing 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, starting with the MI450 next year. That will be done either by purchasing the chips directly from AMD or through cloud computing partners. AMD CEO Lisa Su told the WSJ that the deal would generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for AMD over the next five years.

The two companies are not disclosing the exact financial details of the deals. However, AMD emphasized that each ""per gigawatt"" of capacity is worth tens of billions of dollars, so it's possible the deal is worth upwards of $60 billion.

In return, OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, approximately 10% of AMD, at a price of $0.01 per share, to be awarded in phases, provided that OpenAI meets deployment milestones. The warrants will only be exercised if AMD's share price increases, although again, the specifics are unclear.

The deal is an enormous win for AMD and stands juxtaposed with Nvidia's groundbreaking Intel partnership announced last month. Under the terms of that deal, Nvidia and Intel are jointly developing Intel x86 RTX SOCs for PCs featuring Nvidia graphics, as well as custom Nvidia data center x86 processors. Nvidia also received $5 billion in Intel stock as part of the deal.

OpenAI will use AMD's chip for inference in order to cope with skyrocketing demand. ""It's hard to overstate how difficult it's become... We want it super fast, but it takes some time."" OpenAI's Sam Altman said to WSJ.

""We are thrilled to partner with OpenAI to deliver AI compute at massive scale,"" said Dr. Lisa Su, chair and CEO, AMD. ""This partnership brings the best of AMD and OpenAI together to create a true win-win enabling the world's most ambitious AI buildout and advancing the entire AI ecosystem.""

The first deployment will be 1 gigawatt worth of MI450 chips, scheduled for the second half of 2026. Altman said the AI buildout has reached a phase ""where the entire industry's got to come together and everybody's going to do super well,"" not only on chips and data centers, but also further down the supply chain too.

OpenAI has also inked a $100 billion deal with Nvidia, and will use Nvidia's investment to secure and deploy 10 gigawatts worth of AI data centers. While that deal isn't finalized, AMD and OpenAI reportedly say this deal is ""definitive"" and plan to immediately file the requisite details with regulators, a step that has yet to happen in the Nvidia deal.

Xbox Game Pass' painful price hikes aren't tied to a desire by Microsoft to softly exit the gaming hardware market. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft has issued a statement reassuring customers that Xbox is, in fact, here to stay. In response to a gust of rumors stemming from Xbox's much-maligned Game Pass Ultimate price hikes, Xbox has confirmed in a statement to Windows Central that a next-generation Xbox powered by AMD hardware will be coming to market after all.

Microsoft offered the following statement to Windows Central concerning its plans to remain within the hardware space: ""We are actively investing in our future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered and built by Xbox. For more details, the community can revisit our agreement announcement with AMD."" The statement throws cold water on any rumors circulating about a possible Xbox hardware exit, relevant though they may have been.

Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a series of price hikes across the Xbox Game Pass subscription tiers. The tech giant is raising its flagship tier, Game Pass Ultimate, from $19.99 to $29.99 per month, a 50% price increase. The PC Game Pass subscription also saw a 38% price increase from $11.99 to $16.49, with the lower two Game Pass ""Premium"" and ""Essential"" (née Core) tiers remaining at $14.99 and $9.99, respectively.

These price hikes were paired with hardly very little in the way of upgrades or improvements in service to warrant the new costs. Ultimate members are now eligible to receive up to $100 in rewards points ""simply by gaming,"" and Xbox Cloud Gaming has exited beta for all Game Pass subscribers. Additionally, the $30 tier now also includes a free Fortnite Crew paid membership, representing a $12 per month value for Fortnite players.

In response, many online speculators began bandying the idea that the Xbox Game Pass price increases were part of a subtle exit strategy for Microsoft, to squeeze every dollar out of the gaming sector before exiting it for good. However, as Microsoft's statement today reaffirms, this ignores the highly publicized Microsoft/AMD deal from June, where the two companies confirmed that the next-generation Xbox, likely to arrive around the holiday season 2026, will be powered by AMD's hardware.

""I am thrilled to share we have established a strategic multi-year partnership with AMD to co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next-generation Xbox consoles, in your living room, and in your hands,"" said Sarah Bond, president of Xbox at the time. AMD has committed to designing a slew of semi-custom processors for both the next standard console for Xbox, as well as an upcoming Xbox handheld offering, that will remain backwards-compatible with the Scarlett SoC powering the Xbox Series line.

Of course, the future of Xbox will not be a hardware-first venture. Microsoft's heavy investments across the last decade into buying up game studios like Bethesda and Activision/Blizzard, as well as its gamble on Xbox Cloud Gaming, have been touted as the primary wings of the Xbox strategy for the upcoming generation.

AMD fans can perhaps breathe a sigh of relief at the recommittment to a new Xbox generation powered by AMD, though perhaps they've grown used to winning today. Earlier this morning, OpenAI and AMD announced a close partnership where AMD will outfit OpenAI's newest data centers with Instinct MI450 accelerators in a deal that will secure ""tens of billions of dollars"" in revenue for AMD over the next five years, per AMD CEO Lisa Su.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

This compact kit includes all the essential tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx/Torx security, and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer/demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

Scoring the fastest CPU in the world, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, just got a bit cheaper with this fantastic bundle deal.

MSI has some great bundles on offer, and this AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD are all available as a bundle for just $738.99. There are no codes or coupons, but you do need to add the add the 9800X3D and the 2TB Spatium M480 Pro to the combination bundle by selecting them from the drop down menus.

MSI's combo deal pairs the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk with AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and a 2TB Gen 4 PCIe Spatium M480 Pro SSD (you must add the items to the dropdown menu). With unrivaled gaming prowess, the 9800X3D is the ultimate gaming CPU.

These three components typically cost a total of around $907, so this is a steal by any measure. Also, you don't have to select the SSD, so you can trim off around $100 and bring this bundle down to $639.99. This deal won't last long, so make sure to jump on it if you're after the fastest CPU for gaming.

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. 

Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds.

The Crucial P310 2TB is among the best M.2-2230 SSDs that we've ever tested. Earning a four-star mark from our reviewer for its speed and capacity, the P310 2TB is a great pick at list price, and is a must-consider now that it's nearly 50% off. 

The SN770M, our ""portable gaming king"" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class.

For those looking for the absolute cheapest upgrade for a Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, or any other handheld PC, the Kingston NV3 is your pick. Down to its lowest-yet price of $65.80, the budget SSD got solid marks from us (in its longer 2280 trim) for its budget stature, and its price somehow matches those of full-sized M.2 SSDs today. 

The Crucial P310 2TB 2230 has hit its lowest-ever price at $121.99, 49% off the list price. If you don't need that much space, the 1TB WD Black SN770M is 39% off ($85.49), and the 1TB Kingston NV3 at an excellent $65.80.

You can read more details about these drives here.

The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale.

The ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is $50 off, featuring competitive 1080p and 1440p gaming performance with its 4,096 shader cores and 16GB of VRAM.

This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface.

The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. That said, the competition between the two cards is brisk. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off.

The 8TB WD_Black SN850X is a beast of an SSD, offering up more than enough storage for the majority of users. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage.

The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. Make sure to add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to get the total saving.

The SN850X wields the PCIe 4.0 interface, not the newer PCIe 5.0, but that serves up more than enough performance for most casual users. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly.

The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty.

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential.

When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP.

Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. 

 




Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere.

For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM.

MSI's Shadow version of the RTX 5050 boasts twin fans, a clean black fan shroud, four display outputs, and a conveniently placed power connector for easy building and a sharp-looking setup. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build.

If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And the SK hynix Tube T31 is the best flash drive we've tested, thanks in large part to the fact that it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD attached to a USB plug. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage.

A full price Intel's Ultra 9 285K CPU is a tough sell, but at just $489 — $110 off — it becomes a much more enticing proposition. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal.

All-time low price 

The Intel Core Ultra 7 285K is at an all-time low price, finally making it a worthy purchase against the competition. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. 

Here's how the 285K stacks up against some of the top processors on the market right now. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that.

Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an ""Action Ring"" menu. While it's a little heavier than its predecessor, all the signs so far are good, with the MX Master 4 sharing the DNA of the previous model. Imagine our surprise when we woke up and found a $30 discount on this brand new mouse this morning.

A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. 

AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months.

Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. You can peruse the list below and click on the bold blue price text in the table to see the deals:

The weeklong festival showcased 3D printers both old and new, plus new filaments.

I spent last weekend at Maryland's 3DPrintopia, a celebration of all things 3D printing. The event is an eclectic mix of the latest tech, mixed with homebrew 3D printers, merchants, and geeks showing off their latest projects. Over 3000 visitors and hundreds of exhibitors gathered, from big company CEOs to Cub Scouts racing their first 3D printed (not-a-pinewood) derby car.

Started in 2018 as the East Coast RepRap Festival, the event has outgrown the community college basketball court it called home for the last several years. In 2026, 3DPrintopia will move to the massive Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, with 63,000 square feet of space to spread out on.

Prusa Research CEO Josef Průša was seen at the festival, greeting old friends and checking out new makes, printed by fans of his 3D printers. Ryan Reid had quite the showstopper with his COREBot, a battery-powered CORE One printer mounted on remote-controlled treads that could print while being driven around the festival floor.

Later in the festival, Průša announced a new “space age” filament, PC Space Grade Black, which was developed in cooperation with the Czech space company TRL Space. The material is ESD-safe and has low outgassing properties, and can be printed on a CORE One 3D printer. “We shared the spec sheet with our friends from NASA and their reaction for that it's too good to be true,” he said. Here on Earth, the polycarbonate material is useful for 3D printing electronic cases and, in certain applications, can be used as an alternative to the costly and difficult-to-print PEEK.

 




Not everyone wants the latest 3D printer. Jeff from RainMotorsports started printing in 2021, but found the old, wooden-framed Ultimaker Cupcakes fascinating. He picked up one, then another, until finally he brought a van-load of retro 3D printers to 3DPrintopia. He gives them a bit of love and tuning – and new firmware – in order to get them running again. Keep an eye on his new website, ThisOld3dPrinter.com for more on fixing up old machines with modern firmware.

 




David Tobin, Executive Producer for 3D Printing Nerd YouTube channel, has added a new title to his name: Shoe Designer. David showed off a pair of shoes that he designed and is selling on the Zellerfeld platform, a German company that manufactures 3D-printed shoes with custom TPU pellet-fed FDM printers.

“You've seen 3D printed shoes, they're zany, they're wild. I didn't want any of that,"" Tobin said. ""I wanted to use additive manufacturing for functionality. I wanted these to be shoes that you could wear and no one knows you're wearing 3D printed shoes.” His shoes are designed with skateboarding in mind, have plenty of air flow, and are also machine washable. (Just keep them out of the dryer.)

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Unlike other 3D printed shoes we've been seeing around convention halls in 2025, these are professionally 3D printed by Zellerfeld, which also makes the NIKE Air Max 1000. The website has dozens of designs, from sandals to sneakers, all custom printed to fit your foot. Zellerfeld also welcomes new designers to join the platform and gives detailed instructions on how to digitally cobble a perfect pair of TPU shoes.

CookieCAD launched “CookieCAD Cares” at the event, an initiative to support accessibility and inclusion in the 3D printing community. Co-owner Melissa Kaye said CookieCad will kick off 2025 by donating 500 spools of colorful filament to partner organizations like MakeGood, the Controller Project and the Sanjay Mortimer Foundation. She said the company has plans to increase donations as more partners join the program.

Controller Project founder Caleb Kraft said accessibility tools too often look medical and boring. CookieCAD makes PLA, PETG, ABS, and TPU in fun, sparkly colors, which is even more important for MakeGood, which creates kids' mobility devices. Philip Dunham, a designer from MakeGood, said it's amazing how modern 3D printers allow him to print customized adaptive devices for users that would never be commercially viable with injection molding.

At the CookieCad booth, Dunham showed off a fully 3D printed toddler mobility trainer printed in bright pink PETG with a neon yellow TPU seat and wheels.

To apply to become a CookieCAD Cares partner, organizations must be a registered nonprofit, community-based group, or accredited school. For more information, go to Cares.Cookiecad.com.

 




The HueForge team announced a new feature of its amazing “painting with filament” app called “FlatForge”. The $15 plugin will allow uses to unlock the power of multicolor machines and create prints that are smooth to the touch. No longer limited to just stacking layers of filament, the new technique can put several colors on the same layer. It can be used by Bambu AMS-style systems, or tool changers like the Prusa XL and Snapmaker U1.

The new method allows users to print face down on holographic plates or print thin, doubled-sided items like bookmarks. They can also be more easily added to the top of ordinary 3D prints.

 




The Positron Team announced a new 3D printer project dubbed the Proton. The compact foldable printer will have a much larger 300 x 260 x 260 mm build volume. The printer is still under development and will be updated with full nozzle probing, an all-metal heat break, the flexibility to support several brands of boards, and be run from a USB-C power bank.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Developer recreates classic shoot 'em up Zaxxon as a UEFI firmware — isometric arcade game coded in x86 assembly for no-OS represents 'total freedom from big tech'","https://www.tomshardware.com/software/programming/developer-recreates-classic-shoot-em-up-zaxxon-as-a-uefi-firmware-isometric-arcade-game-coded-in-x86-assembly-for-no-os-represents-total-freedom-from-big-tech","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:58:50 GMT","

There have been other UEFI games, but this is the first complete arcade game designed to boot directly as firmware. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Inkbox Software has released a recreation of a beloved isometric arcade game that runs directly from a PC's Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Moreover, they coded their version of Zaxxon (1982) in x86-64 Assembly language, and have generously released it as open source under the GPLv3 license. There have been prior UEFI games and apps, but they are often incomplete or limited demos, and run within the UEFI as payloads, rather than booting directly to the game.

In the above video, Inkbox explains the reason they decided to begin this classic arcade gaming UEFI coding quest. In brief, our assembly coding hero says that they were “so tired of operating systems holding me back,” and that they wanted their hardware to run a classic game as it was meant to be played. That means “Written in assembly, without an operating system,” asserts Inkbox. “This is total freedom from big tech. Reject OS, Return to metal.”

Of course, there are significant hurdles to creating a handsome and responsive Zaxxon port for a PC UEFI. You can learn how Inkbox navigated this difficult path in their extensive and in-depth, yet engrossing video.

As if assembly coding wasn't tricky enough, the developer battled through UEFI limitations regarding timings, keyboard input, and graphic output. For example, the default UEFI keyboard was described as “absolutely garbage for game input,” by Inkbox, as it has a built-in delay, which is terrible for gaming. So a responsive mouse/joystick control was devised. For graphics, an engine had to be coded to replicate a retro console Picture Processing Unit (PPU).

Such wrinkles were eventually ironed out, though, and the video ends with a demo of the assembly-coded OS-less Zaxxon remake running at a buttery-smooth 128FPS. There is no sound in the game, though.

This game “will run on any x86_64 machine,” says Inkbox, as long as it supports UEFI. Further details about getting this Zaxxon game up and running are available on the Space Game for x64 GitHub, alongside the code and other resources.

Miriam E. Tucker

 October 06, 2025  

Vienna — The investigational monoclonal antibody trevogrumab was associated with lean mass preservation and greater loss of fat mass in people taking semaglutide, an interim trial data showed.

Findings from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's ongoing phase 2 COURAGE trial were presented at European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2025 Annual Meeting by Ofri Mosenzon, MD, of the company. The trial also included an arm of another antibody, garetosmab, which was associated with significant side effects.

Both trevogrumab and garetosmab are fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibodies developed to block key negative regulators of muscle mass, myostatin, and activin A, respectively.

Top-line results from COURAGE were previously announced in June 2025.

Loss of lean mass occurs during weight loss, regardless of the method. In studies, incretin-based treatments, including semaglutide, liraglutide, and tirzepatide have been associated with 15%-45% of total weight loss as lean body mass, with muscle mass being a substantial proportion of that, Mosenzon said.

“Preservation of lean mass is important for strength and physical function, energy expenditure, and glucose homeostasis. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a weight management therapy that preserves lean mass while promoting greater fat loss,” she added.

Indeed, session co-moderator Roman Vangoitsenhoven, MD, PhD, told Medscape Medical News, “There's a lot of excitement around the efforts to preserve muscle mass. Several approaches sound promising, although there are also side effects like muscle twitching with some of the molecules. We anxiously await further human trials to see what will be the effect size and the tolerability.”

Regarding trevogrumab in particular, Vangoitsenhoven, assistant professor of medicine at KU Leuven and staff endocrinologist at University Hospitals Leuven, both in Leuven, Belgium, commented, “I don't think we have seen enough data to be able to say this one is far more promising than the others…I think to be able to say what it really means for the clinic, we need the phase 3 trials.”

In the three-part ongoing COURAGE trial, 605 adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) without diabetes were randomized to receive subcutaneous semaglutide titrated up to 2.4 mg weekly alone, or in combination with weekly subcutaneous trevogrumab 200 mg, trevogrumab 400 mg, or a triple combination of semaglutide 2.4 mg, trevogrumab 400 mg, and intravenous garetosmab 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks, with matching placebos.

Participants had a mean age of about 49 years, about two thirds were women, and 20% were Black individuals. At baseline, they had a mean body weight of 102 kg and BMI of 36.7, 44.7 kg of total fat mass and 53.1 kg of total lean mass.

At 26 weeks, DEXA results showed that semaglutide alone was associated with a 6.5% reduction from baseline in lean body mass compared with just 3.3% with semaglutide + trevogrumab 200 mg, 3.8% with semaglutide + trevogrumab 400 mg, and 2.0% for the triple semaglutide + trevogrumab + garetosmab. The differences between semaglutide alone and the other three groups were all significant (P < .0001).

“So we can definitely say here that lean mass was preserved with trevogrumab with or without garetosmab compared to semaglutide therapy alone therapy,” Mosenzon said.

Percent loss from baseline in total fat mass was 27.1% for the triple combination, 19.1% for semaglutide + trevogrumab 400 mg, 17.3% for semaglutide + trevogrumab 200 mg, and 15.7% for semaglutide alone (P = .0001 and P = .0069 for the triple combination and semaglutide + trevogrumab 400 mg, respectively).

The semaglutide alone and semaglutide plus trevogrumab in both doses all lost about 10% of their total body weight, while the triple combination had a 13.4% weight reduction (P = .0003).

The semaglutide group lost 6.7 kg of fat mass and 3.3 kg of lean mass. By contrast, the dual combination with trevogrumab 200 mg lost 7.6 kg and 1.5 kg, respectively, and the dual trevogrumab 400 mg combination lost 8.5 kg and 1.9 kg, respectively. The triple combination produced losses of 11.8 kg fat mass and 0.9 kg lean mass.

“That means a difference of 2.7 kg in body mass loss on top of their better composition,” Mosenzon said.

Numerical improvements were also seen with trevogrumab in metabolic parameters including waist circumference, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipid parameters including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, in all treatment groups.

Adverse event rates for the dual combinations were similar to those seen with semaglutide alone. However, serious adverse events were higher with the triple combination, 14 vs one each for semaglutide alone and combined with trevogrumab 200 mg, and two with semaglutide and the higher dose of trevogrumab. There were two deaths in the triple combination group.

Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 4.6% with semaglutide alone, 4.7% for semaglutide + trevogrumab 200 mg, and 10.6% for semaglutide + trevogrumab 400 mg compared with 30.9% with the triple combination. The most common adverse event occurring in 10% or more of study participants was muscle spasm, occurring in 4.6%, 6.1%, and 9.3%, respectively, compared with 40.9%.

The COURAGE trial is expected to complete in late 2026.

Regeneron is just one of several manufacturers developing drugs to combat muscle loss associated with GLP-1-induced weight loss. On September 25, 2025, Eli Lilly announced that it was halting a phase 2b trial of its candidate agent, bimagrumab, in combination with tirzepatide in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes for “strategic business reasons,” but it is continuing another phase 2 trial of the agent in people with overweight or obesity who do not have diabetes.

On September 23, 2025, Veru announced a successful meeting with the FDA “providing regulatory clarity” for its selective androgen receptor modulator enobosarm, currently in phase 2 trials for muscle preservation in combination with GLP-1s.

ScholarRock reported positive phase 2 results for its myostatin inhibitor apitegromab in June 2025, but the drug hit a snag in September, when the FDA declined to approve it for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy.

Vangoitsenhoven told Medscape Medical News that several issues are yet to be worked out with all of these as they move forward, including when they should be used and in whom. “Might these be something that we give during the intensive weight loss phase but not necessarily as maintenance therapy? This is an open question.”

He also noted, “increasingly people are in favor of looking more into muscle function than muscle mass. And there, we know as clinicians that if people are able to lose, say, 15 kg, they might be able to go to the gym [to build muscle]…My gut feeling is that would be a good approach.”

And he pointed out that the loss of muscle mass may be of greater concern for some individuals than others. “A 40-year-old woman with a BMI of 45 going on a GLP-1 and losing a bit of muscle mass is not as bad as, let's say, a 75 year-old with a BMI of 33. There is a huge heterogeneity in the people starting on GLP-1s.”

This trial was funded by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Mosenzon reported being an employee of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Vangoitsenhoven reported being a clinical investigator for Amgen, Bayer, Eli Lilly, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Novo Nordisk, Roche; he reported serving or has served on speaker's bureau or advisory board for Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Goodlife Pharma, Novo Nordisk, Prowell, Sanofi; Any financial compensation for these activities has been received by the institution (UZ/KU Leuven).

Critically ill patients with polymicrobial bloodstream infections had comparable 90-day all-cause mortality to those with monomicrobial infections, irrespective of whether potential contaminants were excluded. Other clinical and microbiological outcomes remained similar between groups.

""Our findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that the presence of multiple bloodstream pathogens is not an independent driver of mortality in the ICU,"" the investigators reported.

""Consequently, in contemporary ICU settings with established treatment protocols and timely empiric broad-spectrum therapy, clinicians should not automatically anticipate poorer outcomes solely based on the detection of multiple pathogens,"" they added.

This study was led by Anselm Jorda, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. It was published online on September 24, 2025, in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

Because the study was retrospective, residual confounding and bias cannot be ruled out. Although no major differences were observed in primary and secondary outcomes, the study may have been underpowered to detect small effects or rare complications. Results could not be stratified on the basis of infection source or pathogen type, and the findings from ICUs in tertiary care may not be generalisable to other healthcare settings.

This study received internal funding. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest relevant to this work.

A Franco-Swiss study examined the determinants of patient-perceived physician empathy (PPPE) and found that three key factors shape how patients with chronic conditions perceive physician empathy: consultation length, frequency of visits, and type of diagnosis. 

In clinical practice, empathy refers to understanding and reflecting on a patient's emotional state while maintaining constructive discussions about care. Physician empathy has been linked to better clinical outcomes, improved prescribing practices, stronger therapeutic alliances, patient satisfaction, adherence, and reduced healthcare costs. These benefits occur only if empathy is perceived by the patient, making perception central to its impact. 

Clinical empathy involves active listening centered on the patient, enabling them to feel understood while remaining constructive and positive, and discussing a care plan or actions together. This skill is now regarded as essential in daily practice. However, its benefits are only realized when empathy is perceived by the patient. 

The study enrolled 50 physicians and 762 consecutive adult patients with at least one chronic condition, between February 2019 and January 2020. Researchers recorded physician and work environment data, including gender, age, practice setting, and caseloads. 

Physicians filled in patients' diseases, and patients filled in validated self-reported questionnaires on their health, emotional skills — such as the ability to identify, express, and regulate emotions — and their perception of 10 physician empathic behaviors, measured using the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) scale, a 10-item, 5-point Likert scale that provides an overall score, with a higher score indicating higher empathy.

The mean CARE score was 45 on a scale of 10-50, indicating high overall empathy ratings. However, several factors influenced these results.

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) has issued comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV). The new guideline, published in Kidney International, integrates evidence from randomized controlled trials through August 2024 and reflects the rapid pace of advances in glomerular disease research. The treatment landscape for IgA-driven kidney disease is changing quickly on the strength of new clinical findings.

“The new IgAN KDIGO guidelines are an important step forward in the care of individuals with IgA nephropathy,” said guideline co-author Brad H. Rovin, MD, professor of medicine and pathology, Lee A. Hebert Professor of Nephrology, and director at The Wexner Medical Center for Clinical Research Management in Columbus, Ohio. “In response to new data from registry studies looking at kidney failure due to IgAN, the guidelines suggest treatment should begin earlier than we have in the past, when proteinuria is at least 500 mg/d.”

IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease and a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. IgAV, historically known as Henoch-Schönlein purpura, also carries significant risk for kidney damage, especially in children. A key advance in the guideline is the dual focus on both preventing or reducing IgA-containing immune complex (IgA-IC) formation and limiting IgA-IC injury, while treating complications of IgAN-related damage such as glomerular hyperfiltration and hypertension.

Treatment goals have been revised to a lower proteinuria level of ≤ 500 mg/d and to slow the decline in kidney function to ≤ 1 mL/min/1.73 m2.

“Given the plethora of new therapies approved or in trial for IgAN, the revised guidelines provide a framework for integrating these treatments into daily care,” Rovin told Medscape Medical News. “Some of the newly approved therapies target the presumptive immunopathogenesis of IgAN, while others target the consequences of nephron loss due to IgAN.”

New recommendations include optimizing the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for all appropriate patients, using targeted-release budesonide (nefecon) in those at risk for progressive loss of kidney function, and employing newer agents such as sparsentan (a dual endothelin-angiotensin receptor antagonist) and SGLT2 inhibitors to mitigate IgAN-induced nephron loss. The guideline also provides direction for special situations, including IgAN with nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury, or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

Most patients are expected to benefit from simultaneous treatment of immunologic drivers of nephron loss and therapies that slow progression due to prior nephron loss.

“This framework is critical because the changes in the IgAN treatment landscape have been profound and difficult to keep up with,” Rovin said. “The guidelines also allow us to efficiently add in new therapies to the treatment algorithm as they are approved.”

The update emphasizes preserving kidney function by intervening earlier and treating to lower proteinuria thresholds, approaches likely to significantly reduce progression to kidney failure. With newly approved options, slowing estimated glomerular filtration rate decline may directly improve kidney survival.

“The guidelines attempt to put the IgAN therapeutic landscape into perspective and provide a rationale of what could be used and where it acts in the IgAN pathway,” Rovin said. “Because trials and new treatments have come so rapidly to the nephrology community, there has been considerable confusion about the new drugs, and when and how to use them.”

The guideline includes additional advice for pregnancy planning and pediatric management. It also highlights treatment disparities. Many regions with the highest prevalence of IgAN, such as Asia, remain underrepresented in trials and face barriers to accessing newly approved therapies. KDIGO emphasizes the need for equity so that advances benefit all patients, not just those in resource-rich settings.

“These guidelines are important to standardize care globally and are inclusive of all ages, with specific mention of children,” said Louise Oni, MBChB, MRCPCH, MA, PhD, senior lecturer in pediatric nephrology at the University of Liverpool in Liverpool, England. “They can be adapted for country-specific implementation to make them suitable for their local environment.”

KDIGO previously published its first guideline devoted to hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease in 2008, with several others since, including a broad glomerular diseases guideline in 2021.

Recognizing the rapid pace of discovery in IgA-related disease, KDIGO plans ongoing updates to the new guideline as data and approvals evolve. Under the new framework, these conditions are no longer managed with a single approach but with a toolkit of therapies.

“The treatment landscape for IgA-related glomerulonephritis is transforming,” Oni told Medscape Medical News. “There remains a delay in getting evidence for children; however, there is now a global effort to accelerate this progress so we can champion an equitable specialty.”

Kartik Kalra, MD, clinical associate and the nephrology fellowship co-director at the Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania, called the new guideline a pivotal advance.

“By integrating the latest data from multiple randomized trials and emphasizing a dual therapeutic strategy, targeting both immune complex formation (disease modification) and maladaptive responses of the kidney to nephron loss (foundational therapies), the guideline empowers physicians to personalize care and intervene earlier,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Kalra added that with novel agents such as targeted-release budesonide, sparsentan, and SGLT2 inhibitors, the field is shifting from traditional approaches to a dynamic, multi-modal paradigm targeting disease pathogenesis.

“This update is not just timely, it's essential for improving outcomes and equity in kidney care worldwide,” Kalra said. “I'm eager to see more long-term clinical trial data in IgA nephropathy, especially those focusing on disease modification. Advancements in targeted therapies could significantly improve outcomes for patients with progressive forms of the disease.”

The guidelines listed the financial disclosures for each member of the panel. Oni and Kalra reported no financial disclosures.

Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) offers patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) an effective alternative to the standard of care surgery — with significantly fewer severe complications in the short-term.

The stereotactic ablative radiotherapy vs surgery for stage I NSCLC (STARS) trial showed similar efficacy with SABR vs video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in this patient group at 10 years, according to data presented by senior author Joe Y. Chang, MD, PhD, a professor of thoracic radiation oncology and director of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston at American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2025 Annual Meeting in San Francisco.

The findings are welcome in a cancer patient group that is typically diagnosed at age 71, an age when many have several comorbidities that would make surgical resection impossible or very difficult, said Chang. Surgical complications are significant even for operable cases. However, surgery provides pathologic staging that SABR cannot offer, which remains an important consideration in guiding treatment, he said.

“Our study confirms, based on a decade of data, that stereotactic radiotherapy is a strong alternative to surgery for most patients with operable stage I NSCLC,” Chang said. “This highly targeted, noninvasive treatment achieved the same long-term overall survival [OS] as lobectomy, while offering many patients an easier recovery and potentially better quality of life.”

Chang noted that the two treatments provide comparable results for tumors < 3 cm. However, data suggests that SABR is less effective for larger tumors, particularly those > 5 cm.

“If tumors are > 3 cm, particularly > 5 cm, we always say if surgery can remove it, go for it.”

Tumor location can also be a deciding factor in treatment. SABR can't be used for tumors close to the heart, esophagus, or major vessels, Chang said.

SABR is a highly precise radiation technique that delivers very high doses to small, well-defined tumors in just a few sessions, while sparing surrounding healthy tissue. The noninvasive treatment offers excellent local control and minimal recovery time. Its downsides include that it does not provide pathologic staging and comes with a risk for recurrence near critical structures, an ASTRO site for patients says.

VATS with lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection (VATS L-MLND), was the specific approach used for patients who received surgery in the STARS trial. It combines minimally invasive lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection, offering definitive tumor removal and staging with less pain and faster recovery than open surgery, though it still carries operative risks and requires surgical fitness. The treatment provides thorough tumor and lymph node removal with proven long-term survival and faster recovery than open surgery, but it remains invasive, requires surgical candidacy, and carries risks for complications, according to NCCN guidelines.

The researchers found no significant difference between SABR and VATS L-MLND at 10 years follow-up for OS, the primary outcome of the STARS trial. OS was 69% and 66% for SABR and VATS L-MLND, respectively (P = .4). Cancer-specific survival was 92% and 89% (P = .9), and recurrence-free survival was 57% and 65% for SABR and VATS-MLND (P = .6).

Eighty patients with early-stage NSCLC, defined as tumor size < 3 cm with no lymph node or distant metastasis, were enrolled and treated as outpatients with SABR using focused radiotherapy for 15 minutes per session per day for 3-4 days. These patients were propensity score matched to 80 patients from the VATS surgical cohort, using a multivariable logistic regression model that controlled for potential confounding factors, including age, tumor size, histology, performance status, and the interaction of age and sex as covariates. (Propensity matching is a statistical method that pairs patients with similar characteristics across treatment groups so outcomes can be compared more fairly, as if they had been randomly assigned.)

The rate of moderate-to-severe short-term complications was greater with surgery than with SABR — 50% vs 1%.

Quality of life and financial burden of surviving patients at 10 years were comparable between those who received SABR and those who underwent VATS. These were measured by the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, Version 2 (a patient survey measuring physical and mental health) and the comprehensive score for financial toxicity tool, a validated questionnaire of patients' experiences with the costs of cancer care.

Press briefing moderator Kenneth Rosenzweig, MD, reacted positively to the results.

“If there's a patient for one reason or another who isn't a good candidate for surgery, [SABR is an] excellent option that's going to be equally as effective,” said Rosenzweig, who is the chair of the ASTRO Annual Meeting Scientific Committee and the chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

Given comparable outcomes with SABR and VATS L-MLND, Chang said the current standard of care should be multidisciplinary management with discussion to talk about the advantages and limitations of both modalities.

Research on molecular biomarkers-based personalized SBRT is an important next step, Change added.

This study was funded in part by Varian Medical Systems and the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute.

Chang reported receiving research grants from Bristol Myers Squibb, Siemens, and AstraZeneca. Rosenzweig reported that he had no relevant financial disclosures.

A 65-year-old man with interstitial lung disease due to mixed connective tissue disease, chronic cough, prior pleurodesis, and coronary artery disease developed a massive mediastinal haematoma with haemodynamic instability following an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendicectomy for gangrenous appendicitis.

Postoperatively, he experienced acute right-sided chest pain, haemoptysis, hypotension, and tachycardia.

ECG showed no abnormalities, and the diagnosis was established by chest radiography, contrast-enhanced CT, and angiography.

A case report by surgeon Abanoub Awad and colleagues at the Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic Health System, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, documented the first hemomediastinum after appendicectomy in a patient with preexisting pulmonary disease.

The patient presented to the emergency department with interstitial lung disease secondary to undifferentiated connective tissue disorder, mild coronary artery disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chronic postnasal congestion, chronic cough, and a chronic pleural effusion status post pleurodesis.

The patient underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy for gangrenous appendicitis without intraoperative complications.

During recovery in the postanaesthesia care unit, he developed acute right-sided chest pain and haemoptysis, followed by hypotension and tachycardia.

There was a haemoglobin drop from 16.2 g/dL preoperatively to 13.2 g/dL. CT of the chest revealed a large right upper-mediastinal haematoma with active contrast extravasation. Interventional radiology (IR) embolised the bleeding vessel.

ECG showed no abnormalities, including no ST-segment elevations. Haemoglobin decreased from 16.2 g/dL preoperatively to 13.2 g/dL.

Chest x-ray showed upper mediastinal widening. CT of the chest showed a large right upper-mediastinal haematoma with active extravasation of uncertain origin. As hypotension worsened, transfusion was required. Diagnostic angiography identified active haemorrhage originating from branches of the supreme intercostal artery.

Subsequent subselective angiography using a Renegade Microcatheter identified active bleeding from a branch, likely the second intercostal artery. Two Hilal coils were used for embolisation, and haemostasis was confirmed through angiography. The next day, due to persistent hypotension and intermittent airway bleeding, he was taken back to the IR for a right bronchial artery angiogram.

The angiogram showed an irregular segment, likely the source of haemoptysis; this was embolised with glue. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for evacuation of the haematoma.

“This case report presents the first known case of post-appendicectomy intrathoracic bleeding in the form of hemomediastinum, emphasising the need for heightened awareness of potential unusual complications in patients with predisposing conditions. Even routine procedures can present unexpected challenges, particularly in vulnerable patient populations,” the authors wrote.

A familiar allergy spray may do more than ease sneezing, researchers find azelastine could help block COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, pointing to an accessible new line of defense. 

 Study: Azelastine Nasal Spray for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock.com

Variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, continue to emerge almost six years after its initial emergence. A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine discusses the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to placebo.

Azelastine is a nasal antihistamine spray widely used to manage allergic rhinitis. Recent studies suggest that it exhibits antiviral activity in vitro against several respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2; however, its clinical efficacy remains unclear.

These antiviral effects may arise following previously reported interactions between azelastine and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is primarily used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into cells. Other studies suggest that azelastine treatment inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme, which mediates viral attachment to the host cell. Azelastine also appears to induce changes in the σ-1 receptor and inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression.

Previous small randomized trials suggest that azelastine reduces the viral load in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus suggesting its potential effectiveness as a preventive. The present study explored the effectiveness and safety of azelastine nasal spray for reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The current study was a single-center, phase II randomized controlled trial comparing the use of azelastine nasal spray with placebo in 450 individuals. The mean age of the study participants was 33 years, most of whom were female and White.

Women of reproductive age were included only if they were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding and/or were using reliable contraception. A significant majority of study participants received one or more COVID-19 vaccinations, with the cohort receiving a median of three shots. In most cases, the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered two years before the current study began.

Study participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.1% azelastine or placebo nasal spray three times every day for a total of eight weeks. Notably, this dose of azelastine exceeds the twice daily use that is typically prescribed to manage moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.

Study participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid antigen tests (RAT) twice weekly throughout the study period, and any positive test result was subsequently confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Study participants who experienced respiratory symptoms but tested negative by RAT also underwent a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

The azelastine group was less likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection than controls at 2% and 6.7%, respectively. This observation indicates that azelastine reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by about 70%.

Azelastine treatment also delayed the time to infection by 12 days as compared to the placebo group. Symptomatic COVID-19 infections were less likely in the azelastine group, with azelastine recipients remaining positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 1.7 days less than the control group, as assessed by self-reported RAT.  

Even in times of higher exposure rates, fewer infections per exposure occurred under treatment compared with placebo.”

Aside from COVID-19, rhinovirus infections were the most common infection reported among study participants. Azelastine treatment was similarly found to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections, with 2% of recipients infected as compared to 6% in the placebo group.

Overall, respiratory infections, as detected by PCR, affected 9% of the azelastine group as compared to 22% of controls. Participants who had antibodies indicating prior SARS-CoV-2 infection showed somewhat lower odds of testingpositive again, suggesting that baseline immune status modestly inflenced infection risk.

Importantly, adverse events were similar in overall frequency between groups but more commonly considered treatment-related in the azelastine group. However, most of these reactions were minor and well-known side effects like bitter taste, nosebleeds, and fatigue.

These findings support the potential of azelastine as a safe prophylactic approach warranting confirmation in larger, multicentric trials.”

The overall rate of new viral infections was low, thus indicating that azelastine may have broad antiviral activity. In particular, azelastine conferred protection against symptomatic rhinovirus infection, which may arise due to inhibition of the rhinovirus receptor ICAM-1. The authors noted that this is one of the first clinical trials to show reduced rhinovirus infection rates following a single therapy. 

Azelastine is a safe, easily available, and convenient approach for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be easily used in high-risk settings like public meetings or during travel. Nevertheless, the researchers cautioned that the study's single-center design, modest sample size, and potential unblinding due to azelastine's bitter taste limit generalizability. They also acknowledged that the placebo formulation itself could have had mild protective effects by stabilizing the nasal barrier. 

The study was funded by Ursapharm Arzneimittel GmbH, the manufacturer of azelastine nasal spray, and conducted in collaboration with Saarland University researchers. Despite these promising findings, larger trials must be conducted to validate these observations and explore the potential utility of azelastine for other respiratory viruses.

New research reveals that inflammatory responses may play a role in different types of fatigue experienced by many people with cancer. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Cancer-related fatigue can be a distressing and persistent burden that causes patients to feel physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion. Activation of inflammatory responses by the tumor itself and/or by cancer treatment is thought to be a key biological driver of this symptom, but inflammatory activity across the cancer continuum has not been thoroughly examined.

To investigate, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) analyzed protein markers of inflammation in 192 women with early-stage breast cancer who were examined before radiation or chemotherapy and throughout the 18 months after treatment. At each assessment, women reported on different dimensions of fatigue (general, physical, mental, and emotional) and provided blood that was tested for protein markers of inflammation. These included two pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and two downstream markers of their activity (sTNF-RII and CRP).

Higher levels of TNF-α, sTNF-RII, and IL-6 were linked with greater general fatigue, which involves feelings of tiredness and exhaustion. These effects remained even after accounting for age, race, education, body mass index, and cancer stage. Similarly, there was a positive association between physical fatigue, which involves feelings of physical weakness and heaviness, and TNF-α, sTNF-RII, and CRP. Conversely, higher levels of TNF-α and sTNF-RII were associated with lower levels of emotional fatigue. No significant associations between mental (or cognitive) fatigue and inflammatory markers were found.

Our findings indicate that inflammation plays a role in some aspects of cancer-related fatigue, but not others, and that these effects persist well after treatment. This is critical for developing targeted treatments for this common and disabling symptom.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study shows c-Kit–expressing sweet cells are central to taste bud regeneration after nerve injury","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251006/Study-shows-c-Kite28093expressing-sweet-cells-are-central-to-taste-bud-regeneration-after-nerve-injury.aspx","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 16:14:00 GMT","

Taste is one of our most vital senses, shaping appetite, nutrition, and quality of life. Yet taste buds are fragile, relying heavily on the nerves that connect them to the brain. When those nerves are cut or damaged, taste buds usually deteriorate - but later regenerate as nerves regrow. How this recovery occurs has remained unclear. 

Now, a study led by Dr. Dong-Hoon Kim and Professor Yong Taek Jeong at Korea University College of Medicine, published in the International Journal of Oral Science on September 10, 2025, reveals the key players in this process. The team discovered that sweet-sensing taste cells survive nerve injury thanks to a protein called c-Kit - and that these cells are essential for taste bud regeneration.

Using mouse models and taste bud organoids, the researchers showed that when c-Kit signaling was blocked with the cancer drug imatinib (Gleevec), the surviving sweet cells disappeared. Without these cells, other taste cells failed to regenerate, proving that c-Kit signaling underpins both survival and recovery.

To understand the significance of these findings and what they mean for everyday taste, the researchers spoke about their work in more detail.

Q: What do your findings reveal about taste buds?
Prof. Jeong explained, ""Our taste buds are made up of various cells that detect different flavors like sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami. It's long been known that these taste buds are closely connected to our taste nerves, as they are where the initial taste signals are formed before being sent to the brain.""

Jeong's team confirmed what scientists have known for decades - that when the nerves to a taste bud are cut, the bud degenerates and later regenerates as the nerves regrow. But their study advanced this understanding by showing that the extent of degeneration and recovery depends on the type of taste cell involved, with sweet-sensing cells proving far more resilient than other types. This helps explain everyday changes in taste - for example, during a common cold, when some taste qualities fade faster than others because the underlying taste cells adapt differently.

Q: How did you test resilience and what else did you discover about recovery?

""We used nerve transection in mice to mimic injury and found that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells consistently survived. In organoid cultures, these cells continued to grow even when survival factors were withdrawn. But when we blocked c-Kit with imatinib, the surviving sweet cells disappeared and regeneration was delayed.

We also discovered that it's not just sweet cells that matter. Some Type III cells acquired stem-like properties, helping repair the epithelial lining around taste buds. This shows that multiple cell types are involved in recovery - c-Kit+ sweet cells lead regeneration, while Type III cells contribute to repair,"" Prof. Jeong said.

Q: What could this mean for the future of taste research?
""This is the first discovery that allows us to selectively control specific types of taste cells. While it does not immediately translate into treatment, it provides a foundation for future work on taste resilience and recovery. In the long term, this could guide new approaches to improving nutrition, supporting patients with taste disorders, and even advancing flavor science. By identifying c-Kit as a key factor in sweet cell survival, we now have a building block for more precise control over taste,"" Jeong noted.

This study shows that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells are central to taste bud regeneration after nerve injury, with Type III cells also contributing through repair. By identifying c-Kit as a protective factor, the research explains why some taste qualities persist longer than others and lays the groundwork for future efforts to selectively control taste.

Results from a randomized clinical trial published in Pediatrics show that pediatricians who received targeted educational and clinical decision-support tools were significantly more likely to advise parents to introduce peanut-containing foods early – an approach recommended by national prevention guidelines but often underused in practice.

About 8% of U.S. children have food allergies. Peanut allergy, the most common pediatric food allergy, affects more than 2% of children nationwide.

We found that supporting pediatricians with training, electronic health record prompts, and educational materials for parents significantly improved their ability to counsel families on early peanut introduction.""

Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, lead author, pediatrician and researcher at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

""Because pediatric visits at four and six months are so busy, this support is critical to ensure families receive clear guidance,"" Dr. Gupta added. ""Our hope is that these conversations will help parents feel confident introducing peanut products early. We want to reverse the trend of increasing food allergies in the U.S. through prevention.""

The randomized trial included 30 pediatric practices in the Chicago and Peoria regions, spanning federally qualified health centers, private clinics, and academic practices. Intervention practices received a clinician training video, an electronic health record (HER)-embedded decision-support tool, and visual aids for parents; control practices did not. The primary outcome was clinician adherence to guidelines, documented in EHR data at the four- or six-month well-child visit. In total, 18,480 infants were seen by 290 clinicians.

Lucy Bilaver, PhD, lead statistician for the study and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, noted the importance of leveraging EHR data for this pragmatic trial. ""We were able to measure the primary outcome by making use of the clinical notes and structured data that pediatric clinicians generate during these well-child visits.""

Among low-risk infants, guideline adherence was 84% in the intervention group versus 35% in controls. For high-risk infants, adherence was 27% in the intervention group versus 10% in controls.

""While more work is needed, the success of this intervention supports wider dissemination to prevent peanut allergy in children,"" said Dr. Gupta.

Dr. Gupta holds the Mary Ann and J. Milburn Smith Research Professorship for a Sr. Scientist in Child Health Research at Lurie Children's.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID U01AI138907).

Inhalers are the frontline treatment for asthma and COPD, but they come with a steep environmental cost, according to a new UCLA Health study - the largest to date quantifying inhaler-related emissions in the United States.

Researchers found that inhalers have generated over 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually over the past decade, equivalent to the emissions of roughly 530,000 gas-powered cars on the road each year.

The study, published in JAMA, analyzed emissions from the three types of inhalers approved for asthma or COPD from 2014 to 2024. It found that metered-dose inhalers were the most harmful to the environment, accounting for 98 percent of emissions over the ten-year period. Metered-dose inhalers contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which are potent greenhouse gases that were widely used in products such as aerosol sprays. The other types of inhalers, which include dry inhalers and soft powder mist inhalers, are less harmful to the environment as they deliver medication to the lungs without the need for propellants.

Inhalers add to the growing carbon footprint of the US healthcare system, putting many patients with chronic respiratory disease at risk. On the upside, there is tremendous opportunity to make changes that protect both patients and the planet by utilizing lower-emission alternatives.""

Dr. William Feldman, pulmonologist and health services researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and study's lead author

Researchers conducted the study using a comprehensive U.S. database capturing inhaler prescriptions at the National Drug Code (NDC) level. Emissions were then estimated using validated academic studies and analyzed by drug type, device type, propellant type, therapeutic class, branded status, manufacturer, payer, and pharmacy benefit manager.

Researchers plan to expand their research to examine inhaler-related emissions in specific patient populations, such as the Medicaid population. They will also compare clinical outcomes between of lower- and higher-emission inhalers in the same therapeutic class and explore pricing and patenting strategies that pharmaceutical companies may use as they roll out lower-emission inhaler technologies. 

""A key first step to driving change is understanding the true scale of the problem,"" Feldman said. ""From there, we can identify what's fueling these emissions and develop targeted strategies to reduce them-benefiting both patients and the environment.""

International Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW) takes place globally from October 6-10. The week encourages communities around the world to recognize the vital role of plasma in creating lifesaving medicines and honors those who donate. A new survey has found that 72% of respondents agree that plasma-derived medicines can save lives, yet most have not donated plasma.

The survey asked over 1,000 American adults questions about their understanding of plasma donation and lifesaving plasma-derived medicines. Plasma, a component of blood, is essential in producing treatments for a variety of serious health conditions, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, severe burns, and more. It is also used in everyday health care settings, such as during surgeries, childbirth, and organ transplants. 

The need for plasma-derived medicines continues to rise as science reveals new uses and indications, as advances in standards of care expand their role in treatment. With hundreds of thousands of patients around the world depending on these unique therapies – and because plasma cannot be recreated in a lab – the importance of plasma donation is vital. The Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association (PPTA) commissioned the poll to better understand Americans' perception of the growing need for plasma-derived medicines.

Notable survey findings include:

Eight in ten survey respondents have never donated plasma.

About half (49%) of Americans who have never donated plasma feel they do not know enough about the donation process.

The survey also revealed a perceived disparity between blood and plasma donation, with 65% of respondents believing there is a greater need for donated blood than plasma, and 60% feeling that blood donation benefits more people.

As the survey results show, there is increasing public awareness of the essential role plasma donation plays in saving lives. However, understanding must continue to advance in order to meet growing patient needs. During IPAW, it's important to recognize plasma donors as everyday heroes because, as the survey shows, Americans know that plasma donation saves lives.""

Anita Brikman, President and CEO of the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association

""As a patient who relies on the generosity of plasma donors, I feel optimistic about the survey results,"" said Lillie Hunnicut, a Seattle-based plasma advocate and common variable immune deficiency patient who shares her journey on social media as @chronically.lils. ""Donating plasma helps create medicines that help me and many others thrive! Thanks to my plasma-derived therapy, I can now run, hike, climb, and be active and present in my daily life in a way that I wasn't for several years before my diagnosis and treatment. I am so grateful to the many donors who have given me not just my life back – but have strengthened my sense of hope in humanity.""

""An estimated half a million Americans have been diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency (PI), though the actual number is likely much higher due to widespread underdiagnosis,"" said Jorey Berry, President and CEO of the Immune Deficiency Foundation. ""Many individuals with PI depend on life-saving plasma-derived medicines that cannot be manufactured synthetically and can only be produced through the generosity of human donors. It is my hope that this survey and International Plasma Awareness Week will shine a much-needed spotlight on the critical, ongoing need for plasma donation and help raise awareness of these often-overlooked immune system disorders.""

For more on the survey and its findings, please reach out to [email protected]. PPTA encourages all healthy adults over the age of 18 to consider giving the gift of life through plasma donation. Visit www.pptaglobal.org/donate to learn more and find a donation center near you.

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a new structure determination method using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which shows how different parts of complex molecular machinery like enzymes move while they help catalyze reactions. Focusing on an enzyme in yeast, they demonstrated how contrasts in atomic scale motions impact their function. The method promises unprecedented access to the mechanisms by which biomolecules work, and how they relate to illnesses.

Enzymes are indispensable to the function of all biological organisms, including humans. While snapshots captured using X-ray or cryo-electron microscopy have revealed their intricate molecular structure, they are a constant blur of motion when they are at work. Their atomic scale structure is constantly changing, capturing other biomolecules and helping them react in a carefully choreographed sequence. While clearly important, these rapid motions at the nanometer scale are difficult to capture.

Now, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Teppei Ikeya from Tokyo Metropolitan University have used NMR spectroscopy to capture how different parts of enzymes move. Integrating a combination of different approaches, they successfully captured an accurate ""ensemble structure"" of a reacting enzyme. Essentially, ensemble structure is the collection of all states a macromolecule can take, and how likely it is to take each.

The team demonstrated their method with yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1 (YUH1), an enzyme in yeast that helps it recycle ubiquitin, a protein that regulates various intracellular events. YUH1 has an analogue in humans called ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCHL1), known to be implicated in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. By integrating multiple analytical methods using NMR spectroscopy, they were able to create an ensemble map for YUH1 for dynamics over the millisecond time scale. They discovered that two parts of the enzyme near the active part, where proteins are bound, showed strikingly large movements, a ""crossover loop"" structure and the N-terminus, one end of the protein-capturing structure of the enzyme. The N-terminus was found to move in and out of the loop, going through a whole range of states before finally capturing a target protein like a lasso before acting as a ""gating lid,"" keeping it in place. This new mechanism was supported by the way in which mutant versions with incomplete ""gating lids"" failed to show the same enzymatic activity.

The team's findings reveal how the dynamic nature of enzymes plays an important role in how they function. The method can be applied to a vast array of biological structures in their natural environment, promising a new approach for scientists to access underlying mechanisms and potential pathologies.

New research investigating health outcomes in NCAA athletes during their first year after leaving college sports found that some health measures were worse than expected, but others actually improved. 

The results varied depending on the athletes' history of contact exposure and the number of years they played their sport.

In athletes that are ending their collegiate careers, those with more concussions reported worse outcomes on certain health measures.

Interestingly, those participating in a higher contact sport reported better mental and symptom health scores than those in noncontact sports. Further, those with increased number of years playing their primary sport reported better mental health scores."" 

Reid Syrydiuk, first author on the study and doctoral candidate in kinesiology, University of Michigan Concussion Center

The findings counter the narrative associating concussion with mental health deficits, and suggest that the benefits derived from the team environments seen with contact sports may be somewhat protective, he said. 

The study, which appears in the journal Brain Injury, is also novel in that it explores a period that hasn't been studied much: the time when students are transitioning out of college sport. The research is funded by the NCAA and the U.S. Department of Defense.

Most studies on concussions and health fall into one of two categories: acute (hours or days post-injury) or long term (decades into retirement.) This focus leaves a significant gap in understanding the health of athletes as they undergo the massive life change of exiting competitive sport.

To that end, researchers analyzed health questionnaires completed within one year of leaving college by 3,663 student-athletes in the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium, to assess how concussion history, sport contact exposure and years of participation were associated with their health at the end of their collegiate career, an intermediate time period that has not been studied much. 

Athletes completed eight self-reported health questionnaires spanning factors including cognition, mental health, physical health and neurobehavioral health. Key findings:

Concussion history: Athletes with three or more concussions across a variety of sports reported increased depressive symptoms and worsened neurobehavioral (e.g., irritability, concentration) symptoms compared to those with no concussions.

Benefits of participation: Athletes reporting more years of participation in their primary sport consistently reported better mental health scores.

Sport type comparison: Athletes in contact sports reported better mental health (specifically lower depression scores) and neurobehavioral symptom scores compared to noncontact athletes.

""If I consider why these contact sport athletes report better scores on certain outcomes, I think it could be related to the large-team environments they experience,"" Syrydiuk said. 

The CARE Consortium is a national concussion research network of NCAA athletes and U.S. military service academy cadets across 30 different institutions. Steven Broglio, director of the Michigan Concussion Center and U-M professor of kinesiology, is a principal investigator on the CARE study. 

An important practical application is identifying groups that could benefit from early intervention and support as they leave their college athletics, Syrydiuk said.

""This time period is important because it hasn't typically been used before in this type of sport medicine research,"" he said. ""It both bridges a gap in literature, which is typically studying concussions in the acute and the long term, and it fosters early support for those leaving sport.""

Practical applications could include increased monitoring, such as follow-up mental health screenings for identified at-risk groups postgraduation or targeted resources, such as offering access to counseling or tailored transition support programs for those with significant concussion history.

The change of leaving sport is a critical moment.

""For the majority of these collegiate athletes, their competitive careers end with graduation,"" Syrydiuk said. ""That's a very big change in their lives. We don't want to just ignore them after they've left sport.

""If we can identify groups that are more at risk as they're leaving sport versus decades after they've retired, we can intervene earlier and hopefully increase the likelihood of improving their self-reported health. By identifying who needs support as they transition out of sport, we have a better chance of preventing their health from worsening over time.""

Cardiovascular-related health problems may occur in as many as 1 out of every 7 pregnancies, even among people who don't already have heart disease, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation.

A review of more than 56,000 pregnancies occurring between 2001 and 2019 within the Mass General Brigham health care system in New England found a steady rise in cardiovascular-related complications during pregnancy. Conditions such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, blood clots, hypertensive disorders, and maternal death affected approximately 15% of pregnancies. The increase was most pronounced among individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, but it was observed across all age groups and even among those without prior health issues.

These increases were impacted by a rise in health risk factors present before and during pregnancy. Among study participants:

Most of these health risk factors can be prevented through lifestyle changes or medication. Yet, many of my patients aren't even aware they have these conditions or that they're at risk. If you're planning to become pregnant, I strongly encourage you to connect with a clinician early to understand your risks and take steps to reduce them. During pregnancy, stay proactive about your health. Listen to your body and your provider to address any concerns that arise. And don't overlook the postpartum period, which also carries important health considerations. Starting before pregnancy and continuing after birth, there are valuable opportunities to make heart-healthy choices that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and support long-term wellness.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Reproductive health agencies call for a major shift in diagnosis and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251006/Reproductive-health-agencies-call-for-a-major-shift-in-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-postpartum-hemorrhage.aspx","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 11:40:00 GMT","

Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. The recommendations highlight the urgent need for earlier detection and faster intervention – steps that could save the lives of tens of thousands of women each year.

Defined as excessive bleeding after childbirth, PPH affects millions of women annually and causes nearly 45 000 deaths, making it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality globally. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma.

Postpartum hemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care. These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited – helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families.""

Dr. Jeremy Farrar, Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and Care

Published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), the guidelines introduce new objective diagnostic criteria for detecting PPH, based on the largest study on the topic to date – also published today in The Lancet.

Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning early detection and rapid response is critical. Yet in many settings, especially where healthcare resources and labour wards are overstretched, delays in treatment result in devastating consequences.

Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes – simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood – so that they can act immediately when criteria are met.

The guidelines recommend the immediate deployment of the MOTIVE bundle of actions once PPH has been diagnosed. This includes:

In rare cases where bleeding continues, the guidelines recommend effective interventions such as surgery or blood transfusion to safely stabilize a woman's condition until further treatment becomes available.

""Women affected by PPH need care that is fast, feasible, effective and drives progress towards eliminating PPH-related deaths,"" said Professor Anne Beatrice Kihara, President of FIGO. ""These guidelines take a proactive approach of readiness, recognition and response. They are designed to ensure real-world impact – empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts.""

The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails.

The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth.

During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort.

""Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum hemorrhage can escalate and cost lives,"" said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM's Chief Midwife. ""These guidelines are a game-changer. But to end preventable deaths from PPH, we need more than evidence and protocols. We call on governments, health systems, donors, and partners to step up, adopt these recommendations, adopt them quickly, and invest in midwives and maternal care so that postpartum hemorrhage becomes a tragedy of the past.""

The guidelines are accompanied by a suite of training and implementation resources, developed with partners including UNFPA. These tools consist of practical modules for frontline health workers, national-level guides for introducing new practices, and simulation-based training to strengthen emergency response.

These consolidated guidelines – the first to uniquely focus on PPH – are being launched at the 2025 FIGO World Congress in Cape Town, South Africa. They are a crucial step in the implementation of the Global roadmap to combat postpartum hemorrhage between 2023 and 2030.

Neuroinflammation damages neurons and can contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's. Cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory properties, which suggests that it could combat neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. In a new eNeuro paper, Babak Baban and colleagues, from Augusta University, explored whether CBD can be leveraged as an antiinflammatory treatment in an established Alzheimer's disease mouse model. 

The researchers assessed two distinct mechanisms for shaping immune responses and regulating neuroinflammation in the central nervous system following CBD treatment via inhalation. With several molecular and genetic measures, they discovered that CBD reduced expression of key regulators for neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's mice, which was associated with less proinflammatory molecules. Baban et al. also identified distinct regulators of the immune response and neuroinflammation with which CBD interacted. 

Alzheimer's work has long centered on plaques and tangles. But our study shows that chronic autoinflammation is also a core driver of the disease. What's exciting is that CBD not only calms this immune overactivation but, in earlier work, we've shown it can also help clear plaques and tangles through a different mechanism. Together, this points to a multitarget approach with real therapeutic potential.""

Tokyo's middle-aged commuters may be losing sleep over more than just work, researchers reveal that the farther and smaller you live, the worse your sleep gets.

 Study: Commuting time, residential floor area, and their associations with insomnia and daytime sleepiness among residents of the Tokyo metropolitan area: a cross-sectional study. Image Credit: Urbanscape / Shutterstock.com

A recent study published in the Journal of Transport and Health examines the relationship between commute time and house area with insomnia and daytime sleepiness.

Japan has the shortest mean sleep duration, less than 7.5 hours, among all developed countries. When stratified by age, adults between 40 and 50 sleep less than seven hours every night and report longer daily commutes.

Long-distance commuters are more likely to exercise less, be overweight, have high blood pressure, and experience poor sleep. These individuals frequently feel more tired, stressed, and less satisfied with their lives, in addition to being more likely to experience digestive disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and overall lower levels of wellbeing.

Living near the workplace often correlates with living close to or within the city. Residing in cities is not conducive to good sleep due to air, noise, and light pollution, in addition to the lack of green spaces and walkways, and a reduced sense of neighborhood and safe community.

In Japan, people frequently purchase their first homes in their 30s and rarely move houses thereafter. Thus, the choice of house among young adults may affect their sleep quality throughout their lives.

A larger multi-room house often allows the residents to escape from light and noise pollution, which is not possible in a small house with only one room. Conversely, living in a small house, typical of urban homes, may also disrupt sleep quality.

The disruptive effects of urban living and long commute times may work synergistically to worsen sleep quality. To date, no studies have comprehensively evaluated the combined effects of commute time and housing size.

The current study included 1,757 individuals between 40 and 59 years of age who responded to an online survey about their commute to workplaces in Tokyo. Validated scales were used to evaluate insomnia and daytime sleepiness, as well as dwelling size and daily commute time. The researchers also applied propensity score matching (PSM) to adjust for demographic and socioeconomic confounders such as age, sex, education, marital status, and household income. 

A total of 911 and 499 people reported insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. People who slept between seven and nine hours every night were 80% less likely to report insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. Similarly, people in their 50s were 20-25% less likely to report these conditions, respectively.

People who have longer commute times were more likely to experience insomnia and daytime sleepiness. For daily commute times of 100 minutes or more, the risk of insomnia and daytime sleepiness was 60% and 70% higher, respectively.

After adjusting for education, marital status, and household income, over 50 minutes of commute time was associated with a 22-35% increased risk of insomnia and daytime sleepiness.

People living in smaller houses or apartments were also more likely to have insomnia. People living in houses with a floor area of 115 square meters or more were 35% less likely to experience insomnia, whereas those who lived in houses with a floor area below 95 square meters were 44% more likely to have insomnia.

Each of these factors is independently responsible for insomnia and daytime sleepiness, irrespective of other potential demographic or socioeconomic confounding factors. The threshold appears to be living in a 95 square meter house while commuting 53 minutes to work, a value derived from a mathematical model rather than direct emperical observation. 

Sleeping seven to nine hours every night is associated with the lowest risk of either insomnia or daytime sleepiness. However, this benefit is not observed in those who sleep more than nine hours every night, whose risk equals or exceeds that of those who sleep between five and seven hours.

A shorter commute time and higher housing floor area are predictors of better sleep quality and less daytime sleepiness, with effects appearing somewhat stronger among women, though this difference was not statistically significant. A larger house reduces the adverse impact of longer commutes, which may be attributed to greater life satisfaction and the ability to choose a house for maximum utility.

Longer commute times are associated with a greater likelihood of insomnia and daytime sleepiness, while a small house floor area predicted insomnia but not daytime sleepiness.

Optimizing commuting time and housing size can help mitigate commuter-related insomnia.”

Cervical epithelial cells are far from passive bystanders in the body's immune system. New research shows they actually play an active and highly coordinated role in detecting and fighting infections. That's the conclusion of an international research team led by Associate Professor Cindrilla Chumduri from Aarhus University, and now published in the journal Science Advances.

Using patient-derived 3D mini-organs, so-called organoids, and single-cell mapping technologies, the team has, for the first time, shown how distinct epithelial cell types in the cervix detect, respond to, and help neutralize infections. Importantly, the study demonstrates that these organoids faithfully recapitulate native human cervical tissue at single-cell resolution, making them powerful discovery platforms for infections, cancer and regenerative biology.

""We've demonstrated that the cervix is not just a physical barrier but a truly immunocompetent tissue that orchestrates complex defense mechanisms,"" says Cindrilla Chumduri, associate professor at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University.

The researchers focused particularly on chlamydia, the world's most common bacterial STI. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, they mapped the gene activity of thousands of individual cells in the organoids to reveal their role in immune defense.

The study found that various epithelial cells collaborate in a highly organized defense network. Within each region, specialised epithelial subtypes take on distinct tasks, such as repair, regeneration, or immune amplification. The outer ectocervical squamous cells reinforce the tissue barrier, while deeper endocervical columnar cells act as immune signalers, switching on interferon pathways, antimicrobial defenses, and antigen presentation, triggering alarms. Most surprising was that some of the most immune-active cells were never infected themselves.

""The most striking finding was that uninfected cells became the most immunologically active. They picked up distress signals from neighboring cells and initiated a defense response. It shows how incredibly sophisticated our tissues are,"" says Postdoc Pon Ganish Prakash, the study's first author.

The team also decoded cellular conversations, revealing how signaling between epithelial subtypes balances defense with repair. Some subtypes acted as hubs, coordinating the activity of their neighbors.

These discoveries open new opportunities for vaccines and treatments that stimulate the cervix's local defense system, rather than relying solely on the systemic immune response. This shift could have major implications for preventing STIs and their complications, such as infertility and cervical cancer.

We see huge potential in developing mucosal vaccines that can activate local immunity right at the infection site.""

Cindrilla Chumduri, Associate Professor, Aarhus University 

The patient-derived organoids also offer a powerful new platform to study how infections like HPV and chlamydia affect cervical tissue over time, and how co-infections may increase disease risks.

""Mini-organs are like a window into human tissue. They allow us to test ideas and treatments in highly realistic models, far more accurate than traditional lab methods,"" explains Postdoc Naveen Kumar Nirchal, co-author of the study.

Senior Reseacher Rajendra Kumar Gurumurthy adds:

""Our findings show that epithelial heterogeneity is essential. Each subtype has its own job in protecting the cervix and preventing spread of infections to upper reproductive organs.""

An analysis of 240,000 Americans reveals that the rise in alone time began long before the smartphone boom. It points to age, life stage, and social change as the real forces behind America's loneliness epidemic.

Study: In-person social isolation in the age of smartphonies: Examining age, period, cohort effects by gender. Image credit: Valebru/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study in PLoS One, researchers examined how birth cohort, time period, and age shape the time that people spend alone when social media and smartphone use are widespread.

Their findings show that social isolation has increased sharply over the past two decades, accelerating since the mid-2010s. However, smartphones alone cannot explain these changes, with generational differences and aging contributing to isolation.

The U.S. Surgeon General described isolation and loneliness as a national epidemic in 2023, pointing to online entertainment, remote work, smartphones, and social media as contributing factors. While these technologies allow new ways to stay connected, critics argue they reduce face-to-face connections and weaken real-world support networks.

Evidence cited for rising isolation often comes from time-trend studies, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which shows a steady rise in the time that people spend alone since 2003. However, these analyses may confuse three separate influences: age (isolation tends to rise later in life), period (broad societal changes such as new technologies), and cohort (differences between generations).

Research shows that age may have a U-shaped effect, with social isolation rising notably after midlife due to retirement, loss of peers, and other life transitions. Cohort effects may also play a role: younger generations who grew up with smart devices may rely more on digital than in-person interactions. In comparison, older generations maintain different social patterns.

Prior evidence on generational differences is mixed, with some studies suggesting younger cohorts are less socially engaged offline, and others showing stability in family and friend connections.

Researchers analyzed ATUS data from 2003 to 2022, covering 240,576 respondents aged 15 to 79. The ATUS, conducted by the Census Bureau, collects nationally representative 24-hour diaries of daily activities through telephone interviews.

Respondents report what they did, how long activities lasted, where they occurred, and with whom. Social isolation was measured as minutes spent alone during non-work activities, since work-related “who” data were inconsistently available before 2010 and could bias comparisons.

Cohort, age, and period groups were created in five-year intervals: age groups (15–19 through 75–79), four periods (2003–2007 through 2018–2022), and sixteen birth cohorts (1924–1932 through 1999–2007). The models also controlled for weekends versus weekdays and holidays, since social contact patterns vary by day type.

The researchers applied the Fosse and Winship age-period-cohort (APC) method to separate the influences of cohort, age, and period. This approach overcomes the statistical challenge that age = period – cohort by distinguishing nonlinear effects and estimating a “canonical solution line” of possible linear effects.

Weighted regression models, adjusted for sampling design and non-response, estimated the net contributions of cohort, age, and period. Analyses were stratified by gender, with results visualized using two-dimensional APC plots.

The researchers found that Americans are spending increasingly more time alone in non-work activities. For men, time spent alone rose from 268 minutes in 2003 to 312 minutes in 2022, while for women it increased from 282 to 297 minutes.

This growth accelerated around 2013–2014. Age patterns followed a U-shaped curve, with social contact highest in the mid-30s before declining steadily into older age. Women's time alone rose sharply to 500 minutes by age 79, while men plateaued at around 451 minutes.

Cohort effects revealed that older cohorts (born before 1940) spent the most time alone, with levels dropping significantly among those born in the 1970s–1980s and rising again for the youngest cohorts.

However, the authors emphasize that it is difficult to fully disentangle cohort effects from age effects in the ATUS data, meaning that some generational differences may reflect life-course patterns rather than actual cohort change.

Advanced APC modeling confirmed that period effects (societal changes such as the spread of smartphones) did contribute to rising isolation, particularly after the mid-2010s. Yet cohort and age effects were much stronger influences. Quantitatively, the age effect was about five times larger than the period effect, roughly a 150-minute difference between mid-30s and late-70s adults, compared to a 30-minute rise over the 2003-2022 period.

Gender differences emerged, with women showing steeper increases in isolation later in life, partly reflecting higher widowhood rates. Sensitivity tests (e.g., weekends vs weekdays, pre-pandemic vs post-pandemic, leisure time vs nonwork time) confirmed the robustness of these patterns.

This study demonstrates that while societal shifts, such as smartphone adoption, have contributed to rising social isolation, age and cohort dynamics are far more influential. The strongest finding is the U-shaped age effect, where isolation is lowest in the mid-30s and peaks in older adulthood, particularly for women.

This suggests that aging processes, including retirement, family changes, and widowhood, drive much of the isolation crisis. Cohort effects also indicate that older generations experience substantially higher isolation than younger ones, although these generational interpretations are tentative, given the overlap between age and cohort influences.

Key strengths include using two decades of nationally representative ATUS data and applying advanced APC modeling, which allows a clearer separation of cohort, age, and period influences.

However, limitations remain, including reliance on cross-sectional data, difficulties distinguishing age from cohort effects, and modest assumptions required in APC modeling. Overall, the findings reinforce the Surgeon General's warning and highlight older adults as a priority group for interventions to reduce social isolation.

New artificial intelligence-generated images that appear to be one thing, but something else entirely when rotated, are helping scientists test the human mind.

The work by Johns Hopkins University perception researchers addresses a longstanding need for uniform stimuli to rigorously study how people mentally process visual information.

""These images are really important because we can use them to study all sorts of effects that scientists previously thought were nearly impossible to study in isolation-everything from size to animacy to emotion,"" said first author Tal Boger, a PhD student studying visual perception.

""Not to mention how fun they are to look at,"" adds senior author Chaz Firestone, who runs the university's Perception & Mind Lab.

The team adapted a new AI tool to create ""visual anagrams."" An anagram is a word that spells something else when its letters are rearranged. Visual anagrams are images that look like something else when rotated. The visual anagrams the team created include a single image that is both a bear and a butterfly, another that is an elephant and a rabbit, and a third that is both a duck and a horse.

This is an important new kind of image for our field. If something looks like a butterfly in one orientation and a bear in another-but it's made of the exact same pixels in both cases-then we can study how people perceive aspects of images in a way that hasn't really been possible before.""

Chaz Firestone, senior author

The findings are published today in Current Biology.

The team ran initial experiments exploring how people perceive the real-world size of objects. Real-world size has posed a longstanding puzzle for perception scientists, because one can never be certain if subjects are reacting to an object's size or to some other more subtle visual property like an object's shape, color or fuzziness.

""Let's say we want to know how the brain responds to the size of an object. Past research shows that big things get processed in a different brain region than small things. But if we show people two objects that differ in how big they are-say, a butterfly and a bear-those objects are also going to differ in lots of other ways: their shape, their texture, how bright or colorful they are, and so on,"" Firestone explained. ""That makes it hard to know what's really driving the brain's response. Are people reacting to the fact that bears are big and butterflies are small, or is it that bears are rounder or furrier? The field has really struggled to address this issue.""

With the visual anagrams, the team found evidence for many classic real-world size effects, even when the large and small objects used in their studies were just rotated versions of the same image.

For example, previous work has found that people find images more aesthetically pleasing when they are depicted in ways that match their real-world size-preferring, say, pictures of bears to be bigger than pictures of butterflies. Boger and Firestone found that this was also true for visual anagrams: When subjects adjusted the bear image to be its ideal size, they made it bigger than when they adjusted the butterfly image to be its ideal size-even though the butterfly and the bear are the very same image in different orientations.

The team hopes to use visual anagrams to study how people respond to animate and inanimate objects and expects the technique to have many possible uses for future experiments in psychology and neuroscience.

""We used anagrams to study size, but you could use them for just about anything,"" Firestone said. ""Animate and inanimate objects are processed in different areas of the brain too so you could make anagrams that look like a truck in one orientation but a dog in another orientation. The approach is quite general, and we can foresee researchers using it for many different purposes.""

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. (C. Morgan Engel/Getty Images)

U.S. Soccer says it is “monitoring the situation in Morocco” and “no changes have been made” ahead of the U-17 Women's World Cup later this month, which will feature the U.S. women's national team's youth squad.

The tournament kicks off in 11 days in Morocco, where youth-led, anti-government protests have disrupted major cities across the North African nation.

The U-17 women's World Cup, which features three NWSL players who were called up for Team USA, will be staged in its entirety in the city of Rabat, the nation's capital. However, as some players were saying goodbye to their clubs to join their federations, protests continued to intensify, and Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said by Thursday, at least three were killed.

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. Morocco, Spain and Portugal are jointly hosting the competition.

The protests, inspired by similar youth-led demonstrations in Asia and Latin America, began on Sept. 27 after the loosely organized, anonymous group known as “Gen Z 212” made calls through social media platforms like Discord for better education and healthcare. Protests have since spread to several major cities, and on Sunday continued for the ninth consecutive night.

The U-17 Women's World Cup begins on Oct. 17 with an opening match between Morocco and Brazil at Olympic Stadium in Rabat. In its ninth edition, only five nations have ever lifted the competition's trophy, with North Korea the reigning champions. Twenty-four nations are participating, including the U.S., which has never won the event.

The Athletic asked the federation whether changes were made to travel and security or if it had been in communication with FIFA as a result of the ongoing protests.

“Our security team is aware and is closely monitoring the situation in Morocco,” a U.S. Soccer spokesperson said. “No changes have been made at this time.”

FIFA has not responded to questions for this story as of Monday afternoon.

Morocco has been heavily investing in its efforts to grow as a footballing nation. In addition to the U17 women's World Cup, which ends Nov. 8, Morocco will host the men's Africa Cup of Nations in December. Over the summer, Morocco also hosted a belated edition of the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco was also awarded multi-year hosting rights last year for the U-17 women's World Cup. This year's tournament will mark the first time an African nation will host the competition, with Morocco scheduled to host the event annually through 2029.

“Football in Morocco has gone from strength to strength in recent years,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a news release last year. “While the men's team reached the last four at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the women's team has made such impressive strides, thanks to the support of the government and the Moroccan Football Association, and the talent of the players.

“I believe hosting the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup over five years will inspire so many more girls — and boys — to take up football in the country, and as it is the first time the tournament comes to Africa, that inspiration will spread right across the continent.”

Nine months after that statement, FIFA revealed that Morocco would co-host the men's World Cup in 2030 with Spain and Portugal. The youth-led protests over the 2030 competition have centered around the heavy spending linked to the men's World Cup.

According to The New York Times, police said in a statement they were forced to act in self-defense after protesters tried to storm a police building and seize weapons, during which two people were killed. The authorities did not say how the third person died.

The prime minister said in a televised address on Thursday that his government was ready for a “dialogue and discussion within institutions and public spaces,” The New York Times reported. Demonstrators demanded he step down instead, with Gen Z 212 on social media saying the killings amounted to “a serious human rights violation.”

The group has denounced the violence, Reuters reported on Friday, and called for new, peaceful protests in major cities.

Tim Ream celebrated his 38th birthday as the U.S. Men's National Team reported for October camp on Sunday. Still, he jabbed at his younger teammate Cristian Roldan's age.

“You're 30? Damn, you're old,” Ream said jokingly to Roldan in a media availability with the two veteran leaders on Monday. 

Ream and Roldan, along with goalkeeper Matt Turner, are the only players 30 years or older on the current National Team roster as the USMNT faces Ecuador (Oct. 10 in Austin, Texas) and Australia (Oct. 14 in Commerce City, Colo.).

The players represented the United States in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and carry valuable leadership qualities as the USMNT gears up for the tournament next summer. To round out 2025, the USA will face two more World Cup-bound squads Paraguay and Uruguay in the next window.

“When I think of Tim — I think of poise, I think leadership, I think of control in every aspect,” Roldan said. “He brings a different aura to the team, and he creates a really good environment, a really welcoming environment for a lot of guys, and that's the type of leader that we need.”

During the last FIFA World Cup cycle in 2022, Ream contemplated whether that would be his first — and last — World Cup. At 38 years old and counting, there's no sign of the center back slowing down in the imminent future. 

While he's pondered the sunset of his career on the U.S. Soccer Podcast, playing in a World Cup on home soil is the ultimate dream before any plans of hanging up the cleats for good.

“I've always maintained that I'll push myself to the absolute maximum and bring every ounce of playing time that I can out of my body and my mind,” Ream said. “That's what I'm going to continue to do. I'm going to continue to push to be a starter.” 

Ream has appeared in 11 of the 14 USMNT games in 2025, donning the captain's band in 10. However, he understands the final decision isn't up to him, and he's willing to advance the team's success in any way. 

“If I'm the old guy in the corner handing out orange slices and giving pep talks to these guys, then OK, I've still contributed something to the team environment in the culture,” Ream said. ""But my aim and my goal is to be starting games.”

Meanwhile, Roldan looks at Ream as an example for sustaining a National Team career at any age.

Roldan turned 30 years old in June and appeared in a USMNT shirt for the first time since 2023 in the Americans' most recent camp last month. The center midfielder was added to the roster after the initial announcement, and he impressed head coach Mauricio Pochettino enough to earn a second-straight call-up.

“He's revitalized his National Team career at an older age,” Roldan said of Ream. “It provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here with the team, to really believe that I could get here. He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level but sustain that throughout your career.” 

Before earning his first cap under Pochettino, Roldan gained confidence once again playing at the highest level this past summer. He credited his run with the Seattle Sounders FC in the FIFA Club World Cup and Leagues Cup as pivotal. Roldan found his stride against top European squads in PSG and Atlético Madrid in the CWC. Then he helped lift a trophy with a victory over Lionel Messi and Inter Miami CF in the tournament featuring MLS and Liga MX squads.

Pochettino utilized the September camp to bring in some different faces and allow the deeper player pool a chance to perform ahead of World Cup roster decisions. Roldan took full advantage of that opportunity with productive minutes in the first match against Korea Republic, which earned him a starting position in the USA's 2-0 win over Japan.

In this October camp, it's about building on that for Roldan and the larger group. The time is now to continue growing winning habits. Having leaders like Roldan and Ream in the locker room who know how to steer the ship alongside the coaching staff is crucial in that development. 

“The mentality is focused,” Roldan said. “I think that we had a good game against Japan, and how can we build off that? How can we establish the formations, the tactics, the ideas that coach Pochettino wants to bring to the team and then show it on Friday against a tough Ecuador side?”

Focus, high-intensity, aggressive — I think those are the styles, the characteristics we want to have on the field come Friday.”

World Cup

World Cup 2026

Countdown

 

The emails arrive, unannounced, around a week before U.S. men's national team camps open. Sent by U.S. Soccer and delivered to players, they bear roster news and trigger contrasting emotions. For the two dozen or so players called up to the USMNT, “it's an amazing feeling,” says midfielder Jack McGlynn. For others, there's disappointment. And month after month, camp after camp, no phone call from Mauricio Pochettino ever comes.

Advertisement

Pochettino, the U.S. coach, never calls players to explain roster decisions. Nor does he communicate with them much, if at all, between camps.

The radio silence is a stark departure from what many U.S. players experienced under their previous coach, Gregg Berhalter, but it cuts to the core of Pochettino's managerial philosophy and USMNT rebuild.

“The players don't need to know,” Pochettino said last week when asked why he doesn't explain his squad decisions. Deep down, he believes, they should already know why they were worthy or unworthy. And they should be “desperate to perform … to grind … to convince us to call again.”

They should compete for their place in the USMNT and shouldn't need a FaceTime chat or WhatsApp message to reassure or inspire them. They should be focused, day after day, on improving at their clubs.

So, whereas Berhalter and his assistants would send players video clips or a simple check-in text regularly, Pochettino did not speak at all with his star, Christian Pulisic, from May until September.

And it's not just Pulisic; it's everyone, and it's calculated.

“We decided that the communication with players shouldn't be (happening) while they are in their clubs — (to) not interfere on the day-to-day processes, their routines, their habits,” Jesús Pérez, Pochettino's top assistant coach, told The Athletic.

The players are, instead, left to interpret Pochettino's choices and public comments on their own. At least 10 USMNT players have confirmed that they hardly speak with Pochettino outside of camps — though many have said they don't have any issues with the lack of communication. When, for example, striker Josh Sargent learned via email that he'd miss out on the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, he “didn't really hear any word from the coaching staff.” In fact, he didn't speak at all with them between March and September.

“But at the same time, I know they don't have to call me,” Sargent said last month. “I understand. I kind of just took it as rest up during the offseason and hit the ground running with Norwich to make sure I'm back into the next camp” — which he was.

The lack of correspondence is not uncommon in international soccer. Across the world, and perhaps across generations, approaches vary. Former French star Thierry Henry experienced what he calls the “old-school” custom: “You speak when you're in your national team.” Former England defender Jamie Carragher, speaking on the same Zoom call with reporters last month, said: “I mean, I didn't even think (then-England manager) Sven-Goran Eriksson knew who I was.”

Tata Martino, who has coached three national teams, told The Athletic that he communicated less with players outside of camps when leading Argentina, but did visit Mexico players personally in the buildup to the 2022 World Cup.

“Everyone can feel whether they need to do it or not,” Martino said.

For most U.S. players, though, the norm was Berhalter. The new norm has, perhaps, required an adjustment.

“Every coach is very different,” Pulisic said on a CBS Sports podcast in June. “I've had coaches who I've communicated with daily, who want to talk and get things off their brain, and talk to their players. And I've always appreciated that, for sure, when people make an effort to care about the player, but also the person, too.”

Pulisic clarified, though, that he “(doesn't) have an issue with” with Pochettino's style. “Has it been slightly different with some of my other national team coaches? Yeah. But that's not something that I'm looking into too much.”

When Berhalter took the U.S. job in late 2018, communication was one of his very first initiatives. He flew to Europe and met with around a dozen players in eight days, he recently told The Athletic. He sat down with Pulisic for dinner at an Italian restaurant in Germany. He established contact with domestic players, too, and kept in touch. There were phone calls and FaceTimes. Having come from club coaching, where he could talk with and teach players daily, virtual communication became crucial — because players only spend around eight weeks per year with their national teams.

“To me, it was about building bonds with these guys, and really supporting them,” Berhalter told The Athletic in an August interview.

When asked about his communication with Pulisic, specifically, he said: “It wasn't that transactional. We would talk, we would catch up. ‘Hey, how you doing? How's life going? You're in a busy stretch, you need anything from us?'”

There were, though, chats about tactics. “They watch every game, they reach out to me after some games,” defender Aaron Long said of Berhalter's staff in 2019. Some of the outreach was: “Hey Aaron, how you feeling? How you doing?” Some of it was: “Hey, do you remember this play? What do you think about that? I was thinking maybe you could do this instead.” Game film, via platforms like Hudl, also featured regularly.

Berhalter's systems of play were often detailed and intricate. Players had specific roles and movements. The goal of the outreach, at times, was to soft-launch on-field ideas, so that they weren't foreign when players arrived at camp on Monday ahead of a Thursday game.

And it was to build trust.

“To me,” Berhalter said, “there's a lot of work that needs to be done with relationships, all the time, whenever you're coaching a team. It's not about just what you're doing on the field.”

Former U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard agrees with that idea. He told The Athletic that, “on a very functional team, your best players, your senior players should be having normal regular conversations with the coach; text messages and calls. So the fact that that's not happening is somewhat eye-opening.”

One criticism of the Berhalter era, though, was that in identifying his core players, others felt overlooked and unable to break in, no matter what they might be doing at club level — and no matter whether those core players were in form at their respective clubs.

When Pochettino took the U.S. job in 2024, he adopted a very different approach. It was, in part, informed by the idea that he needed to “open the window to way more players,” as Pérez said.

In the month after finalizing his contract, before his first training camp last October, Pochettino did not reach out to a single player. “By coincidence,” he recalled last year, while out for dinner at Clap London, a Japanese restaurant near where he lives, he ran into USMNT defender Antonee Robinson, who plays for local club Fulham.

But there were no calls or introductory texts.

“Because we didn't have time,” Pochettino said. “I don't want to call only for the reason to say, ‘Oh, I call some guy, or another.' I think all deserve the same way for us to operate.”

There was another reason, too. Pochettino carried it with him after 15 years coaching clubs. “When we were in clubs,” Pérez told The Athletic, constant communication between players and their national team coaches was “something that we found unfair.”

“So,” Pérez continued, “shall I call Pulisic to comment (on) the great run (against Napoli) and his assist?” Their answer is no. “It's his coach(‘s job),” Pérez said.

Instead, the staff prioritized building relationships with players' coaches and their clubs.

“Why? Because Milan staff knows a lot more about Christian than us, because they are working every day with him,” Pérez explained. And Seattle Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer knows a lot more about Cristian Roldan; Columbus Crew coach Wilfried Nancy knows a lot more about Max Arfsten.

So, when Pérez visited Columbus, he sat down with Nancy for a 90-minute lunch. When Miguel D'Agostino, another assistant coach, visited Seattle, he met Roldan, but spent more time speaking with Schmetzer and his staff.

“He appreciated the thoughts that we were conveying to him about what we did at the club,” Schmetzer said. “All of us have different ways of skinning the cat, or winning, or being successful. … When you spoke to [D'Agostino], you could just feel the passion that they had about what they were trying to develop with the culture of the [U.S. team]. And so I was in. I was drinking the Kool Aid right away.”

Pochettino's assistants have visited most, if not all clubs that employ USMNT candidates, but “when we visit clubs, the less important (thing) is to talk to the players,” Pérez said.

Roldan, meanwhile, never spoke with Pochettino, and told The Athletic last month: “I didn't know if I was even on the radar.” But he kept grinding, proving himself as an unheralded MLS star, and out of nowhere, three days into the September camp, a call finally came. A month later, Roldan is back with the group, because his behavior impressed Pochettino, on the field and off it.

“I didn't know Cristian,” Pochettino said. But in a span of six days, Roldan became a “good example of how you need to want to be involved and defend and fight for your place.”

That, in a nutshell, is the Pochettino archetype. He doesn't need to know players. He essentially doesn't want them to care what he says. He wants them all to feel a constant, healthy pressure to perform.

So the staff keeps a relative distance between camps. The ultimate motive is the one Pochettino outlined in a six-minute manifesto at his news conference last week.

“If you bring in a player and say, ‘Oh, I love you,' but after, he's not performing, and you are not going to call (him, he might) say, ‘Hey, but you told me you love me,'” Pochettino explained. Too much communication, in other words, can send the wrong message and create problems where there doesn't have to be one.

Whereas communication built bonds and helped solidify Berhalter's in-group, Pochettino seems to hope the lack of communication outside camps now makes any player believe he can break into the group — or fall out of it. It simplifies the job, in a way. Play well, perform your best, and there is no talking or explaining necessary.

Arfsten, who confirmed there's “not too much” contact between him and U.S. coaches outside camp, told The Athletic: “For the most part, you just got to talk with your performance.”

But the lack of communication outside of camp doesn't mean the staff doesn't value building bonds during their time together.

When Pochettino arrived last fall, as a $6 million man who'd coached and played at levels most of his players haven't, and who hadn't reached out to break ice, there was, perhaps, some discomfort between them. The early days, defender Tim Ream later said, were “a learning process.”

Pochettino and his staff “kind of come off as intimidating when you first come into camp, because they have such a good CV, and they've coached some of the best players in the world,” defender Chris Richards admitted this summer.

What Richards and others learned throughout the Gold Cup, though, is that, “once you finally get to meet them, you understand that they're all just big teddy bears.” After 36 days together, Richards said, the “coaching staff and players are starting to really understand each other.”

Pochettino's bet, essentially, is that the understanding and bonds can be built in camp, when players and staff are actually together. The building is complicated by inevitable absences and truncated time frames. But it happened this past summer, and perhaps it can happen over the next nine months.

Ream, who has often been Pochettino's captain, heaped praise on the coaches for how they went about building those relationships during the Gold Cup, in their first extended time with the team.

“Whether (a player is) first on the starting 11 or if they haven't played a minute, the treatment of everybody is the exact same,” Ream said.

“I think as camps have gone on, you get a better understanding of them as people,” he later continued. “You get a better understanding of their communication styles, their coaching styles. Their interpersonal relationship that they have with each player is very different. And you start to have those interactions enough, and more and more, you start to get (to a point where) you're not thinking as much. … The interactions off the field have gone a long way in helping guys feel a lot more relaxed.

“Just the way they (the coaches) are, and as the camps have gone on, it has helped a lot of guys calm down and just be themselves more and more.”

U.S. Soccer says it is “monitoring the situation in Morocco” and “no changes have been made” ahead of the U-17 Women's World Cup later this month, which will feature the U.S. women's national team's youth squad.

The tournament kicks off in 11 days in Morocco, where youth-led, anti-government protests have disrupted major cities across the North African nation.

The U-17 women's World Cup, which features three NWSL players who were called up for Team USA, will be staged in its entirety in the city of Rabat, the nation's capital. However, as some players were saying goodbye to their clubs to join their federations, protests continued to intensify, and Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch said by Thursday, at least three were killed.

The demonstrations have been fueled by growing anger over heavy spending on preparations for FIFA's 2030 men's World Cup, rather than on public services. Morocco, Spain and Portugal are jointly hosting the competition.

The protests, inspired by similar youth-led demonstrations in Asia and Latin America, began on Sept. 27 after the loosely organized, anonymous group known as “Gen Z 212” made calls through social media platforms like Discord for better education and healthcare. Protests have since spread to several major cities, and on Sunday continued for the ninth consecutive night.

The U-17 Women's World Cup begins on Oct. 17 with an opening match between Morocco and Brazil at Olympic Stadium in Rabat. In its ninth edition, only five nations have ever lifted the competition's trophy, with North Korea the reigning champions. Twenty-four nations are participating, including the U.S., which has never won the event.

The Athletic asked the federation whether changes were made to travel and security or if it had been in communication with FIFA as a result of the ongoing protests.

“Our security team is aware and is closely monitoring the situation in Morocco,” a U.S. Soccer spokesperson said. “No changes have been made at this time.”

FIFA has not responded to questions for this story as of Monday afternoon.

Morocco has been heavily investing in its efforts to grow as a footballing nation. In addition to the U17 women's World Cup, which ends Nov. 8, Morocco will host the men's Africa Cup of Nations in December. Over the summer, Morocco also hosted a belated edition of the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco was also awarded multi-year hosting rights last year for the U-17 women's World Cup. This year's tournament will mark the first time an African nation will host the competition, with Morocco scheduled to host the event annually through 2029.

“Football in Morocco has gone from strength to strength in recent years,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a news release last year. “While the men's team reached the last four at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the women's team has made such impressive strides, thanks to the support of the government and the Moroccan Football Association, and the talent of the players.

“I believe hosting the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup over five years will inspire so many more girls — and boys — to take up football in the country, and as it is the first time the tournament comes to Africa, that inspiration will spread right across the continent.”

Nine months after that statement, FIFA revealed that Morocco would co-host the men's World Cup in 2030 with Spain and Portugal. The youth-led protests over the 2030 competition have centered around the heavy spending linked to the men's World Cup.

According to The New York Times, police said in a statement they were forced to act in self-defense after protesters tried to storm a police building and seize weapons, during which two people were killed. The authorities did not say how the third person died.

The prime minister said in a televised address on Thursday that his government was ready for a “dialogue and discussion within institutions and public spaces,” The New York Times reported. Demonstrators demanded he step down instead, with Gen Z 212 on social media saying the killings amounted to “a serious human rights violation.”

The group has denounced the violence, Reuters reported on Friday, and called for new, peaceful protests in major cities.

...

This World Cup cycle began for the U.S. men's national soccer team with young holdovers from the Qatar adventure, new players seeking opportunity and, without fanfare, veteran center back Tim Ream, the oldest member of the 2022 squad.

At the time it seemed clear the St. Louis native would remain on the scene to, for all intents and purposes, help bridge the gap and offer stability ahead of soccer's jamboree coming to North America in 2026.

Along the way, however, Ream kept his place — for interim coaches, for Gregg Berhalter's second tenure and now for Mauricio Pochettino.

[Yahoo Sports TV is here! Watch live shows and highlights 24/7]

And with eight months and three training camps remaining before the World Cup squad is set, 38-year-old Tim Ream appears almost certain to not only make Pochettino's roster, but remain in contention to start in the Group D opener June 12, 2026, at SoFi Stadium in greater Los Angeles.

“I know I said after the last World Cup that, OK, it could be my very first and last,” the Charlotte FC player said Monday, one day after celebrating his birthday. “And, you know, here we are.”

The former Fulham standout was among 26 players invited to camp in Austin, Texas, ahead of Friday's friendly against Ecuador. Next comes Australia on Oct. 14 in the Denver suburbs.

Through 14 U.S. matches this year, Ream leads the team in minutes played and is second to left back Max Arfsten in starts. In all 10 starting assignments, Ream has worn the captain's armband.

“When I think of Tim, I think of poise, I think of leadership, I think of control in every aspect,” U.S. midfielder Cristian Roldan said. “He brings a different aura to the team, and he creates a really good environment, a really welcoming environment for a lot of guys. That's the type of leader we need.”

That Ream remains a pivotal piece after playing every minute at the 2022 tournament could be received in different ways. On the positive side, he continues to offer the experience, leadership and wisdom vital to World Cup preparation and the actual competition for a program still finding its way on the international scene.

On the flip side, the lack of positional depth has left Ream almost indispensable — even with his physical limitations. “Listen: We all know I'm not the quickest,” he said with a smile.

At the moment, with World Cup veterans Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson not at full strength, Ream and Crystal Palace's Chris Richards are the only sure bets on a backline that could include two or three center backs. The other central defenders in camp are Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers, Toulouse's Mark McKenzie and FC Cincinnati's Miles Robinson.

Should someone supplant Ream, “I'm the old guy in the corner, handing out orange slices and giving pep talks to these guys,” he said. “Then, OK, I've still contributed something to the team environment, to the culture, but my aim and my goal is to be starting games. Whether that happens or not is obviously down to me, but then also down to other decisions and down to other players and their form, as well.”

Selection to next summer's squad would make Ream the oldest U.S. player at a World Cup since the program began qualifying regularly for the tournament in 1990. In 1994, Fernando Clavijo was 38, but four months younger than Ream would be next summer.

Asked Monday to share tips about career longevity, Ream said, “I don't think we have long enough to sit here and go through everything. To be honest, find a good girl to have your back and settle down with her.”

Kristin, his wife of more than 13 years, is also a former Saint Louis University soccer player.

On the field, Ream stressed the importance of “finding things that work for you,” he said. “What works for me isn't going to work for Christian [Pulisic]. What works for Christian probably wouldn't work for me. It's finding even the small things that help you along in that path. Adaptability is a huge one — being able to adapt to different coaching styles, to different managers, to different leagues.”

Ream adapted last year, when, late in the MLS season, he signed with Charlotte after more than 12 years in England with Bolton Wanderers and Fulham. Under English coach Dean Smith, Charlotte enters the international break in fourth place in the 15-team Eastern Conference and assured of a playoff berth. The Queen City side recently boasted a nine-game winning streak, tying a league record.

Ream's ability to extend his career — both at the club and international level — has inspired his teammates.

“He's essentially revitalized his national team career at an older age, and it provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here, to really believe that I could get here,” said Roldan, 30, a 2022 World Cup player who, until last month, had gone more than two years without a call-up. “He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level, but sustain that throughout your career. And what Tim brings to the team is something that is really hard to replace.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Three Men's National Teams (U-20, U-19, U-17) to Train and Play Matches in Spain from Oct. 6-15

LOS ANGELES (Saturday, Oct. 4, 2025) – In a testament to the quality and commitment to excellence of the LA Galaxy Academy, 10 First Team and Academy products have been called up to participate in both international and domestic training camps.

LA Galaxy defenders Riley Dalgado (U-20), Jose ‘Pepe' Magana, Jr. (U-19), Harbor Miller (U-19), midfielders Dylan Vanney (U-19), Vicente Garcia (U-17 2009s), and forwards Ruben Ramos, Jr. (U-19), and Aaron Medina (U-17 2009s), will all be participating in their respective international training camps to be held in Spain during the October FIFA window.

In addition, LA Galaxy Academy defender Enrique Martinez and midfielder Mateo Tsakiris were called up to the U-17 Men's National Team (2008s) domestic camp in Fayetteville, GA from Oct. 6-10. The camp is the team's last gathering before the final 21-player roster is selected for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup this November in Qatar.

These camps are a part of the Federation's continued focus on the U.S. Way philosophy, which emphasizes increased programming for Youth National Teams to create more opportunities for young players to advance through the pathway to the senior National Team with the goal of representing their country at a world championship.

Notably, Alexsander Menedez (U-17 2009s) was also called in to camp with the U-17 Men's El Salvador National Team. The camp will be held in El Salvador in October.

The LA Galaxy Academy passionately believes in whole child development. The club provides a robust enrichment program including nutrition education, cognitive development, and college preparation. All these experiences are intentionally curated by experts who work with the LA Galaxy First Team, so Academy players are exposed to a well-rounded experience as they develop into young adults.

Cristian Roldan has said that positional stability and the confidence from a standout FIFA Club World Cup has led to him playing the best soccer of his life — and a revival with the U.S. men's national team.

The Seattle Sounders midfielder was a late addition to the USMNT roster for last month's friendlies against South Korea and Japan, his first call-up since the 2023 Gold Cup.

Roldan played the final half hour in a 2-0 defeat against Korea and then went the distance in a 2-0 win over Japan.

Those displays helped the 2022 World Cup veteran earn a recall for this month's matches against Ecuador and Australia.

Roldan has appeared to quickly leapfrog several competitors in central midfield to give himself a real shot to make a second straight World Cup roster.

Amid another standout campaign in MLS, the 30-year-old was asked Monday about how he's managed to revitalize his USMNT career.

""I think establishing myself as a one-position player has helped me a ton,"" Roldan said on a call with the media.

""I think that I benefited a whole lot from being able to play multiple positions in the last World Cup cycle, being able to fit into different tactical formations and positions. But now I've been able to hone in on being a center midfielder, a deep-lying midfielder and I think that's helped me tremendously — just being able to widen my range of passing, direct traffic, be a leader.

""The game has slowed down quite a bit for me and it's helped me a ton. I feel like I'm playing the best soccer of my life, but I've got to continue in this way.""

Roldan said his confidence was boosted by a standout display this summer at the Club World Cup, where he impressed against powerhouse sides Atlético Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Botafogo.

After the tournament ended, Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer was full of praise for Roldan after he went toe-to-toe with some of the world's best.

""We should be talking about this for years to come because these three games …[especially] against Botafogo and Atlético, [Roldan] was the best player on the field,"" Schmetzer said.

Roldan said that the three matches in June proved to him that he can perform on the biggest stage.

""I think FIFA Club World Cup helped me tremendously,"" Roldan added. ""It really gave me the confidence that I can play against the very best in the world. Holding my own against teams like PSG and Atlético really gave me a lot of confidence.

""I'm playing with a lot of confidence right now. I really believe that I can help this team. I really believe that I can make a World Cup squad.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"

The US men's national team open their October international window by facing Ecuador at Austin FC's Q2 Stadium on Friday night.

After welcoming Ecuador, the USMNT meet Australia on Oct. 14 at the Colorado Rapids' Dicks Sporting Goods Park.

Both nations are among the 18 countries already qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host alongside Canada and Mexico.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino has named 10 MLS players to his 26-man roster, which is highlighted by Europe-based standouts Christian Pulisic (AC Milan), Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson (Fulham) and Chris Richards (Crystal Palace).

The MLS call-ups include goalkeepers Matt Turner (New England Revolution) and Matt Freese (New York City FC), who are vying for the No. 1 spot.

Orlando City right back Alex Freeman was again selected, along with All-Star midfielder Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake). Additionally, Seattle Sounders FC midfielder Cristian Roldan returns for a second straight camp.

The USMNT are trying to continue the good vibes from last month's 2-0 win over Japan. Beforehand, Pochettino's team had consistently struggled against opponents in the FIFA World Rankings top 25.

The FIFA Club World Cup concludes this week with the semifinals and final in New Jersey.

Fluminense and Chelsea lock horns on Tuesday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, before Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain contest the other match a day later at the same venue.

The winners of those semifinals will meet in the final on Sunday. Traditionally, the teams beaten in the last four would play a third-place game the day before. However, in the expanded 2025 competition, things are being done a little differently.

The Sporting News looks at FIFA's decision on a Club World Cup bronze-medal match and what it might mean for the World Cup next year.

MORE:Full Club World Cup results and schedule | How the prize money works

There is no third-place playoff game at the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. This is despite the fact that a bronze-medal game was commonplace at the annual seven-team tournament that preceded the new format.

That means this week's beaten semifinalists will not have to stay in the United States to prepare for an additional fixture.

FIFA decided not to include a bronze-medal playoff game at the expanded tournament so that participating clubs could resume their domestic commitments as soon as they had been eliminated.

The sport's governing body said: ""For the inaugural edition of the this elite global competition, FIFA decided not to include this match to ensure that clubs and players who do not make the final can transition to their next commitments as soon as possible.""

The decision seems entirely sensible and was perhaps motivated by some of the opposition towards the Club World Cup expansion. Certainly, the majority of competing sides would not have wanted to stay in the U.S. for an additional few days after losing a semifinal simply to play in a third-place game: Fluminense are partway through their 2025 season in Brazil, while Chelsea, Real Madrid and PSG all have preseason programmes due to start in the coming week or so.

The men's World Cup in 2026 will include a third-place playoff, despite the decision not to stage such a game at the Club World Cup.

The international tournament, which will be played across the United States, Canada and Mexico, will see an expanded field of 48 national teams compete from June 11 to July 19 next year. The bronze-medal game between the losing semifinalists will take place on July 18 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.

Tickets to see games in Seattle are starting at more than $300.

When Seattle was first named a World Cup 2026 host city, most local soccer fans seemed absolutely joyous. The world's biggest sporting event was about to be played in our backyard and local organizers eagerly pointed out that it would be the rough equivalent of hosting six Super Bowls in the span of a couple of weeks.

Turns out, they may have been talking about ticket prices.

Over the last few days, FIFA has started notifying fans who entered the Visa presale lottery if they were selected, and those lucky individuals have been met with a bit of sticker shock.

Although tickets theoretically start at $60 for “Category 4”, by Monday no such tickets were available for any of the six Seattle matches. In fact, there aren't even any Category 3 tickets available, nor are any seats at all available for the United States' group stage game that's scheduled for June 19. It was not immediately clear if that's because those tickets sold out or because FIFA is holding them back for a later release. What are available are Category 1 and 2 tickets which range in price from $310-$410 for the three non-USMNT group stage games. Only Category 2 tickets are available for the Round of 32, which costs $440, while tickets for the Round of 16 match range from $485-$660.

While those ticket prices might not be totally outrageous for a major sporting event by today's standard, what's different about these is that fans are buying them blind to both who will be playing and where they'll be seated. Category 1, for instance, is the entire lower bowl, while Category 2 is the entire 300 section between the corner flags.

Whether or not these tickets prove to be a “good” deal likely depends on the draw. FIFA has announced that they'll be using “dynamic” pricing, which theoretically means prices could go up or down depending on demand. They used a similar scheme for the Club World Cup and ended up almost giving tickets away for some games, while charging a premium for others. But there's at least one more round of sales before the draw even takes place. If you're hoping to attend World Cup games with your family without spending thousands of dollars, you're going to have to be patient.","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino agreed to hold the World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. This decision was forged during a conversation at a Club World Cup match

WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) — The plan started coming together inside a luxury box at MetLife Stadium.

As the Premier League's Chelsea was on its way to a shutout victory at the Club World Cup final in July, President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were deep in discussion at the New Jersey sports complex outside New York City on another matter: where the draw for next year's World Cup would be held.

The high-drama spectacle decides which teams will face each other in the group stage of soccer's most prestigious tournament, along with the schedule for competition. It was widely expected to unfold in Las Vegas, home to the 1994 draw when the U.S. last hosted the World Cup and a natural backdrop for glitz. But since at least March, officials had privately discussed bringing the draw to Washington, home to a showman president who regularly hugs the spotlight associated with sports. 

So during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year's World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital — namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.

“During that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we're going to do this, we've got to do it now,” Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. “That's when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.”

The collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as “probably the most respected man in sports."" The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

Tickets are now open to fans as major questions hang over the tournament, including how welcome visitors from some countries will be in the U.S. amid its immigration crackdown. Even as the White House pledges openness, Trump has added another uncertainty by suggesting he could move games from cities he thinks are unsafe. 

Despite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady's garden during Trump's first term. 

Trump's interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Nothing excites Trump like hosting a major event, and Giuliani recalled that, at the time, the president and his aides were almost wistful that he wouldn't be in the White House when the tournament arrived, assuming he would be well into a post-presidency following an immediate second term.

Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. Infantino, who was also serving his first term as FIFA president, made an impression by handing Trump red and yellow penalty cards, joking they could be used on the press. 

The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures. 

During a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA's home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president “my great friend.” Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries. 

The ceremony happened as Infantino was aligning FIFA's sporting and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It followed a pattern of Infantino, much like Trump, cozying up to autocratic leaders. 

Infantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. Visiting Putin at the Kremlin with a group of soccer greats during the tournament, Infantino said he felt “like a child in a toy shop” in Russia. He collected the Russian Order of Friendship from Putin the following year.

Infantino would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.

As the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump's hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino's ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, a fleeting moment FIFA captured with one photo on its website.

Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women's World Cup in July 2023. 

Preparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Biden White House was also careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup. Instead, it negotiates individually with each of the 11 U.S. host cities on security, ticketing and other matters. 

Infantino visited the White House while Biden was president at least once, meeting for about an hour in 2024 with then-national security adviser Jake Sullivan, an avid soccer fan. Biden officials emphasized to Infantino that they wanted to ensure the host cities ultimately benefited from holding World Cup matches and that the U.S.'s human rights values would be respected.

Trump's disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.

Since that victory, Infantino's embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a “winner” in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Meanwhile, FIFA has set up shop at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Infantino worked last month as world leaders gathered nearby for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Infantino and Trump met again last week in New York, along with first lady Melania Trump, according to the FIFA president's Instagram account. 

Infantino has teased the idea of Trump doing the draw himself, which Giuliani called the “MAGA-FIFA World Cup draw.” 

“Just like a great opera, there will be high drama,” Giuliani said. 

Infantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport's heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader's schedule and social media posts. He was late for his own FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May because he was with Trump and the Saudi crown prince in the Middle East, a move seen as disrespectful of his own voters and criticized by Europe's soccer federations.

During Infantino's most recent appearance at Trump's side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president, saying it was “for winners only.” 

That handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.

A White House official said the trophy remains in the White House's possession. 

No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico's President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.

The episode is a reminder of how Infantino can shift with the moment. The man who remarked in Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in November 2022 that “today, I feel (like) a migrant worker” — comments interpreted as solidarity with migrants — was laughing along with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year as they bantered about migrants being unable to scale the repainted wall on the U.S. southern border.

Infantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as “crucial” to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments. Trump's suggestion that he could move the host cities was a reminder that Infantino is working with a famously impulsive president whose whims could expose FIFA to logistical havoc and legal jeopardy if he followed through. 

Even without those threats, those involved with World Cup planning said the tournament's stakes are high because it's the first in a series of global sporting events hosted by the U.S., including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

“This needs to go well in order to show the world that if you want to have the best sports and entertainment events, you want to have them in the United States,” said Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee. “I don't think it's unusual for a White House to be coordinating and be involved, and I don't think it's unusual for the heads of state and for the president to be excited and to be talking about a mega event coming here.”

					Facts Are Stubborn Things				

A coalition of community organizations and documentary filmmaker Billy Corben on Thursday called again on FIFA and Miami-Dade to use their influence to protect soccer fans from federal immigration agents roaming stadiums during next year's World Cup tournament.

At a demonstration in front of FIFA's Coral Gables office, they pressured officials to protect World Cup attendees from “overzealous immigration enforcement” and to reinvest Miami-Dade County tax dollars set aside for the World Cup into the local community. They held a similar protest in June.

“Miami-Dade is a proud county of immigrants, and we are subsidizing the World Cup with over $60 million in public cash and resources,” Corben said during Thursday's press conference. “In a year in which we suffered a $400 million budget deficit, Mayor Daniella Levine Cava is failing us all.”

The activists say their fears about immigration agents are warranted, citing last week's New York Times report that revealed “FIFA was alerted to 145 human rights concerns at Club World Cup games, including federal policies and enforcement.”

The Times reported there were complaints of alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at stadiums during the tournament.

“We unequivocally believe that any human rights plan that does not include protections for fans who are immigrants living in the United States or visiting the country is incomplete, and we urge the Miami Host Committee to commit to no immigration enforcement in or near the stadiums during the games,” the activists said in a statement announcing Thursday protest.

They warn that the stakes are too high in a state with an aggressive posture toward immigration.

“The potential for due process abuses, racial profiling, and for fans to lose their liberties and freedoms is far too great,” they said, noting that the backdrop in Florida “includes the reopening of the Everglades [Alligator Alcatraz] facility and news of a Mexican national on a tourist visa who was detained and deported.”

“The Trump Administration's recent immigration policies have affected both staff and fans,” they said. “The time for FIFA to act is now.”

Since the first protest on June 30, activists said an official of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Miami Host Committee contacted them, according to Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, Policy Coordinator with American Friends Service Committee. She said no meeting date with FIFA has been set.

“This is an international game. They need to meet with people who deal with immigrants,” Mendez-Zamora told WLRN.

She added: “I want to be in the stadium with my family screaming, but it's not worth it if it means people are going to be taken [into federal custody].”

Amy Morales, director of advocacy and policy for Engage Miami, said community nonprofits had to fight for full funding before county commissioners at the same time the World Cup was getting $46 million in subsidies from the county.

“What we're saying here today is that we do not want our taxpayer dollars funding the separation of families — funding deportations,” Morales said to WLRN.

Luna Plaza, a migrant justice committee member of the Florida Student Power Network attended both protests. The University of Miami student said she was disappointed activists were not able to speak with FIFA after the first demonstration but hopes that the second one will prompt a meeting.

“Sports, in general, shapes all of our lives,” Plaza told WLRN. “It's really saddening to hear that so many safe spaces are being taken away for undocumented folks — including sports. It's just really messed up.”

Who has qualified for FIFA World Cup 2026? Updated list of nations confirmed for tournament in USA, Canada and Mexico originally appeared on The Sporting News

The next FIFA World Cup is just nine months away, with the United States, Canada and Mexico poised to host the 23rd edition in 2026.

Lionel Messi completed his long and occasionally tortuous path to glory with Argentina at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. La Albiceleste have since retained their Copa America title and are leading the way in CONMEBOL qualifying for the next World Cup.

The 2026 tournament will be the first time 48 teams have competed at the World Cup finals, expanding from the 32-team format that was used at seven consecutive tournaments from 1998 to 2022.

That means the equation has changed for teams looking to qualify from the six regional confederations — AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA. So, what does the road to the 2026 World Cup look like?

Each confederation has more slots available under the expanded format. The AFC has double the qualification spots it had at Qatar 2022, up from four guaranteed places to eight, while there will be nine African nations instead of five.

CONCACAF will have at least double its 2022 representatives, up from three to six, although half of those slots are accounted for by the United States, Mexico and Canada qualifying automatically as hosts. As was the case at the previous World Cup, two slots will be decided via an inter-continental playoff.

Of note, Uzbekistan and Jordan both qualified for their first-ever World Cup appearances in the summer of 2025. By finishing top two in their group in the third round of AFC qualification, they secured an automatic bid to the competition.

The AFCbegan its crucial third round of qualification in September 2024. Eighteen teams were split across three six-team groups to contest 10 games in a round-robin format. The top two in each of Group A, B and C qualify automatically for the World Cup.

Japan were the first confirmed qualifiers from the Asian section, already assured of a place in the top two of Group C by the middle of the March international break. Iran soon followed them in securing their spot via Group A, and Uzbekistan secured their first-ever World Cup spot by finishing second behind Iran.

The teams placed third and fourth in each group will advance to a fourth round that is split between two groups of three, with each team to face each of the opponents in its group once in October 2025. The two group winners will progress directly to the World Cup, with the runners-up contesting a two-leg playoff in November 2025 to decide which AFC representative will advance to the intercontinental playoff.

Nine groups of six teams play each other home and away in Africa. The winner of each section at the end of the 10 games progresses directly to the World Cup.

The four best runners-up from the initial round-robin phase enter into a playoff, with the winner going forward to the intercontinental playoff as CAF's representative.

CONCACAF began the second round of its qualification phase in June 2024, with 30 teams drawn into six groups of five. Each team will play every opponent in their group once, with two away games and two home games once the phase concludes in June 2025.

The top two in each group advance to the 12-team third round, where there will be three groups of four. Beginning in September 2025, the nations in each group play one another home and away. The three group winners advance to the World Cup, with the two best-ranked runners-up going into the intercontinental playoff.

South America has retained its celebrated marathon World Cup qualification round, with all 10 of the confederation's countries playing one another home and away in a gruelling league format.

The expanded World Cup means qualification is a little easier, with the top six advancing automatically and the seventh-placed team entering the intercontinental playoff, probably as favourite.

Argentina clinched their place at the finals thanks to a memorable 4-1 demolition of arch rivals Brazil.

The 2026 World Cup is the first time the OFC has been guaranteed a representative at the finals. The second round, running across October and November 2024, saw two groups of four playing for the four spots in round three.

The top two in each round-two group advanced to a three-match playoff in March 2025. New Caledonia defeated Tahiti in the first semifinal, with New Zealand thrashing Fiji 7-0 in the other.

New Zealand then claimed the automatic qualifying place by winning the OFC final 3-0. New Caledonia will enter the inter-confederation playoffs, so they have another chance to get their, albeit a slim one.

Twelve of UEFA's 16 spots will be taken by the group winners from the initial format of four or five-team groups. The 12 runners-up, along with the four best UEFA Nations League group winners that finished outside of the top two in their World Cup qualifying groups, enter the playoffs.

Those 16 teams will be drawn into four paths with two single-game rounds. The seeded teams will be at home in the semifinals, with a home nation for the four finals to be drawn prior to the match. The winners from each path advance to the World Cup. UEFA is the only confederation without a representative in the inter-continental playoff.

The two teams in the six-nation playoff with the highest FIFA ranking will be seeded. The four unseeded teams play an effective semifinal, with the two winners progressing to face a seed apiece to decide the final two places at the World Cup.

The four-game playoff will be used as a World Cup test event and played in one or more of the host countries.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on June 11, with co-hosts Mexico in action at the Azteca, which hosted the 1970 and 1986 World Cup finals.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The overall span of 40 days will make this the longest World Cup in history, with the 48 finalists contesting a total of 104 matches.

Fifa is promising the biggest and best World Cup ever in 2026, but will that really be the case?

Fifa president Gianni Infantino has repeatedly insisted that ""the world will be welcome"" during next summer's men's World Cup, which will be held mostly by the USA, with some matches in Canada and Mexico.

""We'll bring the world to the United States of America,"" the Swiss said earlier this year. ""The world loves America, whatever some might say.""

But the nearer the start of the tournament draws, the more scrutiny is being placed on whether the USA will be quite as welcoming as Infantino insists.

With political violence on the rise, state troops deployed to major cities by President Donald Trump, and a more hardline stance taken on immigration, the tournament's main host nation is in a state of division and disruption.

As ticket sales begin and fans make travel plans, BBC Sport explores some of the issues causing concern.

Last week the first batch of tickets for next summer's matches went on sale, with more than 4.5 million fans entering a draw for a chance to buy them. 

Immediately, Fifa's approach to pricing drew significant backlash.

Fifa has not formally revealed a full price list, but they are being listed online by fans who were successful in the draw after spending hours in digital queues last week.

General admission tickets are being split into four categories, with those for the first match in the USA costing between $560 (£417) and $2,235 (£1,662). At the last World Cup in Qatar, the opening match was priced between $55 (£41) and $618 (£460).

The cheapest ticket for the 2026 final costs $2,030 (£1,510), and the most expensive is $6,000 (£4,462). Hospitality tickets, meanwhile, are yet to go on sale but will almost certainly be priced significantly higher.

Some tickets for matches early in the tournament - in a few of the less prestigious locations - are available for $60 (£44), but stadium map images show they are a tiny proportion of available seats.

The Athletic also reports, external that Fifa will also implement 15% charges on both the buyer and seller of tickets resold via its official platform.

Fifa did not respond to questions put forward by the BBC.

""These prices are astonishing - $2,030 for the cheapest final ticket is unacceptable,"" said Thomas Concannon, who leads the Football Supporters Association's England Fans' Embassy.

""If fans are successful in obtaining a category four ticket from the first game to the last, that could set them back $3,180 (£2,363) at least. That is more than double what Qatar cost.

""Combined with travel and accommodation, this will be the most expensive World Cup for match-going fans we've ever seen by some distance.""

Fifa is also adopting a 'dynamic' pricing model for the tournament, meaning ticket prices for matches deemed high demand could be raised significantly during later sales periods.

The system has the potential to benefit Americans while locking out foreign fans.

""Dynamic pricing has really been a thing here for more than a decade,"" said Scott Friedman, found of the Ticket Talk Network in the USA. ""For Fifa, it's supply and demand - they are trying to maximise their revenue.

""The system gives an advantage to American citizens who can maybe buy a resale ticket for a game which has less demand at much less than face value 48 hours before a match. 

""People can't really travel from overseas to do that. The system is not fair for the rest of the world and could definitely price out people from other countries.""

The 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium in Rutherford, New Jersey will host the final of the 2026 World Cup

During his previous term in office, when the World Cup bid was accepted, Trump signed a letter insisting that ""all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination"".

Some fans, including those from the UK and EU, will be able to travel to the World Cup without a visa. That is because 42 territories are in the USA's Visa Waiver Program, meanings fans will only need to apply via the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, which is usually approved or rejected within 72 hours.

But citizens of most countries, especially those in Asia, Africa and South America - including plenty who have either already secured qualification for the World Cup or are likely do so - do have to apply for visas.

While Russia and Qatar implemented visa fast-track processes at the previous two editions of the World Cup, the USA has not done so.

Fans hoping to attend matches must apply and enter the same queue as other visitors to the US, and can face delays so long that they may be unable to be approved for a visa in time to attend the tournament.

Applications for US visas usually involve at least one face-to-face interview at an embassy, and the Trump administration has increased its officials' powers to investigate applicants' social media use and public political statements.

As things stand, average wait times for an initial tourist visa interview for some countries are well over a year.

Last week the State Department announced it will increase staffing levels at some embassies in order to try to process applications more quickly, but hasn't revealed which countries or how many staff.

""We have a long way to go before we're ready to welcome the world,"" said Travis Murphy, a former State Department diplomat and founder of Jetr Global Sports, which helps international athletes access US visas.

""The current administration has been outspoken in terms of limiting international travel, and putting restrictions into some processes to make it more difficult.

""The visa process in the USA has not been very clear or efficient for decades. The regulations really haven't changed that much - how strictly some of the rules are enforced is really what is [important] here.

""You also have this over-arching view that maybe people aren't welcome or are unsafe here. I don't think that's accurate, but I can see why international audiences would have that perception.

""I would hate to see our country put itself in a position where future events might be pulled away because of how we handle this.""

The current wait time for a US visa interview, in which applicants have to convince an individual official that their visit should be permitted, is up to 15 months in Colombia

There have been a series of political assassinations in the USA so far in 2025, and there were around 500 mass shootings across the country in 2024.

Forced deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have also increased on the orders of Trump, who has deployed National Guard troops in Democrat-led cities, including Los Angeles, which will host eight matches. 

ICE and National Guard deployments have drawn mass protests from distrustful communities in some cities, and Trump has threatened to force matches to be moved from cities he deems ""unsafe"".

""There is no question the divisions in the United States are considerable,"" says Daniel Byman, director of the Warfare, Irregular Threats, and Terrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an American think tank. ""On different issues, depending on the day, the president or some of his key people are trying to push a more polarised agenda. There is a lot of anger.

""With the Trump administration, there are lot of 'we don't know' answers in terms of security, because they don't yet have much of a track record for big events.

""There has been a pretty steady dismantling of a lot of the government agencies - cuts at the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. With that comes not only loss of people, but loss of institutional knowledge.

""There are lots of individuals who can be disruptive and dangerous. And the United States, of course, has ready access to firearms in a way that most countries do not.""

FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani has fired back at President Donald Trump after he threatened to move World Cup games from some United States cities.

Montagliani said last week that Trump has no say in where games are played, according to ESPN.

“It's FIFA's tournament, FIFA's jurisdiction, FIFA makes those decisions,” he said at a sports business conference in London, per ESPN.

Montagliani added that the World Cup is bigger than Donald Trump or any other individual.

“With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans,” he continued. “That's the beauty of our game, is that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.”

Montagliani‘s comments came after Trump threatened to move games from some United States cities based on crime rates.

Trump said last month that he won't hesitate to move games if he feels like a host city is unsafe.

“Any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup, or for the Olympics… but for the World Cup in particular, because they're playing in so many cities, we won't allow it,"" Donald Trump said. “We'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.”

However, according to Victor Montagliani that is not his decision.

Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle are set to host World Cup games.

In addition to the 11 United States sites, 2026 World Cup games will also be held in Canada and Mexico.

Demand for World Cup tickets is surging despite sky-high prices. (Carl De Souza / AFP via Getty Images)

FIFA raised ticket prices for at least nine 2026 World Cup games after just one full day of sales, in response to demand that seems undeterred by record-setting price tags.

FIFA officials confirmed last month that the governing body would use a “variable pricing” model for the tournament, which will take place next summer in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

The assumption was that most price adjustments would occur after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw, when matchups will be set and demand will increase for games involving popular teams. But on Friday, in the second window of the very first lottery phase, fans logged into FIFA's ticketing portal and already saw some prices that were slightly higher than the ones first revealed Wednesday. On Monday, in the third window, there were at least a few more upticks.

For the U.S. men's national team's second group game, for example, the Category 1 ticket price rose from $535 on Wednesday to $565 on Friday; the Category 3 ticket price rose from $185 to $205.

According to screenshots sent by fans to The Athletic, Category 1 prices also increased Friday by a similar amount — roughly 5% — for three of the four quarterfinals; at least three Round of 16 matches; the first Round of 32 match at SoFi Stadium in Southern California; and the USMNT's third group game, also at SoFi.

For the Round of 16 game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the Category 1 price jumped from $895 on Wednesday to $935 on Friday, then to $980 on Monday — at which point the game's entire first-phase allotment sold out.

For the fourth quarterfinal, in Kansas City, the Category 1 price rose from its original $1,125 to $1,180 on Monday; and the Category 2 price rose from $765 to $825.

The adjustments, the availability of tickets after 48 hours of purchasing, and exorbitant price listings on resale sites, suggest that some fans are more than willing to pay the prices that others have deemed “astonishing” and “unacceptable.”

Multiple fans who won the opportunity to purchase tickets on Monday told The Athletic that they ultimately didn't buy any — in some cases because prices were too high, in other cases because, after less than three full days of sales, nearly all coveted tickets were gone. By Monday evening, none were available for the Round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals or final.

FIFA made around 1 million tickets — roughly 15% of the total inventory — available in this first “Visa presale” phase. (More will be available for all games in later phases.) From a pool of around 4.5 million entrants, it randomly selected a lucky few for the first of several time slots: Wednesday at 11 a.m. ET to Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. Each buyer was limited to four tickets per match, and up to 40 in total. A second wave of entrants were then selected for a time slot beginning Friday and ending Saturday; a third wave now has a time slot beginning Monday and ending this coming Wednesday.

But within a few hours of the curtain raising last Wednesday, before most fans got through a digital queue, tickets to the final — priced from $2,030 to $6,730 — were no longer available. By Wednesday night, the thousands of tickets made available for Mexico's three group games were also gone.

By the end of that first 24-hour window, nearly all Category 4 allotments and many Category 3 allotments — the cheaper categories — had also sold out. By Monday, hardly any Category 3 tickets were available.

The sales likely confirmed suspicions that, despite the backlash to FIFA's initial prices, they were actually an underestimate of market value and demand.

And that is likely why some prices rose. “We will adapt prices as per the demand we see, as per the remaining inventory,” a FIFA official said last month. (Humans would make the decisions, he clarified, and prices wouldn't fluctuate every five minutes, but part of the process would involve automation.)

FIFA oversees global soccer and funnels a majority of its revenue back into the sport, and has been capitalizing on that excess World Cup demand in a variety of ways. The price increases were one method, but not the only one.

On Thursday, FIFA also launched its World Cup ticket resale platform, where some of Wednesday's buyers quickly listed tickets for several times the price they'd paid a day earlier. FIFA will take two 15% fees on every transaction on the platform, meaning it will earn $30 for every $100 spent.

Meanwhile, FIFA and its “digital collectibles platform,” FIFA Collect, have continued to promote “Right To Buy” tokens aggressively. As millions of fans were shut out of this first lottery phase, anxiously awaiting acceptance emails that haven't yet come, FIFA has sold many “RTB” tokens for hundreds or thousands of dollars apiece.

The tokens are, essentially, a costly shortcut to 2026 tickets, allowing buyers to bypass lotteries. They promise buyers the ability to purchase one or two World Cup tickets to a specific match, in an unknown section, for a to-be-determined full price.

“Owning an RTB does not include the cost of the ticket(s) itself,” FIFA Collect clarifies on an FAQ page. “It only gives you access to purchase the ticket(s).”

Still, fans have gobbled up the tokens. On Saturday, FIFA Collect went to market with its latest batch of RTBs. There were 12 available for Mexico's third group match, priced at $3,999 each, and they quickly sold out.

FIFA has made tens of millions of dollars selling the tokens. And according to spinoff websites, last week and the mid-September week of ticket lottery applications were FIFA Collect's two most lucrative weeks on record, with over $2 million in primary sales — mostly of RTBs — in each seven-day span.

RTB holders do not yet know when, or at what price, they'll be able to actually purchase tickets.

Any fan, meanwhile, will be able to enter the second 2026 World Cup ticket lottery, the “early ticket draw,” beginning Oct. 27. A third lottery phase will then open after the World Cup draw in December.

In this Visa presale phase, more entrants could be selected for purchasing windows between now and Oct. 21, but supply is waning. FIFA, it seems, will not replenish the inventory available until the opening of the second “early ticket” phase in a month.

As of Monday afternoon, only five of the 16 Round of 32 games had standard tickets available; 50 of the 72 group games — including the U.S. opener, priced at $2,735 in Category 1 and $1,940 in Category 2 — had some availability. And only three matches — two in Kansas City, one in Santa Clara, California (near San Francisco) — had any standard Category 3 availability.

If you're planning to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup, prepare for sticker shock.

The cheapest ticket to the final is already more than ten times what fans paid in Qatar just four years ago. And that is before prices begin rising through FIFA's controversial new dynamic pricing system.

The cost surge has made this edition of the World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, the most expensive in the tournament's history. Critics have said that it's becoming a competition only for those who can afford it. Final tickets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are now starting around $6,300. On the resale market, some are already listed for more than $25,000.

Supporters and politicians argue FIFA, despite being a nonprofit, is prioritizing revenue over access. Newsweek contacted FIFA for comment on Monday morning.

In September, FIFA confirmed it would introduce dynamic pricing for the first time in World Cup history. The system, familiar to fans of U.S. sports and air travel but largely foreign to European and South American soccer, adjusts ticket prices based on real-time demand. Group-stage tickets start at $60, while top-tier final seats are priced as high as $6,730. In Qatar, the highest price for a final ticket was $1,607.

“This is the first time in history FIFA has used dynamic pricing for a World Cup,” said Heimo Schirgi, FIFA's Chief Operating Officer for 2026, in an interview with ESPN. “Get your tickets early […] because anything could happen.”

That uncertainty has some fans concerned.

Under dynamic pricing, ticket prices rise or fall depending on demand, but few fans know what they're buying when sales begin. With the tournament schedule still incomplete, tickets are sold without team assignments. A $400 seat could land a fan at England versus Brazil or New Zealand against Uzbekistan. Stadium, city and team matchups remain unclear. That uncertainty makes early buying a gamble, but one many are still willing to take.

For some, this World Cup could be the last chance to witness greatness. Lionel Messi and his Argentina squad have already qualified. The 2026 tournament may mark the final World Cup appearance for one of the sport's all-time greats. Fans hoping to see Messi on the world's biggest stage are paying now, even without knowing if their tickets will put them in the right place at the right time.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the pricing model, pointing to examples where they have said dynamic pricing has helped fans. At the 2023 Club World Cup, also held in the U.S., tickets for a semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense dropped from $474 to just $13 within days.

“For us, the important element is to fill stadiums to give opportunities to people to come,” Infantino said.

But fan groups say that's little comfort for those who bought early. In East Rutherford, many were frustrated when they paid top dollar for what turned out to be an underwhelming matchup. Others who waited bought tickets for less than the cost of a stadium beer.

“This is not ‘make football truly global,' this is the privatization of what was once a tournament open to all,” said Ronan Evain, executive director of Football Supporters Europe, in an interview with The Athletic. “FIFA's leadership seems unable to understand that it needs fans in the stands. It needs life, the atmosphere, the colors, the diversity. None of this exists when you set such prices.”

The backlash has also grown louder with the rollout of FIFA's official resale platform. Unlike past tournaments where resale prices were capped at face value, FIFA is allowing uncapped resale in the U.S. and Canada. Some tickets to the final have already been listed for more than $25,000. FIFA will also collect 15 percent from both the buyer and seller on each transaction, taking 30 percent of every resale. At previous World Cups, combined fees were closer to 10 percent.

FIFA defends the model as aligned with standard ticketing practices in North America. In public statements, the organization has said that revenues from both primary and secondary sales will be reinvested into global soccer development. It has set a $13 billion revenue target for the 2023 to 2026 cycle, up from $7.6 billion during the four years leading to Qatar.

Some economists have argued that the approach, while unpopular, is economically sound.

In a commentary published by the Cato Institute, Ryan Bourne and Nathan Miller described dynamic pricing as a practical way to allocate limited seats in a complex, high-demand global tournament. “FIFA deserves a lot of criticism,” they wrote, “but its pricing proposal at least acknowledges the real-world trade-offs that this complex event must navigate.”

They noted that by allowing prices to move with demand, FIFA ensures that tickets go to those most willing to pay. The system can also work in the fans' favor when interest is low. They cited the example of tickets at the Club World Cup in New Jersey dropping from $474 to $13 in the final hours before kickoff. According to the Cato economists, dynamic pricing is not about targeting individual fans, but responding to market-wide interest.

“Empty stands don't look good, and electric audiences drive food, drink, and merch sales,” they wrote.

They also acknowledged the downsides of the pricing system. Prices for similar seats can vary widely depending on when a ticket is purchased. “Some fans could purchase tickets at vastly different prices to other fans for similar seats,” the economists wrote. For supporters with limited means, that unpredictability could make access less equal.

Democratic New York State Assemblyman and mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani has become one of the most vocal political critics of FIFA's strategy. He launched a campaign titled “Game Over Greed,” calling on FIFA to end dynamic pricing, reinstate resale caps and reserve 15 percent of tickets for local residents at discounted prices.

“The biggest sporting event in the world is happening in our backyard,” Mamdani said, “but most New Yorkers will be priced out of watching it live.”

As pressure builds, FIFA has shown no signs of altering course. 

“We're looking at optimizing revenue, but also optimizing attendance,” Schirgi told ESPN. “It's always a balance between different factors.”

GOAL US unpacks the main weekend storylines from the Premier League, La Liga and other top competitions in The Euro XI

Thank you, Estevao, for giving us a title race. This needed to happen. Liverpool had to lose. Someone else had to win. Those around them also had to play their part. It has not been a pretty week on Merseyside. The Reds have dropped three in a row. Arsenal and Man City have responded with wins.

But that's kind of what it's all about. You shouldn't be able to walk to the title. This should be hard. The Premier League is on. 

The same goes for La Liga. Barca were good. Madrid were bad. Then the roles reversed. Neither side is particularly convincing, and no one really deserves to be top of the table - which is why Madrid have a two-point lead. The good news? This is now far more compelling. Wins there and losses for Barca all amounted to a fun weekend in Spain, too.

If we have learned one thing above anything else so far in the Premier League this season, it is to not turn off your television or leave your seat early. There was yet more late drama but this time champions Liverpool were the victims and not the beneficiaries of the added time as they were dealt a late sucker punch by Chelsea's Brazilian wonderkid Estevao.

Liverpool's dream start to the season has well and truly come to an end with three successive defeats in all competitions and Arsenal are now top of the league after a routine win over West Ham. The only downside for Mikel Arteta's side is their run of injuries and they will miss Martin Odegaard after he damaged knee ligaments, completing a dismal run of fitness issues for the Norwegian maestro.

injury is probably the only thing that could stop his compatriot Erling Haaland right now after Manchester City's hitman scored his 12th goal in nine matches to down Brentford and put Pep Guardiola's side just three points off the top spot. It was not a completely straightforward afternoon for City though as they were left sweating again on the fitness of Rodri.

Speaking of sweating, Antoine Semenyo is in red hot form for a Bournemouth side who had the lowest net spend in the league and yet look as strong as ever.

GOAL runs the rule over the British players earning a living away from their homeland, with plenty more stars deciding to leave the comforts of the United Kingdom in search of a better footballing life elsewhere. The Premier League is still obviously one of the world's most entertaining divisions and the Championship can prove fantastic for development, but there are more options out there.

While some homegrown heroes enjoyed a fruitful weekend, there were quite a few tales of woe to counteract them as well. Sometimes the grass isn't always greener, as it turns out.

Arthur Rinderknech earned his second consecutive victory against Alexander Zverev on Monday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he rallied past the German 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.

The Frenchman beat the World No. 3 in five sets at Wimbledon earlier this year and sent the 28-year-old packing once again with a front-footed display at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai. After losing the opening set, Rinderknech won 24 of 29 points at net in sets two and three and looked fresher in the deciding set, with Zverev regularly bending over between points.

Rinderknech has earned a career-best 23 wins in 2025 and is into the fourth round at an ATP Masters 1000 event for the third time. The 30-year-old, who is 3-18 against Top 10 opponents, reached that stage in Toronto and Paris last season.

""This is huge,"" Rinderknech said. ""I had my first Top 5 win at a Grand Slam at Wimbledon against Sascha and it happens again. I guess I am a bit lucky against him and able to play my best tennis. I need to play my best tennis to beat a guy like Sascha, at No. 3 for many years, such a steady player and a very good player. I am very happy.""

Rinderknech is up five spots to No. 49 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next play Jiri Lehecka after the Czech downed Denis Shapovalov 6-4, 6-4. Lehecka has advanced to the last 16 at six of the nine Masters 1000 events.
Zverev was the highest-ranked player left in the draw after Jannik Sinner retired on Sunday due to cramp. The German leaves Shanghai fourth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 1,475 points clear of 10th-placed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is the first player outside the Top 8 cut with ninth-placed Jack Draper sidelined for the rest of the season. Zverev is a two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion.

In other action, #NextGenATP American Learner Tien continued his good form with a 7-6(4), 6-3 triumph against Cameron Norrie. The lefty has won seven of his past eight matches, reaching his maiden ATP Tour final in Beijing last week. He will next play Daniil Medvedev in Shanghai, where he is competing at a career-high No. 36.
Tien saved eight of 10 break points in the match, including all six in the second set. Tien was up a break at 4-3 in the second set and was down love-40 before rallying to hold. He then broke Norrie for the fourth time in the match.
""I have a lot of confidence right now,"" Tien said. ""I have been able to steal some matches where I have been down pretty big and that really feeds my confidence going into these matches, I can find a way through. I think that is the biggest thing.""
Medvedev moved past Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 7-6(5) to reach the fourth round. The World No. 18 has fond memories in Shanghai, having won the title in 2019.

Nicolai Budkov Kjaer is quickly proving himself as one of the brightest young talents on the ATP Challenger Tour.


On Sunday, the 19-year-old claimed his fourth title of the season at the Open de Vendee in France, where he stormed past American Patrick Kypson 6-0, 6-3 in just 54 minutes. The Norwegian is now level with Borna Coric and Emilio Nava atop the 2025 Challenger-title leaderboard.


“I'm super grateful and super happy to get the trophy here,” said Budkov Kjaer. “It was a great week with a lot of great tennis played and it was a super nice tournament.”


Up two places to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Budkov Kjaer improved his chances of qualifying for his maiden trip to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 20-and-under event will be held 17-21 December.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Rankings watch: Noskova makes Top 20 debut, Lys cracks Top 50","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4376908/rankings-watch-noskova-makes-top-20-debut-lys-cracks-top-50","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 12:45:47 GMT","

Beijing finalist Linda Noskova makes her Top 20 debut in this week's edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, while Eva Lys enters the Top 50 and Janice Tjen becomes the sixth Indonesian Top 100 player in rankings history.

Last week, the Asian swing moved into full gear on the Hologic WTA Tour with the conclusion of the China Open, the ninth WTA 1000 event of the season.

Amanda Anisimova continued her banner year with her second WTA 1000 title -- sealing her qualification for the WTA Finals Riyadh in the process -- and the American holds steady at No. 4 in the latest edition of the PIF WTA Rankings.

Runner-up Linda Noskova enjoyed a breakthrough, saving three match points in the semifinals against Jessica Pegula to reach her first WTA 1000 final (and fifth overall). The 20-year-old Czech -- who also reached the 2024 Australian Open quarterfinals, upsetting Iga Swiatek along the way -- enters the Top 20 for the first time, climbing 10 places from No. 27 to No. 17.

Noskova is the youngest player in the Top 20, and the second-highest ranked 2004-born player behind Coco Gauff (taking over from Diana Shnaider on both counts). She is the fourth player this year to break the Top 20 for the first time, following Yulia Putintseva, Anisimova and Clara Tauson.

Beijing also marked a milestone week for Germany's Eva Lys. The 23-year-old scored her first Top 10 win at the ninth attempt, upsetting Elena Rybakina in the third round and going on to make her first WTA 1000 quarterfinal. Lys started 2025 ranked No. 129 and entered the Top 100 after reaching the Australian Open last 16 as a lucky loser. She cracks the Top 50 this week, jumping 21 places from No. 66 to No. 45.

Lys was one of two unseeded Beijing quarterfinalists alongside Sonay Kartal, who also notched her first career Top 10 win, over Mirra Andreeva in the fourth round. The 23-year-old Kartal, who also made the last 16 of Indian Wells and Wimbledon this year, bounced up 21 places from No. 81 to No. 60.

Hon, Waltert, Tjen make Top 100 debuts

Three players entered the Top 100 for the first time this week, taking the total so far to 24 in 2025.

In July, Priscilla Hon was in Anisimova's player box to watch her compete in the Wimbledon final. The Australian was ranked No. 129, nearly seven years removed from the career high of No. 118 she set in October 2018. Hon, 27, has been putting together her own breakthrough over the past two months, though.

She qualified and reached the third round of the US Open -- a career-best Grand Slam performance -- and she repeated the feat in Beijing with an upset against Jelena Ostapenko. Hon climbs 13 places from No. 108 to No. 95.

Simona Waltert first approached the Top 100 in 2023, climbing to No. 107 in June after reaching the second round of Roland Garros as a qualifier. But by July 2024, she'd fallen to No. 249. This year, Waltert has been rebuilding. After reaching her first WTA 125 final three weeks ago in Ljubljana, the 24-year-old captured the Lisbon ITF W100 title, then made the Rende WTA 125 quarterfinals last week. She leaps 18 spots from No. 116 to No. 98.

Pepperdine University graduate Janice Tjen built buzz with a strong ITF record, then qualified for the US Open last month to make her tour-level debut. Tjen has kept going, reaching the Sao Paulo final in her second WTA main draw and then qualifying for Beijing. Tjen rises three places to No. 99, becoming the sixth Indonesian player to break the Top 100 in WTA rankings history (following Lany Kaligis, Yayuk Basuki, Romana Tedjakusuma, Wynne Prakusya and Angelique Widjaja).

Emma Navarro, +3 to No. 14: Navarro upset Swiatek in the Beijing fourth round to notch her first Top 5 win since the 2024 US Open, advancing to her first quarterfinal at WTA 1000 level or above since the Australian Open.

McCartney Kessler, +6 to No. 33: Kessler reached the fourth round of a WTA 1000 event for the second time in Beijing (following Montreal in August).

Marie Bouzkova, +11 to No. 41: Bouzkova also made the Beijing fourth round -- her deepest run at a WTA 1000 event since reaching the 2023 Cincinnati quarterfinals.

Viktorija Golubic, +6 to No. 64: The Swiss player won last week's Suzhou WTA 125 event -- her first singles title since ending 2024 with a winning streak that encompassed the Jiujiang WTA 250 and Limoges WTA 125 tournaments.

Katie Volynets, +10 to No. 97: Former No. 56 Volynets returns to the Top 100 for the first time since July after reaching the Suzhou WTA 125 final.

Sara Bejlek, +10 to No. 107: The Czech 19-year-old hits a new career high after lifting her second WTA 125 trophy of the year in Rende last week.

Kaja Juvan, +20 to No. 108: Unranked at the start of February as she returned from a 13-month injury hiatus, former No. 58 Juvan won the Samsun WTA 125 title last week -- her second trophy at that level in the past month.

Aliaksandra Sasnovich, +16 to No. 114: Former No. 29 Sasnovich upset former Beijing champion Naomi Osaka en route to this year's third round -- her first Top 20 win in 17 months, and first in five meetings with Osaka.

Lulu Sun, +19 to No. 127: Sun, the 2024 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, fell from her career high of No. 39 last September to No. 164 in August. The 24-year-old Swiss player is on the rebound now, lifting her first WTA 125 trophy two weeks ago in Jingshan.

Nikola Bartunkova, +10 to No. 134: Fresh off her WTA semifinal debut in Guadalajara, Bartunkova continued her strong form to reach her first WTA 125 final in Samsun last week. The 19-year-old Czech is up to another new career high.

Alina Korneeva, +27 to No. 164: Former junior No. 1 Korneeva has won 20 of her last 21 matches, and three of her past four tournaments. The 18-year-old was the champion at last week's Bratislava ITF W75.

Emerson Jones, +11 to No. 166: Jones was runner-up at last week's Rancho Santa Fe ITF W50, and moves to a new career high. The 17-year-old Australian's run included a quarterfinal victory over Julieta Pareja, her successor as junior No. 1 this year.

Nao Hibino, +32 to No. 168: Three-time WTA titlist Hibino was the champion at the Incheon ITF W100 two weeks ago.

Ma Ye-Xin, +36 to No. 198: Ma, 26, reached her first WTA 125 final in Jingshan two weeks ago. The Chinese player, whose career high is No. 177, returns to the Top 200 for the first time since last March.

Anastasija Sevastova, +21 to No. 200: Unranked in April as she returned from maternity leave and an ACL injury, former No. 11 Sevastova reached the second round of Beijing last week. The 35-year-old returns to the Top 200 for the first time since May 2022.

Camilla Rosatello, +66 to No. 201: At the age of 30, Italy's Rosatello won her first ITF W75 title in Bucharest last week, and soars to a new career high.

Olivia Gadecki, +61 to No. 233: Former No. 83 and 2024 Guadalajara runner-up Gadecki is starting to rebuild her ranking. The 23-year-old Australian claimed the Rancho Santa Fe ITF W50 title last week.

Laura Samson, +47 to No. 273: The Czech 17-year-old won the Pazardzhik ITF W50 title two weeks ago -- her second ITF trophy of the year. Samson was a semifinalist at Prague 2024 on her tour-level debut.

Kayla Day, +50 to No. 292: Former No. 84 Day won the Templeton ITF W75 two weeks ago -- the American's biggest title since returning from ankle surgery in April.

Lee Eunhye, +56 to No. 299: The South Korean 25-year-old is up to a new career high after reaching her first ITF W100 final in Incheon two weeks ago.

Elena Ruxandra Bertea, +59 to No. 329: On home soil, the 19-year-old Romanian reached her first ITF W75 final in Bucharest last week.

Mia Pohankova, +62 to No. 394: Playing her first professional tournament since winning the junior Wimbledon title, 16-year-old Slovak Pohankova made the Bratislava ITF W75 semifinals last week, and enters the Top 400 for the first time.

Lucie Havlickova, +180 to No. 473: Former junior No. 1 Havlickova, who was unranked in July after a 12-month hiatus from the game, was the runner-up at the Bratislava ITF W75 last week. The 20-year-old Czech hit her career high of No. 196 in July 2023.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","How Gauff went from a 'hoodie connoisseur' to a fashion-forward trendsetter","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4376969/how-gauff-went-from-a-hoodie-connoisseur-to-a-fashion-forward-trendsetter","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 14:32:20 GMT","

Coco Gauff used to live and die by the hoodie. Now the World No. 3, who has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in in 2025, has established herself as a bona fide trendsetter.

Over the course of her career, as Coco Gauff's game has evolved, so too has her fashion sense.

She's now regarded as one of the most fashion-forward players on the Hologic WTA Tour, a true trendsetter. It's quite a long way from when she first turned pro back in 2018, when she lived and died by the hoodie.

""I used to be a hoodie connoisseur,"" the World No. 3 said ahead of her opening-round match at this week's Wuhan Open. ""I owned, like, 70-something hoodies and having all those ... it was really bad. My mom had told me I had to stop buying hoodies. And then, when I turned maybe 17 or 18, I just stopped. And now I don't really grab a hoodie unless I go to the airport. But yeah, I didn't know what my fashion was going to be, so I feel like I was just conserving myself.

""Now I'm a lot more expressive of what I wear on and off the court. It's really fun. I like wearing clothes. I'm not very talented in a lot of things, so I think clothes is just a way to express myself.""

We'd argue Gauff's lack of talent argument, as she's won two Grand Slam titles and is firmly entrenched in the Top 5 ahead of the year-end WTA Finals in Riyadh, where she's already qualified and is the defending champion.

As for her fashion on court, it's been on point (and very intentional). The American has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in this year, each of which has received rave reviews.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

As for her wardrobe off the court, she doesn't plan much in advance. Gauff takes an organic, in-the-moment approach: How she feels when she gets out of bed dictates her choice for the day.

""It just depends on the mood,"" the 21-year-old said. ""Some days I wake up feeling really feminine and [I want to wear] skirts and stuff. Other days I wake up feeling like a tomboy. It just kind of depends on what my mood is, which is why it's always hard for me to plan outfits in advance. I never know what I'm going to feel like in the moment.""

The French Open champion arrives in Wuhan coming off a semifinal showing in Beijing, where she lost in straight sets to eventual champion Amanda Anisimova. 

She received a bye in the first round of Wuhan, the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025, and will play unseeded Moyuka Uchijima in the second round.

Naomi Osaka's Labubu crew is finally complete! The four-time Grand Slam champion debuted the sixth and final member of her viral US Open Labubu collection on social media over the weekend, and it did not disappoint.The former world No. 1 became a viral sensation in New York this summer not just with her resurgent play on the court—she reached her first Grand Slam semifinal in four years before losing in three sets to Amanda Anisimova—but for the collection of custom zoomorphic monster dolls she accessorized with.Read more: From ‘Andre Swagassi' to ‘Billie Jean Bling', meet Naomi Osaka's Labubu crewOsaka leaned into the existing Labubu trend by commissioning New York City-based artist Kerin Rose Gold of A-Morir Studio with designing bedazzled keychain versions, inspired tennis legends like Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and Andre Agassi. She revealed them (and their punny names) after each win at the US Open, with her sparkly friends generating just as much buzz as her play.And after losing a tense three-setter to Anisimova from a set ahead, Osaka joked she lost out on more than one opportunity: The one she was hoping to call ""Naomi Glowsaka"" was staying home.“I wanted to make one of myself in last year's outfit, and it was the green one. I would have had the bow, and I'm sick about it,” she revealed through laughter. “Oh, my God, that's, like, the worst thing. Honestly, I'm fine losing, but don't ask me about this Labubu, man. Yeah, it would have been me.”But on Sunday, Osaka revealed that what-would've-been is now reality.

Osaka leaned into the existing Labubu trend by commissioning New York City-based artist Kerin Rose Gold of A-Morir Studio with designing bedazzled keychain versions, inspired tennis legends like Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe and Andre Agassi. She revealed them (and their punny names) after each win at the US Open, with her sparkly friends generating just as much buzz as her play.And after losing a tense three-setter to Anisimova from a set ahead, Osaka joked she lost out on more than one opportunity: The one she was hoping to call ""Naomi Glowsaka"" was staying home.“I wanted to make one of myself in last year's outfit, and it was the green one. I would have had the bow, and I'm sick about it,” she revealed through laughter. “Oh, my God, that's, like, the worst thing. Honestly, I'm fine losing, but don't ask me about this Labubu, man. Yeah, it would have been me.”But on Sunday, Osaka revealed that what-would've-been is now reality.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

The drivers and teams report back on all the action at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Russell led off the line in Singapore and was rarely troubled as he recorded his second win of the season. He built a good lead in the first stint, lost a few seconds in the second stint as he struggled to get the hard tyres to work. But Verstappen could never get close enough to apply any pressure and he was able to lift off and coast to the finish for his first win in Singapore. Antonelli did not have such a good getaway, dropping behind Norris and Leclerc. But undeterred, he drove a faultless race from there and pulled off a rare overtake on Leclerc to climb back to fifth at the flag.

George Russell, 1st

""I'm really pleased with our victory this evening. This track has not always been my best friend over the years, maybe from my own doing. We didn't start the weekend in the best way either but come Q3 yesterday I felt really good in the car and that carried on into today. It was such a long race, so I was very glad to see the chequered flag, but we ultimately had it all under control.

""The goal for us is to finish second in the Constructor's Championship this year. This result helps us in that quest, but we still have six races to go. We will need to be at our best if we are to achieve that but hopefully we can carry this form into the double header of Austin and Mexico City. Congratulations to McLaren on their Constructor's title and to Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains too.""

Kimi Antonelli, 5th

""I struggled with some wheelspin in the second phase of my start and that cost me into turn one. I lost two positions, and my race was a fightback from there. It was a tough race physically but I'm happy with how I managed to battle back. The pace was good, and I was able to gain a position back with a good move on Leclerc. We could have achieved more tonight but P5 is still OK.

""Congratulations to George on a great win and a brilliant drive. That is a great result for the team and really helps us out in the Constructor's. Congratulations to McLaren too and everyone at Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains on another Mercedes powered title.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""That was an amazing drive from George this evening. He controlled the race from lights out to the chequered flag to take a brilliant win. The pace he and the car had was surprising but strong and that was the winning formula today. It was also great to have PETRONAS represent our team on the podium with Tengku Muhammad Taufik receiving the trophy. They are a brilliant title partner, and it is sweet to win at what is the closest race on the calendar to Malaysia.

""Kimi's race meanwhile was compromised by losing two places at the start, but he had good pace and battled back hard. His move on Leclerc at turn 16 was incredible; it took everyone by surprise and ensured both our cars finished ahead of Ferrari which is important for second in the Constructor's Championship. On that note, congratulations to McLaren as they secured the Constructor's crown this evening. They have been the best team this year, so it is well deserved. Congratulations also go to our team-mates at Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains who secured a 10th Mercedes powered Constructor's title in the past 12 years.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""That was a great result for the team and congratulations to George on another win. We didn't really know what to expect in terms of pace going into the race; we didn't have any good long run data but it was really encouraging to see George able to pull a decent gap in stint one and keep the tyres in a decent temperature window.

""Kimi lost a couple of places at the start; one of those was on the initial getaway and then another around the first corners where he was struggling for grip on the inside. He drove a very impressive race to finish ahead of both Ferraris though and was able to show good pace once he was in free air.

""It was fun to be fighting at the front again, but we've got a lot of hard work ahead if we want to keep second place in this championship. It will be a tough fight with Ferrari and Red Bull, but we will be pushing to the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi. Finally, congratulations to McLaren on their Constructor's Championship and Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains for powering their success.""

Verstappen opted for a soft tyre start, gambling on a rapidly drying track. He held onto P2 off the line, but could not find the pace to chase down Russell. Instead he was forced to defend from Norris behind, especially in the second stint on the hard tyre after pitting seven laps earlier than the McLaren man. But despite some downshifting issues, the Dutchman defending superbly to hold onto second to the flag. Tsunoda also started on the softs, and was embroiled in plenty of midfield fights but could not quite make it back to the points on a day where there were no retirements.

Max Verstappen, 2nd

“We had a difficult start to the race, having little grip on our side of the grid. We opted for the Soft compound for a better launch and to try and get to P1 but it didn't happen for us unfortunately. The car wasn't where we wanted in terms of the set up and it isn't a mystery what went wrong but just need to analyse this later. The biggest problems were the downshifts and upshifts: this was giving me a lot of pushing in the braking which is not what you want on a street circuit and it was not easy to drive around the track. However, it didn't matter as, even if the balance was perfect, it is hard to pass round here so I think second is the best result we could have achieved. I think my tyres were older for the final stint, so it was difficult to manage, but we were able to keep Lando behind which is what mattered. Well done to McLaren on the Constructors' Championship, they fully deserve that title, and I am very happy for them. Overall, we can still be very satisfied with the weekend, Singapore is not our favourite layout and we maximised our result today. We do understand the car a lot better, we have definitely improved in the last few races, we just need to analyse and hopefully next weekend we can do a little better.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 12th

“Today's first lap was the worst one that I have ever had. I lost so many positions and just didn't have any space to move, every time I tried there was another car there which left no room for me. It was the same at every corner on that first lap when I was trying to overtake. What is really frustrating is that my pace today was really really good, the best that I have had since being with the Team, and definitely enough to put me in the points. The long and short run is feeling so great which was the complete opposite before Baku, and even with a little bit of damage to the car today it still felt competitive which is very positive. Towards the end there was an opportunity to pass Isack but Max was fighting for P2 from behind me, so I moved aside as I didn't want to hold him up which was definitely the right decision for the Team. Looking forward to the rest of the season I will be focusing on bringing together all of the improvements that we have made in the last few races, consistency and extracting grip from the one lap pace will be key.”

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“Firstly, congratulations to McLaren on their Constructors' title, we know how hard it is to win championships, so a big well done to everyone there. From our side, Max had a very strong race and was quick enough today to stay in contact with George and hold off the McLarens. We tried everything we could to win the race, we started on the Soft tyre to try our best chance at the start when the conditions were tricky. It was an aggressive decision and a risk we chose to take. After that there was very little possibility to do anything else with the race. It was very tough out there and, after pitting early, Max did an amazing job defending from McLaren to keep the car in second place.  It is good to be fighting at the front today, that's a huge testament to all the hard work that has and is being done back at Milton Keynes and at track. Having increased performance on a track like this gives us confidence that we will be able to fight better at other circuits and it is a good indication of the progress we have made. Yuki had a difficult day, he really suffered on the first lap and dropped back, but from that point on he did a very decent job, worked hard to get back through the order and nearly had a shot at the points. It had not been a good Saturday for him but he is working incredibly hard and we will continue to work with him to improve together.”

McLaren sealed the Teams' Championship in Singapore with six rounds to go thanks to a strong drive from both Norris and Piastri. But while the celebrations looked set to go deep into the night, there will be things to discuss in the briefing between the two Championship contenders. Norris made a strong start, picking off Antonelli and getting a run down the inside of Piastri into Turn 2. He clipped the rear of Verstappen's car, damaging his front wing and then oversteering into Piastri who wound up very near the walls. That frustrated the Australian, who then trailed Norris for the rest of the race. Norris also refused to allow his team mate the first pit stop, so there were definitely some internal politics at play under the lights in Singapore. But ultimately all that matters is that the team have sealed back-to-back titles, with the Drivers' Championship still all to play for.

Oscar Piastri,4th

""I am very proud of this team. We've won back-to-back Constructors' Championships, something we are all so proud of. It's been a really good season so far, and to win it this early in the year is a great achievement. A massive congrats to the whole team, and thank you for all of the hard work. It was a trickier race on my side, but it's something we'll review as a team. Now, we'll rest and reset before we head to the US.""

Lando Norris, 3rd

“It was a tough race. I gave it my all and got close, but Max didn't make any mistakes today. There were a few moments where we were side-by-side and had a good battle. I would've loved to get by and put some pressure on George, but the opportunities were so limited around this circuit.

“I'm happy with the result though, the car was fast, and we've won the Constructors' Championship for the second year in a row. Huge congratulations to everyone in the team who has played their part in achieving this remarkable success, they've done an incredible job, and we've achieved this together. We'll make sure we celebrate this properly as a team and then get straight back to work for the rest of the season.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“For the second year in a row, McLaren are the Constructors' Champions, an incredible feeling to end a very competitive weekend in Singapore! Last year, it went all the way to the final lap of the final race, so to be able to secure the title with six races to go in the 2025 season is an unbelievable effort from the entire team.

“Our race pace was strong today against our closest competitors, although it was hard to take advantage in the dirty air. Both Lando and Oscar demonstrated their exceptional talent to secure an important result for the team, as we've seen on many occasions this season.

“Thank you to everyone in the team, both trackside and in Woking, for their incredible effort. We can all be very proud of this achievement, the first back-to-back Constructors' Championship for McLaren since 1991. Thank you to our PU supplier HPP, our valuable technical and commercial partners and of course, our loyal papaya fans. It's great that our teamwork is rewarded like this, but we must enjoy the moment this evening and then turn our attention to preparing for a competitive challenge in the final six races of the season.”

Leclerc got the better start of the Ferrari drivers and found himself running fifth. He lost out to Antonelli after the pit stops, the Mercedes man just too quick to keep at bay. Then the Monegasque ceded position to his team mate, Hamilton on a different strategy in Singapore. The seven-time World Champion had stopped twice as he had a free pit stop window, and ate up the ground to the back of his team mate on fresh rubber. He was let through to chase down Antonelli which he did, only to lose his brakes late on. He allowed Leclerc back through and lost nearly 40 seconds to Alonso over the last couple of laps. He crossed the line just 0.3s ahead of his former team mate, but having already been shown a black and white flag, Hamilton was pinged for exceeding track limits as he struggled to turn his car on the final lap. That was looked at by the stewards, and he was handed a five-second time penalty which dropped Hamilton from seventh to eighth behind Alonso.

Charles Leclerc, 6th

""It was a really difficult race, unfortunately, a reflection of the whole weekend. Right from Friday, we struggled to find the right feeling with the car and we never managed to put everything together in the way we would have wanted. Today, in traffic it was impossible to move forward, as we also had to deal with cooling problems. Sadly, where we finished reflects where we are today.

""Over the past two races we have encountered various difficulties that we must now analyse in detail, so that we can start improving again. The aim is to be better prepared and ready to fight with our main rivals in two weeks' time in the United States.""

Lewis Hamilton, 8th

""It has been a challenging couple of days but there were definitely some positives to take. I've felt good in the car all weekend and we had a strong final third of the race. The Softs gave us great attacking pace and meant I could close down a big gap to the cars ahead, but unfortunately a brake issue cost us the overtake and the chance to score more points.

""We had the potential to be further ahead this weekend, starting from qualifying, so the focus now is on maximising what we have going into Austin and executing cleanly to bring home as many points as possible.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""First of all congratulations to McLaren for winning the Constructors' Championship, it's well deserved. On our side it was a tough weekend. We had a strong start of the weekend and after that we didn't extract the full potential from the car in quali. In the race, cooling was an issue right from the beginning although when we were in clean air the pace was decent. Over the last 15 laps, Lewis had mega pace, but he pushed so hard to catch up those ahead that in the end he had a problem with the brakes overheating.

""Clearly, the last couple of races, we have been a step behind our rivals. We need to improve the potential of the car and also our overall execution of the race weekend to ensure we are getting the best out of the car and from the drivers, because for sure, results like today's are frustrating.

""Starting from Austin, we need to get back to being in a position to have good pace throughout the entire weekend.""

Alonso picked up two places at the start, and looked on for good points until a very slow pit stop. That dropped him down the order, but he pulled off some good overtakes – and livened up the airwaves with some pithy radio messages. He made it all the way back to P8, where he was lying before the pit stop, and came agonisingly close to picking off Hamilton, missing out right on the line by three tenths of a second. But when Hamilton was penalised post-race, Alonso inherited P7. As for Stroll, he was another to hang it out for a Safety Car despite starting on the soft tyre. The Canadian was less impressed with the medium, saying at one point that it felt like it was already 100-laps old.

Fernando Alonso, 7th

""We had a good race tonight and the car was behaving well. I enjoy racing here and it's very physically demanding too. We showed good pace on both stints and the team made a good call to fit the Medium tyres, as that enabled us to fight back after a slow pit-stop. Hopefully we can score some more points at the remaining rounds of the Championship.""

Lance Stroll, 13th

""No opportunities for us today: we tried to sit it out and waited for a Safety Car that never came. We managed to make the Soft tyre work for 38 laps. The Mediums in the second stint wore off quicker than expected due to traffic, overheating and fighting other cars. It could have gone better for us, but we did the best we could do and we will keep trying. We now look to Texas in two weeks' time.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""Singapore is known for its Safety Cars and lack of overtaking, but this evening there were no Safety Cars and Fernando and Lance did plenty of overtaking!

""The slightly damp track encouraged us to start both cars on the Softs, which proved to be the right decision as the race played out. Lance did a fantastic job of managing the Softs for 38 laps, holding out for a Safety Car before taking the Mediums to the end, gaining seven places with some great overtakes.

""Fernando also did his overtaking on the track, and P7 this evening saw the fans vote him driver of the day. The team did a great job with tyre decisions, cooling levels and strategy to optimise the race performance. We take encouragement from this and will look to carry this momentum into Austin.""

Bearman scored in Singapore for Haas, their first points since Zandvoort. He tangled with Hadjar at the start which could have been worse for the youngster, who only lost one position. From there he ran a superb race, pitting relatively early and then making his tyres last as he climbed back into the points. Ocon's poor Qualifying yesterday proved costly, the Frenchman starting so far back that he was unable to make much progress through the field on a day where all 20 cars finished.

Esteban Ocon, 18th

“It was always going to be a tough challenge, but we at least gained a position at the start, and we moved up a couple of positions in the first few laps. We were on for catching Lance (Stroll) at some stage, it was getting better through the race. But we stayed out really late and when we boxed, we lost out on everything. We couldn't recover because of the DRS train that was in front – that was it for the race really. It feels like we've had a missed opportunity this weekend.”

Oliver Bearman, 9th

“I'm really happy. After my Lap 1 incident, and dropping to P10, I was then under threat from Nico, who was very fast. In general, I was struggling in my first stint with car balance. We made a good step after the pit stops, and we were looking like P8 potentially with (Fernando) Alonso's long pit stop but sadly lost that position to him as he was quicker than us today. I'm happy to score points, they're so important and on a tough track, we executed a great weekend.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“I'm glad that we finally managed to put a weekend together. As a team, this race was difficult, but converting P9 in qualifying to P9 in the race and points was lots of hard work. It was a shame to be overtaken by Alonso, but in the end, he had good pace, and Aston Martin was quick. We executed the weekend well and I'm very happy for all the team, and for Ollie as well. Yes, overtaking in a DRS train is difficult, but Alonso managed to do it, so we need to see whether that's a car characteristic or what else it is. On Esteban's side, the positive is that he's been quick in all practice sessions, so he has the pace. Overall, I'm very happy to be coming away from Singapore scoring two points. In Austin, I'm looking to build on from here – we want both drivers to score points.”

After a dreadful Saturday, Williams opted to start Sainz from the back of the grid and Albon from the pit lane. The Spaniard's race was made by his ability to keep his tyres alive, Sainz the very last man to pit for fresh rubber. That left him with a big tyre off-set late on and he attacked, picking off Hadjar to score the final point on offer. Albon also had a solid race, fighting hard with a number of drivers. He couldn't quite make the same progress as his team mate.

Alex Albon, 14th

""Starting from the pit lane today we knew it was going to be a bit of a test session for us. We did a test setup just for some learnings and it didn't really work, but that's okay as we can use that data for future races. We had good pace when we were in clean air, we just got caught up in some blue flags and were stuck in traffic for majority of the race. Even when we did have fresher tyres, we had to wait for the car in front to catch the cars further up, so it was just one of those races where we couldn't do much, especially with no safety cars. There were a lot of learnings from this weekend, and we will look to tidy everything up for the next weekend out in Austin.""

Carlos Sainz, 10th

""Given the circumstances, we need to be happy and proud about our performance today. It was a straightforward race with no safety cars, but we still managed to progress through the field and grab a valuable point starting from P18. We were able to extend our medium tyre longer than anybody else into the race and once I put the softs on, I was able to do a very fast stint and some strong overtakes on track. We could've been fighting higher up the field today but all in all I'm very happy with our race execution. We'll take the learnings and start preparing for the upcoming races.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""Congratulations to Carlos on a really strong drive to achieve a point today, and thank you to Alex for working closely on strategy to achieve that result - it really was a team game. We couldn't have achieved more from our starting position, but that only reiterates my disappointment about our qualifying disqualification because we had a quick car today. I'm looking forward to the remaining six rounds of the season, because we have a competitive car and we're here to fight for our position in the Championship. Finally, congratulations to McLaren for retaining the Constructors' Championship – their journey back to the top is an inspiration to us and the benchmark for what we want to achieve.""

Hadjar banged wheels with Bearman at the start, which cost him a place to Alonso. From there he drove well to make his soft tyres last, but once he pitted a power issue was detected. That cost him some time, but the rookie recovered just about back to the points despite some frustrated radio messages. But he was powerless to prevent Sainz on much fresher tyres from overtaking him late on. As for Lawson, he ran in the top 10 midway through the race courtesy of a lengthy first stint. But the much-hoped for Safety Car did not come, and he dropped back down the field when he eventually pitted.

Isack Hadjar, 11th

""It wasn't our day today as we had an issue with the car just before the pit stop. It lasted the whole second part of the race and cost us the points. I was just hoping for the other drivers not to catch up so quickly, but they did, and the blue flags didn't help us. In the corners we were pretty fast but we lost everything on the straights, so there wasn't anything more we could do. I'll be looking together with the team at what happened today and then we'll switch our focus to Austin, aiming to keep the good momentum started after the summer break.”

Liam Lawson, 15th

“We stayed out most of the race on a set of Mediums and unfortunately ended up behind a train of cars after we boxed. Had we started higher up the grid, we could've potentially ended up in the points with our pace, but a tough Quali meant it was going to be tricky from the outset. It's been a difficult weekend in challenging conditions, but my focus is now on Austin.""

Alan Permane, Team Principal

“A very tough day today for us, and the first time that we've been out of the points since Silverstone. We had an issue with Isack's powertrain, which cost him 0.5s each lap, and to race under those conditions, when everything else is so tight here, makes it virtually impossible. He drove brilliantly and did everything he could, but in the end it proved too much of a handicap to keep the car in the points. For Liam, he had just as tough of a race. He didn't have the car underneath him that he wanted and struggled with grip and balance. We went very long for him on his first stint, hoping he could take advantage of a Safety Car, but ultimately he didn't have the pace. We will re-group and absolutely get to the bottom of the issue on Isack's car, coming back strong in Austin – a track that will definitely suit our car.”

Gasly started from the pit lane in the end after stopping out on track in Qualifying yesterday, so was always likely to be in for a long evening. He pitted twice too, which did not help his cause. That left Colapinto to fly the flag for the team and the Argentine racer fought hard, climbing up the order before falling back as some drivers used fresh tyres to recover places late on.

Pierre Gasly, 19th

“Today was always going to be difficult especially with the Pit Lane start. I have not been feeling too comfortable in the car recently so we changed set-up and changed floor to try and understand some things further which should benefit us for the future. We knew the race would be complicated and it was nice to have a few battles out there even if it was not for the points paying positions. I know the team is working exceptionally hard at the moment and we all know we are nowhere near where we should be right now. I am confident we can do better in Austin next time out compared to the last few races where the circuit characteristics have not suited our package especially with the lack of grip and bumps that are common on street circuits. We will continue to keep our heads down and keep focusing on improving our current position.”

Franco Colapinto, 16th

“It was a long race with lots of close battles out there, which was fun but, ultimately, we didn't have the pace and lost some places towards the end on older tyres. I managed to get a good launch off the line and made up places through the opening sequence of corners. We were running quite well in the midfield pack on the Softs at the time and knowing how difficult it is to overtake at this track, we pitted early trying to undercut and use track position to make up places. We tried our best to manage the tyres but with a lot of degradation and having to also move offline for blue flags, it made it difficult to hold off the cars on fresher tyres in the closing laps. It was not what we wanted but we just have to keep pushing and better results will come. I'm looking forward to the next leg of the season in the Americas, which is one of my favourites with incredibly passionate fans.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“It has been another tough race for us but we can take some positives from it in the respect we managed to take a bit of a fight to our competitors. Franco had a good start to gain some places on the opening lap and we went aggressive quite early on strategy with an undercut on the cars ahead which required Franco to manage a long stint on Mediums. It had looked promising but he tailed off at the end with the tyres degrading. For Pierre, we opted to change set-up on his car and change his floor, which meant a Pit Lane start. That put him on the backfoot early on but he did a good opening stint to be in that midfield mix which was held up by a train of traffic. After his Hards faded we opted for some laps on Soft at the end where he closed the gap to cars ahead and had the benefit of some low fuel, high grip running. Of course, it is not the end result we ever set out to achieve but there are plenty of positives to take from the entire weekend and we head to Austin feeling more optimistic in our ability to perform on a much more conventional circuit. We can be confident that better days are coming and I am pleased to see the continued work ethic that everyone in this team is applying in a difficult time. Finally, congratulations to McLaren on setting an extremely high bar with their second Championship win in a row.”

Bortoleto needed a new front wing at his pit stop thanks to some contact at the start, and the resultant slow stop cost him some positions. One tyre almost escaped his pit crew as well, the mechanics just about getting it all back under control. Hulkenberg was running 11th ahead of his team mate but finished behind after a mid-race spin, the German getting in the turbulent air and misjudging his braking point. A stop for some fresh tyres to replace his flat-spotted ones sent him to the back of the pack.

Nico Hulkenberg, 20th

“It wasn't our day today. Without track position it's always tough for us, especially on a street circuit like this where overtaking is nearly impossible unless you've got a big tyre advantage. In the end, when I got close to Franco [Colapinto], he braked quite early — a bit of a surprise — and I lost a lot of rear downforce, which caused a big lock-up and the spin. We'll have to review the strategy, but overall, we didn't quite have the pace this weekend. Still, even on tough days like this, there's always something to learn and take things forward into the next races.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 17th

“It definitely wasn't the best race for us today. I picked up some damage on lap one after contact in Turn One — we went three-wide and unfortunately touched and broke the front wing. This forced us to pit to change it, which cost us some time, and from then on it was always going to be a difficult race. Our pace wasn't the strongest and, once we fell behind Colapinto, we knew it would be hard to get back past — overtaking here is extremely difficult. I spent most of the race stuck behind him, which also allowed others to close in. Overall, it was just one of those days where things didn't quite go our way. Still, we'll take the positives from the weekend, learn what we can, and move on. The team keeps working really hard, both here and at HQ, and we're all determined to get back to scoring points.”

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

“First of all I would like to congratulate McLaren on defending their title. For us, it was an incredibly frustrating race where very little went our way. Starting from P11, I genuinely believe we had the potential to score points today, and we shouldn't shy away from that. With no safety cars, the race unfolded without many of the usual variables here in Singapore, and not a lot of opportunities. We'll thoroughly review to make sure we learn from this weekend and take any lessons forward. That's racing: the great thing about Formula One is that we get to race again in just two weeks.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“First of all, congratulations to George Russell for the win and to McLaren for the Constructors' title!

“As for the race, we had yet further confirmation that the current generation of cars has reached such a sophisticated level of development that overtaking is really complicated, especially on a track like Singapore, which by its very nature does not make this an easy task. On top of that, the teams and drivers have become ever more adept at tyre management, to the extent that we saw stints of 50 laps on the Medium and 38 on the Soft. To be honest, even if we had brought a theoretical C8 compound here it wouldn't have made much difference to how the race unfolded!

“This evening, as we had expected, all three compounds were competitive. At the start, the Soft became an interesting choice, partly because of the rain that fell shortly before the cars went out onto the grid, after which it proved to be very quick, as demonstrated by Hamilton and Sainz as they fought their way back. All in all, the Medium offered the best balance between consistency and performance, but the Hard also delivered good performance.”

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

There was bad news for Lewis Hamilton after the Singapore Grand Prix, with the stewards giving him a five-second penalty.

Lewis Hamilton has been given a five-second time penalty following the Singapore Grand Prix, meaning the Ferrari driver falls from seventh to eighth in the finishing order.

It comes after Hamilton was found guilty of “leaving the track without justifiable reason multiple times” while managing a brake issue on his car in the closing stages of Sunday night's race.

Having finished the encounter just four-tenths ahead of Aston Martin rival Fernando Alonso, Hamilton drops back to eighth position, losing a couple of points in the process.

In their post-race investigation, the stewards noted a breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code – non-compliance with Race Director's Event Note (item 21.1, document 13).

“During the hearing, the driver confirmed that he left the track [on] several occasions,” read the stewards' report. “He was trying to manage a brakes issue situation.

“This being said, after further investigation, and in accordance with the list of exemptions foreseen in the Driving Standards Guidelines, the stewards considered that this was not a justifiable reason and apply the usual penalty for such type of infringement.

“This was not contested by the team representative nor the driver.”

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

McLaren have delivered one of their most competitive F1 seasons en route to successive Teams' Championship crowns.

McLaren confirmed what was on the cards since the early stages of the 2025 season by securing the Teams' Championship at the Singapore Grand Prix – the Woking-based squad having been the class of the field this year. With the dust settling on the Marina Bay weekend, F1.com presents the key statistics behind their achievement…

McLaren's latest title triumph moves them up to second in the all-time F1 list for Teams' Championships won, ahead of rivals Williams on nine. Ferrari remain in the lead with their haul of 16 titles.

McLaren sealed the deal with six Grand Prix weekends (and three Sprint events) still to come, meaning they have tied Red Bull Racing's 2023 record for the earliest championship win in F1 history.

McLaren's MCL39 improved on an already competitive predecessor, helping Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris deliver seven 1-2 finishes across the 18 Grands Prix held so far – their highest tally since a particularly dominant 1988 season.

It has also led to Piastri and Norris claiming pole position for half of the Grands Prix staged up to now – the Australian edging that head-to-head with five poles to the Briton's four.

McLaren have now won 10 Teams' Championships since arriving in F1 in the mid-1960s.

Emerson Fittipaldi and Denny Hulme combined for their first in 1974, with Niki Lauda and Alain Prost, Prost and Ayrton Senna, Senna and Gerhard Berger, and Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard all following across the 1980s and 1990s.

Piastri and Norris wrote their own chapter of McLaren success in 2024 and backed it up with an even more impressive 2025 display.

Building on their pole positions and 1-2 finishes, McLaren's current drivers have combined to score 12 Grand Prix victories so far this season – Piastri again edging that record by seven wins to five.

That gives McLaren their highest number of wins in an F1 campaign since 1988, when they won 15 out of 16 races with Senna and Prost at the wheel.

One area in which Piastri and Norris cannot be split is their podium return, with both drivers contributing 14 rostrum results between Australia and Singapore.

As touched on above, McLaren made history last season by winning their first Teams' Championship since 1998, and they added the icing to the cake in 2025 by going back-to-back for the first time since the early-1990s.

McLaren's last back-to-back came during their Honda-powered glory years, when Senna and Prost delivered both championships in 1989, followed by the Brazilian and Berger through the 1990 and 1991 campaigns.

Such has been McLaren's dominance in 2025, they left the Marina Bay Circuit with 650 points to their name – precisely double the number scored by nearest rivals Mercedes so far.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

F1 TV commentator Alex Jacques looks at the key factors behind McLaren's second consecutive Constructors' Championship title.

It's official: the crown has been retained. McLaren are the World Constructors' Champions for the 10th time in the team's history.

On Sunday in Singapore the Woking-based team wrapped up title number 10, with three Sprint races and six Grands Prix remaining – but in reality, they won this prize long ago.

However, it is worth underlining that when the season started with the Australian Grand Prix back in March, not even McLaren expected it to be so straightforward. Paddock expectations in the rain of Albert Park were for an even season, with four teams consistently in contention for wins.

Instead, McLaren extended their 2024 advantage with a dominant car which allowed the drivers to keep their tyres alive for longer, giving them a strategic as well as speed advantage. The rest of the field were outclassed.

In sharp contrast with 2024's triumph against Ferrari by less than the points total for a third place finish, McLaren took 2025 by storm, winning 12 out the first 15 races to make the title almost a formality.

So how have they done it?

It's been quite the transformation since Zak Brown assumed the role of CEO in 2016 – when even a man with his confidence must have drawn breath at the scale of the task ahead of him.

The team had finished 689 points behind the champions Mercedes and were languishing in sixth place. Furthermore, he was replacing the defining leader in team's history.

Ron Dennis had transformed McLaren from its beginnings as a typical 1960s driver/team start-up, to a perennial title-winning machine with exacting engineering and presentation standards which hauled the entire sport forward and forced the rest to play catch up.

Replacing Ron was the definition of a tough act to follow but this year's triumph recalls the outfit's heyday, and is the team's first back-to-back Constructors' success since the 1990/1991 glory years with Ayrton Senna at the wheel.

Brown has moved decisively to reach this point. This extends to ultimately moving on people who were not performing. In a sporting era of “no blame culture” Brown has not been afraid to wield the axe when required, whether it be a popular driver or senior designer.

However, his most important personnel promotion happened somewhat by chance with former Team Principal Andreas Seidl's ill-fated move to the Audi project, which opened the door for Andrea Stella.

Stella was hugely respected even before his ascension to the role as Team Principal ahead of the 2023 season, and the cerebral Italian will be telling anyone who will listen tonight that titles are won because of many, but his calm methodical ethos has created an environment capable of running two winning drivers in an era where that cannot be taken for granted.

It's why the points total of 650 is almost comically high (and exactly double that of nearest challengers Mercedes), and delivering with both cars is an immense source of pride for everyone at the McLaren factory.

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have scored 12 Grand Prix victories between them so far this season but beyond race-winning pace both have subscribed to the manner in which the team has been run.

Many teams claim to build a culture, but this collective responsibility has unusually spilled over to the cockpit with the pair working well together – and crucially, any flash points which could have threatened team harmony have been quickly neutered by the drivers themselves. At least up to now – it remains to be seen if there is any fall-out from Piastri being unhappy with Norris' Lap 1 move on him in Singapore.

But there have been plenty of examples of the two drivers working for the good of the team overall. Moments such as Lando taking instant responsibility for his crash with Oscar in Canada, or Oscar listening to a team order after Lando's slow pit stop in Monza cost him track position despite falling outside of what had been agreed pre race.

The team has been placed first in a way that few title fights have ever witnessed, and no riot act has had to be read in team debriefs (so far) – in contrast to many previous intra-team battles.

Stella has also overseen amazing efficiency when it comes to allocating resources. In the budget cap era it is vital to know which pathways to pursue at the right moment.

Gone are the days of splashing $300million in all directions. It is no longer possible to hit a development brick wall without suffering the consequences.

Chief Designer Rob Marshall was one of the first key exits at the tail end of Red Bull's Horner era, and his acquisition by McLaren will not have been cheap after 17 successful years at Milton Keynes, but the British engineer is lauded by his peers for his ability to connect departments efficiently.

He oversaw McLaren turning the corner with their game-changing Austria update in 2023 and since then almost every time they have brought upgrades to the car, it has seen improvement with the correlation between wind tunnel and racetrack proving incredibly accurate.

The result is a team record 28 podiums (so far) and a Constructors' title to place them second in the all time list, passing Williams who had been level on nine championships.

The team will now seek their first Drivers' title since Lewis Hamilton's memorable 2008 success before trying to master the new technical regulations of 2026.

But those thoughts can wait. Singapore will see those in papaya celebrating one of the all-time great Formula 1 campaigns.

McLaren superbly sealed their 10th Constructors' Championship with six races still to go as Lando Norris' third place and Oscar Piastri's fourth in Singapore were enough to take the title beyond any other team's mathematical grasp.

As the second successive such championship for the team, it's an incredible achievement given how far they have come since the doldrum days of 2018. However, might an even better race result in Singapore have been possible?

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Max Verstappen had to settle for second between George Russell and Lando Norris at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen shared mixed feelings after a hard-fought run to second position in Sunday night's Singapore Grand Prix, having “struggled a lot” behind the wheel of his Red Bull throughout the race.

Red Bull headed to the high-downforce Marina Bay Street Circuit aiming to validate the apparent progress they have made with their RB21, following back-to-back wins for Verstappen in low-downforce conditions at Monza and Baku.

While Verstappen's run to second in Qualifying and the Grand Prix continued that positive trend, the reigning four-time World Champion was made to work harder than he wanted to inside the cockpit.

Verstappen was heard complaining about shift problems in particular, at one stage describing his car as “undriveable” after locking up and narrowly avoiding the barriers at Turn 14, but he survived to come home between George Russell's Mercedes and Lando Norris' McLaren.

“It was a bit more difficult than I would have hoped for, to be honest,” Verstappen reflected afterwards. “For whatever reason in the race I was struggling a lot with the downshifts and upshifts of the car. It was giving me a lot of pushing under braking, which on a street circuit you don't want!

“The car was also not where I wanted it to be, unfortunately. A few things of course to learn from that, I think, from some decisions that we made throughout the weekend in terms of the set-up.

“We didn't do a proper long run [during practice], so that doesn't help. But it's not like it's a mystery why it didn't go so well in the race, so we just need to analyse that.”

Nonetheless, Verstappen added: “Even if the balance would have been perfect, I think second was still the best possible, because you can't pass around here. As you could see, I think for more than an hour I had Lando behind me, and I think he was clearly faster, but you can't pass.

“Of course, we went for a different strategy at the start with the soft [tyre], knowing that the left-hand side grid was very dirty, which we measured over the weekend. We had to take a risk. For me, that first stint was all about just managing to go long enough.”

As for how much encouragement can be taken from the weekend, given that he finished ahead of both McLaren drivers once again despite the higher downforce track characteristics, Verstappen maintained a cautious tone.

“We were more competitive, but I think it's still not our favourite layout, let's say it like that,” the Dutchman commented. “[But] maybe some other tracks will come to us a bit more, so we just have to see it race by race.”

Verstappen's latest result has seen him make further progress in the Drivers' Championship, moving to within 41 points of Norris and 63 points of championship leader Oscar Piastri.

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Kimi Antonelli looks back on how his race unfolded for Mercedes at the Singapore Grand Prix.

Kimi Antonelli was left with mixed feelings after the Singapore Grand Prix, believing more was possible as his Mercedes team mate went on to secure victory around the Marina Bay Street Circuit.

Whilst the youngster was able to join George Russell on the podium in Canada as the latter won in Montreal, he finished fifth in Singapore on a night where the Mercedes car, in the hands of Russell, kept the Red Bull of Max Verstappen at bay with ease to win.

Antonelli was swift to point to two areas where he felt the weekend got away from him. The first was Qualifying, where he felt he did not do quite a good enough job in Q3 as his team mate grabbed pole.

The second area was the start of the race itself, where the youngster lost out to both the McLaren of Lando Norris, and Charles Leclerc's Ferrari.

“The start was difficult, left-hand side of the grid was a bit worse than the right-hand side, [it] was a bit dirtier and a bit more difficult to do a good start,” he explained after the race.

“It was a shame as it defined a bit the race. As we have seen previously, track position is extremely important. [I] lost a couple of places at the start, then [got] stuck behind Leclerc.

“The pace was really good to be honest, I felt really good in the car and just a bit disappointed because the potential was higher. I think with a better Q3, [it] could have been a different story but we'll try to do better next time.”

Antonelli was unable to get past Leclerc in the first stint, despite running within DRS range of the Ferrari for lap after lap. But once both drivers had bolted on the hard tyre, the Mercedes man was able to pull off a pass, one of very few around a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult.

That left him to come home fifth at the flag, to back up his P4 from Azerbaijan. After a tricky time of it in Europe through the summer, with that entire run of races in his home continent yielding just three points, Antonelli seems to have bounced right back into some much better form for the flyaway races.

“It was a tough race physically but I'm happy with how I managed to battle back,"" he continued. ""The pace was good, and I was able to gain a position back with a good move on Leclerc. We could have achieved more tonight but P5 is still okay.""

One of the hallmarks of the race in Singapore was how the W16 handled the hot conditions, with Mercedes normally going much better than their rivals when conditions cool off. Toto Wolff has famously joked that his team does well whenever he is forced into wearing a sweater, but that was definitely not the case in Singapore when humidity touched 80% at times.

“Definitely the car is getting stronger and stronger,” agreed Antonelli. “I'm able to really put the car where I want and really play with the car so that is a real positive one and, yeah, just really looking forward to the next few races.

“Congratulations to George for winning the race. He did a great job and maximised the result and also congratulations to McLaren for winning the Constructors' and congratulations to our department as well – they've done an incredible job [going] back-to-back, our engine is winning the Championship so incredible job from them as well.”

The Free Press founder will become editor-in-chief of CBS News, but her role outside the formal org chart is a perplexing question mark for insiders at the network.  


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The first place David Ellison went after closing Skydance's $8 billion deal for Paramount Global on Aug. 7 was the offices of CBS News on the west side of Manhattan. In meetings with the journalists and staff there, he praised the legacy of the TV news division, once the home of Edward R. Murrow, and committed to investing in its future.


	That vision, however, will be put to the test, as a long-rumored deal is now official, and the implications for the future of CBS News are consequential.




	Paramount on Monday said that it has officially acquired The Free Press, the digital publication founded by Bari Weiss, and will bring her into the fold of CBS News. The move, which had been expected for weeks, is nonetheless being greeted with dread inside the news division.

	Weiss will become editor-in-chief of CBS News, but will work outside of the current org chart by reporting directly to Paramount CEO David Ellison.

	“I have to imagine she will be his eyes and ears inside CBS News,” one staffer at the company said.


	“We are thrilled to welcome Bari and The Free Press to Paramount and CBS News. Bari is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News. This move is part of Paramount's bigger vision to modernize content and the way it connects — directly and passionately — to audiences around the world,” Ellison said in a statement.

	











	“This is an important initiative for our company and Bari will report directly to me — leading the work of The Free Press and collaborating with our CBS News team in the pursuit of making it the most trusted name in news,” he added. “We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home.”


	“This is a great moment for The Free Press,” Weiss said. “This partnership allows our ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience. We honor the extraordinary legacy of CBS News by committing ourselves to a singular mission: building the most trusted news organization of the 21st century.”


The Free Press will remain a stand-alone business outside of CBS News.


	According to one source, staff in the news division are more confused than anything by the hire: Weiss does not have TV experience (though her digital chops may be the more important skill given the trajectory of TV news right now), and her positioning of editor-in-chief is a perplexing one, with TV news organizations typically using a different organizational structure than newspapers or magazines where the title is more frequently found.


	While TV news outlets have a central reporting structure, in practice each program is led editorially by the executive producer and anchors.


	And they are perplexed by the hire of the contrarian journalist, given the kind words that Ellison said to CBS News staff the morning that Skydance closed on its acquisition of Paramount, where he pointedly made the newsroom his first stop of the day.

	











	He also told journalists at a press conference later that morning that his intent was to maintain CBS' legacy as a news organization.


	“I think we want to be fact-based and truth-based as a news organization,” Ellison said. “That's what we're about, that's the legacy of CBS. I mean, Edward Murrow founded this place.


	“Fundamentally, we want to be in the trust business, we want to be the truth business, we want to be in the fact business,” he added, saying that they wanted to appeal to the majority of the country that “would define themselves from center left to center right, and really ensure that it's a place that can be true to the legacy that we're inheriting, and we're going to invest behind that.”


	In a note to staff Monday, Ellison wrote that while the media “was founded with the mission of informing the public and fostering discussion on the issues of the day, too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart.


	“I don't pretend to have a solution to this challenge. But I do believe we each have a responsibility to do our part,” he added. “At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better — recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. That is our purpose.”

	











	How that squares with what Weiss will bring to the table remains to be seen given her well-known perspective on a range of issues, unless Ellison has other deals in mind with people who bring their own perspectives.


	Also perplexing some staff is how she will engage with Tom Cibrowski, the president of CBS News, who remains in his role. That structure leads one high-level news executive outside of CBS to wonder whether Weiss will end up having more direct impact than some people think on CBS News' output, or significantly less impact than people think.


	The argument for her asserting control over CBS News: A powerful title and a direct line to the CEO (effectively bypassing all other executives in the CBS structure) could enable her to do things that Cibrowski can't, or make moves that senior news executives or producers could otherwise block.


	The argument against it: She is effectively cleaved off from the main CBS News org chart. The anchors and executive producers of CBS News programming report into Cibrowski, who reports into Paramount TV chief George Cheeks, who reports to Ellison and Jeff Shell. It may be hard to have meaningful influence on programming unless she can find a way into that reporting structure.


	Still, in a memo of her own to CBS staff, Weiss outlined 10 core principles that she intends to bring to the network, suggesting that she intends to have a meaningful impact.


	CBS News has been in the middle of a political firestorm for almost a year.


	An interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of last year's election sparked a lawsuit from President Trump, a suit that was ultimately settled for $16 million (or something closer to $30 million, according to Trump). And last month CBS changed its interview policy for Face the Nation after facing outrage over an edit made to an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on the Sunday show.

	











	It's a situation that has left staff at CBS News anxious about what, if anything, Weiss will do to try and influence CBS News programming, and about the looming cuts that are widely expected in connection with the company-wide Paramount cuts, which are likely to happen next month.


	And inside 60 Minutes, the crown jewel of CBS News, staff are holding their breath. The appointment of Tanya Simon as executive producer drew universal acclaim from employees, but the famously independent program (it has its own correspondents, producers and production crews, and works out of offices in a different building than the rest of CBS News) is gearing up for a fight over that independence.


	Bill Owens, the show's former EP, resigned after CBS named Susan Zirinsky to a role overseeing standards for all of CBS News, including 60 Minutes, in what was seen as an unacceptable change in long-standing protocol.


	But one veteran news executive — someone skeptical of Weiss, it's worth noting — nonetheless thinks that perhaps her addition could end up being a wake-up call that the news division needs. CBS Evening News and CBS Mornings are mired in third place, and have been for years. CBS News digital is in need of a refresh, with many competitors like NBC News and CNN pouring cash into forward-looking digital efforts. In other words, the status quo wasn't good enough.


	Whether Weiss is the one to be the change agent that CBS needs is a whole other story, but the newsroom is holding its collective breath to see what happens next.

	











	You can read Ellison and Weiss' notes to staff at the company below.


Dear Team Paramount:


I think we can all agree that the temperature of our nation's social discourse feels higher than ever. Too often, the space once reserved for thoughtful dialogue has been consumed by partisan division and hostile disputes. If we are to move forward, we must find our way back to the ideals that shaped both our country and civilization itself: open exchange of ideas, vigorous yet respectful debate, and a genuine regard for the beliefs and traditions of others. This challenge extends to the media. 


While it was founded with the mission of informing the public and fostering discussion on the issues of the day, too often it has become a platform that amplifies the very partisanship tearing our society apart. George Washington warned that the primary danger in politics is partisanship. Today, that danger extends far beyond politics – threatening the fabric of our communities. When we reduce every issue to “us vs. them” or “my way vs. the wrong way,” we close ourselves off from listening, learning, and ultimately growing, both as individuals and as a society.


I don't pretend to have a solution to this challenge. But I do believe we each have a responsibility to do our part. At Paramount, we have both a unique opportunity and an obligation as stewards of one of the most iconic and respected news organizations in the world. We are challenging ourselves to do better – recognizing that we have the ability to reach a broad audience and demonstrate constructive, respectful, and bipartisan dialogue in our own work. Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding, and engage with the facts. That is our purpose.


With this in mind, I am excited to share that The Free Press is joining our Company. Since its launch just five years ago, The Free Press, under co-founder Bari Weiss' leadership, has built one of the most dynamic news organizations in the country, one that resonates with audiences of all ages and perspectives. Guided by their core values of truth, balance, and an exchange of ideas, the team has made it their mission to help restore public trust in the news – and they are delivering real results. Their dedication to independent and fearless reporting has won the devotion of some 1.5 million readers – more than 170,000 of who are them now paid subscribers – an extraordinary achievement in such a short time.












As part of this acquisition, Bari will become editor-in-chief of CBS News. She brings a passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum. This, combined with her restless desire to build, believe, and innovate, makes her a perfect fit for our storied news division. In these early days working together, I've seen the Bari who you will get to know: a person of incredible energy, judgment, and perception for what will resonate with audiences. Working alongside our exceptionally talented colleagues at CBS News, she will help ensure that our reporting remains relevant, accessible, and – most importantly – trusted in this new era for American media.


I am confident that, in the coming years, CBS News and The Free Press will make big strides and be at the forefront of a much-needed transformation in how news is gathered, reported, and delivered. Our goal is to broaden our reach while solidifying our position as a leading voice in American journalism. Every step of the way, trust and facts will remain our guiding principles as we work every day to strengthen and deepen our connection with our audience. As a news organization, we serve a vital role in the lives of Americans from every background and belief, and we embrace that responsibility with the utmost care, integrity, and purpose. We aim to do our part in helping rebuild a society where our shared humanity unites us, and where our differences become a source of strength rather than division. We are here to achieve great things together. So please join me in extending a warm welcome to Bari and the entire team from The Free Press as they join us on that journey. 


Let's go! 












David


Dear Colleagues: 


I am thrilled and humbled to be writing to you as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Growing up, CBS was a deep family tradition. Whenever I hear that tick, tick, tick or that trumpet fanfare, it sends me right back to our den in Pittsburgh. The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege. 


Right now, I imagine you have some questions. I do, too.


My goal in the coming days and weeks is to get to know you. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. I'll approach it the way any reporter would—with an open mind, a fresh notebook, and an urgent deadline. 


What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you:


I look forward to meeting many of you in the days ahead and to listening and learning from you. I am profoundly honored to join you—and I can't wait to get started. 


With gratitude and excitement, 


Bari

'Meara & Stiller: Nothing Is Lost,' a NYFF movie about the 'Severance' director's famous mom and dad, could be the humanist doc of the season.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	To an older generation, they were Stiller & Meara, the comedy duo with an endless reserve of gently absurd sketches on The Ed Sullivan Show. To a younger generation, he was the fulminating father of George Costanza on Seinfeld.


	To Ben Stiller, of course, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara were something far more intimate: his lovable but deeply complicated parents.




	The Severance-y Stiller documents his forebears in all their messy glory in Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost, a new documentary that world-premiered at the New York Film Festival on Sunday, ahead of its debut in theaters and on Apple TV+ later this month. What starts (and indeed what started out) as an affectionate but membrane-thick portrait of American comedy royalty turns into something unimaginably layered, investigating numerous spousal and parental relationships — and asking tough questions about the price of perfectionism, the pitfalls of parenthood and, really, the ultimate value of an earthly life.

	“Yeah, it's a little personal,” Stiller said before the screening as he described what his family thought of him embarking on this quest. “But it's also, I think, in a way about everyone.” 


	Even to those who know the comedy of the Jewish-American Stiller and Irish-American Meara (they died in 2020 and 2015, respectively), some of the background will surprise — he, an army veteran from an unloving Brooklyn home who urgently sought validation from audiences; she, a nimble comic talent weighted down by her mother's suicide when she was still a girl. 


	Ben Stiller, who does not skimp on his parents' best moments in front of a camera, is also not afraid to expose the dark side they showed to him and his older sister Amy; subjects like Anne's alcoholism and Jerry's work obsession at the expense of his family each get rich treatment. And the elder Stiller's relentless devotion to Meara — he is seen onscreen just once from the recent past, and it's to tout the greatness of his late wife — could blind him to her flaws and the ways her behavior at times might have been hurting the family. 

	











	But it is when Stiller turns the camera on himself — or more specifically on his wife and two kids — that the film clicks into gear, asking how much we repeat the mistakes of our parents and the limits of what we can learn from the past. Ben Stiller sought to avoid the trap of putting his work above his family, but over the course of making the movie touchingly realizes, with his kids nearly grown, he has in fact replicated it. In one of the film's most pointed moments, Stiller's 20-year-old son Quinlin sensitively tells his father he feels he and his sister came second to Ben's work, much as Ben felt he did with Jerry. The look on the director's face in that moment says it all.


	“As a filmmaker, i think ‘this is a good moment for the movie.' Stiller said after the screening of that interaction. “But personally it's ‘oh that sucks.'” (Stiller called out to his kids who were at the screening to ask what they thought of the film and Quinlin yelled back “Terrible,” to laughter, before clarifying that he thought it was great.)


	Apart from the whole famous thing, the title couple also lived exceedingly shared lives, and the film is interested in the impossible tangle of a 24-hour life and work partnership, where, as Anne says, it can be hard to know where the comedy team ends and the marriage begins. Ben Stiller and his wife Christine Taylor also frequently worked together, though with slightly fewer pitfalls; Taylor's voice, it should be said, brings high levels of consideration and insight in a film not lacking for either quality.

	











	Stiller sets the film at the sprawling Upper West Side apartment where Anne and Jerry raised their family and to which Ben and Amy have returned after Jerry's death to go through, pack up and throw out all their parents' stuff to prepare for the sale of the longtime home. And there is so much stuff. Jerry Stiller had a compulsive need to record and save everything, and as we watch Ben Stiller take it all in after his father's death, there is something both humanizing and surreal at the sight of a famous actor undergoing the same heart-wrenching ritual as everyone else.


	At that rummage-y point several years ago, Ben Stiller had no idea where his filmic lark would lead. Because Jerry Stiller had died during COVID there was no memorial, and Ben simply thought of his shoots as a kind of cinematic equivalent of one: important to the family and comedy completists, of little interest to anyone else. 


	But as he showed footage to friends and entertainment colleagues, he began to get a certain kind of feedback: maybe it would work better if you went deeper and even bared your own soul? “I was pushing myself out of it because I didn't want it to be about me,” Stiller said at the screening. “And I realized I had to go the opposite way.”


	If the director comes out of this process feeling, dishearteningly, that parental mistakes have been repeated, he does possess the vulnerability to admit it. While full generational improvement may be a pipe dream, the movie at least suggests the benefits of the modern urge to explore and expose. One can't imagine the subjects of the film ever turning a critical eye on themselves in this way; indeed, Jerry seems uncomfortable whenever Anne discusses even banal details of their relationship on camera. (Ben Stiller after the screening said he thought his mother would like the movie, but his father might be uncomfortable with how much was shared.)

	











	The film is subtitled Nothing Is Lost, and while its melancholy aura in fact contradictorily suggests that so much fades, as the Stillers comb through both artifacts and feelings, the movie also finds much encouragement in the sheer bid, however uncomfortable, to make sure some things are preserved.

A look at what Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara, Jennifer Grey and more have been doing in the years since the film was released in theaters on June 11, 1986.


							By 

	Lisa de los Reyes


Senior Copy Editor


	From Sixteen Candles to The Breakfast Club, the films of John Hughes are known for giving voice to the generation that came of age in the '80s. They captured the social pressures and responsibilities that teens struggled against in high school, giving them permission to accept the messy reality of their lives and embrace the present. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which was released in theaters nearly 40 years ago on June 11, 1986, was the epitome of all that. As Matthew Broderick memorably said in the title role: “Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” 


	The movie follows Ferris Bueller, a kid who has his parents, and most everyone else, wrapped around his little finger. He has perfected the art of faking illness, and uses this scheme to skip school and enjoy one last day in Chicago with his girlfriend (Sloane, played by Mia Sara) and his best friend (the high-strung Cameron, played by Alan Ruck), before the guys graduate. Among their exploits, the trio go to a Cubs game, a fine dining restaurant, the Art Institute of Chicago and a downtown parade, where Ferris commandeers a float and lip syncs to “Danke Schoen” for the crowd. 


	And why not? When you're about to leave for college and everything's going to change, sometimes the best thing you can do is blow off school for a day to enjoy life — and make sure it doesn't pass you by. 


	Below, THR checks in on the cast of this culture-defining hit — including Broderick, Ruck, Sara and Jennifer Grey — to see where life has taken them in the decades since its release. 


	A baby-faced Broderick had his breakout role a few years before Ferris Beuller, in 1983's WarGames. In the cyber-thriller, he plays a student who, while trying to hack into a video game, accidentally breaks into a military computer and nearly starts a nuclear war. The same year, he became the youngest actor to win a Tony for best featured actor in a play for Brighton Beach Memoirs. Ferris Bueller quickly became another calling card for the young actor, as he played the ultimate slacker with a heart of gold, outwitting his high school principal (Jeffery Jones) and antagonizing his sister (Jennifer Grey) in pursuit of a good time. 


	In '87, personal tragedy struck when Broderick and Grey, who were dating at the time, got in a serious car accident while vacationing in Northern Ireland. Two people in the other car were killed, while Broderick and Grey were both injured. In the years since the accident, Broderick (who was driving) has spoken of it only rarely, but has expressed remorse for what happened. The couple broke up not long afterward, and Broderick went on to marry Sarah Jessica Parker in 1997. The couple, who have three children, starred together on Broadway in Neil Simon's Plaza Suite in 2022. 


	Broderick continued to be an in-demand leading actor, starring opposite Helen Hunt in Project X (1987), about an Air Force project involving chimps, followed by a role as an Army recruit in Biloxi Blues (1988), a part he had previously played on Broadway. He re-upped in the military for Glory (1989), playing the commander of a Black unit in the Union Army during the Civil War, with co-stars including Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman. A few years later, Broderick was Emmy-nominated for a TV movie version of A Life in the Theatre (1993), in which he starred opposite Jack Lemmon. 


	In the Disney classic The Lion King (1994), Broderick voiced adult Simba, and in The Cable Guy (1996), he played a poor sap who gets more than he bargained for when Jim Carrey's titular character hooks him up with free cable. In 1999's Election, the tables were turned on an actor best known as a slacker student when he played the high school social studies teacher in the cult comedy starring Reese Witherspoon. That year, he also played the title character in a live-action feature version of Inspector Gadget. 


	A regular presence on the Broadway stage, Broderick won a second Tony for How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying in 1995. He would go on to star opposite Nathan Lane in The Producers in 2001, and reprised the part in the 2005 film version of the musical about two men trying to get rich by intentionally producing a Broadway flop. During this time, he also found time to play Walter, the husband of Nicole Kidman's Joanna, in The Stepford Wives (2004). Broderick's film résumé also includes The Tale of Desperaux (2008), Tower Heist (2011), Manchester by the Sea (2016) and Painkiller (2023). On television, he's popped up on shows like Modern Family, 30 Rock, The Conners and, more recently, Only Murders in the Building and Elsbeth. 


	As the high-strung and fatalistic Cameron, who finally snaps when he realizes a pair of parking attendants took his father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California for a joy ride, Ruck played the stressed-out yang to Ferris' laid-back yin. The actor had already appeared in half a dozen movies and TV movies before Bueller, making his debut in Bad Boys (1983) — not the one you're thinking about, this one centers on a reform school and stars Sean Penn. He also already knew co-star Broderick, as they performed together on Broadway in Biloxi Blues in 1985.


	After the success of Ferris Bueller, Ruck starred opposite Charlie Sheen (who also had a small but memorable part in Bueller, see below) and Kerri Green in road-trip dramedy Three for the Road (1987) and appeared in Three Fugitives (1989), a comedy led by Nick Nolte and Martin Short about bank robbers on the run, among other films. He appeared as a tourist in Speed (1994), and the same year played the captain of the Enterprise-B in the feature Star Trek: Generations. That was soon followed by Twister (1996), the classic tornado-chasing disaster film in which he played Robert “Rabbit” Nurick.


	Ruck's next memorable project was Spin City, in which he played the lovably sleazy Stuart Bondek for the show's entire run, from 1996-2002. After the sitcom wrapped, he played a neighbor of the central family in Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), a school principal in M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening (2008) and a ghost dad in the Ricky Gervais-starring Ghost Town (2008). During the aughts and 2010s, he also kept busy appearing on shows like NCIS, Psych, Burn Notice, Cougar Town, Boston Legal and Scrubs.  


	After bouncing around for a few years in this way, zeitgeist-capturing success struck again when Ruck joined HBO's smash-hit Succession, which ran from 2018-23. He played Connor Roy, the politically inclined half-sibling who is an outsider in his own family and eventually runs for president. Ruck shared in the series' awards riches, snagging an Emmy nomination and joining the cast in winning two SAG Awards for the ensemble. 


	On Broadway, Ruck replaced Broderick as Leo Bloom in The Producers in 2005 and starred as Sidney in Absurd Person Singular, which opened later that year. He met his wife, Mireille Enos, while working on the latter play, and the couple share two children. He was previously married to Claudia Stefany, with whom he also has two children.  


	Sara, who played Ferris' cool and compassionate girlfriend Sloane, made her acting debut in 1983 on All My Children before landing a role in Ridley Scott's fantasy epic Legend (1985). 


	After Bueller, she starred in the miniseries Queenie with Kirk Douglas and appeared in the film Apprentice to Murder (1988) as well as Shadows in the Storm (1988), Big Time (1989) and Melanie Griffith starrer A Stranger Among Us (1992), among others. Notably, in the time-travel sci-fi action movie Timecop (1994), she played star Jean-Claude Van Damme's wife, whose murder is a pivot point in the plot.  


	In the horror movie The Maddening (1995), Sara played a young mother held hostage by an insane couple. She also worked on numerous TV movies and miniseries, including 1997's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and later played Harley Quinn on The WB's Birds of Prey (2002-03). She starred with Ron Perlman in Hoodlum & Son (2003), a 1930s-set mob drama, and played an ally of the Wicked Witch of the West in Dorothy and the Witches of Oz (2012), in which an adult Dorothy realizes the popular books are based on suppressed experiences from her youth. 


	Sara now lives in England, where she writes poetry, and recently returned to the screen in Mike Flanagan's The Life of Chuck (2024) after an 11-year absence. 


	She is married to Brian Henson, the son of Jim Henson, with whom she has a daughter. He directed her in the 2001 miniseries Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story. She was previously married to Jason Connery, Sean Connery's son, after they co-starred with Michael Caine in the TV movie Bullet to Beijing (1995). She and Connery share a son. 


	By the time she played Ferris Bueller's type-A, jealous sister, Grey had already appeared in several movies, including 1984's Reckless, Red Dawn and The Cotton Club. But 1987, the year after Bueller came out, was when she truly made her mark as Baby in Dirty Dancing. 


	After the iconic film co-starring Patrick Swayze, Grey would struggle to reach those pop-culture defining heights again. She starred in Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989) along with Matt Dillon, Madonna and Ruck, followed by a string of TV movies. In the feature film Wind (1992), a romantic drama about yacht races, she starred opposite Matthew Modine. She also was in Bounce (2000), a romance starring Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow. 


	Grey guest starred on Friends as Rachel's former best friend Mindy, who marries Rachel's ex-fiancé Barry (she only appeared once in the role, later saying that performance anxiety kept her from returning; Jana Marie Hupp took over the part in another episode). From 1999-2001, she starred in the ABC sitcom It's Like You Know … as herself, which touched on the real-life backlash she experienced after a nose job. 


	More recently, Grey starred in Amazon's '80s-set series Red Oaks from 2014-17, and did voice work on shows like Phineas and Ferb and the Netflix movie Duck Duck Goose (2018). She also appeared in films including Untogether (2018), Bittersweet Symphony (2019) and on television in shows like Grey's Anatomy and The Conners. In A Real Pain (2024), she played Marcia, who's part of the tour group that Kieran Culkin's Benji and Jesse Eisenberg's David join in Europe. After that, she played the main character's mom in Julia Stiles' feature directing debut, the romantic drama Wish You Were Here (2025). Meanwhile, a sequel to Dirty Dancing featuring Grey is reportedly in development, though it was delayed from its originally announced 2024 release date. 


	Grey dated Broderick after the release of Ferris Bueller, and after that was in a serious relationship with Johnny Depp. She was married to Clark Gregg — the actor known as Agent Coulson from the Marvel Universe — for 20 years, and the couple co-starred in the 2006 Lifetime movie Road to Christmas. They have a daughter. In 2022, Grey released a memoir, Out of the Corner. 


	The same year that he played the tenacious yet comically outmatched principal who tries to catch Ferris Bueller in his lies, Jones starred in another film, which received a more mixed reception but ultimately earned a cult following: Howard the Duck. That film follows an intelligent duck-like alien who lands on Earth, and Jones played a scientist who is possessed by the Dark Overlord of the Universe and kidnaps Howard the Duck's human love interest, Beverly.  


	In 1988, Jones found success again as Charles Deetz, Lydia's (Winona Ryder) straitlaced father, in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice. He later appeared in Burton's Ed Wood (1994) and Sleepy Hollow (1999). However, he would not return for 2024's Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, as it is revealed in a stop-motion scene that his character was killed by a shark after a plane crash, leaving Delia (Catherine O'Hara) a widow; his funeral is the reason the family returns to their haunted home. 


	Jones also had a part in The Hunt for Red October (1990) and played the greedy Thomas Putnam in The Crucible (1996), reuniting with Ryder. He played Eddie Barzoon, the managing partner of the law firm where Keanu Reeves works in The Devil's Advocate (1997), and was Uncle Crenshaw in Stuart Little (1999). He also appeared in Company Man (2000); Heartbreakers (2001), starring Jennifer Love Hewitt and Gene Hackman; and Dr. Dolittle 2 (2001), among other projects. 


	In 2003, Jones pled no contest when he was accused of hiring a 14-year-old boy to pose naked for photos, and was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to register as a sex offender. After this, there was a dropoff in his career, though he played A.W. Merrick on HBO's Deadwood from 2004-06 and returned for the Deadwood movie in 2019.  


	Born Carlos Irwin Estévez, Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen, and made an uncredited appearance in Badlands, in which his father starred, before the age of 10. In Ferris Bueller, the then 21-year-old appears in one scene in which Jennifer Grey's Jeanie has been sent to the police station for “falsely” reporting an intruder in her home. After unashamedly admitting he was arrested for drugs, he imparts some wisdom to Jeanie regarding her problem with Ferris, and the two make out. 


	In 1986, the year that Bueller came out, Sheen appeared in several other movies, most notably Oliver Stone's Platoon, about which the actor wrote in detail in his 2025 memoir. In the '80s and '90s, Sheen's star would continue to rise, as he appeared in films like Wall Street (1987), playing stockbroker Bud Foxx opposite Michael Douglas; Young Guns (1988), alongside his brother Emilio Estévez; Clint Eastwood buddy cop movie The Rookie (1990); and The Three Musketeers (1993), as Aramis. 


	He turned to television in 2000 with Spin City, taking over the starring role after the departure of Michael J. Fox, whose Parkinson's diagnosis had made it difficult for him to perform. After that show wrapped, Sheen went on to star in Two and a Half Men, becoming the highest-paid male sitcom actor of all time. During this period, he also appeared in several of the Scary Movie films. 


	After a very public meltdown — which was attributed to drugs but which Sheen later said was caused by overuse of testosterone cream — and the disintegration of his relationship with Men creator Chuck Lorre, Sheen was banned from the Warner Bros. lot and embarked on a national tour where he made “Winning!” into a catchphrase. Despite Sheen's defiance, he was replaced on Men by Ashton Kutcher. He returned to TV in 2012 with Anger Management, but his casting in major film and TV projects certainly slowed in subsequent years. In 2015, he announced that he was HIV positive, and in 2025 he released his memoir The Book of Sheen and was the subject of the Netflix documentary aka Charlie Sheen. 


	Stein has an economics degree and has worked as a lawyer and presidential speechwriter, as well as an author and columnist for top-flight newspapers like The Wall Street Journal. Despite all this, he is perhaps most iconic for the line “Bueller? Bueller?”, which he delivered as an economics teacher calling roll. 


	After Ferris Bueller, the man famous for his dry delivery went on to appear as an airport representative in Planes, Trains & Automobiles (1987), a public works official in Ghostbusters II (1989), a teacher in Richie Rich (1994) and a psychologist in The Mask (1994). He also had parts in My Girl 2 (1994) and Casper (1995) and appeared on 11 episodes of The Wonder Years.


	He notably hosted 99 episodes of Win Ben Stein's Money (1997-2002) and was a panelist on game shows like Match Game and Hollywood Squares, as well as a judge on Star Search (2003) and a commentator on CBS News Sunday Morning. He also did voicework including on the TV series The Emperor's New School and made guest appearances on Family Guy. More recently, Stein touched down in 2018's The Last Sharknado: It's About Time. He's currently listed on several speakers' bureau websites as being available for public lectures, with fees posted at anywhere between $20,000 and $100,000, and writes a column called “Ben Stein's Diary” for The American Spectator. He's also written more than 20 nonfiction books and seven novels.

This Trumpian moment recalls the industry's infamous blacklist era. Fittingly, Jane Fonda has resurrected the Committee for the First Amendment.


							By 

	Chris Yogerst



	“Any investigation into the political beliefs of the individual is contrary to the basic principles of our democracy,” read the stern words from the star-studded Committee for the First Amendment (CFA) on Oct. 28, 1947.


	The CFA was founded that year in Hollywood by John Huston, William Wyler and Philip Dunne in response to the speech-chilling loyalty investigations foisted upon the industry by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Today, the CFA has been resurrected by Jane Fonda, whose own father, Henry Fonda, was an early member of the original organization, and it has already locked horns with the Trump White House.

	This time around, the signatories feature a range of talent like Ben Stiller, Helen Mirren, Spike Lee, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Larry David, Natalie Portman, Nicolas Cage and Nikki Glaser. The motives of the new CFA are clear, as its website states, “The federal government is once again engaged in a coordinated campaign to silence critics in the government, the media, the judiciary, academia, and the entertainment industry.”

	The anti-communist witch hunts of the 1940s and 1950s across American industries were a precursor to the Trump White House's own targeting of immigrants, professors, media personalities or anyone who dares push back against America's authoritarian lurch. The new CFA is billed as a McCarthy-era movement, but it's important to note that the CFA predates McCarthy by several years, as does HUAC, which began in 1938.

	











	The CFA's origin story is an instructive legend worth revisiting during this increasingly heated moment.


	It was The Hollywood Reporter's founder, Billy Wilkerson, who published an unhinged screed on July 8, 1947, about the industry supposedly kowtowing to Soviet sensibilities. A couple weeks later, on July 29, he unleashed one of the most infamous columns in Hollywood history. Titled “A Vote for Joe Stalin,” the column attacks the Screen Writers Guild as “thought-police” for endorsing the American Authors Authority (regarding copyright protection), before naming names of suspected communists in Hollywood: Dalton Trumbo, Maurice Rapf, Lester Cole, Howard Koch, Harold Buchman, John Wexley, Ring Lardner Jr., Harold Salemson, Henry Myers, Theodore Strauss and John Howard Lawson.


	The names and assertions were all the U.S. government needed as justification to set their sights on Hollywood. A perfect conduit to get national attention on their bullying campaign.


Wilkerson's rhetoric was Trumpian in tone, criticizing those he disagreed with as supporters of a communist agenda working to “surrender freedom of speech or freedom of conscience.” Wrapping himself in the American flag, Wilkerson's word salad grumbled through accusation after accusation, maintaining that the political left sought a “monopoly of opinion.” By claiming to protect freedom of speech, Wilkerson helped launch a war against it.


	On Sept. 23, 1947, 45 members of the American film industry were subpoenaed by HUAC to prove their loyalty to the United States. Signed by committee chairman J. Parnell Thomas (R-NJ), the subpoenas were “a command to perform — perform before a legislative ringmaster, at a grand, three-ring investigation of Hollywood,” wrote screenwriter Gordon Kahn in Hollywood on Trial (1948). Kahn lost his job at the end of 1947, one of hundreds of artists blacklisted for supposed subversive activities.

	











	“Everybody is afraid of being investigated,” wrote Kahn, noting the mood around Tinseltown before he fled. “The prospects are that pictures like Grapes of Wrath, Gentleman's Agreement and others with force and meaning — the kind in which writers, actors, and directors can take pride — will be strangers to the screen in America.” While current power brokers haven't scrapped movies over their content, yet, Hollywood has a recent history of companies obeying in advance by shelving projects until the tensions cool.


	The original Committee for the First Amendment signed a statement published in The Hollywood Reporter on Oct. 21, 1947, that denounced HUAC because “any investigation into the political beliefs of the individual is contrary to the basic principles of our democracy.”


	Going further, the CFA wrote, “any attempt to curb freedom of expression and to set arbitrary standards of Americanism is in itself disloyal to both the spirit and letter of our Constitution.” The undersigned read with names like Henry Fonda, the Epstein brothers (of Casablanca fame), Ava Gardner, Katharine Hepburn, Myrna Loy, Vincent Price, Billy Wilder, Milton Sperling (son-in-law of Harry Warner, who urged his own brother, Jack, to ignore HUAC).


	While enjoying drinks at Lucy's across the street from Paramount Studios, William Wyler, Humphrey Bogart, John Huston and Lauren Bacall devised a hasty plan to show up in Washington to protest the hearings. Wyler's Oscar-winning film The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) — a timely tale of the weight of coming home from World War II — was named as subversive by HUAC.

	











	A small group of Hollywood CFA representatives flew to Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, led by Bogart and Bacall. The group marched proudly to the courtroom and sat for the hearings on the following day. Filled with cameras and newsreel operators, the events were highly reported and recorded. Stars such as Bogart, Bacall, June Havoc, Evelyn Keyes, Richard Conte and Geraldine Brooks listened to the tumultuous tussle between Chairman Thomas and screenwriter John Howard Lawson, who penned such films as Blockade (1938), Action in the North Atlantic (1943) and Sahara (1943), and was named as a subversive by Billy Wilkerson two months prior.


	As HUAC's chief investigator Robert Stripling questioned Lawson's political connections, the screenwriter pushed back about the legality of such questions. Thomas pounded his gavel continuously in protest to Lawson's self-defense as an American citizen.


	“It's unfortunate and tragic that I have to teach this committee the basic principles of Americanism,” Lawson fired back after being asked if he was a member of the Communist Party. As the gavel continued to crack, Lawson kept speaking but was quickly surrounded by police.


	MPAA president Eric Johnston followed by denouncing screenwriter Lawson and claiming he would not allow communists to work in the film industry. Importantly, Johnston also argued that HUAC should give any suspected subversives a fair trial. Johnston smartly pointed to the 1941 Senate investigations into anti-Nazi movies where Hollywood adequately defended their industry against claims of extremism and warmongering. Going further, Johnston articulated that any movement based on hate will ultimately fail — as was seen with fascism and communism — and maintained there is “very little if any communist propaganda in our pictures.”  

	











	Despite Johnston's testimony, the CFA would get associated not with the MPAA president but with the fireworks at Johnston's hearing. Chairman Thomas even snapped at the Hollywood attendees, calling them “glamor girls.”


	Leaving Washington, D.C., CFA members were sullen and worried. They arrived with confidence and left with trepidation from what they witnessed. Determined to push forward, the committee issued another ad in THR and the trades on Oct. 28 titled “Hollywood Fights Back!” Like today, the CFA mused whether people knew what the First Amendment even said. The Oct. 28 advertisement reminds readers of the seriousness of HUAC's free speech violation.


	The original CFA landed 135 members, many recognizable names including Lucille Ball, Kirk Douglas, Benny Goodman, Rita Hayworth, Ben Hecht, Burt Lancaster, Peter Lorre, Groucho Marx, Vincent Price, Donna Reed, Edward G. Robinson, Claire Trevor and Orson Welles. Many of Tinseltown's towering personalities appeared on a CFA radio show broadcast on Oct. 26 and Nov. 2. “Before every free conscience in America is subpoenaed,” warned Judy Garland, “Tell them how much you resent the way Mr. Thomas is kicking the living daylights out of the Bill of Rights!” Ball argued that “all civil liberties go hand in hand, and when one goes the others are weakened, just as the collapse of one pillar in a house would endanger the whole structure.”

	











	Surprisingly, Academy Award-winning director William Wyler was given space in The Hollywood Reporter on Nov. 6 to criticize the media coverage of CFA. Infamous gossip columnist Hedda Hopper had weaponized her column to attack the free speech warriors on the CFA and defend HUAC's crusade. “No member of our group is a Communist or is in anyway sympathetic to Communistic doctrine,” wrote Wyler, “we have continuously emphasized that we did not, nor do we now, defend or attack any individual or group within the motion picture industry.”  Wyler expressed that the CFA was “non-partisan” and included both Democrats and Republicans and was ultimately “anti-totalitarian and pro-democratic.”


	However, after a series of HUAC testimonies from friendly witnesses decrying subversion in Hollywood and a combative set of unfriendly witnesses — including Trumbo, who called the hearing “the beginning of an American concentration camp” — who questioned HUAC's right to subpoena American citizens to question their loyalty, a blacklist began. On Nov. 25, 1947, a majority of Hollywood top brass met at the Waldorf Astoria in New York and drafted the notorious Waldorf Statement that promised no studio would employ anyone who was a communist or suspected subversive.


	Political players had painted Hollywood red with communism and the studios threw up their hands. Anyone pushing back against HUAC was a traitor, a red, and should be exiled. Bogart, as the biggest star in the CFA, felt the most pressure. After appearing on the cover of the Daily Worker, Bogart fully repudiated his trip to Washington in defense of the First Amendment. As Variety reported on Dec. 3, Bogart claimed the Washington, D.C., trip was “Ill-advised and even foolish.” The actor added, “I am not a communist.” The CFA was mortified and assumed that Warner Bros., the home studio for Bogart and Bacall, forced them to pull back their political advocacy.

Harrison, a failed screenwriter and a prudish independent journalist, stood solidly with HUAC. “Gag the prima donnas” read Harrison's front page editorial on Dec. 6, 1947, speaking of the CFA and anyone in Hollywood who wanted to use their First Amendment-protected right to speak.


	In 2025, the resurrected CFA already has well over 500 names. Late night television hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert are canaries in the coal mine, and they are still chirping for now despite the latter facing a cancellation announcement that is yet to take effect. 


	The White House responded to Jane Fonda with the usual mixture of derision and deflection, “Hanoi Jane is free to share whatever bad opinions she wants. As someone who actually knows what it's like to be censored, President Trump is a strong supporter of free speech and Democrat allegations to the contrary are so false, they're laughable.” In short, Fonda can share what she wants, but Colbert and Kimmel will get government threats and intimidation if they do the same.


	Today's CFA intends to educate about autocracy, the First Amendment, and the “ecology of what we're dealing with.”


	The original CFA's impact, despite its valiant cause, only went so far. The Blacklist happened, livelihoods were ruined and freedom of thought was squelched for years as Americans were pushed into a corner of fear and anger. This struggle, well on its warpath before Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI) hit the national state, was described by Trumbo as having “only victims.” Today's playbook is similar to 1947 — label any dissent as unpatriotic, subversive, Marxist and so on. Anything to avoid engaging with differing views. The difference is today's Committee for the First Amendment has infinitely more avenues for communication in the digital age, in addition to an infinitely larger list of participants. Perhaps, if we're lucky, there won't be only victims this time around.

The KPop Demon Hunters smash extends its run, while McRae earns her third top 10.

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-hauling animated film KPop Demon Hunters, tops the Billboard Hot 100 for an eighth week.


	The anthem by the singing trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, in the roles of KPop Demon Hunters characters Rumi, Mira and Zoey, ties for the eighth-longest command for a song from a movie over the Hot 100's 67-year history. It's also now the sole second-longest-leading hit ever by an all-women group.


	Previously, “Golden,” which first ruled the Hot 100 in August, made HUNTR/X the first female group associated with Korean pop to reign. The song is additionally the sole longest-leading hit by an animated group in the chart's archives, while KPop Demon Hunters became the first soundtrack to generate four simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s.


	For a second week, the song crowns the Hot 100 while the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack is No. 1 on the Billboard 200. They previously doubled up atop the Sept. 20-dated charts.


	Elsewhere, Tate McRae's new single, “Tit for Tat,” launches at No. 3 on the Hot 100, becoming her third top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.






	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 11, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Oct. 7. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 32.3 million official streams (down 4% week-over-week), 38.3 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 13%) and 6,000 sold (down 13%) in the United States Sept. 26-Oct. 2.


	The track tallies an 11th week at No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart; ascends 9-8 on Radio Songs; and rises 2-1 for a third week atop Digital Song Sales.


	With an eighth week pacing the Hot 100, “Golden” ties as the eighth-longest-ruling hit from a movie all-time, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start.


	Here's a look at the longest-leading movie songs in the Hot 100's history (as defined by qualifications used for Billboard's Top 75 Movie Songs of All Time recap, which is based on weekly performance on the chart):




	Plus, “Golden” surpasses TLC's “Waterfalls” to become the sole second-longest-leading Hot 100 hit by an all-female group (of three or more members). It now goes chasing only Destiny's Child's “Independent Women Part I” (11 weeks, 2000-01).


	Here's a recap of the 10 longest-ruling songs in the category:


	Tate McRae's new stand-alone single, “Tit for Tat,” bounds onto the Hot 100 at No. 3. In its first week, following its Sept. 26 release, the song totaled 19.7 million streams, 53,000 airplay impressions and 2,000 sold (boosted by buzz that the song may be about her ex, The Kid LAROI).


	McRae adds her third Hot 100 top 10, with her second adjacent: Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring McRae, holds at No. 4, after it led in its first week in May. (It adds a milestone 20th week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.) McRae matches her best Hot 100 rank as a lead artist — “Greedy” hit No. 3 in January 2024. With “Tit for Tat,” she claims both her highest Hot 100 debut and top weekly streaming count in a lead role.


	Notably, “Revolving Door” remains McRae's current promoted radio single; it keeps at its No. 9 best on the Pop Airplay chart. The song, which debuted at its No. 22 Hot 100 peak in March and rises 52-45 on the current list, is from her latest album, So Close to What, which that month blasted in as her first No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” holds at No. 2 on the Hot 100, after 10 nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It posts a 16th week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (up 2% to 76.8 million in audience — a new weekly best), tying for the fifth-longest reign in the chart's 35-year history.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” climbs 8-5 on the Hot 100.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which topped the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and went on to become last year's No. 1 song, rises 7-6. It logs a record-extending 111th week on the chart overall and a record-padding 80th week in the top 10.


	Also from KPop Demon Hunters, Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” slips to No. 7 from its No. 3 Hot 100 high and their “Your Idol” falls 5-10, after reaching No. 4. (Both are sung by Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.)


	Additionally in the Hot 100's top 10, Morgan Wallen's “I Got Better” rises 11-8, after reaching No. 7, and Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” holds at No. 9, after hitting No. 5.

	With “Which One,” Drake strings together his fourth No. 1 in a row on the list — all coming in 2025. “Nokia” reigned for two weeks in May, followed by the PARTYNEXTDOOR and Cash Cobain collaboration “Somebody Loves Me” in July for a week and the three-week rule of “What Did I Miss?” beginning in August.

	That run equals Drake's longest streak of rulers on Rhythmic Airplay. He previously went four in a row between 2018 and 2019, albeit largely as a featured act on Bad Bunny's “MIA” and Meek Mill's “Going Bad” and Chris Brown's “No Guidance,” followed by a lead-act reign of his own via “Money in the Grave,” featuring Rick Ross.


	It's also Drake's fourth nonconsecutive calendar year with at least four No. 1s, as well as his first with four or more No. 1s as a lead act since 2016.




	His 43rd No. 1 extends his record for the most Rhythmic Airplay toppers in the chart's 33-year history.


Most No. 1s, Rhythmic Airplay:43, Drake17, Rihanna16, The Weeknd14, Chris Brown13, Bruno Mars13, Lil Wayne13, Usher12, Beyonce12, Nicki Minaj


	As for Central Cee, “Which One” is his first Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 in his eighth appearance on the ranking. His previous best, “Band4Band,” a collaboration with Lil Baby, peaked at No. 2 in 2024.


	“Which One” also jumps to No. 1 on Rap Airplay, Central Cee's first ruler and Drake's record-extending 45th. That's two in a row for Drake, as “What Did I Miss?” reigned for three weeks beginning this August. Central Cee previously reached No. 3 with “Band4Band.”


Most No.1s, Rap Airplay:45, Drake13, Lil Wayne10, Ye9, Jay-Z9, Nicki Minaj8, Cardi B8, Kendrick Lamar7, 50 Cent7, T.I.


	Concurrently, “Which One” also lifts 12-10 on Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay and 14-13 on R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay. It's Drake's chart-leading 91th top 10 on the former and Central Cee's second.


	“Which One” debuted at No. 23 on the all-format, multimetric Billboard Hot 100 dated Aug. 9 and ranks at No. 87 on the latest tally via 16.5 million radio audience impressions and 2.4 million official U.S. streams earned in the week ending Oct. 2, according to Luminate.


	The song is expected to be part of Iceman, Drake's ninth studio album, a release date for which has not yet been announced.


	All Billboard charts dated Oct. 11 will update on Billboard.com on Tuesday, Oct. 7.

Mike Rittberg and Mark Flaherty will lead the initiative's two divisions.

Industry News Editor


HYBE America has unveiled HYBE Label Service (HLS), its first global division dedicated to supporting HYBE artists in international markets. The new unit will unify global operations across distribution, manufacturing, and marketing & promotion (M&P), with the goal of expanding the reach and impact of HYBE's roster.


	To lead HLS, HYBE America has promoted Ryan Hyeong Woo Noh to chief business officer. Formerly the company's chief strategy officer, Noh will oversee core business operations from HYBE's Los Angeles headquarters, reporting to HYBE CEO Jason Jaesang Lee and HYBE America CEO Isaac Lee. Since joining HYBE in 2022, Noh has played a key role in the company's growth, bringing more than 15 years of experience in entertainment and gaming — including senior leadership positions at Nexon US Holdings, where he led international business development and managed post-merger integration.


	HLS is structured into two core divisions: Global Distribution and Global M&P. Mike Rittberg has been appointed president of global distribution, responsible for strategic release planning and catalog management. Rittberg previously served as COO of Big Machine Label Group (BMLG), where he led marketing and streaming initiatives. Mark Flaherty joins as president of Global M&P, tasked with leading global marketing strategies. Flaherty's career spans major labels like Warner Records, Interscope, and Sony Music, as well as entrepreneurial ventures such as Fanatical Music & Marketing, where he helped expand Southeast Asian talent globally, including the girl group Bini.


	HYBE executives emphasized the strategic importance of HLS in expanding global reach and supporting artists, with Lee calling the launch a “pivotal moment” in the company's global strategy. “By centralizing our essential global support functions and bringing in top-tier leaders like Mike Rittberg and Mark Flaherty, we are providing our artists with an unparalleled platform for continued worldwide success,” he said.


	Noh emphasized strengthening connections between HYBE's regional capabilities and “our powerful partners while enabling our artists and labels to more seamlessly reach and engage with audiences across different markets worldwide.”


	Rittberg praised HYBE's innovative approach to global music, saying it is “redefining what's possible in global music,” while Flaherty added he was excited to help “stretch the boundaries of what a global music company can be.”


	The launch of HLS follows the recent departure of Scooter Braun as CEO of HYBE America. Braun had overseen acquisitions including BMLG and Quality Control Music, each purchased for $300 million.


	HYBE plans to expand HLS into additional regions, reallocating resources to reinforce its global presence. The initiative highlights the company's ongoing push toward long-term international artist development. HYBE America, a subsidiary of HYBE Corp., operates a portfolio that includes Scooter Braun Projects, BMLG and Quality Control Music.

The ""Hurricane"" singer adds another impressive stat to his career.


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



Luke Combs has surpassed Garth Brooks as the highest-certified country artist in history by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).


	Combs has sold and streamed a combined 168 million units (units can be albums or singles), according to RIAA. Brooks stands at 162.5 million and had held the record for more than 20 years.


	“When my team first told me about this, my initial reaction was, ‘Are you sure? There's no way.' It was only 8 years ago that I got my first [RIAA] plaque for ‘Hurricane' going gold,” Combs said in a statement. “I knew then, without a doubt, I had the best fans in the world. The song had gone platinum before they could even give me the gold plaque. I'm super humbled by the fans' belief in me and support of my music today and over the years. I know this does not happen without them. This achievement is more so theirs than it is mine. All I ever hoped and dreamed of from the beginning of this crazy ride was to make music that made people feel something and I can't wait to continue making country music for the rest of my life.”

	Combs already held the record for the most Diamond-certified singles for a country artist with four. Diamond-certified singles have sold/streamed 10 million units, and Combs' four to surpass that tally are “Beautiful Crazy,” “When It Rains It Pours,” “Hurricane” and “She Got the Best of Me.”

	











	The news comes as Combs' current single, “Back in the Saddle,” climbs to No. 8 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart. On Friday, Combs released The Prequel, a three-song set with “My Kinda Saturday Night,” “15 Minutes” and “Days Like These” via Sony Music Nashville.




	It's already been a stellar year for Combs, who is up for three awards at November's CMA Awards, including entertainer of the year, and recently announced that he and wife Nicole are expecting their third child. After his extensive worldwide tour in 2024, Combs has concentrated on playing festivals this year and is the first country artist to headline both Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza. Later this month, he will headline the Austin City Limits Music Festival.


Drake is the RIAA's highest-certified artist across all genres, with 298.5 units sold and streamed, followed by Taylor Swift at 242.5 million units. Combs now stands at ninth among all artists.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	WWE vet Dwayne Johnson learned about his Achilles heel at the box office this weekend in Taylor Swift and Leonardo DiCaprio, after his R-rated drama The Smashing Machine, hit the mat as the blockbuster star's lowest opening ever with $5.9M U.S. 


	Indeed, this is quite upsetting for Johnson, for the story of UFC champ Mark Kerr was a passion project; the wrestler-turned actor announcing the movie back at the UFC 244 card weigh-in in November 2019. 


	Upsetting, as Johnson is a tireless promoter who leaves no stone unturned on the PR tour. Like Swift he has a social media reach of a half billion-plus, one which he speaks to directly. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Upsetting as there truly seemed to be an awards glow on The Smashing Machine coming out of its Venice Film Festival World premiere after its 15 1/2 minute standing ovation, Johnson crying on a global stage, Safdie's Silver Lion win and a seemingly good 73% Rotten Tomatoes certified fresh critical score.   


	But it's never a good sign when a movie plummets from its initial projections on tracking. Three weeks ago, Smashing Machine was forecasted to be one of A24‘s highest openings in the high teens to $20M range. 


	What the hell happened? 


	Just like Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party for a Showgirl is a box office case study in its last-minute announcement and thrifty marketing campaign which fueled a $34M opening, so is the fallout here from Smashing Machine.  


	Word began to leak at Smashing Machine‘s Toronto North American premiere that the movie wasn't all that. And, no, not because Johnson was stretching with an edgy dramatic performance, rather Smashing Machine wasn't an underdog sports movie, nor necessarily one about a champ's downfall, rather a very non-traditional, deliberately paced movie about an athlete struggling with drug addiction. The movie's B- CinemaScore is on par with A24's cinematic canon which is known to divide critics and moviegoers. 

	











	Here's the good news before diving into the bad, and that's this movie at a net $50M production cost with tax credits from Vancouver and New Mexico won't lose much, estimates being in the $10M-$15M range. 


	On the low end, that's based on a final domestic between $14M-$20M. How great that loss becomes hinges on how hard A24 wants to push the movie this awards season, insiders telling us that the NYC label continues to support the movie, and stands behind the filmmaker's vision. Smashing Machine‘s budget is propped by foreign sales (which the Rock lobbied for back at Cannes 2024) estimated to be in the $35M range. A24 also has a great pay-one deal in HBO Max. 


Smashing Machine was a project foreign buyers liked in qualitative terms but at the time, sources say there were concerns over its commerciality as a story with an unrecognizable Johnson onscreen and UFC lesser known cultural presence outside the United States. Johnson took a $4M fee, significantly below his historical $20M+ paycheck plus points. Sources say he even gave a portion of his paycheck to Emily Blunt and Kerr. Theatrical P&A is factored at an estimated $15M. 


	While that net $50M might be low for a Rock movie, it's considerably high for a wrestling movie. Reality check: There's a very low ceiling on wrestling movies at the box office and arguably always has been, outside Jared Hess' 2006 Nacho Libre which opened post the director's fanfare of Napoleon Dynamite, when Jack Black original comedies could debut to $28.3M and end their domestic run at $80M. 


	Look back at the grosses of wrestling movies, and Smashing Machine‘s actually seems above average, i.e. A24's 2023 Iron Claw ($4.8M 3-day, $35M domestic), Darren Aronofsky's 2x Oscar nominated The Wrestler (its highest grossing weekend at $3.7M was its 6th with a $26.2M final domestic in 2008) and Bennett Miller's 2014 Foxcatcher ($1M in its widest break, final of $12M). Heck, even the Robert Aldrich directed, Peter Falk starring 1981 nudie comedy, …All the Marbles, about female-wrestling fell outside the ring with $6.1M domestic. 


	In regards to Smashing Machine‘s misfire, some are elbowing A24 and its means of marketing. The hipster specialty cinema brand no doubt wants to graduate to bigger headliner projects, evident in their business with Johnson here and their upcoming Josh Safdie directed movie Marty Supreme with 2x Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet. Criticizes one boutique studio exec, “If A24 wants to make movies at this budget threshold with A list stars they can't just rely on their digital-social media and tastemaker driven campaigns. It's a very a different ballgame.” The misfiring of Smashing Machine comes in the wake of A24 bungling the opening of horror-comedy, Death of a Unicorn, back in the spring, which after a receptive world premiere at SXSW with Wednesday megastar, Jenna Ortega, tanked with a $5.7M opening and final $12.8M domestic. Many believe that A24, particularly with a star like Ortega, could have positioned the movie better. While 64% 18-34 showed up for Smashing Machine, the entire over-35 specialty adult crowd was completely missed.


	Optics you don't expect on a wide release for the Rock had Benny Safdie walking around Manhattan, passing out flyers and promoting the movie with a sandwich board. 

pic.twitter.com/SSFr9QYkcP


	iSpot shows Warner Bros with One Battle After Another outspending Smashing Machine, 13 to 1 on linear. To A24's defense, they did hit up sports programming, it's just that some believe it came too late with spots during MLB playoffs, NFL, college football, ESPN SportsCenter and Jimmy Kimmel Live. Movie marketing execs say it took a lot for Warner Bros' to get One Battle After Another to a $20M+ opening; that DiCaprio-starring, Paul Thomas Anderson-directed movie towering over Smashing Machine in 2nd place with a 2nd weekend of $11M.

	











	UFC CEO Dana White was a definite proponent of Smashing Machine and embraced it early with several screenings for UFC tastemakers as well as signed-off integrations. Fans of the sport at 279 million strong around the globe didn't come out. Why? Again, word of mouth, but also, they're a homebound demo, shelling high priced money to watch fights in their living room. Smashing Machine is the type of movie they're bound to catch on their couch. 


	Despite all the rah-rah coming out of Venice for the film, it also comes as another warning sign for other auteur driven starry movies down the road (who can forget Joker: Folie a Deux) looking to make an awards season world premiere there. If you paddle to the Lido, better have the goods, or else a movie winds up saddled with a critical reaction a month or so before it opens. Some in tracking ponder whether a 76% certified fresh score is a solid indicator when it comes to forecasting opening weekends.


	The eleventh-hour addition of AMC's Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl which won the weekend sans trailers or one-sheets, certainly didn't help Smashing Machine. While there's no overlap in demos between Swift and Rock, essentially she ran away with his movie's higher ticket priced premium large format screens, not to mention, if you're surfing the web over the weekend, you were apt to land on a movie ticket portal for the 14x Grammy winner's movie, not the multi-billion dollar leading man. As we mentioned in our weekend coverage, Swift was able to rally with very little promotion because she was tied to her own cultural event, that being her 12th album drop, not to mention she's in a zone that fans crave to watch her. The latter couldn't be said about Johnson and his fans when it came to Smashing Machine. 


	Johnson has been in this specialty slump before: The $17M-budgeted 2006 gonzo movie Southland Tales grossed under $300K at the domestic B.O. after a Cannes Film Festival world premiere. Not to mention, audiences weren't really in their seats for his last R-rated movie, 2013's Pain & Gain which earned a C+ (despite the Michael Bay bodybuilders and drugs movie opening to $20.2M).


	But there's no need for Johnson to sweat: He'll be back in all victory belt box office glory soon with the openings of Disney's live-action Moana on July 10, 2026 and Sony's Jumanji 3 on Dec. 11 next year as well. 


	Johnson posted three hours before this post, “From deep in my grateful bones, thank you to everyone who has watched The Smashing Machine.”


	“In our storytelling world, you can't control box office results — but what I realized you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. And I will always run to that opportunity,” he continued while summing, “Truth is this film has changed my life.”

This movie should have been made for $10-15M max.! A24 should know better.  Dwayne taking $4M when he doesn't need it. Greedy.  Not smart and they deserve to lose.

Did he not tap into the WWE at all?

What kept me away, aside from apathy, was that I have no desire to see The Rock and Emily Blunt onscreen together again. Their chemistry in Jungle Cruise was passable at best, but no romantic spark at all – to watch them do it again but with no jokes? Negative interest. And I *like* both of these actors.

It's a wonderful movie and a story worth telling. Credit to Dwayne for doing something different as an actor. Cinema attendance in general has been on a drop since the pandemic. Go see the movie yourself and make up your own mind.

There should be bigger consequences for people who back films that lose so much money. But Benny Safdie will continue to work. And so will DJ.

10-15??? Puh. leeeez.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Cindy Holland and her team have officially announced themselves to the TV marketplace by scooping up a big package with a big commitment in a big bidding war. In Paramount+‘s first official greenlight since its parent company was acquired by Skydance, the streamer has given a straight-to-series order to Discretion, a legal thriller from A24 written and executive produced by The Husbands author Chandler Baker, which has Nicole Kidman (The Perfect Couple) and Elle Fanning (The Great) starring and executive producing and Susannah Grant (Unbelievable) executive producing.


	Paramount+, led by Paramount's new Direct-to-Consumer chair Holland, flexed some serious muscle to land the high-profile project, which sparked a bidding frenzy when it was taken out by A24 last month, resulting in seven offers, including multiple straight-to-series as well as script-to-series and writers room commitments, I hear. It is the kind of statement Paramount's new film leadership made shortly after the merger was completed by nabbing High Side, the hot movie package re-teaming A Complete Unknown's James Mangold and Timothée Chalamet.

					'Lioness' Renewed For Season 3 By Paramount+		
			








	Those moves are part of a big content ramp-up by the new regime that has included a string of high-profile deals, including a blockbuster film and TV pact with Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer. Holland's talent relationships forged during her 18-year tenure at Netflix are believed to have played a major role in both landing the Duffer brothers and winning Discretion. 












	In Discretion, which has an eight-episode order, Lenny (Fanning), a summer associate at a prestigious Dallas law firm, uncovers a web of NDAs masking a dark truth. When she realizes she signed the same agreement, her discoveries put her in the crosshairs of the firm's most powerful female partner Sharon (Kidman)—upending their mentor-protégé dynamic and raising the question: who gets to keep secrets, and at what cost?


	There has been a lot of curiosity what Holland, who led Netflix's foray into original scripted series with hits like House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things, The Crown, Ozark and The Queen's Gambit, will do in putting her stamp at Paramount+.


	“We want to entertain all audiences around the world,” she told Deadline in August about her programming strategy, adding that she wants to expand upon the streamer's current foundation of the Taylor Sheridan universe, the Star Trek franchise and CBS next-day programming.


	She also revealed to Deadline at the time that Paramount+ will be buying from third parties “because we want to be programming the best stories regardless of what the producing entity is,” a departure from the streamer's previous model of relying entirely on its sibling studios for scripted content.


	According to sources, Holland and her top programming executive, Jane Wiseman, EVP, Head of Originals for Paramount+, had been sending out feelers to the creative community about their interest in premium female-driven drama series to compliment Sheridan's male-skewing slate, with female thrillers near the top of their wish list.


Discretion fits that bill, and it comes from an outside supplier, A24.


	The indie studio put the project together. It acquired the rights to Baker's yet-to-be-published short story Discretion in a highly competitive situation involving multiple bidders. According to sources, the studio stepped up with a 7-figure purchase price and additional million dollars in script/development fees, making this one of the biggest IP sales of the year, especially for an unpublished short story.


	A24 then attached Oscar and Emmy winner Kidman and Emmy nominee Fanning, reuniting the stars who have worked together in Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled, How To Talk To Girls At Parties and A24's upcoming David E. Kelley series for Apple Margo's Got Money Problems.


	The studio also brought in Oscar and Emmy-nominated Erin Brockovich writer Grant, whose TV series credits include Fleishman Is In Trouble and Lessons In Chemistry, as an executive producer before taking the project out.


	All in all, it took less than four months from the short story hitting the marketplace to the packaged project landing a series order, a very quick turnaround, especially by current TV industry standards.


	Baker, who has a law degree from the University of Texas, Austin, is adapting the fictional short story, which is inspired by her experience as a corporate attorney. She and Grant are executive producing the series alongside Kidman and Per Saari under their Blossom Films banner, Elle Fanning, her sister Dakota Fanning and Brittany Kahan Ward for Lewellen Pictures as well as Linden Entertainment's Jordan Cerf and Joe Hipps via his A24-based banner Cut To. Filming is slated to begin in 2026.


	Hipps' close relationship with Holland and Wiseman reportedly helped steer Discretion to Paramount+ where the project is expected to get a lot of internal support as one of the first new original series for Paramount+ 2.0.

	











	Hipps and Holland were in a similar situation a decade and a half ago when, in his role as top TV executive at MRC, Hipps played a key role in the sale of House Of Cards to Netflix over a rival offer from HBO. It was Holland's team's first original scripted series that put the then-fledgling streamer on the original programming map. Hipps also worked with Holland and Wiseman on the hit Netflix series Ozark, which he developed and produced through MRC. Grant too has an existing relationship with Holland; she created and executive produced the Netflix limited series Unbelievable during Holland's tenure there.


	Ironically, Holland went head-to-head against one of her top executives at Netflix, Peter Friedlander, who was recently appointed Head of Global TV for Amazon MGM Studios. Paramount+ and Prime Videos were believed to be the finalists in the bidding for Discretion. 


	Baker has been in-demand around Hollywood lately; she is adapting her book The Husbands for Amazon MGM and Plan B with Kristen Wiig attached to star and produce. A movie adaptation of her short story Oh. What. Fun, which she co-wrote with director Michael Showalter, is coming up on Prime Video with Michelle Pfeiffer, Felicity Jones, and Chloe Grace Moretz starring, and Baker and Showalter have another script in development at Sony3000. She is also developing a streaming adaptation of her novel Cutting Teeth.


	Kidman just wrapped Practical Magic 2, slated for release in 2026, as well as TV series Scarpetta for Prime Video and Margo's Got Money Troubles, She is headed to production on Season 3 of Taylor Sheridan's Paramount+ series Lioness. Also upcoming is a third season of Big Little Lies, which is in development at HBO, and a possible followup to Netflix's The Perfect Couple.


	Coming off A Complete Unknown, Fanning stars in Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, which took the Grand Prix at this year's Cannes Film Festival. She is filming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping and has Predator: Badlands coming up. Fanning also will be seen with her sister Dakota in The Nightingale, TriStar's feature adaptation of Kristin Hannah‘s bestseller.


Discretion joins A24's current series slate, which includes HBO's Euphoria, Netflix's Beef, Prime Video's Overcompensating and Apple's Margo's Got Money Troubles.


	Baker is repped by CAA, Writers House, Linden, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Kidman is repped by CAA, Media Talent Group, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. Fanning is repped by UTA, TFC Management, and Hansen Jacobsen. Grant is represented by UTA and Adam Berkowitz of Lenore Entertainment Group.

Quanity over quality

Kidman creating jobs and bringing a little joy into the world…seems like a good thing to me.

this pitch was paper-thin, wish Cindy had exuded stronger curation. not buckling to expensive packages

So… Damages?

Sounds expensive for a pretty unoriginal concept

Senior TV Writer


Beyond the Gates creator Michele Val Jean promised Deadline in July that a “hot male” was about to join the action in her leafy Maryland suburb. She kept her word: Greg Vaughan is joining the CBS sudser in a mystery role later this season.


	Details about his role are expected at a later date. 


	Speculation has been rampant on social media that the Days of Our Lives alum was coming to the sudser. Over the weekend, cast member Trisha Mann Grant posted a video on Instagram to celebrate star Clifton Davis' birthday.

A post shared by Trisha L. Mann-Grant (@trishamanngrant621)


	In July, Val Jean told Deadline that “I can't say who just yet, but I will say longtime soap fans all know and love him!” 

	











	Vaughan departed Days of Our Lives in 2020. He portrayed Eric Brady on the then-NBC daytime drama since 2012, and won a supporting actor Daytime Emmy for the role in 2018.


	This the second major cast addition on the CBS soap since Keith D. Robinson joined in March as a series regular. He took over the role of Dr. Ted Richardson, previously played by Maurice Johnson.


	Just last month, Beyond the Gates killed off its first big character. The role of Doug McBride, who was played byJason Graham, perished in a car crash. Graham, whose previous credits include 911, All-American Homecoming and Sisters, was part of the original cast when the CBS soap debuted in February. 


Beyond the Gates has been renewed for a second season. The sudser is up 67% in multi-platform viewership from last year's time period and beats ABC's General Hospital by 7% among women 25-54 on broadcast, according to Nielsen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Task throws a curveball in its best episode yet","https://www.avclub.com/task-recap-season-1-episode-5-vagrants","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:05:00 GMT","

One of the things that makes Task so compelling is that its world is tiny and its time frame is incredibly tight. It's been two days since Robbie and Cliff went to Ray to try to sell their drug haul and maybe four or five since they kidnapped Sam. By the start of this episode, the FBI already have a lead on Robbie and it just takes one quick, tense visit to Maeve's house for Perry to piece together the fact that Cliff and Robbie were friends. There's no hiding in this world. This is a small enough town that Robbie's brother and best friend were both murdered by the same man. 

Task isn't a show about if or even when everything is going to go wrong. It's about the few agonizing moments where our characters are trapped between the hope of a better future and the inevitability of tragedy. Yet even so, it's still shocking just how quickly the shit hits the fan in this antepenultimate installment. Halfway through this 60-minute episode, Perry has murdered Eryn, Grasso has been revealed as the Dark Hearts mole, Maeve has turned Sam over to the FBI, and Robbie has taken Tom hostage after the two almost casually cross paths at his house. 

While Task hasn't exactly been a slow burn so far, it's followed something of a familiar rhythm each week: a bunch of moody character scenes, a tense action/suspense set piece in the third act, and a denouement with some sort of cliffhanger to set up the next episode. Here, however, the show explodes that structure in a thrilling, destabilizing way. If this were all happening in a season finale, it would be exciting but expected. But with two episodes left to go, it genuinely feels like anything can happen in “Vagrants,” right up through its cliffhanger climax. 

For all those exhilarating swerves, however, what I love most about this episode is how it returns to the vibe of the premiere, which was my favorite hour of the show before this week. We open with Robbie's story about how he and Billy used to brace themselves with cold water before jumping into the freezing quarry in winter. They were worried that their hearts were going to explode and, in a way, that's what happens to Robbie this week.   

For Robbie, this season has been a brutal lesson in the sunk-cost fallacy. This whole saga began because he was obsessed with the idea of finding meaning in his brother's death. He wanted to use his sadness and anger to rob his way to a better financial future for his family. Instead, he's driven Maeve away, gotten Cliff killed, and now inadvertently contributed to Eryn's murder too. Robbie thought his impulsive idealism could build him a shiny new life. Instead, he's lost nearly everything he truly cared about.

One of the more striking motifs in this episode are the shots of families enjoying picnics by the lake. So many of our main characters are riddled with trauma and grief that it's jarring to remember this is also a world where people are living happy, normal lives. That was once the life that Robbie had, as we saw in last week's flashback to his family day out at the lake. Now, however, so many of his loved ones are dead or estranged that that world feels a million miles away.

That ties into the other big returning motif from the premiere—Tom's love of bird watching. For as on-the-nose as the metaphor is, it's heart-wrenching to hear Tom compare Robbie to a “vagrant,” a bird that's strayed so far from its normal range it's forgotten how to find its way home. Most of them don't survive, Tom explains, to which Robbie hilariously responds, “Wow, what a lovely story, thank you for sharing, Tom. I've kidnapped the world's most depressing human.” Tom is trying to tell Robbie he can go home again, although that ominous shot of a dead deer by the side of the road suggests otherwise. 

This is a really tremendous episode for both Tom Pelphrey and Mark Ruffalo, as Robbie and Tom reach two very different turning points. For one thing, it's fun to see both characters in their A-game. While it's stupid to go into Robbie's house without backup, I loved Tom's whole act about being an aging, befuddled agent looking into a cold case. (“There's the DNA and the sequencing machines and the AI…”) And after a season of bad instincts, I love that Robbie can immediately spot Tom's lie.  

Mostly, however, this episode provides an emotional turning point for both characters. For Tom, being held at gunpoint clarifies how he feels about his family. The moment he thinks he might die, all he wants is to talk to his children again—not just Emily and Sara (who get their own lovely bonding moment this week) but also Ethan. After a year of living in indecision and avoidance, Tom is finally ready to face the future. The priest in him might call that an act of divine intervention. 

For Robbie, however, this hour is about slowly realizing he has no future. While he never gives up entirely, from the moment he gazes up to see a hawk flying through the sky he seems to accept that whatever happens, this isn't going to end well for him. He still visits Freddy Frias to try to sell the drugs and he doesn't take the opportunity to turn himself in to the FBI when he could. But he also seems to accept—hell, maybe even encourage—the idea that he's going to die in this process. 

After an initial burst of tough-guy energy to take Tom hostage, Robbie mostly falls back into a state of quiet vulnerability, which really highlights what great, grounded work Pelphrey has done with the character. The car conversation about god and the afterlife emphasizes what a devastating, in some ways unfair, place Robbie has found himself in. He may be a criminal and a pretty lackluster dad/uncle, but there's a clear difference between him and Perry, who instinctively drowns Eryn in order to stop her screaming for help. 

Robbie's instincts have always been gentler. After the initial burglary went wrong, Robbie's impulse was to bring Sam home and look after him. After kidnapping Tom, he decides to drop him off in the woods rather than kill him. And as Tom is leaving, Robbie's only plea is to keep Maeve out of all the damage he's caused.

Robbie may be a fuck up, but he's a sympathetic fuck up. And Pelphrey plays that incredibly well. As the episode ends, it's unclear whether he's called for a meeting with the Dark Hearts to kill them or to let himself be killed by them. Pulling a gun on an FBI team sure feels like a “death by cop” situation. But with two episodes left, this show could take its story in any number of different directions. 

We've also still got much more to learn about how and why Grasso started working with the Dark Hearts, what Jayson will do when he finds out his surrogate dad murdered his wife, and how Freddy Frias is going to fit into all of this—not to mention everything with Tom's family, Aleah's pointedly mentioned marksmanship skills, and Lizzie's post-divorce house exorcism. Given how Mare Of Easttown unfolded, I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few more twists in store before this season is up. 

But whatever happens, I hope this isn't the last we get of Pelphrey and Ruffalo together. I thought Tom and Robbie's eventual meeting would be impactful on a plot level, but what stands out most is just how much more emotionally rich their stories feel now that they've shared them with one another. While Heat is a clear influence on Task and perhaps the most obvious reference point for Robbie and Tom's mid-season conservation, this episode even more so captures the melancholic energy of Catch Me If You Can to me. I'm not rooting for Tom and Robbie to take each other down; I'm rooting for them to somehow find a way through together. Now the question is which ending will Task emulate.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Tori Amos will take on the ""non accidental burning down of democracy"" on newly announced album","https://www.avclub.com/tori-amos-in-times-of-dragons-album-announcement","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:50:00 GMT","

Tori Amos has long spoken out about the world's injustices, and she isn't stopping any time soon. The singer-songwriter announced her 18th studio album, In Times Of Dragons, today, Pitchfork reports. The album presents “a powerful journey of resilience and awakening where the pursuit of freedom meets forces that seek to control and silence,” a press release reads. It also describes the record “a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the ‘Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.”

That's pretty heady stuff, but Amos' work isn't all terror and tyranny. Earlier this year, the artist released an illustrated children's book called Tori And The Muses, as well as a surprise soundtrack album, The Music Of Tori And The Muses, to go with it. The book is a semi-autobiographical tale about a young girl named Tori who's an incredibly talented musician (Amos was something of a child prodigy herself), but wants to make her own music instead of rehearsing for her recital. Maybe we'll see Amos play some of the nine original tracks from The Music Of Tori And The Muses on her upcoming European tour, which Consequence notes is her biggest in a decade. Pre-sale tickets for select dates will be available to fans who pre-order In Times Of Dragons before Tuesday, October 7. You can find more info here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","CBS's new workplace comedy can't find any DMV jokes you haven't heard","https://www.avclub.com/dmv-review-tv-cbs","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

There are many reasons why good sitcoms are set at work. If the workplace itself is interesting (like a busy, big-city police department or the offices of a late-night show, for example), the challenge of meeting the job's expectations provides fuel for an episode's conflicts and shenanigans. If it's is stultifying and meaningless, characters bond over and chafe under their shared ennui. The paper company of The Office is an ideal version of the latter, the ubiquitous blankness of the product acting as an apt metaphor for the unending white noise of the daily grind. 

DMV, CBS's new sitcom about the perpetually harried denizens of a rundown Hollywood motor-vehicle bureau, faces the unique challenge of finding new ways to make a joke out of a joke. The actual rituals of Americans' dreaded visits to the DMV are such a tattered and trampled punchline of both stand-up and real life that a series set in one had better have something fresh to bring to the party. 

Sadly, the show (created by Dana Klein and inspired by Katherine Heiny's short story “Chicken-Flavored And Lemon-Scented”) traffics in clichés. Old ladies run over forests of driving-test cones. Rich jerks gripe about proper (easily-googleable) Real ID documentation. The office fridge is a crime scene. Irritated customers perform would-be wacky things in line—and so on. Meanwhile, DMV‘s attempt at an Office-style knockabout ensemble piece proves blandly low-wattage, despite the ever-steadying presence of Tim Meadows as Gregg, the longest-serving and least perturbable of the show's put-upon functionaries. 

On the workplace front, the beats come in predictable lockstep, where the nondescript office is divided between the driving testers and the paper-pushers. Behind the wheel are Meadows' Gregg, buoyed by the actor's signature beaming, underplayed cynicism; Tony Cavalero's Vic, whose himbo-oddball schtick includes steering his test-takers through the McDonald's drive-thru (which they pay for); and Harriet Dyer's Colette, whose chipper optimism and fumbling awkwardness mark her out as DMV's nominal lead. Colette's infatuation with new guy on the documents window Noa (The Rings of Power's Alex Tarrant) also signals her position at the head of the ensemble, with brash photo ID jockey Ceci (Gigi Zumbado) and former SNL player Molly Kearney's newly promoted manager Barbara filling out the shift roster. 

It's not an entirely unpromising group. Alongside Meadows, Aussie actor Dyer has already proven her rom-com cred in homeland hit Colin From Accounts, while Kearney's booming presence as the gung-ho but insecure Barbara fits nicely. Cavalero appears to be channeling the Workaholics iteration of his Righteous Gemstones partner Adam Devine at points, but his weird energy offsets some of Vic's abrasiveness.

At the same time, the assembled talents are slotting into a set of types far too diffuse to make much impact. Dyer doesn't lean enough into either Colette's cmishaps or thwarted do-gooder naivete, while Kearney's turn as the blustering Barbara is no Michael Scott, saddled as she is with a running gag about her being too unworldly to recognize, say, a vibrator from the lost and found. (She also keeps referring to the state's capital as “Big Sac,” with all the attendant wordplay that entails.)  



But it's in DMV's efforts to manufacture a Jim/Pam workplace romance that the show labors the most. Dyer's character stammers her way toward the stolidly hunky Noa again and again, ultimately thwarted by wheezy sitcom plotting as much as Colette's rumpled insecurities. The pilot sees her impaled shirtless on a nail while attempting to escape through the communal bathroom window, while another episode forces her to grade calamitous neophyte driver Noa's road test. (She's dubbed “E-Z Pass” by co-workers for never failing anybody.) That surfer-dude Noa is either clever and competent or dim-bulb clueless according to the needs of each of the first four episodes is a genuine worry. As is, Tarrant and Dyer's lukewarm chemistry as they weave toward an inevitable future pairing bumps against manufactured obstacles aplenty without either character being engaging enough to care all that much about.   

The same goes for the running of this particular branch. The pilot brings in a lightly kooky pair of government inspectors, whose revelation to the panicked Barbara that theirs is one of four area DMVs being evaluated for potential closure. That should set off a ticking clock but for the fact that the next three episodes abandon the thread entirely in favor of watching Colette try to fool a judgmental visiting actor friend that she's really a veterinarian.  

This is a resolutely unambitious portrait of lowest-rung bureaucrats lightly peppered with tonally indifferent stabs at character development and overarching purpose. Kearney's Barbara makes an effortful case in the pilot that the DMV's mandatory democratic drudgery despite “what you look like or how much money you make or if you went to college” is somehow meaningful. Meanwhile, the workers' perennial gripes about their roles in “the most despised institution in America” (there's a lot of competition there) give way to the occasional flash of hazy, half-realized idealism. (Meadows' Gregg is much more convincing as he shepherds new hire Noa through hard-won DMV rewards like pantomiming his non-existent cigarette during smoke breaks or “going number zero” to goof off in the bathroom.) 

As with most work-related premises, there's undoubtedly a good sitcom lurking at the DMV. Coupled with the ordinary drudgery of the average office, the added theme of governmental hoop-jumping, and burdensome red tape and expense offers unique layers of employee and customer exasperation to play with. But the glimmers of invention (the driving testers keep track of the number of days since they were almost killed on a whiteboard) are so meager here that this DMV feels as perfunctory and forgettable as re-registering your car.

John Oliver praised Super Bowl organizers for their bravery last night. “The NFL ‘controversially' gave the Super Bowl Halftime Show to one of the hottest, most commercially successful people alive,” he quipped of the announcement that Bad Bunny would star, per Variety. While Oliver is right that any kerfuffle around this selection is pretty ridiculous, there has been a controversy nonetheless. Previously, Bad Bunny decided that he would not be performing anywhere in the 50 states, partly out of concern that “fucking ICE could be outside [my concert],” as he told i-D magazine last month.

The administration responded, as is its wont, by immediately announcing that ICE agents would be present at the game. Agents will be “all over” the event, as secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem said on The Benny Show podcast this past Friday (via The New York Times). People should not attend the game, she continued, unless they are “law-abiding Americans who love this country.”

Bad Bunny seems to be taking all of this backlash in stride. “I'm doing the Super Bowl halftime show. I'm very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News,” he quipped during his Saturday Night Live monologue last night, before rolling a montage of clips spliced together to make it sound like those hosts thought he should be “the next president.” After thanking his fans in Spanish, he added, “And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”

On his show, Oliver also played a montage of Fox news hosts reacting to Bad Bunny's selection, with one broadcaster asserting that the Puerto Rican artist isn't American, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. After transitioning to a segment of continued ICE raids, Oliver got serious. “But as grim as all of this has been, the one glimmer of hope has been the strength of the pushback from local communities around the country,” he said, concluding that the Trump administration cannot “cover up the ugliness of what they are doing right now, and it deserves to be pushed back on and exposed at every available opportunity.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","There's only one movie you need to understand The Smashing Machine's Mark Kerr","https://www.avclub.com/the-smashing-machine-the-life-and-times-of-extreme-fighter-mark-kerr-john-hyams-documentary","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The Smashing Machine will be most people's introduction to Mark Kerr, the soft-spoken mixed martial artist who was brawling back when the Ultimate Fighting Championship wasn't yet a toxic cultural juggernaut, just lurid pay-per-view “human cockfighting,” in the words of John McCain. But the film that Benny Safdie and his star Dwayne Johnson have effectively remade—often shot for shot—is better in every way than the dramatized biopic born from its bruises.

John Hyams' 2002 HBO documentary The Smashing Machine: The Life And Times Of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr lets its subject's aw-shucks personality and the wet, meaty thwack of knee strikes and hammer fists speak for themselves. This lends subtlety to a fall-and-rise arc that could otherwise knock you in the face with its grimdark spin on a pro wrestling narrative. Ambition and acceptance, violence and tenderness, life-affirming pain and the life-threatening drugs that assuage it—these archetypal dualities all reveal themselves naturally during the fly-on-the-wall, backseat observations of a normal man's abnormal job. Kerr's soft voice, little-kid smile, and gentle patience (even when, in simplified English, he's arguing over money with the Japanese middlemen of the Pride Fighting Championships) breezily define The Life And Times‘ contrast between person and profession.

Like Kerr tells an older lady in a doctor's waiting room, he doesn't hate his opponents. Not at all. The idea is almost laughable to him. It's just a job, and they're just his coworkers. It's one of countless moments meticulously reconstructed in The Smashing Machine, replicating the words without the spirit (a little like the clunkier moments of The Room biopic The Disaster Artist). When Kerr has this conversation, it sounds like he's had it a million times, with his parents, with folks in the checkout line, with people on the bus. A familiar refrain trotted out at cocktail parties. The Rock can't help but sound coached, like he's talking down to someone on a red carpet, even when repeating the footage verbatim.

That's one side of Mark Kerr, one side of The Smashing Machine. Then, when the shirts come off and the lights go up, Hyams captures the combat with a similar inimitable clarity. Just as The Life And Times hovers in the corners of Kerr's suburban Southwest life—the perfect vantage to see all the ugly and strange little details poking out of the Americana, like hypodermic needles out of a black Hefty bag—Hyams keeps his camera unflinchingly locked on the thudding collisions between elbows and ribs, knees and skulls, fists and livers. Safdie's film is enamored of the spectacle, of the life-defining gulf between winning and losing. His fights cut away to crowd reactions, overwhelmed by the lights and music. Hyams stares blankly at the bloody damage, scored mainly by the dull sounds of human meat being tenderized.

This could be linked to the movies' respective relationships to the MMA of their eras. Hyams made his film when the sport was still on the relative fringes, its brutality banned across the U.S. and its reputation, as the woman in the doctor's office reminds us, still obscene. The Smashing Machine is set in this era, but was filmed with the knowledge that the sport would rise again, boosted to respectability by an increasingly toxic TV environment (Spike TV was UFC's savior) and the always alluring promise of cash. Colored by this future, The Smashing Machine broadens its approach to the wider audience MMA now commands. Hyams' documentary was entrenched in the grungy, strange, relatively underground indignities of Kerr's career—it simply didn't know any other way to be.

This difference is captured, unassumingly, by a small deviation The Smashing Machine makes from The Life And Times. At the end of The Smashing Machine, when a fight is inter-cut with Kerr getting his chin stitched up in a side room, the doctor attending to him is American, chatting with him nonchalantly in English. In reality, because this tournament was held in Japan, the doctors sewing him up were Japanese, and were speaking to each other in a language Kerr couldn't understand. The latter scene, the real scene, doesn't just juxtapose a competition Kerr has been knocked out of with the toll taken on his body. It spotlights a man who, when outside the ring, is alone and isolated, lost among people who know what to do with his body, but not with him.

These silent insights are also found in what the documentary doesn't show of Kerr's relationships. We get to fill in the intense gaps left by the film—whether they're between Kerr and his girlfriend Dawn, or Kerr and his trainer, or Kerr and his superstitiously sexist colleagues, or Kerr and his college pals who help stage his opioid intervention—while Safdie spells it all out through obvious melodrama. It's another concession to a wider prospective audience that Hyams never conceived of pandering to. It's the small yet potent difference between a fascinating reality and an alienating fiction.

This would not be the last time John Hyams mined melancholy from the edges of action. Son of Peter Hyams (Timecop, Sudden Death), Hyams would make a few more documentaries after Smashing Machine, then take up the family tradition of directing Jean-Claude Van Damme. His final entries in the Universal Soldier franchise turned its super-soldier fantasy into a nightmare of eternal war. Finding the tragedy in the broken-down physiques of bodies built for violence became something of a specialty for Hyams. The hardships endured by Van Damme and Scott Adkins grew naturally from those endured by Mark Kerr. Even as the conflicts in his films escalated, Hyams knew that the vulnerable men at the center, the men who hated that they loved the constant fight, were the real draw.

What could be better than a personalized wedding venue? This is something that HGTV's “Property Brothers” star Drew Scott has discussed creating for his brother, Jonathan Scott, and his fiancée, actress Zooey Deschanel.

A post shared by Jonathan Silver Scott (@jonathanscott)

The couple announced their engagement in August 2023, but they are not in a rush to get married. Their decision to take their time prompted Drew to joke about building their venue for them, but it's a great idea!

“I will offer to build a venue, right?” Drew told People in an interview published on October 6. “I'm going to harass him. You know what? I will tell him that you told me. It's not me pushing, but I was told… People were saying that you need to get this done.”

Drew also gave reassurance to anyone wondering why the couple is taking so long to walk down the aisle, sharing that they are very much in love. “And again, they love each other. They're amazing together. I'm like, ‘You guys, it'll happen when it happens.' And for now, they just love the time together with the kids,” he said. Jonathan and Deschanel have a beautiful blended family as he steps into the role of stepdad to her two children, daughter Elsie, 10, and son Charlie, 8, from her previous marriage to Jacob Pechenik.

A post shared by Zooey Deschanel (@zooeydeschanel)

The couple may not have made much progress in terms of wedding planning, at least, not what they have shared publicly, but they do occasionally give fans a glimpse into their relationship. In an Instagram post on October 2, Deschanel posted a video informing fans of what they can find them doing on “date night.” 

Among the things that you can find them doing is talking about their cats a lot, having a little dance, and discussing leaving events early. It's a hilarious and relatable video, and fans have shared their thoughts in the comment section. 

“The cats talking is real haha,” a fan wrote. “‘Talking about our cats' deserved first billing with you guys,” another fan shared. 

“You better walk that man down aisle,” a third person shared. Other reactions include, “You both found your soulmate! It's great to see. The world needs more love,” and “What a Beautiful, Inspiring couple.” 

Fans adore Scott and Deschanel as a couple, and when they finally get married, it's going to attract a lot of attention because fans feel invested in this relationship at this point.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Britney Spears Injured After Falling Down the Stairs & Shares the News to Supportive Fans","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/britney-spears-leg-injury-update-video/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 03:01:05 GMT","

Britney Spears sparked concern among fans after revealing a painful leg injury in her latest Instagram video, just days after spending time with her sons, Sean, 20, and Jayden, 19. In the clip, the 43-year-old pop icon danced inside her home wearing a sparkling pink mini dress, accessorized with fingerless gloves and black heels. A white bandage wrapped around her right knee was clearly visible as she moved carefully to the music before briefly sitting at her piano to play a few notes.

“I fell down the stairs, and my leg snaps out now and then,” Spears explained in her caption, adding that she's “not sure if it's broken.”

A post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)

Fans quickly flooded the comments with messages of concern. “Hope she's getting good care and rest,” one user wrote on X, while another added, “Oh no, that sounds painful!”

The “Toxic” singer's post quickly went viral as fans voiced their concern for her well-being. Spears' followers have long monitored her social media activity for signs of distress following the end of her 13-year conservatorship in 2021.

A post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)

Later in the day, she shared another video in two new looks — one featuring a plunging cheetah-print swimsuit and another in a glittering gold crop top and shorts. In one clip, her knee bandage was still visible. “As Madonna says, express yourself, don't repress yourself,” she captioned the post.

The video comes shortly after Spears spent time with her sons for the first time in nearly two years. She shares Sean and Jayden with ex-husband Kevin Federline, who now lives in Hawaii.

In June, Spears posted a video celebrating Jayden's new Mercedes AMG SL 63, valued at $187,000. “He's 6'3″ and his hands are so big now! How long am I going to be in shock?” she wrote. “I'm blessed. Just please be careful with my heart too!”

Sources told the Daily Mail that those close to Spears are “wary” that Jayden's new music interests could lead to family tension, fearing he may use her fame and connections for career gain.

Amid ongoing personal struggles, Britney Spears is reportedly facing new professional hurdles. Sources claim that production on her long-awaited biopic — inspired by her 2023 memoir “The Woman in Me” — has stalled, with insiders citing concerns over the singer's “erratic” behavior, leaving Hollywood producers frustrated.

Still, fans remain steadfast in their support. “She's been through so much. I just hope she finds peace,” one person commented under her latest post, echoing the sentiment of many.

Despite recent challenges, Spears' devoted fan base continues to rally behind her, hoping she finds stability, healing, and the creative freedom she has fought for since the end of her conservatorship.

The news of Tina Turner and Ike Turner's son, Ike Turner Jr., was announced on Sunday, October 5. He was 67. 

Before Turner Jr.'s passing, his cousin Jacqueline Bullock revealed he had been suffering from health issues. “Ike Jr. died Saturday at a Los Angeles hospital from kidney failure,” Bullock told TMZ. The publication reports that Turner Jr. had “battled severe heart issues for years” and had “recently suffered a stroke in early September.” In another, lengthier statement, Bullock also revealed what it was like to grow up as the son of the “What's Love Got to Do with It” singer and Turner Sr. 

“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of my cousin, Ike Turner, Jr.,” Bullock told the New York Post. “‘Junior' was more than a cousin to me, but rather a brother, as we grew up in the same famed household together.”

Bullock's statement reveals what it was like growing up in Tina's household. She said, “As the son of Tina and Ike Turner, from an early age, his talents were evident as there wasn't an instrument he did not want to play. While he favored the drums early on, my aunt and his mother, Tina Turner, insisted that he break down his drum kit after each practice. This led him to favor the keys. Eventually, Junior would end up helping to run Bolic Sound Studios, the recording studios founded by his father, Ike Turner.” Tina adopted Turner Jr., but his biological parents are Lorraine Taylor and Turner Sr. 

Bullock praised her cousin for his talents as a musician, sound engineer, and even a Grammy winner, having worked on his father, Turner Sr.'s, album, “Risin' With The Blues.” She also requested privacy for the family during this difficult time. 

A post shared by Afida Turner (@afida_turner)

Social media has been filled with loving tributes for Turner Jr., including one from his brother Ronnie Turner's widow, Afida Turner. In an Instagram post on Sunday, October 5, Afida called Turner Jr. an “amazing brother-in-law,” and revealed how she had a phone call with him before his passing.

Afida's short but loving post has received support, with fans sharing their condolences and praising her beautiful tribute.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Emily Simpson Bravely Opens Up About Son's Learning Disability","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/emily-simpson-son-learning-disability/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 00:16:33 GMT","

Emily Simpson is opening her heart to fans as she navigates her son's recent learning challenges.

In the latest episode of “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” which aired Oct. 2, Simpson revealed that her 10-year-old son, Luke, had been diagnosed with dyslexia. 

A post shared by Parents (@parents)

In the candid scene, the reality star shared the news with raw honesty, expressing her self-doubt and concern as a parent.

“Like, are these things I should have noticed before?” she asked. “Were there all these red flags? Did I bring him [to the doctor] too late? He's highly intelligent in certain areas, but he's in the fourth grade, and I didn't know he couldn't read? I mean, how sad is that?”

Luke's diagnosis came alongside other challenges, including avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Despite the hurdles, Simpson's openness struck a chord with viewers, many of whom praised her vulnerability and her dedication as a mother.

A post shared by Emily Moore Simpson (@rhoc_emilysimpson)

The day after the episode aired, Simpson took to Instagram to clarify her comments and share an encouraging update. She posted a video of Luke working on his own comic book, showing fans how creative and resilient he is.

“Just to clarify: Luke can read, he's just not reading at his grade level and he's struggling with word comprehension etc,” she wrote in the caption. “He was also recently diagnosed as dyslexic. I was not aware that he was struggling and behind.”

Simpson went on to share that Luke has since transferred to a new school and is thriving. “He's loving it,” she added. “Please be kind. Just remember I am learning and dealing with all of these issues in real time while filming!”

Fans filled the comments with words of encouragement, including “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” star Angie Katsanevas who wrote, “You are a great mom Emily. He is darling.”

A post shared by Emily Moore Simpson (@rhoc_emilysimpson)

Throughout Season 19, viewers have also seen how Luke's health and learning journey have tested Simpson's marriage to husband Shane. The couple admitted to having different parenting styles when it comes to supporting their son.

“I think my approach is a little bit more try to make it like it's normal for Luke and it's nothing that stands out or makes him lesser than or feel inferior,” Shane said in a confessional. “But Emily just wants to flip a switch and fix it. And I know it doesn't work that way.”

Despite moments of tension, the Bravo star shared in the same episode that Shane has made significant strides in his parenting. “You being so much more engaged with him and being more affectionate — just more warm with him — has made a big difference,” she told her husband of 16 years.

Shane responded that his shift was “not physical, as much as it was validating and praising [Luke] and making him feel good.”

The update left fans inspired by the couple's teamwork and the family's resilience. As Simpson continues to balance motherhood, filming, and advocacy, she's showing that even the most difficult parenting moments can lead to growth — both for children and their parents.

It's aliiiiive, and it just screened at Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque! On Sunday night, Guillermo del Toro‘s “Frankenstein” had a surprise showing at the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles. Following a marathon screening of his earlier works (“Cronos,” “The Devil's Backbone,” and “Mimic”), the beloved Mexican filmmaker invited stars Mia Goth and Jacob Elordi to help introduce their new movie to a ravenous genre audience.

“They were ecstatic,” said Beyond Fest co-founder Christian Parkes in an interview with IndieWire on Monday. Previously shown at the Venice International Film Festival (where IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio gave it a “B,” and again at a secret screening at Telluride), “Frankenstein” is expected in limited theaters on October 17 and will hit Netflix on November 7.

“We didn't know that was happening, really happening, until that afternoon,”  said Parkes. “The projectionists didn't even know.”

“Guillermo making a move the night before and saying, ‘Hey, I want to show my film!' — that is all him,” said co-founder Grant Moninger. “But he's part of the People's Republic of Beyond Fest by doing that.”

 










“Frankenstein” is among the most anticipated horror releases left in 2025, but Beyond Fest organizers didn't even ask to screen the film. Del Toro offered the West Coast premiere to them the day before during a different block of his retrospective series (“Crimson Peak,” “Nightmare Alley,” and “The Shape of Water” also played the Egyptian), and thanks to the American Cinematheque, they pulled it off.

“He just nonchalantly threw it out to the crowd,” said Parkes. “He was like, ‘Let's just show the movie tomorrow!' And then it was like, ‘Oh, yeah, that's kind of nuts!' You have to ingest the film and make sure it works. It wasn't really until six o'clock — doors were at seven — that we did the tech check and we were like, ‘OK, this can actually happen.'” 

Beyond Fest has been around since 2011, but this year's edition marks unprecedented success for the most popular genre event in Los Angeles. With just two days left, organizers are projecting record attendance with approximately 30,000 festivalgoers coming from across the city and around the world. After a difficult year for Californians, it was an electric homecoming for weirdo cinephiles — and a needed outlet for plenty of local film lovers who, as always, got to see many screenings for free.

 










“It's been gradual growth,” said programmer Evrim Ersoy, who has been with the fest since year two but sat out this year to manage social media from his home in London. “Slowly but surely, we're building the people's trust, and these filmmakers are coming to us,” he said.

Exclusivity can be key to making a movie or event seem “cool,” and the sudden activation of “Frankenstein” was an electric highlight this weekend. But while other genre promoters jockey for access, Beyond Fest insists they don't worry about premiere status. The “pipe dream” event got started on a fake-it-til-you-make-it mentality 14 years ago, and organizers have kept the faith ever since. 

“It's like, who cares? We'll have studios that come to us and say, ‘Look, we're going to go big with you in L.A., but we have opportunities elsewhere,'” said Parkes. “My response is always, ‘Is going elsewhere going to help your film? Then go do it!' Because the people that come to our theater on a Friday night, they want to see the film. They're not coming because it has to be the premiere.”

Beyond Fest is dedicated to expanding how the movie business defines “genre” in a city that, no matter how the rest of the industry fares, still owns awards season. Del Toro's “Frankenstein” has been compared to Robert Eggers' “Nosferatu,” and early spectators for next year's Oscars race could see this premiere as a step on that path.

 










Straddling the divide between fan-facing genre events, like Fantasia Fest in Montreal, and the more prestige international festivals that are always along the path to the Academy Awards, Beyond is bridging a critical divide by commingling the best of the best genre programming — across horror, arthouse, anime, and more — with the fervent excitement of attendees who celebrate it all like a midnight movie.

“We've never paid to advertise,” said Moninger. “There's such a love of these films, and it's a rabid audience. That's why it grows to 16 days every year. It's like, ‘Maybe we'll do nine!' — or, ‘Maybe we'll do eight!' And it always ends up being 16. We want to make sure everyone can go see something.”

From the first 70mm print of Brady Corbet's “The Brutalist,” to the West Coast premiere of Bong Joon Ho's “Parasite,” Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque programming has organically turned into an “overarching umbrella, where all of these films can live through their connective genre tissue,” said Parkes. “Time and time again, filmmakers after their screening, they thank us and they say, ‘That's exactly who I made my film for.'”

“We've had a second screen for a long time,” said Ersoy — shouting out Beyond Fest at American Cinemtheque's shorts programming as well. “It's always been about highlighting films that people wouldn't normally take a chance on. Everyone's heard del Toro's ‘Frankenstein' is coming, but maybe this helped them find something else. We showed this anime that's coming along, ‘100 Meters,' that's absolutely stunning.”

 










Beyond boasted the West Coast premiere of Best Picture winner “Anora” last year, and Sean Baker was back to host a chat with the legendary Japanese actress Meiko Kaji (“Lady Snowblood,” “Blind Woman's Curse”) for her first-ever U.S. appearance in 2025. With the reigning Best Director winner practically popping in just to say hi — and del Toro across town literally tossing out “Frankenstein” t-shirts — Beyond Fest at American Cinematheque has established itself as an award-worthy monster maker capable of winning the fight too many genre lovers feared was finished when “The Substance” lost.

“I look forward to the day when someone else can take this mantle so that we can sleep,” said Parkes. “Until then, we'll just keep doing it.”

The evolution of artificial intelligence is moving so quickly, even OpenAI‘s policies are already out of date.

Last week, along with the launch of OpenAI's latest hyper-realistic AI video model, Sora 2, the Wall Street Journal reported that the tech company intended to require copyright holders to opt-out if they don't want their creations to appear in the Sora app. The lawyers we spoke to compared it to a burglar saying he had the right to steal everything in your house because you haven't explicitly told him to stop. 

We've long suspected that AI companies were training their models on copyrighted material, with some cut and dry lawsuits that Hollywood studios are battling aggressively, and it suddenly felt like OpenAI was now just daring everyone to get them to stop.

“They've essentially admitted that there's at least a live issue here as to whether creators or owners of copyrights will be able to enforce their rights,” Ray Seilie, an attorney with KHIKS told IndieWire. “They're saying if you own a copyright and you don't want that copyright to be used in our training data, you have to tell us. And by implication, you're saying they have some rights here. We need some level of permission. But then they don't go all the way and ask for a license. You tell us if you're going to go after us. And that's just not the way that any kind of right works.”

 










“It's the equivalent of a begging for forgiveness type of thing. Because I think we all know it has been happening,” added Simon Pulman, an attorney with Pryor Cashman. “What they are effectively saying is as a position, ‘The second you create it, we have the right to use it, unless you affirmatively opt out.'”

That begging for forgiveness came quick on Saturday when, after the Internet was flooded with people using Sora 2 to create custom “South Park” episodes, Pikachu in “Saving Private Ryan,” or police dashcam footage of “Mario Kart,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said it was changing its tune.

My favorite new trend in the Sora app is putting Pikachu in every movie.This is “Saving Private Pikachu” 👇 pic.twitter.com/pV8JYUb9SZ

“We are hearing from a lot of rights holders who are very excited for this new kind of ‘interactive fan fiction' and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all),” Altman wrote in a blog. “We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rights holders decide how to proceed.” 

Altman explained that, rather than an opt-out, the generation of existing characters would instead have rights holders opt-in. It's the same way OpenAI intends to police “likeness,” which the company is treating separately from “copyright.” One of Sora 2's gobsmacking new features is letting people “Cameo” in your AI-generated videos. If you so choose, you can put yourself into an AI video with Sora 2, and your friends can do the same, but you can revoke someone else's privileges to your likeness or to a specific video they're making at any time.

 










We read that as, if Nintendo is cool with people using AI to see Mario speeding away from cops like he's OJ Simpson, then more power to them. We just don't envy the person at Nintendo who has to comb through every video created and determine which ones Nintendo is cool with and which ones it's not.

The trouble with this: OpenAI hasn't brokered a deal with a studio to grant them full permission to do whatever they want, like in the way Runway did with Lionsgate to generate AI models based on their films. When that news broke, we wrote that there's a distant future where Lionsgate and Runway charge people if they want to use AI to put themselves into “John Wick 5” or create their own fan-fic endings. OpenAI has just gone and done it, and your guess as to how any of this will be monetized is as good as ours.

“That's how you would have companies typically act in situations where you need to get permission from a copyright holder,” Seilie said. “This is a strange middle ground where [OpenAI] is saying, well, we acknowledge that you have some rights here, because why else are we asking for your opt-out? But we also don't think we really have to respect your rights unless you opt out.”

Pulman said it's the latest example of a tech company working to get ahead of the law by first trying to normalize and make ubiquitous the thing it's doing. He explains that, if OpenAI can muddy the waters with an enormous amount of people using the Sora app, flood social media with AI slop, and make the process of combatting it so complex and difficult to navigate, the court of public opinion will eventually work out in its favor.

 










After OpenAI along with Google recently lobbied the Trump administration to consider all AI training data “fair use,” it's betting this administration has sympathetic ears to help on legal grounds as well.

But an important distinction that also remains murky is input versus output. Copyright holders may now say they don't want their characters appearing in the Sora 2 app, but it's not clear whether that also precludes that material from being ingested in training data for the Sora model. Sora may bar users from generating Darth Vader, but it doesn't necessarily mean it didn't learn from Darth Vader to create everything else. That means that even if one were to successfully opt out, it could be near impossible to verify whether OpenAI has actually complied.

Sora 2 just produced a mini episode of South Park for me pic.twitter.com/fHWqDxfGSo

“You don't, it's a ruse,” said Bryn Mooser, CEO of the AI film studio Asteria. Studios, he believes, shouldn't be asking OpenAI whether Sora 2 can generate their copyright but should ask, was it trained on it? “Just because you can filter it does not mean that it's not in that data set,” he said.

Mooser said it's not hard to imagine a near future where AI-generated likenesses of actors are used to sell junk, and that the 10-second clips that can put your friends' faces into the videos are all about creating content for social media. 

 










This is not the utopian vision of creating an AI model that can cure cancer or democratizing the filmmaking process so that anyone can make their own “Avatar.” And after playing around with everything Sora 2 can do, he said what it can create is “pretty shocking to see how brazen” it is with copyright.

“The release of it is an admission that OpenAI is not interested in Hollywood,” Mooser said. “It's not going to be all the breathless articles that were written about when Sora 1 came out: Hollywood is over. Hollywood's cooked. When Sora 2 comes out it's, ‘We don't care about Hollywood. We don't care about copyright or about artists concerns about being replaced by making viral slop. And we don't care about the needs of Hollywood when it comes to having AI tools that are actually powerful enough to be used for making film and television.' It's a real sign that's not where their interest is, despite probably having a bunch of meetings a year ago to the contrary.”

Asteria, which is the AI company co-founded by Natasha Lyonne and the home of her directorial debut that aims to incorporate AI into the filmmaking process, has designed its AI model such that everything it's trained on is designed by the filmmakers and artists working on the project or licensed directly from other creators. And while using AI in any capacity is already toxic enough in Hollywood without OpenAI's help, Mooser feels making generative AI videos synonymous with viral memes is going to make things even harder for the indie filmmakers who dream of using AI ethically.

 










“Is the industry going to stand in this moment and try to figure out how to build this thing in the right way? Or does the pressure of the new technology just wash over and everybody gives up the fight,” Mooser asked. “We've all been at these points before where technology is going to disrupt how we make things, and I think that the industry has done a good job up until now of ‘we set our standards with the guilds or with our norms.' We don't wait for court cases in Washington D.C. to decide this stuff. But I do think that we're at that crossroads … the rights holders and guilds need to be paying attention, because you can lose that fight if you're not paying attention.”

It can't be overstated how big of a shock to the system Taylor Swift‘s “The Eras Tour” concert film release was back in 2023. The movie was announced just weeks before its release, it set a precedent for a major artist essentially circumventing studio distributors and going directly to theaters, and it disrupted the release calendar so much that we still haven't heard the end of it from rival distributors who got burned and pushed to the sidelines. The film's $261 million worldwide box office was a much needed salve for what would've been a down year in theaters. 

 










Announced again just weeks in advance, Swift's latest surprise theatrical release, a visual album companion for her twelfth album “The Life of a Showgirl,” again topped the box office with an estimated $50 million worldwide. It's less than half of what “Eras Tour” opened to even domestically back in 2023. But there are reasons why “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” was never going to match or beat “The Eras Tour,” and it's an impressive — if not box office shattering — result all the same.

Where “Eras Tour” was a legit concert film documenting what has now become the biggest global tour of all time, “Showgirl” was an album film for songs literally no one had heard yet. That inherently meant the audience for the film was going to be reserved largely for super-fans, many of whom bought tickets in advance and front-loaded the box office. $15.8 million of its total haul came on Friday alone. That it brought in only $34 million domestic  (plus $16 million internationally), speaks to how many Swifties needed to see it as soon as possible on Friday night and then didn't go on Saturday or Sunday. Those ravenous fans still gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore, naturally, which is certainly kinder than some music critics were to the album itself.

Some other factors: “Showgirl” was a one-and-done, single weekend event and won't be held over the way “Eras Tour” hung around in theaters for a few weeks. “Showgirl” was roughly 90 minutes long compared to the three-hour running time of “Eras Tour,” which would've allowed for a few more showtimes, but also didn't have Thursday night previews (the album released at midnight last Friday morning). And perhaps most notably, “Eras Tour” had a premium price tag of $19.89 (we'll call it $20) whereas “Showgirl” was a more traditionally priced movie at an average of $12 a ticket nationwide. Given all that, “Showgirl” has still already surpassed what Beyonce's “Renaissance” concert film, also released in 2023 direct to theaters by AMC, did at the box office with $44 million globally.

 










All of this still had an impact on the box office as a whole. “Showgirl” likely snagged a few premium screens away from Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which managed only $11.1 million domestic in its second weekend and dipped 49 percent from its first weekend, though it did manage to cross $100 million at the global box office. “The Smashing Machine” with Dwayne Johnson also likely took a bit of it on the chin because of Swift's presence, as the film opened to just $6 million domestic. 

Most crucially, the box office for the year is still 4 percent ahead of the pace of 2024 at this same time in the calendar year. We've written about how a few titles have vacated 2025 and put the box office in a precarious spot. But seeing even a more niche Taylor Swift release reach No. 1 is a sign that AMC and other distributors aren't done with these event film experiments.

Love, madness, love, and more madness.

Jennifer Lawrence is here with one of the boldest performances of the year in “Die My Love,” directed by Lynne Ramsay. The Oscar-winning actress stars as Grace, a mother living in Montana who begins to show signs of postpartum psychosis, her mental distress unraveling her relationship with Jackson (Robert Pattinson). Written by Ramsay with Enda Walsh and Alice Birch, the 2025 Cannes Film Festival premiere finally hits theaters November 7 courtesy of Mubi. Watch the trailer below.

LaKeith Stanfield co-stars in the film as an alluring stranger who attracts Grace, while Nick Nolte and Sissy Spacek play Pattinson's parents. The official synopsis for the film is slightly more hope-tinged than what you get from seeing the movie, which resembles something between a dark comedy and a psychological horror film: “A hopeful young and loving couple (Grace and Jackson) move from New York to an inherited house in the country. Grace tries to find her Identity with a new baby in the isolated environment. Yet as she begins to unravel, it's not in weakness but imagination, strength and a stunning untamed vivacity that she discovers herself anew.”

“Die My Love” has curiously not been at the fall festivals this season, coming into theatrical play and eventual Mubi streaming straight from Cannes instead. There was chatter that recuts were happening post-Cannes, but the unchanged running time suggests those edits are imperceptible.

 










More on the film from our review: “‘Die My Love' is a two-hour cinematic miasma of what it's like to be in postpartum depression hell and possessed by a sexual appetite that could never possibly be quenched by even someone as hot as Robert Pattinson. As such, it will be a tough sell for even Lawrence's most ardent fans. The story offers little to hook us onto other than Grace's constant flailing through psychosis, visually realized by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey with the feeling of a bad dream you wake up from in a heated, unforgiving sweat. The atmosphere of this fugue-state-turned-panic-attack of a film is never not intoxicating. As Grace spins out in a hothouse countryside beset by ever-buzzing flies — inescapable swelter and tall grass abound — you can all but feel the ticks and Lyme disease consuming you.”

Toxic, Chappell Roan-belting girlboss… or alien among us sent to annihilate all of living Earth? In Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” his latest film and fourth feature with Emma Stone, you decide. A new trailer offers a fresh glimpse at the movie, coming to theaters in time for Halloween.

In “Bugonia,” Jesse Plemons plays a conspiracy-addled beekeeper who kidnaps a high-powered big pharma CEO (that's Stone), convinced that she is an extraterrestrial intent on destroying the planet. He also ropes fellow and more impressionable conspiracist Don (Aidan Delbis) into the hijack. 

 










Will Tracy (“The Menu”) adapts the script as a remake of the 2004 Korean sci-fi film “Save the Green Planet!,” directed by Jang Joon-hwan. Lanthimos' tenth movie first premiered in competition at the Venice Film Festival, with Focus Features releasing the movie after his collaborations with Searchlight Pictures.

More on the film from IndieWire's review: “Imagine if Michael Haneke's ‘Funny Games' were instead about a pair of lone-wolf, conservationist vigilantes trying to save the world instead of two sociopathic twinks wanting to tear it down, and you'll have some idea of the hyper-contained, rigorously controlled torture chamber that is Yorgos Lanthimos' ‘Bugonia.' … Lanthimos works from an on-the-nose-for-the-now feature screenplay by ‘Succession' and ‘The Menu' writer Will Tracy, diverting from the droll theater of cruelty present in scripts by Efthimis Filippou (‘Kinds of Kindness') or the florid repartee of Tony McNamara (‘The Favourite,' ‘Poor Things'). ‘Bugonia‘ has all the streak of Tracy's kill-the-rich brand of satire, but with the Greek Oscar-nominated filmmaker interrogating the potential performativity of such capitalist-fighting crusades.

 










Also, read Anne Thompson's interview with Jesse Plemons out of Telluride here.

“Bugonia” is Lanthimos' buzziest film since “Poor Things” won Emma Stone the Best Actress Oscar; “Kinds of Kindness” was a creative detour from that film's grandiosity that performed unimpressively at the box office. The sci-fi and comedy elements plus Emma Stone back in the lead should set up “Bugonia” up for success this October.

Focus Features will release “Bugonia” opens in select theaters on Friday, October 24 before expanding everywhere on Friday, October 31. Check out the new trailer below.

Tori Amos has announced a new album, In Times of Dragons. The follow-up to 2021's Ocean to Ocean is due out in spring 2026, via Universal's recently relaunched Fontana label. The singer-songwriter has also announced a huge European tour. Check out the dates below.

Amos said in a press release, “In Times of Dragons is a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the ‘Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.”

Early this year, Amos released a soundtrack to the children's book Tori and the Muses.

Lorde is among the latest wave of artists joining the No Music for Genocide campaign, which urges musicians to geo-block their music in Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Caribou, Hayley Williams, Dry Cleaning, Marina, Caroline, Diiv, Duval Timothy, Idles, Muna, Paloma Faith, Obongjayar, Marc Rebillet, Tokimonsta, 454, Pinegrove, and Skee Mask have also removed or pledged to remove their music from streaming services in the country. Hyperdub is the latest label to pull its catalog, joining Bayonet, 10k, Pan, and more.

Back in 2017, Lorde announced—and swiftly canceled—a concert in Tel Aviv, after proponents of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, including the authors of an article in New Zealand publication The Spinoff, criticized her decision to play in Israel. Lorde wrote at the time, “i pride myself on being an informed young citizen, and i have done a lot of reading and sought a lot of opinions before deciding to book a show in tel aviv, but i'm not proud to admit i didn't make the right call on this one.” An Israeli court ordered the authors of the article in The Spinoff to pay damage to fans who claimed the cancellation caused them “moral and emotional injury.” The article authors said the ruling was designed “to intimidate Israel's critics” and added that, rather than paying the court-ordered fine, they would raise funds for a mental health organization in Gaza.

Today's new additions to the No Music for Genocide streaming embargo join the likes of Massive Attack, Björk, MJ Lenderman, and dozens more who have backed the organizers' stated protest against “Israel's genocide in Gaza; ethnic cleansing of the Occupied West Bank; apartheid within Israel,” and the suppression of pro-Palestine activism.

Massive Attack have also joined a separate but parallel drive to pull music from Spotify altogether; proponents of that movement primarily cite founder Daniel Ek's investment in weapons contractor Helsing, which is not linked to Israel. Music businesses' links to the military industrial complex are also listed as a target of the No Music for Genocide movement, for which more than 1,000 artists and labels have signed up, according to organizers.

There's a 1976 Eve Babitz essay about a magazine reporter who noses into a scoop while watching Elizabeth Taylor eat room-service caviar with onion, right in front of the used car salesman whom she's supposedly dating. Surely, the reporter thinks, the one and only Elizabeth Taylor would not subject a lover to onion breath? Indeed not—the telltale allium portends that at this very moment, dear Liz is deep in secret negotiations to remarry Richard Burton! That's world-historic gossip. I don't usually go as far out of my way to think about Taylor Swift's upcoming wedding to Travis Kelce, but then she announced her new album on his podcast, and one track on it is a song-length dick joke. At least everyone's having a giggle—I don't even know what happened to the poor used car salesman.

What's the harm in a little fun, I thought, as I headed off to a screening of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, a music video premiere and behind-the-scenes documentary that played at all 540 AMCs in the country this past weekend. “I didn't realize we were coming here for one music video,” said the woman behind me on the out escalator, with no appreciation for the other 85 minutes' worth of making-of clips, artist commentary, and lyric visualizers (the clean versions). Taylor Swift fans are eating, catered by Target exclusives, TikTok effects, a “content capture activation” at the Century City mall in Los Angeles, and “Showgirl Era”-inspired cupcakes that come in “orange vanilla” and “teal vanilla,” which are the same flavor.

New Swift songs are prized commodities, and we're insatiable. “You're only as hot as your last hit, baby,” she warns in the new song called “Elizabeth Taylor,” pondering fame, exposure, and the ever-tenuous nature of celebrity marriage. But, like most ordinary rules of pop music stardom, this one doesn't fully apply to Swift: Her 2024 album, The Tortured Poets Department, had a big hit in the Post Malone adult-contemporary duet “Fortnight,” but in the same year, the Eras Tour and savvy marketing sent her 2019 song “Cruel Summer” to the top of the charts, too. More than any other pop singer, Swift has the luxury of setting her own agenda. Even before it came out, The Life of a Showgirl was already the biggest pop album of the year.

This is music for Taylor Swift fans and I am one! I like the Swift of “Leaving like a father/Running like water” and “I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money” and “I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time” and the Swift who dissed John Mayer and who is never ever getting back together and who wrote about her house in Rhode Island, and I will especially always love her collaborations with Swedish pop superproducers Max Martin and Shellback at the firework highs of 1989 (2014). When I am sick and tired of Taylor Swift, “Wildest Dreams” wins me back.

Lately I notice, though, that my favorite pop-loving Pilates instructor is putting dance remixes of “Look What You Made Me Do,” “Cruel Summer,” and, yes, “Wildest Dreams” on his playlist—that is, nothing later than Lover (2019). Though the Eras Tour was an explosion, in recent years the mood on record has felt more restrained. In The Official Release Party, Swift describes The Life of a Showgirl as inspired by that tour—the glitz, the hard work, the thrill of the crowd. With a bold shift from black and white photography to tangerine glitter and rhinestones, the album's presentation seemed to herald the return of big, fun pop bangers with a retro twist. The original record, released October 3, is a classic 12 tracks (compared to 31 on Tortured Poets' Anthology Edition) and Jack Antonoff is nowhere in sight. Shellback back? I said, Max Martin on deck? Sign me up. But now we got prob-lems.

˜The Life of a Showgirl is not really a new musical or thematic direction for Swift in the sense that Reputation (2017) or Folklore (2020) were. In most ways, it is a predictable continuation of her catalog: There's personal memoir with a veneer of poetic license, a pretty obvious diss track, an extended meditation on memories from high school, a touch of Shakespearean drama, and a singular focus on romantic love and a happily-ever-after that's happily ever closer. But it is simply untrue to claim, as Rolling Stone did on Friday, that Showgirl represents “new, exciting sonic turns.” Granted, there's never been another Taylor Swift song that sounds so much like the Jackson 5's “I Want You Back” (“Wood,” with the spiritual energy of bachelorette-party penis décor), or so uncannily like both Pixies' “Where Is My Mind?” and Weezer's “Say It Ain't So” (“Actually Romantic,” allegedly alleging that Charli XCX calls her “Boring Barbie,” which might stick).

These aren't obscure soundalikes—they are several of the most famous songs already ever made, now recreated in the genre of “Taylor Swift song.” Whatever vision Martin and Shellback set out to realize here is not really serving her strengths and, intentionally or not, appears to signal a disinterest in evolution. “Father Figure” has some of the album's strongest writing, with the signature Swiftian heel turn at the bridge, and I could not be less excited about how the production sounds, which is unremarkable compared to its inspiration, the 1987 George Michael song that's still so hot you remember it from Babygirl. It's not worth being mad about “CANCELLED!,” a swagless “Look What You Made Me Do,” even when Swift hits us with, “Did you girlboss too close to the sun?”

I can sort of recommend “Opalite,” a better-days-ahead anthem for gemstone lovers that sounds like a stage adaptation of Post Malone's “Circles,” or maybe it's Maroon 5's “Sugar”? “Honey” is quite sweet—a simple hip-hop beat flecked with bass, clarinet, and banjo, it finds room in the spotlight for the extensive live instrumentation that's sometimes overshadowed on other songs. The same is true of Swift's charming detour back to country-pop alongside Sabrina Carpenter on the closing title track, which ties a bow on the theme of A-list drama and glamour with lines like, “They ripped me off like false lashes” and a Swedish guy playing pedal steel guitar. (He's Anders Pettersson and he also appears on “The Fate of Ophelia,” far and away the most convincing song overall, and normie dream house “Wi$h Li$t,” in which Swift imagines a future where, apparently, everyone looks just like Travis Kelce.)

“The Life of a Showgirl” is a little schmaltzy, but it's proactive about introducing an independent personality with a story to tell, and Carpenter is a real asset. It's one of the moments when, musically, The Life of a Showgirl brushes up against a much better idea—a big, glorious pageant that inspires organic passion and camaraderie; a concept album with the ambition to do something familiar like it's never been seen before. The rest of the time, Showgirl sounds like much of the pop music you have heard over the past 10 years and throughout your lifetime; it asks that this time, you listen more closely, because this is Taylor Swift, with the enormity of commercial power and cultural significance and algorithmic rank that implies. “In my industry, attention is affection,” Swift says in her video commentary introducing “Actually Romantic.” That's the showgirl's job: making you pay attention. It's working, and if this is the only pop album you hear this year, maybe it's good enough.

The DJ mix CD is not yet dead, but it's time to call the priest. As an enfeebled relic from a mistily remembered past, the format is now passing into its museum era, even if a plucky few cling on honorably. (DJ-Kicks, for one, is still kicking.) Obituaries for the mix CD—popularized by series like Global Underground, fabric, Northern Exposure, and a slew of also-rans—have run regularly since the mid-2010s, when online mixes, often self-published, allowed DJs to sidestep onerous licensing and marketing hurdles. The mix CD's imminent demise has loomed so long that even those death notices have by now expired.

But hold the phone. Call Super's spectacular new album, A Rhythm Protects One, is essentially a mix CD, and a welcome reminder of its once-formative power to mold tastes and bend minds. Its praise for the bygone medium is not only implicit in its own format and deluxe, gatefold 2CD package design; the album's release is accompanied by a zine “celebrating CDs, routines and rituals.” In one essay, Call Super, a.k.a. Joseph Seaton, writes lucidly about what's been won and lost in the SoundCloud soup. Though that hyperdigital realm facilitates squishy abundance and easy access, they argue, the cost is the inability to grasp history as it unfolds, much less get a decent view of it. In that spirit, the piece asks, “Where are the hills to the flatlands?” The mix answers that rhetorical question via the west-of-Scotland sesh riddle of “The Argosy,” a spoken-word piece that intones, “Noise convinces the future to forget.”

The fluidity of the net, the solidity of the canon—as it happens, those are useful ways to think about the music on A Rhythm Protects One. In the flutters of woody clarinet and digital scree of the opening track, “Blue Sun I,” it's as though Seaton pits their own ambivalent thoughts about the past and present of DJ culture in cautious conversation. But the rest of the album is striking in its self-possession. As a DJ mix produced by Seaton in its entirety (in the guise of sly aliases like Clam1, Louis Lupin, and DJ Flowerdew), A Rhythm Protects One casts a glance toward a handful of old masters—particularly, Ricardo Villalobos and his timelessly strange and spiky fabric 36. (Seaton has their own entry into the fabric series.)

What fabric 36 and A Rhythm Protects One share is a mercurial minimalism whose extracurricular clicks and pops follow a strict internal logic. If Seaton's music is more viscous—itself squishily abundant—than minimal's avant-garde, it's also capable of breaking out of itself. When the mix shifts from “Lululu” to “Limelight,” Seaton invites a braying crowd of percussion: door slams, bell chimes, droid chat. Once they're sent spinning on merry-go-round spirals of bass and melody, the whole thing unscrews into deranged life.

In the last decade, club music has been marked less by innovation than recalibration. One way or another, a prolonged reckoning with—or plundering of—the past has clogged up what many of its artists do now. If a handful of disparate producers—Two Shell, Lanark Artefax, aya, Proc Fiskal—have responded with the extreme-HD sound of the digital sublime, Seaton's embrace of 4K sheen on A Rhythm Protects One and recent albums is equivocal. One of A Rhythm Protects One's strengths lies in its uniquely compelling sense of uncertainty, in which many ideas circle the point and hesitate to commit. In “Milkways,” unresolved piano chords and synthy mouthwash swirls dribble in irregular intervals through a bassline of unerring steadiness, not uncommon to the skewy thrum of early '00s Thomas Melchior.

In these moments, Seaton is at once familiar and ungraspable. One of their other signatures, the uncanny compound of human touch and hijacked hardware, surfaces again and again. A hand slapping what sounds like plywood on “Same Battles” beats against muscular voice modulation and veins of micro-digital FX. Even as these cyborg gestures circulate through A Rhythm Protects One, the mix draws its vitality from an archaic truth: The progress of culture depends as much on the ability to make out its forms as it does the imagination to recast them. There's no clearer example than on the fantastic closer, “Mothertime”; it resembles a theoretical Groove Chronicles classic, but it also can't help sounding like Call Super—in dialogue with club music's archive, in touch with the pulse of now, but beholden only to a polyphonic self.

Future Ruins, the film-music festival organized by Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, has been canceled a month before its planned launch in Los Angeles. The festival cited “logistical challenges and complications” that would prevent it from materializing as planned, via a statement on social media. Refunds will be issued automatically, according to the statement.

As well as Reznor and Ross, John Carpenter, Mark Mothersbaugh, Questlove, Goblin, and Hildur Guðnadóttir were among the composers booked for the festival's inaugural edition on November 8 at L.A.'s Equestrian Center. Billed by Live Nation as the “first of its kind,” it was conceived as an opportunity for composers “to tell new stories in an interesting live setting,” Reznor said in the initial announcement. “There's no headliner. There's no hierarchy. This is a stacked lineup of visionaries doing something you might not see again.”

The organizers' statement reads, “Unfortunately Future Ruins will not move forward this year. The reality is, due to a number of logistical challenges and complications, we feel we cannot provide the experience that's defined what this event was always intended to be. Rather than compromise, we're choosing to re-think and re-evaluate.”

Nine Inch Nails recently released their latest soundtrack, Tron: Ares, and announced a new North American leg of their Peel It Back tour with Boys Noize.

	Manosphere podcasters didn't win Donald Trump the presidency in the 2024 election cycle, but they went a long way to solidifying the president's support among large swaths of the young men who follow them. Now — nine months into the implementation of the president's agenda — the same ultra-popular podcasters and streamers who lent their audiences to the president in 2024 are scrambling to break with his government. 


	“I really really wish I never got into politics,” Kick streamer Adin Ross recently told his audience. “I just don't think I'll ever care enough again for another politician.” 


	Ross, who has been repeatedly banned from streaming platforms over his use of hateful slurs, interviewed Trump last August at the president's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. The streamer encouraged his viewers to vote for the then-candidate, and even gifted Trump a custom Tesla Cybertruck and a Rolex watch. The two bashed members of the  traditional press who had grilled Trump's campaign promises and public statements in past interviews, and gushed over each other. 

	











	Trump's interview with Ross was perhaps the most overtly sycophantic of the interactions the president had with bro-oriented content creators over the course of the campaign, but it was no anomaly. Now, figures like Joe Rogan, Andrew Schultz, and Theo Vonn — who all provided friendly, nonconfrontational spaces for the president's campaign agenda — are, like Ross, retreating from the MAGA movement. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Comedian Theo Von, host of the This Past Weekend podcast, interviewed Trump the same month as Ross. Trump asked Von about his cocaine use (“That's down and dirty, isn't it?”). Von asked Trump what he liked the most about each of his sons. Von would later attend Trump's inauguration. You could forgive the Trump administration for believing they were on friendly terms when the Department of Homeland Security used a clip of Von saying — in his telling, as an out of context joke —  “Heard you got deported, dude. Bye!” in a social media video.

	Von was not happy.  


	“My father immigrated here from Nicaragua. One of my prized possessions is his immigration papers from when he came here — I have them in a frame,” Von said last week. “This was just fucked up. It was fucked up.”


	In a social media post responding to DHS — which was later deleted — Von wrote that he didn't “approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger' deportation videos.”


	The administration's authoritarian approach to immigration enforcement has become a point of contention for other content creators considered reliable MAGA liaisons just months ago. 


	Earlier this year, Rogan slammed the Trump administration's deportation of hundreds of Venezuelan men, the majority of which had no criminal record, to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador for indefinite detention without due process. 


	“This is kind of crazy that that could be possible,” Rogan said in March. “The cause is let's get the gang members out, everybody agrees, but let's not let innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs.”


	Over the summer, Rogan criticized ICE's tactics in immigration raids as “insane.” 


	“There's two things that are insane,” Rogan said in July. “One is the targeting of migrant workers — not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers — just construction workers. Showing up at construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?”

	“I voted for none of this,” Schulz declared in July. “He's doing the exact opposite of everything I voted for. I want him to stop the wars — he's funding them. I want him to shrink spending, reduce the budget — he's increasing it. It's like everything that he said he's going to do — except sending immigrants back, and now he's even flip-flopped on that, which I kind of like.”

	











	But none of what Trump has done since retaking office should come as a shock. Trump had been vowing to go after immigrants — as well as his critics and political opponents — for years. His plans for ruthless, relentless mass deportations were as explicit as his designation of migrants as “poison” to the blood of the nation. It's a shame that many of the content creators who helped put him back in office only seem to be realizing it now.

	When the initial wave of shock wore off this morning that Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson are touring as Rush next year, most fans turned their attention to who will be taking on the absurdly difficult task of replacing the late Neil Peart behind the kit. The answer: German virtuoso Anika Nilles. “We could not be more excited to introduce her to our loyal and dedicated Rush fan base,” Lee said in a statement, “whom, we know, will give her every chance to live up to that near impossible role.”


	In a video accompanying the tour announcement, Lee explained how he came into contact with Nilles. “How do we replace someone who is irreplaceable?” he asked. “I had heard from Scully, my bass tech, who had been on tour with Jeff Beck. He had been working with this drummer named Anika Nilles. He mentioned how impressive she was, how talented and musical she was, and powerful. And I think [Alex] and I playing with her started to put a charge on us. We heard our songs coming back to life. It was only once we had those successful rehearsal sessions with her that I felt, ‘Yes, we can do this. And we can do justice to this. And this is going to be fun.'”

	











	Nilles is a familiar name to true drum aficionados, and she has 225,000 followers on her YouTube channel, where she showcases her seriously impressive chops and jams with figures like guitarist Joshua De La Victoria and drummer Kaz Rodriquez. But she's largely unknown to most rock fans, even if they saw her play with Jeff Beck in 2022.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Nilles has been drumming since early childhood, and she took to the instrument with great ease. “Drums are such a physical instrument,” she told 15 Questions. “It's all about coordinating your limbs and having a clear idea of the rhythms and sounds you want to create. For me, drumming often feels like yoga — it's just me and the drums, and everything else fades away for a while. That's really liberating.”

	At age 16, she told her parents that she wanted to play drums for a living. They said, “No, no, no!” she recalled to The Beat in 2023. “‘You need to do something serious first.' So I studied social work for five years and became a preschool teacher. It was fun, it gave me the chance to be creative, and I got a really good job offer after my final exam. But I had to think carefully about my situation.”


	She didn't quit to pursue music full-time until she was in her late twenties. “I always knew that I wasn't that happy at that job,” she told Modern Drummer in 2017. “But when you get money and you are safe, it's not that easy to quit.”


	After leaving her preschool job, Nilles enrolled in the popular music program at Popakademie Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim, Germany. “When I practiced at the university, I would close the doors and cover the windows so no one could see who was playing,” she told Drumeo. “I hated the idea that people could hear me failing. But at some point, I realized that I was making real progress, both mentally and in my drumming.”


	Nilles posted the original composition “Wild Boy” online in 2013, and videos of her playing began spreading across the internet, leading to world tours and teaching gigs. Her debut LP, Pikalar, landed in 2017. And in 2022, she played with guitar god Jeff Beck on his final tour.


	Rush haven't brought a new member into the fold since Peart was hired back in 1974. And even when they added keyboards to their sound, they refused to bring anyone new onto the stage. Lee instead found ways to sing, play bass, and handle the keyboard parts all at once. Those days are ending, though.

	“There's one other decision that is coming,” Lee says in the announcement video. “I love the idea of being able to wander over to [Lifeson] and wander over to the drummer and just be a bass player. I think we will find ourselves adding to the band, maybe a keyboard player. What do you think about that idea?”

	“I think it's great,” Lifeson says. “I think having a little time together at the front of the stage will be a lot of fun.”


	In back of the stage, meanwhile, Nilles will be honoring the work of Neil Peart and helping one of the greatest prog bands in history have a very unexpected victory lap. Her life will never be the same.

Larry Campbell still remembers the voicemail he received early this spring, and from a familiar voice: “This is Bruce Springsteen. You know, I'm Patti Scialfa's husband.”


	Campbell knew Springsteen's tongue was planted firmly in cheek. The veteran guitarist's résumé includes a seven-year stint in Bob Dylan's band starting in 1997 and studio sessions with Dylan, Paul Simon, Levon Helm, Rosanne Cash, and just about every American music legend of the last half-century. (He's also toured and recorded with his wife, singer Teresa Williams.) His connections to the Springsteen-Scialfa home go back a ways, too. In the Eighties, Campbell met Scialfa when the two sang and played together in bands on the New York club scene, met Springsteen at a birthday party for E Street bassist Garry Tallent, and guested on one of Scialfa's albums. He was even briefly the boss of the Boss: In 2003, Springsteen played guitar on an album Campbell co-produced for their friend Soozie Tyrell.

	











	Even with that background, Campbell was surprised when he returned Springsteen's call and heard what was afoot. Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, the movie about the period of crisis that led into the making of the pared-down Nebraska in 1982, was in the midst of filming. Over the last 40-plus decades, Springsteen has slipped all 10 of its songs into setlists, whether on solo tours and with the E Street Band. But until that call to Campbell, he'd never played the whole record start to finish with the same minimalist accompaniment. And with the movie on the way, now appeared to be the time. “He said the songs had never been performed the way they were recorded, and he needed a second guitar player, and would I be interested and have time to do it?” Campbell recalls. “I said, ‘Gee, let me think about this — yes.'”

	











	Campbell well remembered the arrival of Nebraska and how it stood apart from Springsteen's catalog and the musical landscape at the time. “I'm an old folkie at heart,” he says. “And one guy with a guitar telling a story, if it's done well, I'm in. It was showing a side of Bruce that I certainly didn't know was there, and I really respected what he was doing when that record came out.”

	After signing on and learning that E Street Band keyboardist Charlie Giordano would be the only other musician on the project, Campbell started his prep by relistening to Nebraska and focusing on the subtle overdubs Springsteen added to his voice-and-guitar basics. “I'd listened to that record many times, but I didn't pay attention to what was going on instrumentally, because there wasn't a lot going on instrumentally,” he says. “Bruce asked me to listen to the tracks and stay true to the second guitar stuff going on in there. That took a lot of paying attention to what was going on. His engineer did send me some of those guitar parts separated, because they're not mixed where they're really discernible.”


	With the taping only a few weeks away, Campbell then began playing along with the record, attempting to match the rhythmic punch in “Open All Night,” “Johnny 99,” and “State Trooper,” and delicate folk cadences in “My Father's House” and the album's title track. “It was impossible to get note for note everything that was played, but I wanted to absorb the vibe and the chordal inversions,” he says. “Once I thought I felt it and got it, I moved onto the next song.”


	In what Campbell calls “one of those pinch-yourself moments” he and Giordano, who would contribute synthesizer and celeste to replicate the subtle glockenspiel parts, found themselves at Springsteen's home studio in New Jersey, rehearsing the material the first time as a trio. To recreate Springsteen's mandolin on songs like “Atlantic City,” Campbell brought his own instrument and borrowed one of Springsteen's 12-strings for others.

	Since the Nebraska songs are structurally simple, Campbell says the warm-ups weren't overly difficult. “As far as technical guitar playing, none of that was challenging,” he says. “But what was challenging about it — about all of them — was feeling like I was expressing the mood of each of those songs. I had to really listen to the lyrics and put myself in a place that was empathetic to what Bruce was trying to say. I had to feel like I could see myself inside the songs.”

	











	After only a few days' warmup, the musicians, crew, and director Thom Zimny, who's worked on five Springsteen films (including the one made from the Springsteen on Broadway shows), met up at the Count Basie Center for the Arts in nearby Red Bank, with no audience in attendance. Arriving at the venue, Campbell realized how secretive it was; no fans were milling about. “I wasn't thinking about that or aware of it,” he says. “Any of the intrigue was just superfluous to what we were doing. It was all very low-key.”


	As the musicians set up onstage, facing the empty row of seats, Campbell began to realize the rationale behind that scenario, even if it wasn't fully explained to him. “This may be me projecting, but that sense of emptiness contributed to the vibe of the whole thing,” he says. “I was watching Thom film it, and the starkness of it all, to me, was the proper illustration of the stories on that record. It really captured the landscape of this body of work. It felt to me like Thom wanted to get Bruce's performance on film in a way that really enhanced that darkness.”

	Over the next few hours, the musicians got to work, cutting several takes of each Nebraska song. Campbell recalls the musicians moving efficiently from tune to tune, with what he calls just a “trunkload” of guitars behind him and Springsteen. “It was, ‘Let's do this like you're in a recording studio and do this song and then this song next,'” he says. “It was business. As the filming went on, Campbell watched as Springsteen and Zimny huddled after each take: “Thom would say, ‘Okay, that's great,' and if Bruce was cool with it, we moved on.” According to Campbell, the trio didn't attempt any songs that weren't on the album, but given they played a few versions of each song, this still means there's an alternative live Nebraska now in the vaults.


	When the recording and filming were wrapped up, the project was over almost as quickly as it had started. “Bruce was very courteous and thought it went really well, and then we went our separate ways,” Campbell says. He hasn't yet seen Zimny's completed movie of the concert, which will be included in the Nebraska '82: Expanded Edition box out on Oct. 17. But even given the abbreviated timeframe of the project, Campbell believes he gained an enhanced understanding of the album. “That landscape he created with that record was a real interesting and emotionally moving place to be for a couple of days,” he says. “I very much look forward to the next collaboration, if that ever comes around.”

	During an appearance on SiriusXM Hits 1, Taylor Swift opened up about playing the more explicit songs on The Life of a Showgirl for her mother. Based on her response, she must have queued up the clean version of “Wood.” 


	“I think that she thinks that that song is about superstitions, popular superstitions, which it absolutely is,” Swift said. “That's the joy of the double entendre. You could read that song for people and it just goes right over their head. You see in that song what you wanna see in that song.”


	“Wood” isn't particularly vague — “He ah-matized me and opened my еyes/Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see/His love was thе key that opened my thighs” — but maybe it's just easier for her mother to turn a blind eye. There are other moments on the album that opt for profanity over explicit imagery. 


	“If it, to me, improves the intensity of the moment or, in terms of syllables or consonance and vowels, if it pops off more, there are certain lyrics that just bounce more,” Swift said about choosing when to write profanity into her songs. “Or if it feels like it's a part of the vernacular of how that character that I'm kind of cosplaying in that song would speak. There are a lot of different reasons you choose to throw in a swear word or like a certain phrase or a sort of alliteration or whatever. But that's what I love so much about songwriting. Those decisions are fun and oftentimes hilarious to make.”

	











	Elsewhere in the interview, Swift opened up about her muse, Travis Kelce. “He's one of those people where as soon as you meet him, you kind of know he's the best,” she said. “And you kind of know there's no one else on the planet that's ever been even remotely similar to him. He's like one of one.”

	











	Swift also looked back on her Fourth of July post from 2023, where she captioned a carousel of photos, “Happy belated Independence Day from your local neighborhood, independent girlies. See you tonight. Kansas City.” She met Kelce shortly after, and finds the coincidence “deranged.”

	“How deranged is that post? I think back on that, I'm like there's no way,” she said. “If we break it down, I'm in this picture with a bunch of girls, not just me and Selena [Gomez]. A few of the other girls found their person right after that. The fact that it was right before the Kansas City show … and then the next day I go and play in Kansas City not knowing that Travis was gonna come to the show. It's unreal.”


	Gomez tied the knot with Benny Blanco in a ceremony last week. Swift gushed about “how happy I am for my friends when they find happiness,” adding, “Selena was the most beautiful, not just the most beautiful bride — just the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Just so happy and she deserves it so much.”

Despite the extraterrestrial associations often encouraged by paranormal enthusiasts, the term UFO – as well as its modern-day equivalent “UAP” – in no way implies the involvement of alien beings in these phenomena. In fact, the scientific study of these incidents is only hindered by idle speculation surrounding little green men and their intentions. That's why it's a shame that most documentaries about the subject assume that you're already part of the worldwide cult of E.T. truthers, an approach that makes it difficult to take most of these productions seriously.

Thankfully, this isn't always the case, and Small Town Monsters' latest production is a rare example of a UFO documentary willing to make do with historical facts and credible eyewitness reports while skillfully avoiding most of the common pitfalls that plague the genre. Directed by Seth Breedlove (who helmed most of the previous films in the series, including The Mothman Legacy and On The Trail of Bigfoot), Lost Contact: UFOs After Wartime stands out from previous Small Town Monsters projects by focusing more on the tangible and historical aspects of a tragic true story.

In the film, photographs, historical footage, and interviews with surviving witnesses are used to tell the story of World War II fighter pilot Thomas Mantell Jr., an experienced veteran who survived the war only to die in a mysterious crash after being ordered to pursue an unidentified object flying above the skies of his homeland. With the help of expert consultants, the documentary explores the cover-up that allegedly ensued after Mantell's death, with the government denying any strange occurrences despite several details about both the accident and its immediate aftermath not adding up.



This fascinating sequence of bizarre events is sure to keep both general audiences and die-hard Ufologists entertained throughout the majority of the flick's 90-minute runtime. The information is presented in a clear and concise manner, and the story itself is filled with eerie little details suggesting a larger conspiracy (like how Mantell's coffin was supposedly lined with lead as well as claims that the military showed up decades later to collect additional samples from the crash site).

The subject matter does a lot of the heavy lifting here, with the filmmaking itself feeling rather barebones, with the exception of a few stylish projections and the occasional interesting question. Aaron Deese's narration even invokes a monotonous High-School history class at times, though that has more to do with bland writing than the actor himself.

Regardless, the biggest issue here is pacing. Mantell's fateful crash may be the perfect subject for a spooky documentary, but it's clear that Lost Contact could have told the exact same story as an hour-long TV special containing all of the same information in a more easily digestible form.

That being said, repetitive talking heads and familiar archival footage are par for the course when it comes to low-budget documentaries, though the same excuse can't be applied to Breedlove's regrettable (though admittedly brief) inclusion of AI-enhanced imagery in the film. I can understand the instinct to inject some visual variety into the feature by animating old photographs and diagrams, but this kind of cheap digital shortcut only hurts an otherwise credible experience without actually adding any value to it – and I really hope that we don't see more of this in future Small Town Monsters projects.

Screenshot

Thankfully, the rest of the film remains a decidedly human affair, and I especially appreciate the inclusion of interviews about Mantell's family life and who he was as a person. After all, a 25-year-old human being perished because of dangerous orders from a superior officer, so it's refreshing to see Breedlove and his team make an effort to remember the tragedy at the heart of the incident, regardless of the mystery surrounding it.

And while the documentary doesn't present viewers with definitive evidence of the existence of aliens or even a solid theory about what exactly happened up there (though nearly everyone involved with the film rejects the balloon hypothesis), I think these answers are beside the point. Breedlove isn't really trying to make up anyone's mind regarding the incident, but instead attempting to tell a compelling true story that touches on everything from Cold War paranoia to government censorship, and that's where he succeeds.

Ironically enough, Lost Contact is one of the most down-to-earth explorations of an alleged close encounter that I've seen in years, and this sober approach to the subject matter is precisely why I found it so refreshing. Sure, the film's presentation could have used some polish, but the source material is captivating enough to carry the experience through to the finish line.

It's unlikely that we'll ever uncover the complete truth behind what happened to Mantell on that fateful afternoon back in 1948, but Breedlove's latest documentary is a great place to start the investigation.

Lost Contact: UFOs After Wartime releases on VOD on October 7, 2025.

The oldest and possibly “most haunted” hotel in Las Vegas is hosting a contest just in time for spooky season.

Thrill-seekers up for the challenge will have the opportunity to apply to spend a weekend inside the El Cortez Hotel & Casino hunting down ghosts — in the hopes of winning a $5,000 prize.

Only one lucky soul will be chosen to participate.

The legendary El Cortez, the longest-running hotel casino in Vegas, is situated on Fremont Street, often referred to as “the Old Strip” or “Old Vegas.”

This old-school hotel — and many others on Fremont — has seen it all since it first opened its doors in 1041: mobsters, murders and even paranormal activities.

In a hotel that is 84-years-old — it's almost expected for guests to see and hear some creepy things, like phantom footsteps and shadowy figures.

“We're sending you to investigate, fully equipped with ghost-hunting gear, to see if the stories are true!” the contest listing from Casino.org read.

“The chosen ghost hunter will check in to the El Cortez for a haunted weekend stay, where you'll explore the casino's oldest and eeriest corners, searching for signs of ghostly activity.”

The chosen one will be tasked with walking through the hotel's corridors, casino floor and any other areas that are thought to be haunted using ghost-hunting equipment such as EMF meters, EVP recorders and thermal sensors to detect unusual activity — at night.

The ghost hunting contest runs from Oct. 6 through Oct. 31, and the trip is expected to take place in early December.

If anything spooky is found, the ghost hunter will be expected to take photos and videos for evidence and to journal a short report of the scariest, funniest or mysterious findings.

It's rumored that the El Cortez basement is full of the ashes and cremated remains of former employees who died without any family, making the hunt a little more eerie.

And $5,000 can go a long way these days, considering people can't get over the wildly high prices Vegas is charging visitors these days.

“Having a coffee that was $14 was crazy. I just wasn't expecting that. It was just a latte with a few extra flavors,” Katherine from College Station, Texas, told Fox News Digital.

“I got a drink this morning. It was, like, $12 for a lemonade or something like that. And water bottles are so expensive,” her daughter Cammie added.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life.

Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System.

However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed.

In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored.

The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise.

We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space – from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces – with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.

Is it the invasion of the genome snatchers?

Just in case the idea of aliens walking around in human skin suits wasn't frightening enough. An outlandish study asserts that aliens might have abducted us and inserted genes into human DNA, with the fallout affecting potentially millions of people.

“Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation,” lead researcher Dr. Max Rempel, the founder and CEO of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, told the Daily Mail of the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.

Rempel came to this far-fetched-seeming conclusion by analyzing DNA from both regular people and those who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens. This comes following a spike in UFO sightings over the last year, making many fear that we are on the verge of some not-so-friendly close encounters.

The scientist specifically analyzed 581 complete families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 families that didn't appear to correspond to either family.

These genetic aberrations entailed a bundle of 348 non-parental genetic variants. As the subjects were born before 1990, this ruled out human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, which only emerged in 2013.

Rempel also analyzed 23andMe results from individuals who self-identify as alien abductees, discovering that some families showed evidence of non-parental markers.

If this evidence is confirmed to be true, the alien prober feels that “it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.” In other words, like the premises of every sci-fi flick from “Invasion Of The Body Snatchers” to “They Live,” the aliens are already walking amongst us, camouflaged our genes, per his theory.

The extra-terrestrial enthusiast even claimed that noted that a good portion of those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's, and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions, although he noted this is speculation at this point.

He even suggested that these extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy, much like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi sequel “Alien Resurrection.”

Of course, there are some caveats to this out-there study. Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, noted that there is “no conclusive evidence yet” as they “need better datasets, which are available only on approval.”

“That takes time and effort,” said the scientist, who added that current commercial genotyping services, which rely on array-based data, aren't precise enough to support such radical claims. Instead, he advocates for next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which can detect novel variants with much higher resolution.

Rempel's hope is to use high-resolution or next-generation sequencing — which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution — to analyze parents and children who identify as alien abductees and hopefully pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand.

Not to mention that the researcher's theory is in the same wheelhouse as the most fringe alien-hybrid hypotheses floated by tinfoil hat conspiracists, such as the Naza mummies, which reportedly harbor both human and alien DNA.

Nigel Watson, author of “Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited,” urged caution due to the sample size and the challenge of studying those with anecdotal evidence of alien abductions.

‘Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors,” he said. “We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”

Nonetheless, Watson believes that further genetic research on volunteer abductees is needed and could potentially prove as “world-shattering as recovering a flying saucer.”

In the interim, Rempel believes that possible “alien hybridization” could have major implications for the future of humanity.

“We need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet, and which alien races we might give priority,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","other"

Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: Supernatural, the boys

Jensen Ackles teases filming a scene for The Boys Season 5 that caught him totally off-guard: ""I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for that.""

During Creation Entertainment's ""The Road So Far, The Road Ahead"": Creation Philadelphia, Misha Collins shared some interesting details on his and Jared Padalecki's Supernatural reunion with Jensen Ackles for the fifth and final season of Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys. But the ten-ton teases didn't stop there, with Ackles sharing an anecdote about filming a scene for the upcoming season that gives us a much better sense of just how much Kripke is dialing up things for the streaming series' final run.

""I walk into the scene. Soldier Boy. And I turn the corner and I go, 'Oh my god.' That wasn't my line,"" Ackles shared, getting a nice wave of laughter from the audience. ""And I was supposed to stay there. But I hadn't seen what was going on. We'd blocked it out. We rehearsed it. Things changed when the camera was rolling, and I hadn't seen it. And I walked in and it was, 'Dear God,' and I just walked back out. And they were like, 'Uh, cut?' And I was like, 'I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for that [laughter]. And I don't think anybody else will be either."" Ackles and Padalecki gave each other very knowing stares before Padalecki said, ""I can't wait,"" and Ackles yelled to the audience, ""Enjoy!""

Here's a look at what Ackles had to tease during #SPNPhilly on Sunday – and once again, a ton of thanks and appreciation to Fangasm for continuing with the excellent coverage:

During his Saturday session, Collins discussed how the video that the trio posted, confirming that they would be filming together, pulled in millions of viewers. From there, Collins dropped a ten-ton tease that there are other ""surprise guests"" on tap for the episode, too.

Is it the invasion of the genome snatchers?

Just in case the idea of aliens walking around in human skin suits wasn't frightening enough. An outlandish study asserts that aliens might have abducted us and inserted genes into human DNA, with the fallout affecting potentially millions of people.

“Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation,” lead researcher Dr. Max Rempel, the founder and CEO of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, told the Daily Mail of the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed.

Rempel came to this far-fetched-seeming conclusion by analyzing DNA from both regular people and those who have claimed to have been abducted by aliens. This comes following a spike in UFO sightings over the last year, making many fear that we are on the verge of some not-so-friendly close encounters.

The scientist specifically analyzed 581 complete families from the 1,000 Genomes Project, discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 families that didn't appear to correspond to either family.

These genetic aberrations entailed a bundle of 348 non-parental genetic variants. As the subjects were born before 1990, this ruled out human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR, which only emerged in 2013.

Rempel also analyzed 23andMe results from individuals who self-identify as alien abductees, discovering that some families showed evidence of non-parental markers.

If this evidence is confirmed to be true, the alien prober feels that “it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA, essentially identifying hybrids.” In other words, like the premises of every sci-fi flick from “Invasion Of The Body Snatchers” to “They Live,” the aliens are already walking amongst us, camouflaged our genes, per his theory.

The extra-terrestrial enthusiast even claimed that noted that a good portion of those with autism, ADHD, and Asperger's, and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions, although he noted this is speculation at this point. 

He even suggested that these extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy, much like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi sequel “Alien Resurrection.”

Of course, there are some caveats to this out-there study. Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, noted that there is “no conclusive evidence yet” as they “need better datasets, which are available only on approval.”

“That takes time and effort,” said the scientist, who added that current commercial genotyping services, which rely on array-based data, aren't precise enough to support such radical claims. Instead, he advocates for next-generation sequencing (NGS) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS), which can detect novel variants with much higher resolution.

Rempel's hope is to use high-resolution or next-generation sequencing — which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution — to analyze parents and children who identify as alien abductees and hopefully pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand.

Not to mention that the researcher's theory is in the same wheelhouse as the most fringe alien-hybrid hypotheses floated by tinfoil hat conspiracists, such as the Naza mummies, which reportedly harbor both human and alien DNA.

Nigel Watson, author of “Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited,” urged caution due to the sample size and the challenge of studying those with anecdotal evidence of alien abductions.

‘Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors,” he said. “We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”

Nonetheless, Watson believes that further genetic research on volunteer abductees is needed and could potentially prove as “world-shattering as recovering a flying saucer.”

In the interim, Rempel believes that possible “alien hybridization” could have major implications for the future of humanity.

“We need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet, and which alien races we might give priority,” he said.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

Written by Tyler Chancey

Published: October 6, 2025 1:51 PM

Wizards of the Coast has released a Psion UA update for Dungeons & Dragons. This new version of playtest material for the popular fantasy TTRPG introduces tweaks and changes to the Psion class, a casting class that focuses on psychic powers.

In a blog post on D&D Beyond the design team discussed the changes in the Psion UA update. It covers the fundamental parts of the Psion, like its class features and its Psionic Energy dice, as well as tweaks to three of its subclasses. The fourth subclass, the Psi Warper, has been unchanged from the previous Unearthed Arcana.

Some of the core changes were meant to streamline the class. Telekinetic Propel and Telepathic Connection are now baseline abilities; you can use them at will as a Bonus Action. They can also be enhanced with Psionic Energy dice. Certain effects have been reworded so you only lose energy dice if your target fails a saving throw. Psionic Modes have been removed, and you have more means of regaining energy dice.

The Metamorph subclass has received some buffs across the board. Now, whenever you use a Psionic Energy dice, you gain temporary hit points. The Life-Bending Weapons feature deals additional damage without spending Psionic Energy dice. Curiously, the UA specifies that if the Psion shows up in a future book, it will include magic items that enhance the subclass' Organic Weapons feature.

The Psykinetic is another subclass that has been bumped up. It has a new feature called Stronger Telekinesis, which enhances the Mage Hand spell, letting it carry up to 20 pounds of weight. The reworked level six feature, Destructive Trance, adds bonus damage to spell attacks. And certain mid-to-late features like Rebounding Field and Heightened Telekinesis either don't use dice, spell slots, or provide temporary hit points.

The most significant changes are reserved for the Telepath subclass. New spells have been added to its spell list, The Potent Thoughts feature greatly extends the use of telepathy to 60 feet. The Scramble Minds feature has been simplified to where enemy behavior is dictated by the caster and not by random dice rolls. This helps add more utility to the subclass without dragging down the pacing of a fight.

The feedback form for the Psion UA update playtest material opens October 9.

ANDERSON, Calif. - A 37-year-old woman from Anderson, Hannah Chacon, remains missing after she vanished this past summer. She was last seen on August 9 at 8:30 a.m., leaving her mother's home at Blue Oak Court Apartments on Highway 273.

Hannah has a rare disorder called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, also known as ""Brain on Fire."" During episodes, she may appear psychotic and experience seizures.

Mary Chacon, Hannah's mother, said, ""Last words were, I love you, mom and if she went, I gotta go, that was it.""

Mary Chacon shared her belief that Hannah is still out there and in need of help. ""My inclination, my gut feel as a mother, is that she's still out there and no one has commented on her or seen her if I just feel the mom feels I know she's out there and she needs help,"" she said.

She explained that Hannah's symptoms might make her seem as though she is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, which could cause the public to hesitate in offering assistance. ""Some of those symptoms makes them appear as if they're on very heavy drugs or alcohol or mentally ill psychotic schizophrenic because of that people will tend to back away from her, so if she's in need of help, they may be fearful the public may be fearful of trying to help her when in fact, if they can find her call 911 she needs to be transported immediately to an emergency room,"" said Mary Chacon.

Police later found Hannah's phone along the Sacramento River in Anderson, providing a clue to her last whereabouts. Mary wants searchers to look along the river for signs of her daughter.

Hannah is 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs 185 pounds, and has short brown hair and brown eyes. At the time of her disappearance, she was wearing a black pullover sweater, olive green shorts, and tennis shoes. She also has tattoos on her arms and ankle.

Anyone with information on Hannah's whereabouts is urged to contact the Anderson Police Department at (530) 378-6606 or call 911.

An illegal migrant with a criminal history who was in charge of overseeing the running of a number of schools in Iowa is now facing deportation.

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines School Board, was arrested by ICE agents after he was found to be an undocumented migrant with a final order for deportation.

The arrest of the popular superintendent sparked a backlash in the state leading his supporters to protest for his release.

In addition to him being in the US illegally, inconsistencies in his CV and previous run-ins with the law, which allegedly involved Mr Roberts carrying a gun through an airport, have since emerged.

Mr Roberts was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers on Sept 26 after he was found hiding, dressed in a suit, near a trailer park.

Investigators said he had fled in a Jeep owned by the school district, where a loaded handgun, a hunting knife and $3,000 in cash were later recovered.

When he was selected to run the public school district in 2023, he was viewed as the sort of inspiring leader who could turn around the district after the Covid-19 pandemic.

The former Olympic athlete had a compelling life story, having immigrated from Guyana, allegedly earned degrees from impressive universities and spent most of his career in urban school systems building a reputation for his hands-on approach.

“I believe deeply in the promise of public education being the most important opportunity gap closer for youth, particularly with a focus on diverse populations,” Mr Roberts wrote in his cover letter, according to The New York Times.

Despite a past brush with the law and an inconsistency about where he obtained his doctorate, the school board moved ahead with hiring him after two outside vetting companies confirmed he was a US citizen.

For two years, Mr Roberts oversaw the education of 30,000 children in the public system and ushered in improvements in academic standards.

Even after a Texas judge ordered him to be deported last year, Mr Roberts allegedly continued to drop into classrooms and encouraged voters to approve more funds for the district.

Mr Roberts had arrived in the US from South America in his 20s and attended Coppin State University in Baltimore, where he competed in the athletics team.

He went on to represent Guyana, running in the 800m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.

According to ICE, Mr Roberts entered the US on a visitors' visa in 1994 when he was in his twenties and had arrests in New York in 1996 for drug charges and in 1998 on a charge of using an unauthorised vehicle, which was later dismissed.

After receiving a five-year student visa in 1999, the year after obtaining a bachelor's degree from Coppin State, he undertook a master's in education at St John's University in New York.

In 2001, he unsuccessfully applied to become a permanent US resident and went on to work as a teacher in Baltimore for five years before becoming a principal.

A former public school official who once interviewed Mr Roberts praised his “incredible energy” and the “tremendous rapport” he had with kids, according to The New York Times.

Throughout the subsequent years, the teacher's immigration status remained unclear, though ICE indicated to the newspaper that he had legal status in the country from 2018 to 2020.

During this time, he led a struggling high school in Washington, DC and a district office in St Louis, Missouri, specialising in turning around underperforming urban public schools.

In 2020, he was hired as a superintendent at a school district in Pennsylvania, telling the school system he was an American citizen when he applied, district leaders said.

Months later, his authorisation to work in the country is alleged to have expired.

Following his arrest, Mr Roberts was first placed on paid leave, then unpaid leave before the school board accepted his resignation.

Further holes have since emerged in the educator's CV. Mr Roberts claimed on his application in Iowa and Pennsylvania that he had a doctorate from Morgan State University. However, university officials said he never received his degree.

An article on the Des Moines Public Schools site said that Mr Roberts received a Master's degree from MIT, but the university said it had no record of him attending.

While Des Moines School Board officials were aware of a citation against Mr Roberts for having a loaded gun in a vehicle in Pennsylvania, they were unaware of a separate alleged arrest in 2020 for carrying a gun through an airport.

In the now-sealed case in New York, Mr Roberts was allegedly arrested for carrying a gun in his bag at LaGuardia Airport, an official told The New York Times. It is not clear if he was charged.

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said he “should have never been able to work around children”.

Jackie Norris, the chairwoman of the Des Moines School Board, said the district had followed the law and relied on an outside firm, JG Consulting, to assess Mr Roberts's credentials.

On Friday, the school district sued JG consulting, accusing it of failing to vet Mr Roberts properly. A lawyer for the consulting firm defended its work and said that the teacher “provided the documents necessary to show that he was eligible for the position”.

Mr Roberts's lawyer said that the Department of Homeland Security was attempting to “demonise” his client.

“It is a disturbing pattern that will fail,” Mr Parrish told The New York Times, adding that “the public will see that Dr. Roberts is a good man whose main interest was inspiring and educating young people”.

The Department of Homeland Security, Des Moines School Board, JG Consulting and representatives for Mr Roberts were approached for comment.

US President Donald Trump has mocked activist Greta Thunberg over attempt to reach Gaza aboard an aid flotilla, arrest and deportation afterwards.

Over 400 activists, with Thunberg among them, were detained by the Israeli navy on Friday as they tried to breach the blockade of the enclave by sea. More than 130 of them were deported to Türkiye over the weekend. Thunberg became a part of a group of activists deported to Greece and Slovakia earlier on Monday.

When asked about the Swedish activist, Trump responded with “she is a troublemaker.” “She's no longer into the environment, now she's into this… She needs to see a doctor. She has an anger management problem,” he told journalists at the Oval Office on Monday.

On Saturday, fellow activists and lawyers claimed that Thunberg, along with others, was subjected to “torture” and “harsh treatment” in an Israeli prison after they were arrested. West Jerusalem later rejected the claims, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said he is “proud” of the harsh conditions the activists are being held in.

Thunberg and Trump have been feuding for years, involving throwing each other's own words back in the face. Back in 2019, he made remarks on the activist's “anger management problem” after she was named Time's Person of the Year. Thunberg responded by updating her Twitter (now X) biography to include: “A teenager working on her anger management problem.”

Canadian prog-rockers will play seven concerts in summer 2026 in the US, Canada and Mexico, after hiring new drummer Anika Nilles

Rush, the Canadian prog rockers whose epic and detailed songcraft continues to attract a large and heartfelt fandom, are to reform for the first time since the death of drummer Neil Peart.

Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, both 72, will tour the US, Canada and Mexico, playing seven concerts in summer 2026 beginning in Los Angeles on 7 June.

Lee said in a statement: “It's been over 10 years since Alex and I have performed the music of Rush alongside our fallen bandmate and friend Neil. A lifetime's worth of songs that we had put our cumulative hearts and souls into writing, recording and playing together onstage. And so, after all that has gone down since that last show, Alex and I have done some serious soul searching and come to the decision that we fucking miss it, and that it's time for a celebration of 50-something years of Rush music.”

Lee promises a “vast selection of songs” from the band's 19 studio albums, and while crediting Peart as “irreplaceable”, announced a “remarkable” new drummer, Anika Nilles. Lee previously praised her in a 2023 Guardian interview, saying: “I heard this drummer the other day, I think her name is Anika [Nilles]. She played on the last Jeff Beck tour and I thought was she was terrific.”

Rush originally formed in 1968 in Toronto, and 11 of those 19 albums eventually went Top 10 in the US, culminating in 2012's Clockwork Angels, a No 2 hit.

Rush's last gigs were in a 40th anniversary tour in 2015, with the band members reportedly divided over their future. “I miss playing with Rush. I don't miss travelling with Rush,” Lee told the Guardian in 2018, and in his 2023 interview he added: “[The 2015 tour] was a lot of fun, but as the tour wound down, the mood started to change and it split into two camps. Neil was getting happier and Alex and I were getting sadder, because we really wanted to bring the tour to fans around the world, but Neil had agreed to do 30 shows. He felt as if he was approaching liberation, so we were quite divided by the end.”

Peart died of brain cancer in 2020, having lived for more than three years with the illness, and Lee had previously scotched the idea that Rush would perform again without Peart. “That's finished, right? That's over,” he told Rolling Stone later in 2020. “I would never hesitate to play one of those songs in the right context. But at the same time, you have to give respect to what the three of us with Neil did together.”

But in 2023 he told the Guardian it was “likely” that he and Lifeson would make new music together.

Lee also spoke more about Nilles at a launch event for the tour. “No matter who the drummer is, they all have their own perception of what it's like to play a Rush song, and they may not line up with the way we play Rush,” he said. “So whoever we were going to choose was going to be difficult, and there was going to be like a translation.

“And so we very secretly brought Anika to Canada, and we did it wasn't an audition, because at that point we weren't really sure that we were going to tour. It was all an experiment … I'm very happy to say that she is fantastic to play with … A lot of drummers can play Neil's drum fills, but to combine that with the feel of those songs so that it feels the way you guys want to hear those songs – that's work, that requires work. So she's winning.”

Lee added that the trio would be augmented by other supporting musicians: “Before we hit the stage, we also hope to add another musician or two to expand our sound a wee bit and free up Alex and I, in order to show off some of our new fancy dance steps.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Gold and bitcoin have both hit record highs in recent days. Geopolitical and economic uncertainty are factors, while doubts over the US dollar are attracting institutional investors.

It's been a happy few weeks for those who hold stocks of gold and bitcoin in their trading arsenals. The commodities have both reached record highs as investors continue to back them.

Gold smashed through the $3,900 (€3,334) a troy ounce barrier this week — a troy ounce being the unit of weight for precious metals and equivalent to 31.1 grams.

Meanwhile, on Sunday (October 5), the world's oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, hit a record when it broke through the $125,000 barrier for the first time, before falling back a little.

It has so far been a bumper 2025 for both commodities. Gold has been on its biggest rally since the 1970s, with the price jumping by more than 50% since January 1. Bitcoin has had some falls during a turbulent 2025, but its value has risen by around a third since the start of the year.

Long seen as a so-called safe-haven asset which investors back during periods of uncertainty, gold has been on a steep upward curve since late 2018, with its value having increased by more than 300% since then.

Uncertainty has been a factor in the current rally, with US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs in April fuelling concerns over the global economy, the sustainability of US government debt levels and the future viability of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency.

There has also been ongoing geopolitical uncertainty as a result of Russia's war in Ukraine and the war in Gaza.

Another recent factor has been the US government shutdown. Gold is widely seen by investors as an alternative option to the US dollar, which has fallen sharply in value this year.

Gold has also benefited from a fall in support for the Japanese yen as a safe-haven asset. Japanese stocks surged on Monday after it was confirmed that Sanae Takaichi was elected as leader of the ruling party LDP, setting her up to be the nation's first female prime minister. However, the yen continued to fall back.

""Yen weakness on the back of the Japanese LDP elections has left investors with one less safe-haven asset to go to, and gold was able to capitalise,"" KCM Trade Chief Market Analyst Tim Waterer told news agency Reuters.

The US situation was adding to the attraction of gold. ""The enduring US government shutdown means that a cloud of uncertainty still hangs over the US economy, and the potential size of any GDP impact,"" he added.

However, experts say there is more to gold's current surge than doubts over the future of the US economy or indeed, the global economy. Several analysts say there has been a rise in demand for gold-backed exchange traded funds (ETFs), with more and more investors from a wider range of backgrounds seeking to invest.

""The fact that ETF demand has re-entered the scene so forcefully means that there are two forms of 'aggressor' bids for gold, from central banks and ETF investors,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a note to clients.

Gold has long been purchased by central banks around the world but the new ETF demand has fuelled the current rally. Recent data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) shows that hedge funds now hold record holdings of $73 billion worth of gold.

Bitcoin's record rally has been largely driven by the reelection of Donald Trump as US President, with his clear and often-stated support for cryptocurrencies helping to increase demand and trust in the sector.

However, there is evidence that more institutional investors are ploughing into bitcoin, similar to the trend seen with gold. The commodity is becoming favored as an alternative to other bets, such as the US dollar. Expected interest rate cuts are also apparently luring investors to take greater risks on the asset.

Bitcoin also appears to be strengthening on the back of uncertainty over the US economy, with the ongoing government shutdown driving up demand.

""The shutdown matters this time around,"" Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in a note to investors.

""This year, bitcoin has traded with 'US government risks,' as best shown by its relationship to US Treasury term premium,"" he added, referring to the metric which measures the extra yield investors demand in order to hold long-term government bonds — which reflects the extent of their faith in long-term economic stability.

Another factor in bitcoin's current strength may be related to its annual cycle. October has historically been one of its strongest months, with the price having only fallen twice during the month of October since 2013.

Many observers see gold and bitcoin continuing to rise in value, with new milestone breakthroughs expected.

""I suspect bitcoin will rise throughout the shutdown and will soon reach $135,000,"" Geoffrey Kendrick predicted. The fact that the Trump administration is likely to continue pursuing favorable policies for cryptocurrencies adds to the sense of optimism.

As for gold, few see it losing value anytime soon.

""Rallies can continue into 2026 aided by official sector buying; institutional demand for gold as a diversifier can stay robust,"" HSBC said in a note to investors on Friday.

The London, UK-based bank said it expected central banks to continue buying gold in large quantities as an ongoing hedge against geopolitical risk.

That chimes with what the World Gold Council said in its last quarterly statement in late July, that its annual central bank survey showed that ""95% of reserve managers believe that global central bank gold reserves will increase over the next 12 months.""

That, along with the growing demand around ETFs from hedge funds and other institutional investors, suggests the commodity is likely to breach the $4,000 mark soon.

            Eswatini on Monday received 10 third-country nationals deported from the United States, it said, adding to an initial group of five deportees it received in July.
    


            The Southern African country had announced on Sunday night that it was expecting to receive 11 deportees from the US in October under an agreement with the Trump administration. It did not give their nationalities.
    


            “His Majesty's Correctional Services (HMCS) confirms the arrival of ten (10) third country nationals from the United States of America,” the government department said in a statement on Monday.
    


            It said the individuals would be kept in correctional facilities until they could be repatriated to their home countries and added that they were in good health and undergoing admissions processes.
    


            There was no immediate statement from the Trump administration.
    


Eswatini says Jamaican man deported by US has been repatriated



            President Donald Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to ramp up removals to third countries as part of that crackdown.
    


            The first five immigrants deported to Eswatini this year were from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen. One man, from Jamaica, has already been repatriated with the cooperation of his government.
    


            Two others are expected to be repatriated soon, the statement from Eswatini said.
    


Eswatini, a small mountain kingdom bordering South Africa, has not disclosed the terms of its deal with the Trump administration and is facing a lawsuit from local activists who claim it was illegal.
    


            Legal and human rights activists have also protested the treatment of the deportees, the first group of whom were held in solitary confinement.
    


            “HMCS remains committed to the humane treatment of all persons in its custody,” the department of correctional services said in its statement.

NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “Diddy” Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean.

In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to “strongly recommend” that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.

FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs “to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,” Combs lawyer Teny Geragos wrote.

Also Monday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname “Puff Daddy,” did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Trump's remarks was left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team.

Combs' sentencing Friday on charges he transported people across state lines for sexual encounters capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called “freak-offs,” and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music.

The “I'll Be Missing You” singer was convicted in July under the federal Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.

Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.




In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a “spiritual reset” in jail and is “committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.” 

“I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,” he wrote.

Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix.

Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.

FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles (103 kilometers) southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.

Combs once owned a home in New Jersey, selling it nearly a decade ago.

His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest.

FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.

In 2021, a 27-year-old Fort Dix inmate was stabbed in the eyeball by a fellow prisoner.

In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.

During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Republicans are seizing on recently unearthed violent rhetoric from Virginia's Democratic candidate for attorney general in a push to re-shape the state's governor's race — and tarnish the Democratic Party nationally — less than a month before Election Day.

President Donald Trump, like Republicans across Virginia, called for Democratic state attorney general candidate Jay Jones to quit the race over the weekend. The Republican president described Jones as a “radical left lunatic” and sought to link him to former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia's Democratic candidate for governor. 

“Abigail Spanberger, who is running for Governor, is weak and ineffective, and refuses to acknowledge what this Lunatic has done,” Trump wrote on social media. 

The clash over Jones' violent rhetoric, shared in a 2022 private text message exchange published on Friday, comes just four weeks before voters in Virginia and New Jersey choose new state leaders. History suggests that the party that holds the White House — Trump's Republican Party in this case — struggles in off-year elections, but Republicans hope the scandal might tilt next month's elections in their direction.

It was too early on Monday to say what impact the evolving situation may have on the high-stakes governor's races, if any, but Democrats privately acknowledged that the scandal is at least an unwelcome distraction, in Virginia and beyond — especially as Trump escalates his campaign to cast his political opponents as violent extremists.

Experts say damage from the scandal could spread beyond Jones' race and boost what has been a lackluster campaign for Republicans.




“The plain fact is that the damage for Democrats will not be contained only to the campaign for attorney general,” said Mark J. Rozell, dean of George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. 

“Between now and Election Day, the Republicans are not going to let up on this issue, nor should they. It is their opportunity now to drive much of the narrative of the campaign and take the Democratic candidates off their message,” he said. “The GOP campaign overall had looked divided, uninspiring, and faltering, but now the party's candidates have a cause to rally around.”

Spanberger's campaign did not respond Monday when asked whether Jones should leave the race. In a statement released on Friday, the Democrat said she “spoke frankly with Jay about my disgust with what he had said and texted. I made clear to Jay that he must fully take responsibility for his words.”

She promised to ”always condemn violent language in our politics.”

That wasn't good enough for Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who released a new ad on Monday highlighting Spanberger's recent support for Jones. 

“Jay Jones dreamed of murdering two young kids and their dad over politics—and Abigail Spanberger wants him to be attorney general,” Earle-Sears wrote in a social media post sharing the ad. 

Spanberger and Earle-Sears are scheduled to face off in a debate on Thursday.

Jones has apologized repeatedly in recent days for the violent rhetoric he used in text messages he sent to a Republican lawmaker in 2022 about former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert. The text exchange was published on Friday by the National Review. 

In the texts, Jones wrote: “Three people two bullets ... Gilbert, hitler, and pol pot ... Gilbert gets two bullets to the head.” Pol Pot was the leader of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.

Jones did not hold elected office when he sent the messages. He had formerly served as a state legislator and stepped down in 2021, before launching his bid for state attorney general. 

Trump seized on the issue over the weekend even as he continued to distance himself from Republican Earle-Sears in the governor's race. His allies have long feared that she may struggle to defeat Spanberger next month despite her strong support for Trump. 

Trump ignored Earle-Sears during a Sunday rally-like speech to Navy soldiers in Virginia, even as he ticked off a list of prominent Republicans in the state. In a social media post, he went after Spanberger without naming Earle-Sears.

The comment fit a pattern of escalation from Trump, who repeatedly has cast Democratic activists as violent extremists.

In a speech to the military generals last week, Trump proposed using U.S. cities as training grounds for the armed forces and spoke of needing military might to combat what he called the “invasion from within.” He continued his rhetoric in Sunday's speech to the Navy. 

“We have to take care of this little gnat that's on our shoulder called the Democrats,” he said.

The president has faced little, if any, Republican pushback for his rhetoric. But he and his allies lashed out at Jones and his Democratic allies on Monday. 

“What does it say about Virginia when presumably millions of Democrats will go out and vote for the murder of their Republican neighbors' children?” conservative media figure Benny Johnson asked Jones' Republican opponent, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, in a Monday interview.

Miyares said Virginians are “good and decent people,” before charging that Democrats, including Spanberger” have not been held accountable for Jones' rhetoric. 

“She's still willing to campaign with him, he said of Spanberger, noting that she has not asked him to quit the race and is “perfectly happy for him to be the top prosecutor in the state.” 

“That is an amazing lack of judgment,” Miyares said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Comey won't appear before House Oversight, denies knowledge of Epstein files","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3839141/james-comey-denies-knowledge-epstein-files-house-oversight-committee/","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 19:20:37 GMT","

Former Democratic FBI Director James Comey denied any knowledge of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to letters reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

Based on his responses, the House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) withdrew his subpoena to appear in person for a deposition to Congress regarding the ongoing investigation of Epstein and associate Ghislaine Maxwell and the release of the criminal files. 

The decision comes after Comey was indicted last month on two of three counts sought by prosecutors, one of making false statements and one of obstruction of justice. The indictment stemmed from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on his role in the bureau's handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Comey was initially subpoenaed in August to testify behind closed doors on Tuesday as part of an effort to bring in a broad group of former Department of Justice and FBI leaders to speaking on the handling of the criminal case. However, Comer withdrew the demand after Comey and former Justice Department leaders provided written statements.

“Given that I do not possess knowledge and information relevant to the Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and related matters, I offer this letter in lieu of a deposition that would unproductively consume the committee's scarce time and resources,” Comey wrote in a letter. 

Trump allies have long accused Comey, an Obama-era official, of misleading Congress and authorizing politically motivated leaks about the FBI's probe into Trump campaign associates in 2016. Just earlier this month, Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to move “without delay” in pursuing charges against several former Obama-era officials. Comey's indictment claims he obstructed a congressional investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information in violation of 18 USC 1505. It also alleges that Comey made a false statement in violation of 18 USC 1001. 

The former FBI director is set to appear before a court later this week for his arraignment. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, is set to preside over the case. Comey responded on Bluesky, saying he is innocent.

Comey is not the first subpoena in the Epstein investigation to be withdrawn. Former Attorneys General Merrick Garland and Eric Holder told the House Oversight Committee they have no knowledge of files related to Epstein. The committee also backed off compelling in-person interviews with Attorneys General Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales last month. The committee also withdrew a subpoena for former FBI Director Robert Mueller, citing his declining health.

President Donald Trump, House GOP leadership, and the DOJ have sought to move past the Epstein files following the public fallout from the department's announcement in July that it had no plans to make any further documents available and affirmed that Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges related to the sex trafficking of minors.

The Trump administration insisted there was no “client list” that would have implicated famous and powerful people involved in Epstein's alleged sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. Responding to public demands for more information, the House Oversight Committee issued various subpoenas to seek the DOJ files and interviews with witnesses.

The committee originally issued 10 subpoenas for depositions earlier this year, including former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, from August through October. The other eight subpoenaed individuals were Comey and Mueller, and former Attorneys General Bill Barr, Loretta Lynch, Sessions, Gonzales, Holder, and Garland, although not all were required to appear in person. Barr's transcript from his testimony was released earlier this month.

Alexander Acosta, former Department of Labor secretary and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, testified before the committee last month after a separate subpoena. Acosta granted Epstein what many believe was a “sweetheart deal.”

The committee has released multiple batches of documents related to the DOJ files, many of which came from the committee's subpoena to Epstein's estate.

GRAND JURY INDICTS FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY 

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced a discharge petition to try to force a vote for a full release of the Epstein files. However, it was one signature short of forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to put Massie's Epstein transparency bill on the House floor for a vote.

After Democrats won a recent special election in Arizona, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva is expected to sign the Epstein discharge petition and reach 218 necessary signatures to compel floor action. Johnson has delayed the swearing-in of Grijalva as the House continued to be in recess amid the government shutdown, a move some Democrats have said is due to her support of the petition to release files related to Epstein.

OpenAI told the world about its internal workplace tools last week, and since then, the market has been freaking out about whether the AI startup will someday compete with the SaaS industry with its own software tools.

So, at OpenAI's big DevDay conference on Monday, I headed straight to a presentation by Scotty Huhn, who is part of a team that builds tools that help OpenAI's Sales, Customer Success, and Operations teams do their jobs more effectively.

Huhn walked a packed crowd through three OpenAI software tools: GTM Assistant, OpenHouse, and Support Agent.

He made clear these are internal tools at the moment, but after the presentation he was asked whether OpenAI would ever release them as software products in the future. He mostly the dodged the question by saying it is still very early days.

OpenAI wouldn't be the first company to start selling the internal tools it develops to other businesses. Famously, workplace chat giant Slack used to be a game developer called Tiny Speck, and spun out its messaging tool into a full-fledged business (Salesforce bought Slack for nearly $30 billion in 2020).

Huhn also noted in his presentation, and in comments afterwards, that OpenAI is open-minded about build-versus-buy decisions when it comes to workplace software. If there are better tools out there to buy, OpenAI will do that, he said.

Huhn also noted that OpenAI uses Sales Cloud, Salesforce's customer-relationship-management software, as a ""source of truth"" for the startup's sales teams. OpenAI also uses Workday for HR information, Slack for internal communication, and Databricks for a key data warehousing service, according to his presentation and comments. 

The first internal tool Huhn described was OpenAI's GTM Assistant, which helps the startup's go-to-market sales team work more efficiently. 

He said some of the skills that were distilled for this tool came from a talented human sales employee called Sophie. 

The tool helps staff with planning for meeting potential clients, customer demos, and follow-ups after these touchpoints. 

Another real human employee at OpenAI had developed about 100 customer demos, and the startup used these to train its GTM Assistant tool to create better demos. Now, this knowledge has been spread among the broader team, which numbers more than 400, Huhn explained. 

Any missing stuff can be called out by employees and fed back into the system, constantly improving it, he added. 

Next up was OpenHouse, an internal HR tool that taps into existing workplace software, such as Slack and Workday, to help employees connect with each other better and keep up with company policies and other information.

In one example, Huhn shared a recent sales trip to New York. He used OpenHouse to ask if any colleagues there knew about customers and topic areas relevant to his upcoming meetings. 

OpenHouse suggested four or five staffers, and Huhn reached out to a specific person who helped him prepare better. 

The final tool Huhn discussed was Support Agent, which makes OpenAI's customer support operation more efficient. 

He showed a chart of customer support tickets over the past year or so, with a huge spike in the spring when OpenAI introduced a new image-generation tool, and usage spiked. Interestingly, there was another huge spike in recent weeks, per the chart. 

The tool has improved OpenAI's support ticket deflection rate, which measures how many customer requests are dealt with quickly and easily. 

More customer questions have been solved, and positive reviews are way up, according to data Huhn shared during the presentation. 

The tool has helped OpenAI bake standards and knowledge into its customer support operation, partly by taking interactions and feeding them back into evaluation processes at the end, which improves the system over time. 

Huhn finished by pitching the audience on using AI in general to improve their own operations. 

Rather than selling these specific internal tools, he encouraged developers to use OpenAI's AgentKit service to build their own agents.

He stressed that the skills OpenAI distilled into its own AI tools ultimately came from the startup's employees, including that talented sales staffer, Sophie. 

""Find your Sophie,"" Huhn said.

Crypto:

Growing fiscal concerns in some of the world's biggest economies are adding momentum to a so-called “debasement trade,” as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin, gold and silver while pulling away from major currencies.  

The yen tumbled on Monday as pro-stimulus lawmaker Sanae Takaichi was set to become Japan's next prime minister. French bond spreads blew out and the euro slid after the prime minister resigned, hurling the country into another political crisis. The dollar, which has weakened about 30% against Bitcoin this year, remains under pressure as the US government shutdown drags on. The euro has its own problems with fresh political uncertainty brewing in France.  ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Oops, something went wrong

Gold (GC=F), silver (SI=F), and bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Monday as investors sought a hedge against rising debt and political uncertainty in developed markets.

Gold futures (GC=F) neared $4,000 per troy ounce on Monday to touch a fresh record, while silver futures (SI=F) also jumped to $48.50 per ounce, less than two dollars away from a 1980 intraday high. Meanwhile, bitcoin jumped about 2% to touch a fresh record north of $125,790 per token.

The market action highlighted the so-called ""debasement trade,"" which refers to investors shifting into assets to guard against what they see as the erosion of fiat currencies' value from inflation, heavy government spending, and mounting debt financed by money creation.

Over the weekend, JPMorgan analysts noted the rise in precious metals and cryptocurrencies against the backdrop of what they called “dollar debasement.” The US dollar index (DX.Y.NYB) is down more than 9% year to date.

Meanwhile, fiscal uncertainty in some developed markets has driven a flight to safe-haven assets. In an unexpected election outcome in Japan over the weekend, Sanae Takaichi was set to become the country's next prime minister. Market analysts view Takaichi as a ""fiscal dove,"" supporting government stimulus to grow the economy.

Takaichi's election indicates ""how much of the developed world is pivoting into a 'Run It Hot' fiscal dominance framework, carrying monster deficits in order to try and outgrow debt,"" Nomura Securities analyst Charlie McElligott said in a note on Monday morning.

""Accordingly, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin are again simultaneously moving to fresh ATH's as the chief winners in this latest escalation of the ... 'Debasement Trade,' alongside equities then too ripping to record highs as well,"" he added.

Gold and silver have surged more than 50% and 60% year to date, respectively, as expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted the appeal of metals, which tend to perform better when interest rates are lower.

Meanwhile, bitcoin is up roughly 33% year to date as the world's largest cryptocurrency kicked off October, its seasonally strongest month of the year, soaring from $118,000 to $125,000 over the past week.

""The ongoing US government shutdown has amplified Bitcoin's safe haven narrative, with investors increasingly rotating from U.S. related assets like treasuries into assets seen as resilient to political dysfunction and inflationary pressure,"" Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR, said in a note.

Wall Street sees further gains for the crypto space as stablecoin issuance sends native tokens for blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) higher.

""I believe that the next wave of crypto adoption will come from stablecoin adoption. And that's going to be very positive for crypto overall,"" Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, told Yahoo Finance last week. ""This is a trend that might take six months to one year to start to reflect on prices.""

Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) are up 115% since the company's IPO in June. Related stocks have also been on a tear in recent weeks. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is up 295% year to date, while Coinbase (COIN) is also up 56% since the start of the year, off its all-time high from July.

Gespa, Switzerland's gambling authority, has begun a preliminary probe into FIFA's new “Right-to-Buy” blockchain collectibles, aiming to determine whether  the soccer governing body has complied with local gambling laws, according to a report from Bloomberg. 

The “right-to-buy” (RTB) collectibles, offered via the FIFA Collect platform, provide users the option to purchase tickets to the upcoming 2026 World Cup to be hosted in North America. The collectibles are initially sold directly by FIFA, but can be resold on the secondary marketplace. 

“Our mission is to bring fans closer to the game they love. By introducing Right-To-Buy on FIFA Collect, we are offering supporters a new and more direct way to be part of FIFA World Cup 26™, turning digital collectibles into real-world opportunities,” said Modex Technologies Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lorenzon at the time of RTB launch in late September. 

Modex is FIFA's exclusive partner and collaborator on its digital collectibles platform. 

According to statements gathered by Bloomberg, Gespa is performing further fact-finding to determine whether or not any regulatory action is necessary. 

FIFA Collect users can find RTB collectibles in surprise packs or purchased directly from the secondary marketplace, with current prices for the option to buy one ticket to a match game in Houston for $149, more than $1,200 for the right to buy tickets to Canada's first match, and as much as $7,000 for the right to buy opening tickets to the first match at Mexico's Azteca Stadium. 

Holding the collectible ensures users are not subject to the general queue of ticket buyers when tickets go live. However, they will still need to pay for the tickets to their respective match, as the collectible merely provides the option to purchase. 

Official tickets to the World Cup are being sold in phases, with the Visa Early Presale taking place in mid-September. The next phase will occur at the end of October, with other draws and sales taking place throughthe end of the tournament. 

A selection of tickets have been set aside specifically for FIFA Collect users. 

FIFA Collect was originally developed on Algorand in 2022, but earlier this year FIFA announced its departure from the proof-of-stake blockchain. 

In May, it announced it would build its own Avalanche layer-1 network to power its platform, enhancing the digital collecting and “immersive fan experiences” it could provide. 

Representatives for Gespa and FIFA Collect did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

This news release constitutes a ""designated news release for the purposes of the Company's amended and restated prospectus supplement dated May 14, 2025, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated September 11, 2024.

San Antonio, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - October 6, 2025) - HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (NASDAQ: HIVE) (FSE: YO0) (the ""Company"" or ""HIVE""), a diversified multinational digital infrastructure company, is pleased to report its September 2025 production figures and provide an update on the commissioning of its Phase 3 Valenzuela facility.

September 2025 Production Highlights

Bitcoin Produced: 267 BTC (up 8% month-over-month from 247 BTC in August 2025, and up 138% year-over-year from 112 BTC in September 2024)

Average Daily Production: 9 BTC/day

Hashrate: Averaged 19.4 exahash per second (""EH/s""), with a peak of 21.7 EH/s

Fleet Efficiency: 18 joules per Terahash (""J/TH"")

BTC per EH/s: 13.8 BTC

Phase 3 Valenzuela Commissioning Ahead of Schedule

HIVE's 100 MW Phase 3 Valenzuela build is nearing completion. Civil works are concluded, hydro containers are installed, and the control center is live. The focus has now shifted to energizing ASICs, with new units being steadily integrated into production.

Hashrate Growth: HIVE's average hashrate rose 19% month-over-month, from 16.3 EH/s in August to 19.4 EH/s in September.

Network Outperformance: This growth outpaced the 16% increase in Bitcoin network difficulty (from 130 trillion to 151 trillion (""T"")). These figures are publicly verifiable through Bitcoin block explorers.

Record Production: Despite consecutive all-time high Bitcoin network difficulty, HIVE mined 267 BTC in September - a year-to-date high - underscoring its operational strength.

As of today, HIVE's global Bitcoin mining fleet totals 21.8 EH/s, powered entirely by renewable hydroelectric energy. With additional ASICs scheduled to come online in October, HIVE remains on track to scale to 25 EH/s by U.S. Thanksgiving, at an average efficiency of approximately 17.5 J/TH.

Management Commentary

Frank Holmes, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, commented:

""HIVE's September milestones demonstrate the power of a focused, dual-engine strategy as our global Bitcoin mining fleet now produces over 9 BTC per day. Our executive team was in Paraguay last month and Gabriel Lamas, HIVE's Country President, is doing an outstanding job while Phase 3 Valenzuela continues to advance ahead of schedule. At the same time, BUZZ HPC, under Craig Tavares' leadership, is expanding our AI cloud capabilities and forming strategic partnerships with Bell Canada, Dell Canada, VAST Data and other leading AI companies in Canada to broaden access to enterprise-scale compute. HIVE is a unique Canadian data center company that only sources green hydroelectric energy to power its operations.  With data centers spanning 9 time zones, across Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, we've built a truly global footprint that reflects our commitment to sustainability, capital efficiency, and long-term value creation.""

Aydin Kilic, President & CEO, added:

""With construction substantially complete at our Phase 3, 100 MW site in Valenzuela, approximately 50% of the hashrate capacity is now online, with commissioning of the remaining hydro containers well underway. The next wave of ASICs is set for installation next week, keeping us on track for 25 EH/s by American Thanksgiving.  With disciplined energy management and optimized fleet efficiency, our current 9 BTC/day production (at Bitcoin network difficulty of 151T) demonstrates the resilience of our Paraguay-based engineering and technical teams.  As we approach the successful completion of our targets for 2025, HIVE looks ahead to further expansion in global operations for 2026, with our cash flow from the Bitcoin mining business providing funding and growth for our HPC and GPU AI cloud business. As stewards of capital, our goal is to lead the sector in ROIC to provide value for our shareholders. We are always looking for long-term accretive opportunities, and we believe increased sustainable cash flow is the key to long-term success in these industries.""

Future Production and Economics

As previously disclosed, all ASIC purchases for Phase 3 are funded and have shipped.  HIVE expects future growth to follow the economics of its Paraguay operations.  Each additional exahash increases daily Bitcoin production and revenue potential, while operating costs remain stable with fixed-rate hydroelectric power and minimal labor increases.  Power expenses scale with machine usage and align with current cost structures.  Results may vary depending on network difficulty and Bitcoin prices.

About HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd.

Founded in 2017, HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. builds and operates sustainable blockchain and AI infrastructure data centers, powered exclusively by renewable hydroelectric energy. With a global footprint in Canada, Sweden, and Paraguay, HIVE is committed to operational excellence, green energy leadership, and scaling the future of digital finance and computing, while creating long-term value for its shareholders and host communities.

""Uptober,"" the wordplay on crypto's historically bullish month of October, is so far living up to its name as bitcoin BTC$124,704.72 pushed towards new all-time highs and altcoins also caught a bid.

After briefly spiking above $125,000 and retreating on Sunday, BTC followed through on Monday, surging to a fresh record of $126,223 during the U.S. trading session. BTC changed hands around $125,200 recently, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours.

While the dollar's weakness has helped the rally to new highs, the largest crypto now has clinched to new highs in euro terms crossing 106,000 EUR and surpassing its January peak, while breaking its mid-August peak in Swiss franc (99,642 CHF), TradingView data shows.

Bitcoin's strength extended across the crypto market. Ethereum's ether ETH$4,677.76 advanced 4% to hit $4,700, its strongest price in more than three weeks, leading the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index higher. Popular memecoin DOGE$0.2657 and the native token of layer-1 network BNB BNB$1,216.51, closely linked to exchange giant Binance, gained 6%-6%.

Crypto stocks posted mixed results on Monday, with retail trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) falling 3% after Galaxy Digital unveiled GalaxyOne, a new crypto trading platform that mirrors Robinhood's core offering. The announcement sent Galaxy Digital (GLXY) shares up 7%, as investors bet on the firm's move to compete directly in the crypto brokerage space.

Elsewhere, crypto-linked companies including Coinbase (COIN), Circle (CRCL) and Michael Saylor's parent company Strategy (MTSR) all closed roughly 2% higher. Their performance aligned with broader gains in the crypto market, where the CoinDesk 20 Index showed most cryptos saw modest upward moves.

The biggest gains came from mining stocks, which surged on news that OpenAI struck a deal to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of AI chips from AMD. The deal could give OpenAI up to a 10% stake in the chipmaker, a move that sent ripples through other AI-exposed sectors.

Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Cleanspark (CLSK) each gained around 10%, driven by optimism around data center demand and possibly boosted further by bitcoin's rally earlier in the day.

Bitcoin's rally is ""fueled by a perfect storm of macroeconomic tailwinds,"" said Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of Deribit, the options trading venue that was recently acquired by Coinbase (COIN).

The U.S. government shutdown is driving debasement trades into perceived hard assets such as gold and BTC, strong inflows into BTC ETFs coupled with dwindling spot supplies on exchanges are feeding a ""self-reinforcing bull cycle,"" he said in a Monday update.

The technicals also point higher, he added, with BTC's double-bottom breakout pointing to short-term targets of $128,000–$130,000, with possible upside to $138,000. However, he also warned of currently overbought conditions, suggesting that a brief shakeout to $118,000–$120,000 remains possible.

""From here, watch for volatility spikes and any shift in put volume as a red flag for near-term corrections,"" Péquignot said. ""Bulls have their eyes on $130K+, and bears might find opportunities in overbought squeezes.""

You can imagine a post-auth Redis vulnerability being deceptively well-exposed, because web apps often give partial control of the Redis key space to attackers, and don't care how long you make your strings. But this one is a UAF that requires attackers to send a malicious Lua script.

Like, the lua scripting feature is there for developers to write static trusted lua, check it in, and run transactional stuff etc, and so anyone uploading arbitrary user code as a script is already wildly outside of a normal use of redis.Seems wild that something which requires using the thing wrong, and also which impacts close to 0 real deployments of the thing, gets a CVSS 10.

Do you have your redis exposed without any authentication on the public internet?If you do either of those, sure, this is bad for you.I've worked with quite a few redis setups and know the details of even more, I do not know a single redis setup which would be vulnerable to this.I've never heard a single instance of someone deciding that redis's lua sandbox is secure enough that they'll let their users upload arbitrary lua code and run it, and trust the lua sandbox to keep that redis box safe.Like, because it's a use-after-free in the lua environment which requires a malicious lua script, this is just such a giant nothing-burger to me and every redis setup I've ever used, all of which only run trusted lua scripts.

Now that Amazon owns James Bond outright after its landmark deal with producers Barbara and Michael G. Wilson, people have been bracing for just what the streamer might have planned for the character beyond Denis Villeneuve's new movie. Endless spinoffs for Prime Video? No… movie posters where the gun-toting spy has had his license to kill revoked by Photoshop.

Last week people began noticing that Prime Video in the UK—now one of the premiere platforms to view the Bond series digitally—had begun updating its assets for the films with new posters, each depicting the relevant Bond posed on a generic colored background with the ‘007' logo on it, and their respective titles. Nothing too exciting, until you looked closer and realized that Amazon had digitally altered some of them to remove Bond's gun.

""Just being disarming, darling""https://t.co/41P6Tkg2PK pic.twitter.com/KQQYif7d0q

— MI6 HQ (@jamesbondlive) October 3, 2025



Not all of the promotional imagery used in the refresh was based on production stills of an armed Bond, but multiple were, and all were digitally manipulated to remove them. As Bond fansite MI6 HQ spotted, Roger Moore's arms were lengthened on the poster for A View to a Kill so his weapon-holding hand was erased from sight. In others, the guns were simply airbrushed out of the Bonds' hands, leaving the awkward imagery of Bond seemingly gripping something that wasn't there anymore, or, in the case of Pierce Brosnan on the poster for Goldeneye, looking like he's in the middle of making a rude gesture at you.

It's a ludicrous idea, given that Bond is a character known for his gunmanship. From the whole concept of the license to kill granted to 00 agents, to the iconic gun barrel title motifs, even to his trademark Walther PPK and P99 in later films, the fact that James Bond shoots people is not an unknown nor a controversial trait. While Bond media has tried to downplay in parts certain aspects of the character over the years (like his drinking, smoking, and general womanizing), you can't really downplay the fact that James Bond kills people, and trying to do so even in such a silly way as photoshopping pistols out of movie posters is only going to get you endlessly mocked.

And endlessly mocked Amazon was, with some decrying that this was a sign of the future of the franchise under the company's complete creative ownership. But it's not the first time recently that a streamer has updated a poster to remove weaponry from sight—when Disney brought Thunderbolts to Disney+ over the summer, it advertised the Marvel movie's arrival with a poster that edited the team's guns (and the character of Taskmaster entirely) out of their hands, leaving them all weirdly pointing trigger fingers at each other.

We'd have to wait until whenever Denis Villeneuve's Bond movie arrives to see if people's worst fears about Amazon will come to light, but again, it's unlikely to the point of absurdity that the new Bond is a pacifist: we recently heard rumors that the movie could focus on a younger Bond's mission to earn that 00 agent status, a process which has historically required killing multiple people. Although Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment from io9 about the new posters, Variety notes that after this weekend's celebration of Bond Day on October 5 (marking the anniversary of Dr. No‘s debut), Prime Video UK quietly updated the key art for the Bond franchise to revert them back to stills from the movies—albeit all with stills where Bond just happens to not actually be carrying a gun this time.

Get a high-performing mid-range GPU with 16GB of VRAM for just $540


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


VRAM is one of the most important factors when choosing a graphics card, and ASRock's latest RX 9070 16 GB Challenger graphics card has plenty of it. The RDNA 4 GPU is $50 off its normal price at Newegg, making it as cheap as the more affordable RTX 5070 graphics cards on the market. Best of all, the RX 9070 has more VRAM than the RTX 5070 (12GB), making this deal quite enticing if you are in the market for a graphics card in this price range.

The Challenger version is technically ASRock's cheapest 9070 offering, but it doesn't skimp on much, boasting a beefy triple-fan cooling system, with a nickel-plated copper base, Japanese capacitors, and a 2-ounce copper PCB.

The ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is $50 off, featuring competitive 1080p and 1440p gaming performance with its 4,096 shader cores and 16GB of VRAM.

The RX 9070 16GB is AMD's latest mid-range GPU, based on the RDNA 4 architecture. The GPU can provide a competent gaming experience at 1080p or 1440p, thanks to its 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM wired to a 256-bit interface.

In our benchmarks, the RX 9070 16GB often outperforms the RTX 5070, particularly in rasterization benchmarks. For example, at 4K native resolution, the RX 9070 beats the RTX 5070 by 11% in our 16-game rasterization-only geomean.

The extra 4GB of VRAM further helps the RX 9070 in memory-bound titles. Games are getting more and more demanding, and while 12GB of VRAM can generally get you by in most games, we are starting to see that amount being a limiting factor when pushing ultra settings. 16GB gives you more memory overhead, and is a capacity that is capable of enabling modern high-performance GPUs to run any game today at maximum settings at 4K resolution.

If you want a more in-depth comparison, check out our RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 face-off.

At $549, the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is an excellent deal in a market where GPU sales don't often exceed 5% of the GPU's value. With the discount, the RDNA 4 GPU is priced as low as Nvidia's cheapest RTX 5070 12GB partner models on sale today.

Increased intake of two fermentable fibers, inulin and beta-glucan, was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing Crohn's disease (CD) among first-degree relatives of patients with the condition.

“We found that two specific fiber types [inulin and beta-glucan] are associated with a reduced risk of future development of Crohn's disease, each associated with around a 30% reduction in risk, in conjunction with preserved gut barrier function indicating that we have a potential tool to prevent the risk of developing Crohn's disease in high-risk populations,” said study lead Williams Turpin, PhD,a translational research scientist at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada, who presented the study. 

The study was conducted by researchers from the Crohn's and Colitis Canada GEM Project and affiliated institutions. Findings were presented at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2025.

The cohort comprised young first-degree relatives of CD patients, which may limit generalizability. Dietary intake was self-reported, and causality cannot be inferred.

Turpin reported no relevant conflicts of interest.

In a matched analysis involving 110 patients with transformed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (TriNHL) and 391 patients with de novo large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), CAR T-cell therapy showed superior outcomes in those with TriNHL, with higher 1-year progression-free survival (55.8% vs 31.7%) and overall survival (72.1% vs 50.7%).

“In conclusion, our matched-comparison study revealed a greater efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy, with a toxicity profile for patients with TriNHL comparable with that for patients with LBCL,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Pierre Stephan, Department of Hemato-Oncology, Hôpital Saint Louis in Paris, France. It was published online in Blood Advances.

President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have developed a close relationship. Here's how their bond is shaping the 2026 World Cup.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The plan started coming together inside a luxury box at MetLife Stadium.

As the Premier League's Chelsea was on its way to a shutout victory at the Club World Cup final in July, President Donald Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino were deep in discussion at the New Jersey sports complex outside New York City on another matter: where the draw for next year's World Cup would be held.

The high-drama spectacle decides which teams will face each other in the group stage of soccer's most prestigious tournament, along with the schedule for competition. It was widely expected to unfold in Las Vegas, home to the 1994 draw when the U.S. last hosted the World Cup and a natural backdrop for glitz. But since at least March, officials had privately discussed bringing the draw to Washington, home to a showman president who regularly hugs the spotlight associated with sports. 

So during that July match in the stadium that will also host the final game of next year's World Cup, Trump and Infantino agreed to get going on holding the draw in the U.S. capital — namely, the Kennedy Center, another institution that Trump reshaped to his liking.

“During that Club World Cup final, there was a real seriousness to well, look, if we're going to do this, we've got to do it now,” Andrew Giuliani, executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told The Associated Press. “That's when talks heated up between the president and Mr. Infantino in terms of getting this done.”




The collaboration over the draw, slated for Dec. 5, illustrates the bond that has formed between Trump and Infantino, described by the U.S. president as “probably the most respected man in sports.” The relationship will come into even sharper focus as the World Cup approaches, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

Tickets are now open to fans as major questions hang over the tournament, including how welcome visitors from some countries will be in the U.S. amid its immigration crackdown. Even as the White House pledges openness, Trump has added another uncertainty by suggesting he could move games from cities he thinks are unsafe. 

Despite his affinity for sports, Trump is known more for his ties to golf and football than soccer. But his awareness of the sport was spurred in part by his youngest son, Barron, who is such a soccer fan that he had a net in the first lady's garden during Trump's first term. 

Trump's interest only grew when the U.S. won World Cup hosting rights in 2018. Nothing excites Trump like hosting a major event, and Giuliani recalled that, at the time, the president and his aides were almost wistful that he wouldn't be in the White House when the tournament arrived, assuming he would be well into a post-presidency following an immediate second term.

Shortly after the U.S. was awarded the tournament, Trump hosted Infantino at the White House. Infantino, who was also serving his first term as FIFA president, made an impression by handing Trump red and yellow penalty cards, joking they could be used on the press. 

The relationship flourished in 2020 as both men plotted their futures. 

During a dinner that January at the global economic summit in Davos, near FIFA's home in Zurich, Infantino called the U.S. president “my great friend.” Trump, always appreciative of a compliment, responded by inviting Infantino to a White House signing event for the Abraham Accords, which sought to normalize diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab countries. 

The ceremony happened as Infantino was aligning FIFA's sporting and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It followed a pattern of Infantino, much like Trump, cozying up to autocratic leaders. 

Infantino appeared to relish public meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin before, during and after that country hosted the 2018 World Cup. Visiting Putin at the Kremlin with a group of soccer greats during the tournament, Infantino said he felt “like a child in a toy shop” in Russia. He collected the Russian Order of Friendship from Putin the following year.

Infantino would later relocate to Doha ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, emerging as a strong defender of the tiny Gulf state that was fiercely criticized for its treatment of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers needed to build essential stadiums, transport projects and hotels.

As the connection between Trump and Infantino deepened, Joe Biden dashed Trump's hopes of staying in the White House. For the next four years, Infantino's ties to Washington were far more limited. The two leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November 2022, a fleeting moment FIFA captured with one photo on its website.

Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff also met with Infantino when he traveled for the Women's World Cup in July 2023. 

Preparations for the World Cup under Biden were under the radar by design, according to one senior official for that administration who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Even though the administration had its own World Cup 2026 task force, Biden aides were aware of sensitivities surrounding large gatherings so soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Biden White House was also careful not to overtly promote a relationship with FIFA, which had sidelined the U.S. Soccer Federation in its traditional role in coordinating a home World Cup. Instead, it negotiates individually with each of the 11 U.S. host cities on security, ticketing and other matters. 

Infantino visited the White House while Biden was president at least once, meeting for about an hour in 2024 with then-national security adviser Jake Sullivan, an avid soccer fan. Biden officials emphasized to Infantino that they wanted to ensure the host cities ultimately benefited from holding World Cup matches and that the U.S.'s human rights values would be respected.

Trump's disappointment about missing out on the World Cup would prove to be unfounded after he was elected to a second, nonconsecutive term last year.

Since that victory, Infantino's embrace of Trump has been gushing. He promptly congratulated him the day after Election Day, was at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's South Florida club, during the presidential transition and had a prime seat at his January inauguration. Trump called Infantino a “winner” in a video played at the Miami draw for the Club World Cup in December, which was attended by daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Meanwhile, FIFA has set up shop at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where Infantino worked last month as world leaders gathered nearby for the annual United Nations General Assembly. Infantino and Trump met again last week in New York, along with first lady Melania Trump, according to the FIFA president's Instagram account. 

Infantino has teased the idea of Trump doing the draw himself, which Giuliani called the “MAGA-FIFA World Cup draw.” 

“Just like a great opera, there will be high drama,” Giuliani said. 

Infantino has had more public appearances with Trump than with any soccer officials from the sport's heartlands of Europe and South America, according to the FIFA leader's schedule and social media posts. He was late for his own FIFA Congress in Paraguay in May because he was with Trump and the Saudi crown prince in the Middle East, a move seen as disrespectful of his own voters and criticized by Europe's soccer federations.

During Infantino's most recent appearance at Trump's side in the Oval Office on Aug. 22, he took even some fellow soccer officials by surprise when he gifted a gold replica World Cup trophy to the U.S. president, saying it was “for winners only.” 

That handover was unexpected, according to one senior soccer official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive dynamics. Even though it was a replica, the moment was still seen as a snub of World Cup tradition because Trump has held onto a trophy that is supposed to belong to the sport as a whole, not an individual person.

A White House official said the trophy remains in the White House's possession. 

No such offer was publicly extended by FIFA to Mexico's President Claudia Scheinbaum or Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney. Infantino has not met with Carney this year and met Sheinbaum for the first time on Aug. 29.

The episode is a reminder of how Infantino can shift with the moment. The man who remarked in Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in November 2022 that “today, I feel (like) a migrant worker” — comments interpreted as solidarity with migrants — was laughing along with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem earlier this year as they bantered about migrants being unable to scale the repainted wall on the U.S. southern border.

Infantino has framed his close relationship with Trump as “crucial” to the success of the World Cup, a massive operation that relies on expansive cooperation with federal, state and local governments. Trump's suggestion that he could move the host cities was a reminder that Infantino is working with a famously impulsive president whose whims could expose FIFA to logistical havoc and legal jeopardy if he followed through. 

Even without those threats, those involved with World Cup planning said the tournament's stakes are high because it's the first in a series of global sporting events hosted by the U.S., including the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

“This needs to go well in order to show the world that if you want to have the best sports and entertainment events, you want to have them in the United States,” said Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee. “I don't think it's unusual for a White House to be coordinating and be involved, and I don't think it's unusual for the heads of state and for the president to be excited and to be talking about a mega event coming here.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","With Sabalenka's Greek getaway over, her Wuhan fortress awaits","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4376956/with-sabalenkas-greek-getaway-over-her-wuhan-fortress-awaits","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 13:43:50 GMT","

After embracing “work-life balance” with a sun-soaked recovery in Greece, Aryna Sabalenka is back where she never loses, chasing a fourth consecutive Wuhan title and another slice of WTA history.

Clutching her racquet bag, Aryna Sabalenka posed coyly in a grove of pine trees with the caption “Work life balance” punctuated with a smiling emoji.

The rest of the recent Instagram post followed that theme: Sabalenka unwinding by the Mediterranean Sea in off-court mode, her team in the gym and sweeping scenic shots from a Greek resort.

After winning her second straight title at the US Open last month, the World No. 1 mixed business with pleasure while most of her colleagues on the Hologic WTA Tour descended on Beijing for the first of back-to-back WTA 1000 events in China. Sabalenka, nursing a “minor injury” sustained in New York, withdrew from the opener.

“I feel good,” Sabalenka told reporters on Sunday in Wuhan. “I just didn't want to rush my body into the tournament. So I think we made the right decision to take extra time for recovery and for the preparation. Physically, I feel ready to go.”

Sabalenka has been better than a “go” in her three previous campaigns at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, winning titles in 2018, 2019 and again last year. In the last two matches, she defeated Coco Gauff and Zheng Qinwen -- who went on to play the championship match at the WTA Finals in Riyadh -- to run her record to a dazzling 17-0 in this city by the Yangtze River.

That makes her a three-time defending champion and owner of the finest run of dominance at a single WTA event since Serena Williams won 21 straight in Rome from 2012-19.

She's absorbing the culture here. On Saturday, she learned to cook fried rice (she wants to take some back home to Florida) and marveled at the pink lavender fields while driving to the Optics Valley International Tennis Centre.

The eighth edition of the Wuhan Open opened on Monday. Founded in 2014, this WTA 1000 event returned to action in 2024 after a four-year hiatus. This tournament features eight of the Top 10 players in the PIF WTA Rankings and a loaded 64-player draw in a one-week format.

The not-so-secret subtext: A handful of players are still in contention for the remaining three singles spots in the PIF WTA Finals in Riyadh.

Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva, who lost in the Round of 16 to Sonay Kartal in Beijing, are in the best position. The eighth and final position could well go to Elena Rybakina or Jasmine Paolini, depending on who goes deeper in Wuhan.

Later this month, Sabalenka will reach 52 consecutive weeks as the PIF WTA Rankings No. 1 player. She's won more matches (56), more titles (four) and more money ($12 million) this year than any other woman. Sabalenka, who reached three major finals and all four semifinals, has a nearly 2,500-point lead over Iga Swiatek in the overall rankings and a 1,500-point edge in the Race to the WTA Finals in Riyadh.

Sabalenka has a potentially challenging path. She'll play the winner of the first-round match between Rebecca Sramkova and Anna Kalinskaya in her first match in more than a month. Based on seeding, she'd see No. 8 Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals, No. 4 Amanda Anisimova in the semifinals and No. 2 Iga Swiatek in the final. Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka and Beijing finalist Linda Noskova (unseeded) are also in her quarter of the draw.

Seven years ago, at the age of 20, Sabalenka was the youngest Wuhan winner to date. Her success there represents the first time a WTA player has won three straight editions of the same WTA 1000 since Serena Williams hit the trifecta in Miami from 2013-15. In the 17 years they've been contesting 1000s, no woman has ever scored a four-peat.

Only three women have ever won four consecutive titles at a single WTA event across the past three decades: Monica Seles at the Canadian Open (1995-1998), Venus Williams in New Haven (1999-2002) and Caroline Wozniacki in New Haven (2008-2011).

Sabalenka would love to become the fourth.

“Am I confident about winning for the fourth time?” she mused during her opening press conference. “I don't know about that, but I can assure you that I will do my best, and hopefully I can claim this beautiful title again.”

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

George Russell put in an impressive performance to take victory in the Singapore Grand Prix, while McLaren brought home the Teams' Championship.

George Russell has claimed a dominant victory in the Singapore Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver converting pole position into a flawless win ahead of Max Verstappen and Lando Norris, while McLaren scored enough points to seal the 2025 Teams' Championship.

Russell had led cleanly away from P1 on the grid as the race got underway, while the battle behind saw Norris clip the rear of Verstappen's Red Bull and bang wheels with team mate Oscar Piastri, the Briton subsequently getting past his team mate in a close scrap.

While Piastri voiced his unhappiness at how the incident had played out, Russell continued to lead up ahead in a commanding performance, the Silver Arrows driver proving unchallenged as he stormed to his second win of the season and fifth career triumph.

Verstappen had a fight on his hands to keep P2 as Norris chased him down during the final stages, but the Red Bull driver defended well to maintain the position. And while Norris had to settle for third – with Piastri behind in fourth – it was enough for McLaren to become Teams' Champions for a second consecutive season.

Kimi Antonelli enjoyed a strong drive to claim fifth, adding to Mercedes' tally, while Charles Leclerc claimed sixth ahead of Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton. However, the seven-time World Champion was noted for exceeding track limits after the chequered flag fell and picked up a five-second penalty post race, dropping him to eighth.

Race results

FORMULA 1 SINGAPORE AIRLINES SINGAPORE GRAND PRIX 2025

Fernando Alonso, who had just missed out on overtaking Hamilton at the finish, was promoted to seventh place as a result of Hamilton's demotion. Ollie Bearman clinched two points for Haas in P9, with Carlos Sainz bouncing back after Williams' double disqualification from Qualifying to round out the top 10.

Isack Hadjar was 11th for Racing Bulls, with the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda following in 12th ahead of Aston Martin's Lance Stroll in 13th. Alex Albon had to settle for 14th, while Liam Lawson claimed 15th in the other Racing Bulls machine.

In a race that saw no retirements, the order was completed by Alpine's Franco Colapinto (P16), Gabriel Bortoleto for Kick Sauber (P17), Haas' Esteban Ocon (P18), the Alpine of Pierre Gasly (P19) and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg (P20).

After a busy Qualifying session saw Russell claim a surprise pole position – beating Verstappen and Piastri in the process – the paddock reconvened on Sunday ready for the 62-lap Singapore Grand Prix.

A few changes had been made to the starting order in the build-up to the race, with the first being due to the disqualification of both Williams drivers from Qualifying after the rear wing on each car failed DRS slot gap checks.

As a result, Sainz would line up at the back of the grid, while Albon was confirmed to start from the pit lane due to the team opting to modify his suspension settings. Also starting from the pit lane was Gasly, with Alpine having changed the floor on his car as well as the suspension set-up under parc ferme conditions.

With rain having fallen at the Marina Bay Street Circuit earlier on Sunday, questions remained over the weather forecast in the run-up to lights out. While the drizzle seemed to have stopped as start time approached, the teams and drivers would doubtless be keeping a close eye on conditions during another humid night in Singapore, with sections of the track remaining damp.

Once all 20 drivers had assembled and the tyre blankets were removed, it was confirmed that the majority would start on the medium tyre, with the exceptions being Verstappen, Hadjar, Alonso, Tsunoda, Stroll and Colapinto on the soft compound.

Once the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out, Russell made a strong start from pole, holding the lead from Verstappen as the McLaren pair of Piastri and Norris went side-by-side, with an aggressive Norris finding a way past his team mate to move up into third.

“That wasn't very team like,” a disgruntled Piastri reported over the radio, while Norris had picked up damage to his front wing to leave the endplate hanging off. Replays showed that the Briton had clipped the rear of Verstappen's Red Bull before then banging wheels with the other McLaren.

Elsewhere Leclerc had gained a position on Antonelli to run in fifth, with Hamilton in seventh ahead of Alonso, Hadjar and Bearman. A potential collision between the latter two was noted by the stewards, though no further investigation was deemed necessary.

This also was the case for the incident between Norris and Piastri, but the latter was keen to hear whether the team would choose to take any action. The championship leader was subsequently informed that the incident would be discussed after the race, leading Piastri to respond: “That's not fair.”

Up ahead, Russell had built up a lead of over four seconds from Verstappen as the race reached the Lap 10 mark, the Dutchman going on to report difficulties with the downshifts on his RB21. Norris, meanwhile, was a further 1.5s back as he tried to hunt down the Red Bull.

Further back, a gap of more than seven seconds had developed between seventh-placed Hamilton and Alonso in P8, with Hadjar hot on the tail of the Aston Martin. But as Lap 14 arrived, attentions turned to the pit lane as Tsunoda and Bortoleto became the first drivers to stop, the latter having picked up damage to his front wing endplate from earlier contact during Lap 1.

Back out on track, Norris clipped the wall but looked to have avoided any damage, while Antonelli seemed to be experiencing a steering issue down the straights during his first F1 race in Singapore.

The McLaren pit crew appeared to be readying themselves for a Norris stop on Lap 18, only for the Briton to be told to stay out on track instead. But just two laps later, Red Bull brought Verstappen in for the hard tyres, the Dutchman emerging back on track in seventh ahead of Alonso. How would Norris and McLaren respond?

Leclerc was the next frontrunner to pit on Lap 22, also for the hard compound. This initially put him in P10 behind Hulkenberg, but it did not take long for the Ferrari to overtake. As for Verstappen, the World Champion was informed that he was free to push, leading him to respond: “Everything is working against me this race.”

At the front, Russell admitted that his tyres were struggling, his lead still remaining at just under nine seconds from Norris. Hamilton, meanwhile, pitted for the hard tyres after being chased down by Verstappen – only to experience a slightly slow stop, with a delay on the front right bringing him out in P9.

Russell was the next to stop with Antonelli following as part of a double stack, bringing the former race leader out into third. Over at McLaren, Norris was asked if he would be happy for Piastri to pit before him to protect from Leclerc, but the Briton's response was a “no”.

With this seeing Norris pit first, Piastri inherited the lead of the race. The Australian was subsequently called to pit but an issue with the left rear resulted in another slow stop at 5.2s, the McLaren then returning to the track in fourth.

Another driver to experience a delay during their visit to the pits was Alonso, the Spaniard dropping down to P15 as a result. Also experiencing problems was Hadjar, with the Frenchman left frustrated by an engine issue on his Racing Bulls as he circulated in P14.

As the race reached its halfway point on Lap 31, Russell led Verstappen by more than three seconds, ahead of Norris, Piastri, Leclerc, Antonelli, Hamilton – all of whom had stopped – Lawson, Stroll and Sainz, the latter three yet to pit.

Verstappen was not giving up in P2, however. The Red Bull driver – on a track that he has never previously claimed victory at – looked to be cutting into the gap to Russell. Elsewhere, Antonelli was looking quick in P6, while Sainz was chasing down Stroll for P9, the Aston Martin driver impressively still running the soft tyres.

That charge from Verstappen hit a snag when the Dutch driver locked his front tyre on Lap 37, narrowly avoiding contact with the barriers whilst losing two seconds to Russell, prompting a sweary response from Verstappen over the radio.

Elsewhere Alonso was engaged in a feisty battle with Hadjar, the Spaniard getting past before radioing in: “Trophy for the hero of the race!” His team mate Stroll, meanwhile, finally pitted for the medium tyres, emerging back on track in last place.

“The rear is like a handbrake,” a struggling Verstappen reported on Lap 40 as he sought help for the issue – just as Norris looked to be closing in on the Red Bull, the margin coming down to just under 1.5s.

It was not all smooth sailing for Norris, however, with replays showing the McLaren man having a moment that saw him just avoid hitting the wall. Further back there were plenty of squabbles playing out, as Albon locked up during a scrap with Alonso while Colapinto fought with Hulkenberg, an incident that was noted by the stewards.

There was further trouble for Hulkenberg on Lap 45 after spinning off the track at Turn 7, briefly triggering the yellow flags before the Kick Sauber got going again, rejoining at the back of the pack.

Russell vented his frustration as he approached the backmarkers, the Mercedes driver calling for blue flags as he shouted: “Get out of the way!” The gap back to Verstappen remained at 4.4s – but, crucially, Norris was now only around half a second behind the Red Bull man with 15 laps remaining.

Back in fourth, Piastri seemed disgruntled as he sarcastically commented: “This race is so much fun.” The Australian was told that opportunities remained during the race, all while Norris continued to chase Verstappen.

Hamilton, meanwhile, pitted for soft tyres as he emerged in seventh into fresh air, while others to make late stops included Lawson and Sainz, dropping both further down the order.

Elsewhere Antonelli snatched P5 from Leclerc – just as Hamilton was also closing in on the Monegasque, with the team then opting to allow the seven-time World Champion through to chase the Mercedes ahead.

With just a few laps to go, Norris was still trying to catch Verstappen, the scrap allowing Piastri to close the gap down to 3.1s. And while the gap closed further in the next few tours, it did not seem to be enough for the Australian to get involved in the battle.

There were problems for Hamilton who reported issues with his brakes, leading Ferrari to swap their drivers back around. But there were no such troubles for his former team mate Russell, who crossed the line by 5.430s from Verstappen to take victory.

Despite Norris' best attempts, Verstappen held on to cross the line in second place, but Norris' P3 – and Piastri's P4 – were enough for McLaren to wrap up the Teams' Championship for a second consecutive year.

Antonelli claimed fifth place, with the Ferrari pair of Leclerc and Hamilton following in sixth and seventh respectively on the road, though it was confirmed after the race that Hamilton's five-second penalty for exceeding track limits would drop him down a place.

Alonso rose to seventh while Bearman and Sainz completed the top 10 as Hadjar just missed out in P11. The Frenchman was followed by Tsunoda, Stroll, Albon, Lawson, Colapinto, Bortoleto, Ocon, Gasly and Hulkenberg, all 20 cars reaching the finish line in Singapore.

""It feels amazing, especially after what happened a couple of years ago,"" said Russell. ""That was a bit of a missed opportunity, but we more than made up for it today. I'm so grateful for the team, they did an amazing job this whole weekend. We don't really know where this performance came from, but I'm really happy.""

F1 will next travel to Austin for the United States Grand Prix, which takes place over the weekend of October 17-19. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Radio Rewind: 2025 Singapore Grand Prix

2025 Singapore Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Singapore was more than just tense racing. From championship celebrations and full-circle moments to special lids and post-race exhaustion - the weekend was memorable.

The 2025 Singapore Grand Prix provided the goods yet again. George Russell produced a masterclass to finally conquer the Singapore streets, whilst McLaren secured their second Constructors' Championship victory in a row. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen closed in again on the papaya duo for the Drivers' title with his tenacious defence against Lando Norris.

The on-track drama delivered under the Singapore night sky, but aside from the racing action, the city played host to numerous notable moments – from papaya-coloured championship celebrations and wholesome full circle moments to special edition helmets – the magic of Formula 1's original night race truly lives on.

George Russell's maiden Singapore victory was special for several reasons; after some painful results over the past couple of visits – including that last lap crash in 2023 after running P3 – but one specific post-race celebration  highlighted how this win meant that little bit more.

Reminiscing on Instagram, the Brit explained how back in 2018 he was at Marina Bay as a junior driver, and watched Lewis Hamilton produce one of the most famous laps in Formula 1 history during Qualifying, before going on to win the Grand Prix in a fantastic weekend for the team. Hamilton celebrated that night with a photo sat cross-legged on the track beside his trophy – an image that clearly stuck with Russell. Seven years later, he found himself in the same position, this time as a five-time race winner, and recreated the iconic pose in tribute. He won't be forgetting this win for a while!

It wasn't just George Russell celebrating in Singapore – McLaren had plenty to cheer about as well. The team sealed the 2025 Constructors' Championship for the second time in two years and did it in style under the glittering lights of Marina Bay.

Despite some tense moments between Drivers' title challengers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in the early stages of the race, the post-race mood was all smiles as the papaya squad declared on social media that they were “painting Singapore papaya.” From team photos to trophy shots and plenty of orange confetti, the celebrations underlined just how far McLaren have come in a few years and how much this title means to everyone in the garage and back in Woking.

It's no surprise that Singapore is the only race on the calendar that the drivers specifically prepare for given the brutal mix of blistering heat, sweltering humidity, and the constant cornering around the Marina Bay Circuit.

Post-race the scenes in parc ferme told the story: the exhausted podium-placers were sprawled on the floor ahead of the podium ceremony, dousing themselves with water over themselves to fight the intense heat. Hydration is vital here, with competitors able to lose up to 4kg in body weight over the course of the race. For many on the grid, survival is almost as big a victory as the points on Sunday night in Singapore.

The spectacle of Singapore is always sure to attract a glittering mix of celebrities to enjoy the action, and 2025 proved to be a star-studded affair. Spice Girls' Mel C enjoyed a sweet reunion with Romeo Beckham, the son of her bandmate Victoria, bumping into him ahead of the Grand Prix during her DJ set on the grid. Musical fans were out in force: Dutch DJ Martin Garrix was there to support his friend Max Verstappen, while singer Lewis Capaldi brought his brother along for a high-speed weekend as well as taking to the stage for the post-race concert. Over in the Mercedes garage, Jack Whitehall, the co-host of F1 75 Live back in February, soaked up George Russell's victory from a prime position.

Beyond those faces, the Singapore entertainment lineup added more sparkle: The Smashing Pumpkins headlined, with other stars such as Superman (a.k.a. David Corenswet), JJ Lin, Vernon and Dino from SEVENTEEN, ENHYPEN, BABYMETAL, G-DRAGON and Alan Walker in attendance, creating a true festival atmosphere alongside the night-race action.

Singapore has become a favourite stop on the calendar for many of the drivers, and the night race often inspires them to bring out special edition helmet designs and showcasing a bit of personality under the visor. This year was no different, as Yuki Tsunoda teamed up with artist Verdy on a colourful cartoon-style design, whilst race-winner George Russell debuted a striking blue chrome helmet created in partnership with the Blue Marine Foundation. Lewis Hamilton added some sparkle under the lights with a glittering gold design, and Alex Albon paid tribute to his roots with a Thailand-inspired lid in collaboration with UNICEF.

The first music video from Swift's new album premiered in movie theaters, but wasn't available to watch at home until Sunday night.

Taylor Swift‘s “The Fate of Ophelia” music video is now streaming on YouTube, following an exclusive early release to movie theaters in the U.S. on Friday (Oct. 3).

	Written and directed by Swift herself, the music video for “The Fate of Ophelia” made it online Sunday night (Oct. 5). The reference-filled visual has the pop star playing several parts, or showing several sides — among them the once ill-fated Ophelia of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, the lead in a Golden Age Hollywood movie musical, a frontwoman to a 1960s girl group, and the modern Swift showgirl that audiences know and love.

	Of course, Swift's single imagines an Ophelia who makes her way out of a destined tragic ending.


	In the accompanying music video (seen below), Swift crawls out of an on-set version of a Sir John Everett Millais painting circa the 1850s that famously depicts Ophelia's drowning. She performs different iterations of a “Fate of Ophelia” show — in homage to the likenesses of Marilyn Monroe in one scene and Ronnie Spector/The Ronettes in another, and center soundstage in an Anything Goes-inspired ensemble — and ends up soaking in her bathtub by the clip's end. She's presumably exhausted after playing all the parts, but still quite alive.


	“The Fate of Ophelia” music video wraps with the image that became the official album cover for Swift's newly released The Life of a Showgirl.

	











	Earlier on Sunday, Swift's team posted a short interview clip that has the singer-songwriter explaining how the album art came to be.


	“There was this moment in the photo shoot [with photographers Mert Alaş and Marcus Piggott] right at the end of the day, the last setup, I'm in this bathtub in this bedazzled dress,” she said. “They take my picture. I see it on the monitor. I see it pop up. Even though it was at the weirdest angle, and I'm in the bathtub, I'm just like, ‘That's the cover.' And it was.”


	She added, “I went and looked at the picture like, ‘Yeah. That's it.' I think it represents to me that you've done all this work, you've done a three-and-a-half hour show, you've done the lead-up to it, you've done the warm-ups, you've gotten through it. Anything that could've gone wrong, you sidestepped. You finally get back, what do you do? You take a bath.”


	“That's what I do in those situations,” she said. “It's like that moment of relaxation. That moment the cameras are down, the lights are off. What do you have to say? What's your story? Who are you then? That's really the story of this album.”

Opening-day album sales for The Life of a Showgirl, as reported by data tracking firm Luminate, reached 2.7 million on its first day of release (Oct. 3). That tally counts traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album. It marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991; Adele currently holds the largest sales week with 25. Further news of Showgirl‘s first-week building sales and streaming activity will be available in the coming days.

	











	“The Fate of Ophelia” music video was first shown in theaters as part of The Release Party of a Showgirl, Swift's theatrical event that opened at No. 1 at the box office this weekend. The screening featured the music video premiere and behind-the-scenes footage from making it, plus Swift's commentary on all 12 songs from The Life of a Showgirl and a first viewing of each track's lyric video. It also revealed an unexpected co-star appearing in “The Fate of Ophelia” video: a loaf of Swift's homemade sourdough bread.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Paramount officially owns The Free Press","https://www.avclub.com/paramount-owns-free-press-bari-weiss-cbs-news","Mon, 06 Oct 2025 17:35:00 GMT","

“Paramount bought The Free Press“ is a chilling statement no matter how you slice it. This time, however, we're specifically talking about The Free Press, a Substack newsletter started by cancel culture warrior and former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss, which the company just bought for millions of dollars. Weiss, who has proudly claimed the labels “radical centrist” and “Zionist fanatic” (per The New York Times) and has many times railed about how to fight back against “woke” culture, will officially be the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. 

CEO David Ellison is unsurprisingly thrilled about Weiss' appointment. In a memo to staff on Monday, Ellison wrote that Weiss will help the network broaden its audience and maintain a “constructive, respectful and bipartisan dialogue” in its work, per TheWrap. “Our mission is clear: to ensure that this global platform remains a place where people can seek the truth, gain understanding and engage with the facts. That is our purpose,” he continued. He also suggested that the temperature of the discourse “feels higher than ever,” and that a space “once reserved for thoughtful dialogue has been consumed by partisan division and hostile disputes.” Despite all this gesturing towards bipartisanship, Ellison has made it pretty clear which side of the division he would favor if these disputes ever came to a head. Along these lines, it's not surprising that he praised Weiss as a “perfect fit” for CBS' news division in his memo, lauding her “passion for reaching broad audiences through rigorous, fact-based reporting and a relentless commitment to amplifying voices from all corners of the spectrum.” 

Weiss has had a wholly untraditional rise to this high-ranking position. As The New York Times, her former outlet, points out, “In its nearly 100 years, CBS has not seen a leader quite like Ms. Weiss. Neither has the media industry.” Weiss moved her reporting to Substack, where she initially launched a newsletter titled Common Sense, after publicly resigning as an opinion writer and editor at NYT in 2020. Since its founding in 2021, The Free Press has grown to reach more than 1.5 million readers and generates a reported $15 million in annual subscription revenue. While exact financial details were not disclosed, TheWrap reports that Paramount acquired the website for as much as $150 million in a cash and stock deal, but it will continue to publish independent reporting, podcasts, and more during the transition. In a statement to NYT, Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie said this deal is a “strong recognition that we're in a new generation of media now.” 

If that is indeed true, Weiss wants CBS News to be at its forefront. In her own memo to staff, she said she'd like to hear from employees about what is and isn't working at the company currently, as well as how to make CBS News “the most trusted news organization in America and the world.” (They may not be the most forthcoming right now, however. Ellison is reportedly planning to lay off up to 10 percent of the newsroom's staff during this changing of the guard.) “I'll approach it the way any reporter would—with an open mind, a fresh notebook and an urgent deadline,” Weiss added. “What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you.”

“General Hospital” fans know that one of the most frequently spoken lines of the series is, “It's Monica's house, Alan gave it to her.” The Quartermaine estate was bought in 1978 by Alan and given to Monica as a wedding present. Nearly every family member, over several generations, has lived on the property with their own growing families.

Now that Monica's memorial has come and gone, and the family has paid their respects to the cornerstone of their family,  it's time for the reading of her will. That leads to the big question: Who will inherit Monica's house?

Monica's history with Tracy Quartermaine spanned 45 years. When Alan decided to make Monica his wife, Tracy refused to believe that she was good enough to be a Quartermaine. Even when she eventually saw the value in Monica, she spent decades refusing to admit it.

At Monica's memorial, Tracy finally admitted just how important her brother's wife had been to her. Tracy shared with the family that while she spent her younger years thinking Monica wasn't good enough, she now understands that she was actually the best of the family.

Tracy believes that Michael will inherit the Q's estate and asked him to allow her to continue living on the property. She won't need permission if her oldest friend leaves the house with her.

Michael Corinthos' connection to his grandmother is undeniable. He has lived at the Qs with his own small children for years, making them all a daily presence in Monica's life. Michael has admitted that one of his biggest regrets was not seeing his grandmother before leaving for work on the day that she died. He would usually check on her and kiss her before leaving the house, and skipped it that day because he was dealing with Willow.

Michael Remains locked in a custody battle with his ex over their two children, Wylie and Amelia. He has always raised his kids on the Quartermaine estate, and he just might inherit the house.

Jason was born out of a relationship that Alan had with Susan Moore in 1981. When he was sick as a baby, Monica was called on to help him, and after doing so, she declared him her son. Their relationship wasn't always good, especially after a head injury wiped out most of Jason's memory. Instead of choosing a more ethical path, he became an enforcer for Sonny Corinthos. To this day, Jason functions as a trained killer, but he balances that out by raising his son, Danny Morgan, under the Q's roof.

When Danny's mom passed away last year, Jason and his son moved into the estate to keep Sam's children close together. That gave Jason daily interaction with Monica, which went a long way to heal their relationship. The love between them became apparent, and it's possible that he could inherit the family home.

Monica may choose to leave the Quartermaine home to a younger couple, one that she views as the future of the family. If that's the case, then she may have picked Brook Lynn and Chase. The couple is still relatively new to marriage, but they seem to embody the qualities that are important to the family's legacy. There is also always a chance that Monica decided to turn the whole family upside down by leaving everything to her usually estranged sister, Ronnie Bard. She just appeared in Port Charles after Monica's passing and was invited to the reading of the will. While many suspect she is looking for a handout, it would be cool if she did inherit the mansion and then give it to Michael. Perhaps she'll realize she doesn't want what they have at all, and if so, Michael is the one Monica talked to her about the most.

Who do you think Monica has left her house to?

Whoopi Goldberg had a peculiar suggestion for Super Bowl attendees to troll Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. While speaking on The View, the actress suggested people bait her by getting a “Latin accent” and a tan after Noem said that ICE would be “all over” the Super Bowl and she also slammed the NFL over Bad Bunny being booked as the headliner.


	“How's she going to know who's who?” asked Goldberg, to which co-host Joy Behar responded, “Because the Supreme Court has given permission to question anyone who has a Spanish accent or who has dark skin. That's why.”


	“Everybody, get a little cocoa butter, sit in the sun, that's the first thing,” Goldberg said during the episode. “And this is the only time you can probably ever do this: Give yourself a Latin accent, and just see if [Noem] can tell who's who.”

	The comments from Goldberg were in response to Noem saying that ICE will be “all over” the 2026 Super Bowl in a recent The Benny Show video. “I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that's what America's about,” Noem said in the interview. “So yeah, we'll be all over that place. We're going to enforce the law.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When asked if she had “any message to the NFL” regarding the organization naming Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime performer, Noem said, “Well, they suck and we'll win, and God will bless us and we'll stand and be proud of ourselves at the end of the day, and they won't be able to sleep at night because they don't know what they believe. And they're so weak, we'll fix it.”

	Bad Bunny addressed the right-wing backlash while hosting Saturday Night Live over the weekend, playing a montage of Fox News hosts saying, “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician, and he should be the next president.”


	 “I'm very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know that people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” the Grammy winner said before continuing in Spanish. He wrapped up his monologue in English: “And if you didn't understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”

The government would bolster its security check system to prevent China from infiltrating the nation's medical cold chain, a national security official said yesterday.

The official, who wished to stay anonymous, made the remarks after the Chinese-language magazine Mirror Media (鏡周刊) reported that Pharma Logistics (嘉里醫藥物流) is in charge of the medical logistics of about half of the nation's major hospitals, including National Taiwan University Hospital and Taipei Veterans General Hospital. 

The company's parent, Kerry TJ Logistics Co (嘉里大榮物流), is associated with the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), the report said.

Pharma Logistics is also one of the key contractors of medical drug distribution in Taipei, New Taipei City and Keelung, it reported, adding that the company's cold chain logistics center in New Taipei City's Sijhih District (汐止) is responsible for the storage and delivery of the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) disease prevention resources.

Kerry Logistics is affiliated with Hong Kong's KLN Logistics Group (香港嘉里物流) and KHL Holding (嘉里控股), and has cross-shareholdings with China's SF Holding Co (中國順豐控股), the magazine said.

SF Holding is China's biggest logistics company, and it acquired Kerry Logistics in 2021, it added.

KHL Holding chairman Kuok Khoon-hua (郭孔華) has been a member of the CPPCC Beijing Municipal Committee since 2023, and his sister Kuok Hui-kwong (郭惠光) is a member of the CPPCC Shanghai Committee, the magazine said.

SF Holding has signed a strategic cooperation agreement with the PLA Air Force, and is incorporated in the logistics network of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) “military-civil fusion” strategy, it added.

In response to concerns about the potential national security threat, the official said that Taiwan would bolster its security check system, prohibit monopolization of critical logistics systems and include key companies that cooperate with the government in its security check system.

Security check systems should be enhanced for critical infrastructures and key industries, especially those associated with societal security resilience, to check for Chinese funding or abnormal connections with China, the official said.

Aside from medical resources, logistics systems are also involved in the distribution of key daily necessities, so monopolies should be banned and solid backup systems must be in place, regardless of whether Chinese infiltration is involved, the official said.

Lastly, while logistics companies only handle commercial logistics in normal times, government agencies should have open-ended contracts with the companies that they normally cooperate with to systematically include them in its security check system and ensure that they are not associated with Chinese funding, the official said.

Tunghai University Center for Mainland China and Regional Development Research deputy director Hung Pu-chao (洪浦釗) yesterday said that the situation poses a national security threat.

Medical logistics is a lifeline during wartime, so if critical cold chain and distribution nodes are controlled by companies that are bound by Chinese law, then Taiwan's healthcare system would be exposed to enemy surveillance, he said.

It is not only a logistics chain management issue, but a vulnerability in the nation's defense resilience, Hung said, adding that the government should classify medical logistics under critical infrastructure, pushing for localization and restricting Chinese funding to prevent external control in times of emergency.

The threat of Chinese infiltration through funding is not only about money, but about information, he said.

China's National Intelligence Law requires companies to cooperate with its intelligence agency, so if they are connected to China or Hong Kong's Internet domain, Taiwan's hospital codes, delivery routes and patients' information could be leaked, Hung said.

This is a highly private information that could result in significant risks, so the government must set up a sovereign defense line for protecting such information, and ensure medical logistics information remains in Taiwan and is safely managed by Taiwanese, he added.

The greatest crisis lies in “local infiltration,” because if a hostile force could legally enter sensitive industries in Taiwan, there would be security vulnerabilities within the system, Hung said, urging the government to enhance investment reviews and beneficial owner disclosure mechanisms, classify medical logistics as strategic assets and prevent subversive infiltration.

Only by addressing these systemic risks could Taiwan's defense resilience really be established, he said.

Deputy Minister of Health Lin Ching-yi (林靜儀) yesterday said that the ministry would discuss with agencies setting up backup logistics systems and information nodes.

Medical response relies on collaboration among multiple systems, including local health departments and healthcare facilities, so the ministry has asked healthcare facilities to store certain quantities of vital drugs and medication for emergencies, and work with logistics companies in allocating resources when there is insufficient supply, he said.

The law does not prohibit Chinese investment in logistics companies, so the ministry would discuss with the Food and Drug Administration how to establish backup logistic systems, Lin said.

The CDC yesterday said it ended its contract with Pharma Logistics last year.


MILITARY BOOST:
                                        The procurement was planned after Washington recommended that Taiwan increase its stock of air defense missiles, a defense official said yesterday                                        Taiwan is planning to order an additional four PAC-3 MSE systems and up to 500 missiles in response to an increasing number of missile sites on China's east coast, a defense official said yesterday. 
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the proposed order would be placed using the defense procurement special budget, adding that about NT$1 trillion (US$32,88 billion) has been allocated for the budget. 
The proposed acquisition would include launchers, missiles, and a lower tier air and missile defense radar system, they said 
The procurement was planned after the US military recommended that Taiwan increase                                    


NOT ‘SATISFIED':
                                        A report said Xi Jinping believes he can persuade Donald Trump to formally oppose Taiwanese independence because he is eager to do an economic deal                                        The US would maintain its stance on Taiwan and oppose any unilateral move to alter the “status quo,” a US Department of State spokesperson said on Monday after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) plans to press US President Donald Trump to formally oppose Taiwanese independence.
“Our position on Taiwan has not changed,” the spokesperson said in response to media queries from Taiwan.
“We remain committed to our one China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China Joint Communiques and the six assurances to Taiwan. The United States is committed to preserving peace                                    


TWO HEAVYWEIGHTS:
                                        Trump and Xi respect each other, are in a unique position to do something great, and they want to do that together, the US envoy to China said                                        The administration of US President Donald Trump has told Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) “we don't want any coercion, but we want [the Taiwan dispute] resolved peacefully,” US ambassador to China David Perdue said in a TV interview on Thursday.
Trump “has said very clearly, we are not changing the ‘one China' policy, we are going to adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act, the three communiques and the ‘six assurances' that were done under [former US president Ronald] Reagan,” Perdue told Joe Kernen, cohost of CNBC's Squawk Box.
The act, the Three Joint Communiques and the “six assurances” are guidelines for Washington                                    


MANUFACTURING TALKS: 
                                        The condition outlined by the US secretary of commerce would ‘go against Taiwan-US supply chain cooperation,' the Executive Yuan said                                        Taiwan has “never made any commitment to a 50-50 split on manufacturing chips, and would not agree to such terms,” Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun (鄭麗君) said yesterday after returning from a fifth round of in-person tariff negotiations with the US.
US President Donald Trump's administration wants Taiwan to adopt a “50-50 split” on semiconductor manufacturing, with half of the chips used in the US to be made domestically, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in an interview with NewsNation on Sunday.
The concept differs from the investment direction being discussed under negotiations regarding supply chain cooperation, the Cabinet said in a                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

The FDA has approved the supplemental new drug application for topical roflumilast cream 0.05% for treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in children aged 2-5 years, the manufacturer announced in a press release on October 6. 

Roflumilast cream, marketed as Zoryve by Arcutis Biotherapeutics, is a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor administered once daily. It was previously approved in a 0.15% formula for treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in patients aged 6 years and older and in a 0.3% concentration for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, including intertriginous areas, in adults and children aged 6 years and older.

In addition to an extension study and a phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, the additional approval was based on data from the phase 3 INTEGUMENT-PED study, in which nearly 40% of children treated with roflumilast 0.05% achieved a 75% improvement from baseline on the Eczema Area and Severity Index 75% score at 4 weeks vs 20% of those using the vehicle, according to the press release. Also at week 4, 25.4% of those on active treatment had a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on the validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis scale and a 2-grade improvement from baseline compared with 10.7% of those using the vehicle (P < .0001).

Itching also was reduced with treatment, according to the company. Results of the study were previously presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in 2024, and were reported by Medscape.

In pivotal studies, treatment was well-tolerated and the most common adverse effects reported were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, vomiting rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and headache, the company said in the release. 

This approval follows the recent FDA approval of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% (Opzelura), a topical JAK inhibitor, as a treatment for mild-to-moderate AD in children ages 2-11 years, as previously reported by Medscape.

Topical roflumilast 0.05% is expected to be available at the end of October 2025, according to the company. Full prescribing information is available here.

The family physician shortage in Alberta goes beyond the problem of fewer doctors providing services and includes patient factors that demand more time and resources, a new study revealed.

The number of family practices in Alberta that are accepting new patients “decreased dramatically” from nearly 900 in 2020 to 164 in 2024, according to Braden Manns, MD, senior associate dean of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, Calgary, and colleagues. “Nearly 50% of older Canadians with acute illness wait > 6 days to get an appointment with their [family physician], the worst among Commonwealth countries.”

Against this backdrop, “we thought it would be a good idea to try to understand this issue from a workforce planning perspective,” Manns told Medscape Medical News. “Why do up to 25% of [patients] not have family doctors? Why can't they see their family doctors within a week if they're sick? Is it simply a head count issue? Or is there something else going on?”

Unlike most previous studies investigating the family physician shortage, Manns and colleagues looked at changes in patients as well as in family physicians over time. In particular, they examined the increasing need for primary care services because of rapid population growth overall, the aging of the Boomers, and recent evidence suggesting that Canadians are developing more comorbidities.

The researchers conducted a population-based cohort study using administrative health data (including physician claims, health records, hospital data, and ambulance reports) to assess adult patients seen by family physicians providing comprehensive primary care in Alberta from 2004 to 2020. They also assessed changes in family physicians during the study period.

The researchers found “notable changes” in the family physician workforce. For example, the proportion of women family physicians increased from 39% in 2004 to about 47% in 2020. “We're not highlighting this statistic as a bad thing,” Manns noted. “We know that female family physicians tend to spend longer with their patients and that the care they provide is often of higher quality than that of male physicians.”

The idea that women might work part-time or won't work as many hours as men is “not true,” he said. His team did not address that issue in the current study, but “other studies have shown that women have maintained the number of hours they work per week, whereas men have backed off on the number of hours they work per week.”

The current study also found that the proportion of family physicians trained in low- and middle-income countries rose from 6% to 17%. “That was surprising to us, and I think it reflects that we're not doing a good job with our own workforce planning and our own training of our own physicians,” he said.

The quality of care provided by family physicians from low-to-middle income countries is not in question, he noted. “In fact, as we get more immigration from these areas, having family physicians who understand patients who are from those countries is good. But although being able to communicate in local languages is great, we're still not training enough of our own family physicians.”

The researchers also found that the average number of patients seen per day by a family physician fell from 23 in 2004 to 20 in 2020, and the average days worked each year by family physicians decreased from 167 in 2004 to 156 in 2020.

The authors suggested that the decreased number of patients seen per day, and possibly smaller roster sizes, might result from factors such as the greater complexity of patients, as well as family physicians who are combining traditional primary care with focused practices (eg, surgical assistants, hospitalists, or urgent care) and thus are spending fewer days providing comprehensive outpatient care. An increase in burnout and in administrative burden might also have resulted in a reduced capacity for patient care.

On the patient side, the study found that the proportion of patients aged 61-80 years increased from 16.1% in 2004 to 22.1% in 2020, while the proportion of those with five or more comorbid conditions increased from 2.8% to 5.2%.

One limitation of the study is that the researchers did not include children under the age of 18 years, and so even their comprehensive analyses don't reflect the full spectrum of the primary care workload.

“The solution isn't just more doctors, or doctors with more time,” Manns said. “We need to expand primary care teams to include allied health professionals in one place, under one roof.” He pointed to Alberta's Primary Care Networks, where family physicians work alongside other allied health professionals such as nurses, dietitians, and social workers to address patients' needs.

“But while nearly three-quarters of Albertans receive care in primary care networks,” he said, “funding for teams remains very limited, with only about four allied health professionals for every 10 family physicians.”

Carrie Bernard, MD, president of the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC), Mississauga, Ontario, agreed that more team-based care would be beneficial and would “help ensure that the way the students are trained is how they work.”

These days, “almost all family medicine students are trained in teams,” she told Medscape Medical News. “That doesn't change the number of family physicians; that changes the way they work. We know that working in teams means that each person is supported to work at their full scope, and with these more complex patients, having a dietitian to deal with issues such as diabetes, having pharmacists on the team, all this enables a family physician to see many more patients.”

While some family physicians want to set up their own private practices, Bernard acknowledged, most family physicians no longer do, especially those who are new to the field.

Another strategy that would make going into family medicine more attractive, Bernard suggested, is reducing the administrative burden. Doing away with low-value visits for sick notes when employees miss a day of work would be one approach. This idea has been successful in provinces such as Nova Scotia and Ontario, where sick notes are no longer required for specific conditions.

The CFPC is also working to reduce the number of federal forms that family physicians need to fill out for patients, such as the disability tax credit form. “It takes an inordinate amount of time, and we've been advocating and asking the government to stop needing us to police this,” Bernard said. “There are multiple aspects of red tape where governments could just change the way it works, and it wouldn't cost money.

“More respect and remuneration would also make family medicine more inviting,” she noted. On the university level, “there is an unspoken and sometimes spoken divide between a specialist and a family doctor. We call ourselves family physician specialists because we are specialists in generalist care.” Universities need to change the “respect narrative” for family physicians, and this change is beginning to happen, she said.

“We also have to look at how family physicians are remunerated,” Bernard added. “We've seen this in provinces across the country. When a better deal is struck with family physicians who provide comprehensive care, we see a net increase in family physicians providing that care.”

Indeed, the Alberta Medical Association (AMA), in collaboration with Alberta Health, launched the Primary Care Physician Compensation Model (PCPCM) in March. The model “aims to stabilize family medicine by supporting longitudinal care and improving income equity,” AMA President Brian Wirzba, MD, told Medscape Medical News. The model “acknowledges the complexity of modern primary care and compensates physicians for the full scope of their work, including time spent outside of direct patient visits,” he said.

In addition, to further alleviate shortages, Wirzba pointed to the following strategies also mentioned by Manns and Bernard:

“While we have seen very good uptake of the PCPCM (just over 1000 physicians), we would be interested in partnering with the Ministry of Primary and Preventative Health Services to better understand the impact and to determine ways to have more physicians adopt this innovative model, potentially doubling over the next 12 months,” Wirzba said.

Meanwhile, “clinicians should be aware that system-level change is underway, but advocacy remains essential,” he said. “The PCPCM is a promising start, but its success depends on continued physician engagement, transparent evaluation, and responsive policy adjustments.

“Clinicians should also prioritize their own well-being. Burnout is a systemic issue, and sustainable practice models must support both patient care and provider health,” Wirzba concluded.

This work was supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research Foundation Award. Mann, Bernard, and Wirzba reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A ball kid enjoyed his moment in the sun on Monday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he came to the aid of Felix Auger-Aliassime in the closing stages of the Canadian's clash against Jesper de Jong.

Serving at 6-4, 4-5, 15/30, the No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings put on his running shoes to track down a drop shot from the Dutchman but was unable to make up the ground. After lunging forward to get a racquet on the ball, Auger-Aliassime took a slight tumble and found himself sitting on the hard courts at the ATP Masters 1000 event.

Just as he was preparing to return to his feet, a ball kid made his way onto court and offered his hands to the 25-year-old, who was successfully pulled to his feet, with the ball kid receiving loud cheers from the crowd.

Auger-Aliassime went on to seal a 6-4, 7-5 win and will next play Lorenzo Musetti or Luciano Darderi. Auger-Aliassime is 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is aiming to make his second appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, to be held from 9-16 November. He holds a 36-19 record on the season, according to Infosys ATP Stats and married long-term partner Nina last month.
