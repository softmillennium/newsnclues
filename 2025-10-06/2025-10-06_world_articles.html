The Israeli army has declared a temporary pause in its military operation “Gideon's Chariots 2,” which had primarily focused on occupying Gaza City. This decision came after the Israeli political leadership recommended scaling down offensive operations and restricting them to defensive measures in an attempt to create a suitable atmosphere for negotiations — particularly following Hamas's positive response to U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal regarding Gaza. In the past days, Israeli forces had expanded military operations in the city, encircling it completely from all sides and seizing control of entire neighborhoods in the heart of Gaza City, such as Sheikh Radwan, Sabra, and Tal al-Hawa. They relied on a scorched-earth policy, using intensive artillery, aerial, and naval bombardments, in addition to deploying old armored personnel carriers loaded with tons of explosives used to demolish entire residential neighborhoods and clear the way for ground forces. The Israeli military operation displaced more than 600,000 of the city's residents and carried out systematic destruction that Gaza City had not witnessed since October 2023. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Known as the beating heart of the Strip and an inseparable part of it, the city had long been celebrated for its picturesque streets, green gardens, and remarkable historical landmarks, as well as for hosting several universities and distinguished educational institutions. Israel fully understands how precious Gaza City is to the Palestinian people and how much they have already suffered living without it during 16 months of forced displacement in the south. Most of Gaza City's residents are refugees who were forced to abandon their lands under the threat of massacres carried out by Zionist militias in 1948. They thought they would remain in the city only for a short time and then be allowed to return to their homelands. However, days turned into years, and that glimmer of hope began to vanish. We loved it as if it were our original homeland — the place that holds our memories and everything we hold dear in life. We believed we would live happily in Gaza City forever, never imagining that the Israelis would displace us from it, just as they did to our grandparents in 1948. We knew all too well that remaining in the city was impossible, as Israeli forces were carrying out a systematic plan of gradual occupation and “cleansing” of Gaza City's neighborhoods, killing anyone who refused to leave. At the same time, we also knew that life in tents — stripped of the most basic necessities and overshadowed by the uncertainty of whether we would ever return home — was simply another form of death. Most Gazans believe that this displacement is the worst thing that has happened to them since the beginning of the war, as Israeli forces have used new and more aggressive methods to expel us — such as detonating explosives-laden robots in residential neighborhoods and using quadcopters to plant landmines on the roofs of homes to demolish them. Added to this are the heavy financial burdens we have never faced in any of our previous displacements: a single tent costs $1,000; renting a piece of land to set it up costs $200; hiring a truck to transport belongings can reach $1,000 due to soaring fuel prices and vehicle maintenance costs; and building a makeshift bathroom can cost $300. The idea of paying such staggering amounts to leave your beloved home and live in a tent in exile reflects the depth of the oppression and pain we endure — as if our lives are meaningless, as if we are no longer seen as human beings with the right to live with dignity. We hope that this time the war will truly end forever, that our stay in the south will not last too long like the last time, and that we will be able to return to our homes and live normally — free from bombardment, starvation, and daily killing — like anyone else in the world deserves. I never imagined such a horrible scenario.” Saim mentioned that she and her children are eagerly waiting for the announcement of a possible ceasefire so they can return to Gaza City, even though their home may be destroyed. “Just end the war and return me to my neighborhood. Shorok Akilah, 30, said she had been determined not to leave the city, unwilling to relive the horrific experience of spending 16 months in a small tent in Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis. My only wish is to return and never leave again. I hope Trump's plan will truly end the war because we are exhausted.

As crucial services grind to a halt and federal workers go without pay, Donald Trump is using the ongoing government shutdown to do what he does best: grab more power. Last week, as the shutdown loomed, Trump gloated that his administration would use it as an excuse to shutter “Democrat agencies,” whatever that means. It was, the MAGA leader said, an “unprecedented opportunity” that had been gifted to him by “Radical Left Democrats.” Meanwhile, Russell Vought, an intellectual architect of Project 2025 and the current head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), made it clear that the shutdown was an opportunity to simply axe congressionally approved spending mandates, especially if they involved money that disproportionately flowed to blue states. In a memo sent out to all government departments in the days leading up to the shutdown, Vought's OMB ordered agencies come up with reduction in force plans for projects, programs, and activities that aren't “consistent with the President's priorities.” With that directive, the OMB furthered the mission of its head, long a supporter of an unbound presidency, to free up Trump to ignore Congress at his pleasure. The administration then proceeded to pull $8 billion in clean energy grants from 16 blue states and suspend payments on $18 billion for federal transport infrastructure projects in the New York region. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also announced it would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of FEMA disaster-preparedness grants from states until they recalculated their populations to reflect the recent mass deportations undertaken by the administration — a naked ploy to revise downwards the populations of large Democratic states such as California, New York, and Illinois — in a likely effort to reduce the number of congressional representatives that they are allotted. By Friday, as the Senate voted on (and failed to pass) several bills to fund the government, the administration let it be known, through a series of announcements from White House spokespeople and surrogates appearing on right-wing media outlets, that it would soon begin implementing plans to permanently fire thousands of additional federal workers. That they hadn't begun the chopping by this past weekend seemingly reflects internal divisions in the GOP ranks, with many GOP congressmembers and senators deeply uncomfortable with the sort of across-the-board government reductions that Vought has been championing. In fact, over the weekend Trump began framing potential firings as “Democrat layoffs.” Turns out — no surprise — that this administration values its hard power federal employees: those whose jobs involve coercion, incarceration, and security. The rest, as they have repeatedly stressed, can be put “in trauma,” in Vought's unpleasant-but-honest phrasing, or at least made to feel perennially vulnerable. This represents a lower percentage than in previous shutdowns. Demanding those employees work without paychecks, while simultaneously hanging over the federal workforce the Damocletian sword of potential mass firings, seems like a strategy designed to make employees feel perennially insecure. It makes it harder for them to protest being asked to work without pay or being furloughed from an agency deemed non-critical to the national well-being, since it presents an even more unpalatable alternative: If you don't like it, the argument goes, we can always simply fire you instead. It's somewhat akin to a theory of foreign policy associated with Richard Nixon, who believed that adversaries were more likely to comply if they feared him lashing out unpredictably. At the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), offices working on climate change issues have gone dark, while divisions reconfigured to work on rolling back climate change regulations remain open for business. Meanwhile, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection, immigration courts, and the rest of the deportation-machine agencies are humming along as if it's still September 2025; only 5 percent of Homeland Security personnel are being furloughed, compared to 89 percent at the EPA and 87 percent at the beleaguered Department of Education. Making all of this worse, many furloughed workers report that, without their knowledge, their emails began sending out automatic replies blaming Democrats for the shutdown and for the fact they aren't at their computers and able to respond to the public's questions. Government agency websites have subjected visitors to similar messages. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.” Click onto the Department of Agriculture website, and you can read “Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.” All of this naked propaganda is a clear violation of the Hatch Act, which prohibits the civil service from being used for partisan purposes. If the administration does ultimately start firing thousands of federal employees, expect that vindictive measure, too, to be pitched as simply being an unfortunate but necessary response to the “Radical Left's” efforts to shutter basic government services. This is a shutdown the GOP should have to own. Democrats aren't responsible for the furloughing of workers, and they certainly won't be responsible if Trump decides to fire thousands of additional employees in the days to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Organizations directly financed by the European Union took part in the October 4 attempt to overthrow the government of Georgia, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said. "Over the past four years, five attempted revolutions financed from abroad have taken place. Right now, organizations directly financed by the European Union participated in the attempt to seize power," he told the Rustavi-2 television. Kobakhidze went on to say that despite such incidents, Georgia has maintained "one-sided friendship" with the EU, and was ready to reboot relations at any moment. "There is no place for grudge in politics," the premier added. On October 4, the day of the municipal elections, an opposition demonstration took place in Tbilisi. The organizers, who announced plans to oust the government, called from the stage to "take the keys to the presidential palace," after which some protesters moved toward the residence. The crowd tore down the fence, but riot police dispersed them using water cannons and tear gas. In the early hours of October 5, police detained five organizers of the rally, including former Prosecutor General Murtaz Zodelava and opera singer Paata Burchuladze for calls to overthrow the government and organizing mass violence. They could face up to nine years behind bars if found guilty.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeffrey Epstein's ex-girlfriend can now only be freed if granted a presidential pardon Ghislaine Maxwell has vowed to fight on after her appeal to overturn her sex trafficking conviction was rejected by the US Supreme Court. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence in a minimum security prison in Texas for trafficking underage women to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. They did not give a reason for refusing to hear her case, as is customary. However, Maxwell's family denied they had run out of legal road and said the disgraced socialite had been preparing a “Habeas petition”, which is used to challenge the lawfulness of an individual's detention. “This fight isn't over,” David Markus, Maxwell's lawyer, said. Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify before Congress in July, but her deposition was delayed because she insisted she could not speak freely while the Supreme Court weighed her appeal. He also demanded she be sent the questions in advance. Maxwell said she would testify freely before Congress if Donald Trump freed her from prison. Mr Trump, who has faced a backlash from supporters for his own association with Epstein, could look favourably on her if she publicly exonerates him from wrongdoing during committee questioning. Asked by a reporter on Monday if he would consider pardoning Maxwell after her appeal was rejected, Mr Trump said he would “take a look at it” and speak to the justice department about her case. He added: “I will speak to the DoJ [department of justice]. Mr Trump was friends with Maxwell in the 1990s, when they were both fixtures on New York's social scene, until at least 2004 when he fell out with Epstein, reportedly over a Florida real estate deal. According to Steven Hoffenberg, a former business associate of Epstein's, the president “liked Epstein” but was “crazy about Maxwell, a very charming lady”. When asked about Maxwell's sex trafficking prosecution in 2020, Mr Trump responded: “I just wish her well, frankly”, adding that he had met her “numerous times over the years”. Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general and a former personal lawyer of Mr Trump, met with Maxwell as the US president sought to quell criticism over his government's failure to publish all of the documentation it holds on Epstein. Maxwell told Mr Blanche that she was not aware of any “client list” belonging to Epstein and never saw Mr Trump behave inappropriately. Inmates at minimum security institutions, also known as federal prison camps, benefit from a low prison guard-to-inmate ratio and limited to no perimeter fencing. The US Justice Department closed the case on Epstein earlier this year, ruling there was “no incriminating client list” or any evidence that Epstein may have blackmailed prominent people. Maxwell's lawyers said that in its reference to co-conspirators, the agreement placed no geographic limit on where the non-prosecution commitment could be enforced. Conspiracy theorists think the financier, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was murdered to stop his so-called “client list” from becoming public. Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, said in congressional testimony on Sept 16 that there was no credible information that Epstein trafficked women and underage girls to anyone but himself. Maxwell failed to convince a trial judge and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out her conviction based on the 2007 non-prosecution agreement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla arrives in Athens on Monday.Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters Israeli authorities said on Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Thunberg was among dozens of deportees to land in Athens, Greece, on Monday afternoon. It is a shame!” Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly after arriving. “I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story,” she added. Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their “complicity” with the “genocide” being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza. “This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,” Thunberg said. Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand wrote on the platform X today that “Canada is aware of three Canadians who were detained off the coast of Israel.” She says Global Affairs Canada has offered consular assistance and “all three are in the process of being released.” Her department said Sunday that Canada was aware of two detained citizens and had asked Israel to release them. Two Canadians detained in Israel over involvement with Gaza flotilla Israeli authorities again rejected mistreatment accusations that have emerged in interviews with activists who were deported to Turkey, Spain and Italy over the weekend. Israel's government has also vehemently denied claims that its offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide, despite a growing number of experts denouncing it as such. Lubna Tuma, a lawyer with the Adalah association representing more than 470 Global Sumud Flotilla participants who were detained last week as they attempted to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, said 150 people were still held in Israel's Ktziot prison, including Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela. Israeli authorities said Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including Greta Thunberg. Adalah lawyers have seen most, but not all, of the activists. Israel's Foreign Ministry accused one activist of biting a female medical staff member. “There was some dehumanizing and violence and shouting,” Roos Ykema, a Dutch member of the flotilla who was deported to Madrid on Sunday, told The Associated Press. North African nationals who were detained told the AP they faced harsher treatment than their European counterparts. “When I showed my Belgian passport their behaviour toward me changed completely,” said Houssem Eddine Rmedi, a dual Tunisian-Belgian citizen. “The moment you show your Tunisian, Algerian or Moroccan passport, they start beating you,” said Moroccan activist Ayoub Habraoui, who added that he and others were kept kneeling under the sun for nearly six hours. South Africa's government said Monday that its citizens would be released and repatriated on Tuesday via Jordan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian drones struck Russian-occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 6, hitting the Feodosia oil terminal, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces. Pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind said the explosion sparked a fire visible from tens of kilometers away, while additional blasts were reported near the Saki and Kacha airfields. According to the General Staff, the terminal serves as a multifunctional facility for transferring oil and petroleum products between rail, sea, and road transport. Ukrainian forces also struck an ammunition depot belonging to a logistics battalion of Russia's 18th Combined Arms Army in Crimea, though the results of that strike are still being assessed. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had intercepted 251 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 40 over the occupied peninsula. A Ukrainian attack damaged energy facilities and disrupted power supplies in the Russian city of Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Oct. 5. The attack follows weeks of intensified Russian strikes against Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Nearly 40,000 Belgorod residents were left without electricity after the strike, which caused significant damage across seven municipalities, according to Gladkov. Local authorities are coordinating school operations amid the outages, Gladkov said. On the morning of Oct. 6, Gladkov reported that partial power outages continued in 24 settlements, affecting 5,400 residents. He did not indicate when full power restoration was expected. "Restoration work is continuing, and we hope that it will be completed in the very near future," he said. Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) released an alleged intercepted phone call, in which a Belgorod Oblast resident described widespread blackouts and internet outages following the attack. "All of Shchebekino was without power," a woman can be heard saying. Ukraine is investigating evidence that Russian forces executed at least 322 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), the Prosecutor General's Office reported on Oct. 6 in response to a request from Ukrinform. Many former POWs have reported beatings, starvation, and psychological pressure. To date, 80 criminal proceedings have been opened, the Prosecutor General's Office said. Up to 5,000 Cuban fighters are actively participating in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reported Oct. 5, citing an internal U.S. State Department cable seen by the outlet. "After North Korea, Cuba is the largest contributor of foreign troops to Russia's aggression, with an estimated 1,000 to 5,000 Cubans fighting in Ukraine," the cable said. The U.S. circulated an unclassified cable, sharing details about Cuba's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, as part of its campaign to counter a United Nations resolution calling for Washington to lift its embargo on the Caribbean nation, which has been in place since 1960. According to Reuters, the U.S. State Department declined to provide additional details on the Cuban fighters, but said it was aware of reports that they were serving alongside Russian troops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fox Sports analyst and former New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the late-night incident in a downtown Indianapolis alleyWade Payne/The Associated Press Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears announced the felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury, which carries a potential sentence of one to six years in prison, during a news conference with Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Chris Bailey. Mears said the investigation is ongoing and that additional charges are possible. “We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” the prosecutor told reporters. Ex-NFL star and Fox analyst Mark Sanchez stabbed, arrested after fight in Indianapolis “This was a situation that did not need to occur,” the prosecutor said. Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, the initial affidavit signed by a police detective said. The truck driver, identified as P.T., had a cut to his left cheek, it said. Sanchez had been scheduled for a hearing Tuesday on the original misdemeanour charges but that was rescheduled to Nov. 4. Sanchez remained hospitalized and was listed in stable condition Monday morning. One of Sanchez's attorneys, James Voyles, declined to comment on the case. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days,” Sanchez's brother, Nick, said in a statement released Monday. The prosecutor said police are still gathering information and have several outstanding search warrants. He also said surveillance video captured the incident from multiple angles. I don't care where you live,” the police chief said. He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rare, monstrous EF5 tornado that struck the United States more than three months ago was the first of its kind in more than a decade, experts announced Monday. A tornado that roared through part of eastern North Dakota in June and killed three people was upgraded Monday to an EF5 with winds greater than 210 mph, the National Weather Service in Grand Forks, North Dakota, confirmed. Only 60 tornadoes of EF5 strength – including this one – have been recorded since 1950, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. The tornado first hit near Enderlin, North Dakota – located about 40 miles southwest of Fargo – and tracked north for nearly 20 minutes and about 12 miles before ending near Alice. The Enderlin tornado was originally rated an EF3 with winds of 160 mph. Additional investigation by weather service meteorologists in consultation with other scientists led to the upgrade, mainly based on the damage the tornado did to a freight train. Its raging winds also ripped large trees down to stubs and inflicted “complete destruction” on one farmstead. Twenty-four people were killed and more than 200 were injured after the tornado turned the city to rubble in a matter of moments. Despite the rarity of such a monster, the fact that there hadn't been an EF5 tornado in more than a decade didn't sit right with some scientists. A study released in August dove into this so-called EF5 tornado “drought” and posited the lack of these high-end ratings had more to do with a potentially imbalanced damage rating scale than the power of the twisters themselves. Tornadoes are assigned ratings based on the type of damage that they do and that damage level is tied to a wind speed. A tornado that rips apart a single family home down to its foundation is given winds of 200 mph, making it an EF4. However, before the scale was changed in 2007, that type of damage was considered the most extreme level. The August study argued that adjusting the definition of an EF5 tornado down slightly to 190 mph would result in an EF5 frequency that's more consistent with decades past. That area of discussion will continue for years to come, but one thing is certain: The EF5 counter has reset and the clock is ticking again. CNN Meteorologist Chris Dolce contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Man viewed as inspiring leader faces deportation after being arrested by ICE agents in Iowa Ian Roberts, the superintendent of the Des Moines School Board, was arrested by ICE agents after he was found to be an undocumented migrant with a final order for deportation. In addition to him being in the US illegally, inconsistencies in his CV and previous run-ins with the law, which allegedly involved Mr Roberts carrying a gun through an airport, have since emerged. Mr Roberts was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers on Sept 26 after he was found hiding, dressed in a suit, near a trailer park. The former Olympic athlete had a compelling life story, having immigrated from Guyana, allegedly earned degrees from impressive universities and spent most of his career in urban school systems building a reputation for his hands-on approach. “I believe deeply in the promise of public education being the most important opportunity gap closer for youth, particularly with a focus on diverse populations,” Mr Roberts wrote in his cover letter, according to The New York Times. Despite a past brush with the law and an inconsistency about where he obtained his doctorate, the school board moved ahead with hiring him after two outside vetting companies confirmed he was a US citizen. Even after a Texas judge ordered him to be deported last year, Mr Roberts allegedly continued to drop into classrooms and encouraged voters to approve more funds for the district. After receiving a five-year student visa in 1999, the year after obtaining a bachelor's degree from Coppin State, he undertook a master's in education at St John's University in New York. A former public school official who once interviewed Mr Roberts praised his “incredible energy” and the “tremendous rapport” he had with kids, according to The New York Times. In 2020, he was hired as a superintendent at a school district in Pennsylvania, telling the school system he was an American citizen when he applied, district leaders said. Following his arrest, Mr Roberts was first placed on paid leave, then unpaid leave before the school board accepted his resignation. Further holes have since emerged in the educator's CV. Mr Roberts claimed on his application in Iowa and Pennsylvania that he had a doctorate from Morgan State University. However, university officials said he never received his degree. An article on the Des Moines Public Schools site said that Mr Roberts received a Master's degree from MIT, but the university said it had no record of him attending. In the now-sealed case in New York, Mr Roberts was allegedly arrested for carrying a gun in his bag at LaGuardia Airport, an official told The New York Times. It is not clear if he was charged. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said he “should have never been able to work around children”. On Friday, the school district sued JG consulting, accusing it of failing to vet Mr Roberts properly. Mr Roberts's lawyer said that the Department of Homeland Security was attempting to “demonise” his client. “It is a disturbing pattern that will fail,” Mr Parrish told The New York Times, adding that “the public will see that Dr. Roberts is a good man whose main interest was inspiring and educating young people”. The Department of Homeland Security, Des Moines School Board, JG Consulting and representatives for Mr Roberts were approached for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 100,000 Western-made components were discovered in drones and missiles launched by Russia against Ukraine overnight on Oct. 5, President Volodymyr Zelensky said a day after. The strike killed at least six people, including an entire family of four, and left 18 others injured. According to Zelensky, the attack drones contained 100,688 foreign-made components. He added that Kyiv is also working on new sanctions targeting individuals and entities aiding Russia. "It is crucial to shut down every scheme that circumvents sanctions, because Russia uses each one to keep killing. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, previously said that most foreign parts found in Russian weapons used on the battlefield in Ukraine originate from China. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Oct. 6 that he has "sort of made a decision" on whether to supply Ukraine with Tomahawk long-range missiles. Officials from Russia's Tyumen Oblast claimed on Telegram that three Ukrainian drones were shot down over an "industrial facility" in the city, adding that no fire, casualties, or explosions occurred amid the attack. According to Reuters, repairs may take around a month. Everyone managed to take shelter in time, and no casualties were reported. The fire has since been extinguished by first responders. Both leaders began their trips by honoring fallen Ukrainian soldiers at Kyiv's Wall of Remembrance. The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces. "We are using all tools," Danish Industry and Trade Minister Morten Bodskov said. The scope of work will be significant," Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.</p>

Sikorski added that the Polish consul had concluded meetings with the country's citizens held in Israel. “They are expected to return to Poland shortly,” he said, urging Polish nationals to follow the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' guidance and avoid travelling to areas considered dangerous.

Konsul RP właśnie zakończył widzenie z naszymi obywatelami zatrzymanymi w Izraelu.Mimo, że odmówili dobrowolnego wyjazdu, powinni w najbliższych dniach wrócić na łono ojczyzny.Jeszcze raz apeluję o przestrzeganie przestróg @MSZ_RP.

Those detained by Israel in international waters included MP Franciszek Sterczewski, Omar Farris, president of the Polish Palestinian Socio-Cultural Association, and Karolina “Nina” Ptak, president of the Nomada Association, who has begun a hunger strike in protest against her detention, Polish media report.

Journalist and activist Ewa Jasiewicz, who also holds British citizenship, was part of the same humanitarian mission to Gaza.

According to the latest information from the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the Polish citizens were among 171 people deported from Israel on Monday, 6 October.
