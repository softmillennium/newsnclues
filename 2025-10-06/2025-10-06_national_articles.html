U.S. Israel Education Association Chair Bruce Pearl weighs in on the Israeli-Hamas peace talks and reacts to being called ‘divisive' on ‘The Will Cain Show.' Bruce Pearl stepped down as the Auburn Tigers men's basketball head coach on Monday, and a longtime ESPN host appeared rather pleased about the news. "Pardon the Interruption" host Michael Wilbon called Pearl a "divisive person" and hoped there was "pressure" to push him out of the program. "He had become a divisive person, it seems to me, intentionally. And I hope there was pressure to just get him out," Wilbon said. Pearl appeared on "The Will Cain Show" on Monday and offered a response to Wilbon, who he said he "loves," adding that a "dear friend" of Wilbon reached out and said Wilbon's sentiments were "probably political" and "not antisemitic." "I was a regular on ‘Pardon the Interruption.' I've tried to bring people together my entire life. Maybe it's an example of why we can't agree to disagree about saying things politically," Pearl said. Auburn Tigers head coach Bruce Pearl reacts after a missed free throw during the first half against the Kentucky Wildcats at Rupp Arena at Central Bank Center. I love the opportunity now to be able to do some things for faith and family and our country, to be an advocate for Israel, an advocate for education. I'm looking forward to being able to do those things while my son is winning basketball games." Pearl, who is Jewish, has expressed his fervent support for Israel in the face of rising antisemitism in the U.S. since the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel. He's been a supporter of how President Donald Trump has handled the conflicts in the Middle East as well. He was 246-125 as the Tigers' head coach and led the team to two Final Four appearances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — Sean “Diddy” Combs' lawyers want the hip-hop mogul sent to a low-security federal prison in New Jersey to serve his four-year, two-month prison sentence, telling a judge Monday that the facility's drug treatment program will help him stay clean. In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to “strongly recommend” that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs “to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,” Combs lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. Also Monday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname “Puff Daddy,” did not say if he would grant the request. Messages seeking comment on Trump's remarks was left for Combs' lawyers and his publicity team. Combs' sentencing Friday on charges he transported people across state lines for sexual encounters capped a federal case that featured harrowing testimony about violence, drugs and so-called “freak-offs,” and exposed the sordid private life of one of the most influential figures in music. The “I'll Be Missing You” singer was convicted in July under the federal Mann Act, which bans transporting people across state lines for any sexual crime. His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life. Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a “spiritual reset” in jail and is “committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.” Subramanian has not yet acted on the request to recommend placement at FCI Fort Dix. Judges often make recommendations about where inmates should serve time, but it's up to the Bureau of Prisons to decide. FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles (103 kilometers) southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. His primary residence, according to court papers, has been a $48 million mansion on an island near Miami. That home and a mansion he owns in Los Angeles were raided by federal agents last year during the investigation that led to his arrest. FCI Fort Dix has been home to a number of high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli. For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate and two other people were arrested for using a drone to smuggle in contraband including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements and eyeglasses. The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband. During his time at Fort Dix, Shkreli ended up in solitary confinement amid allegations he was using a contraband smartphone to run his drug company from behind bars. Inmates are forbidden from conducting business and possessing cellphones.</p>

A mother in Connecticut allegedly poisoned her husband with antifreeze while the two were fighting for custody of their child. Kristen Hogan, a 33-year-old Ridgefield resident, was arrested by the Connecticut State Police on Friday and charged with two counts of attempted murder and a charge of interfering with an officer, according to documents released by the agency. Her husband, who's not named in court documents, went to a court hearing regarding their child on Aug. 7, but Hogan wasn't there. Authorities said that while he was in court waiting for Hogan, he got a notification that she was uploading data to the Wi-Fi router at his home. When he returned home, she was not there. That same day, Hogan's husband drank a "small amount" of wine that was in his fridge, but woke up in the "middle of the night" and became "increasingly ill." At 6 a.m., his mother came to help him, only to find he was "slurring his words, staggering and vomiting," and was taken to the hospital. Kristen Hogan, 33, allegedly poisoned her estranged husband with ethylene glycol. After ruling out a stroke, doctors believed he was poisoned by ethylene glycol, the ingredient used in antifreeze, according to court documents. Kristen Hogan is accused of poisoning her husband's wine, police said. When detectives seized Hogan's phone, they allegedly found searches for several chemical compounds, including monoethylene glycol, according to court documents, which detailed how she also searched how much of the substances "would kill you." While Hogan initially denied poisoning her husband with antifreeze, she eventually admitted to putting ethylene glycol in her husband's wine bottle but "never intended to kill him, but just wanted to make him sick as payback for him being mentally abusive," according to authorities. Authorities said that Hogan put ethylene glycol in a bottle of tea on a separate occasion, adding she was trying to make her husband sick. Their child was also hospitalized in September and presented similar symptoms as the husband, according to authorities. Connecticut State Police arrested Kristen Hogan after she allegedly poisoned her husband with antifreeze while the two were in a child custody battle. Hogan is being held on a $1 million bond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top Virginia Democrats have sharply criticized attorney general nominee Jay Jones but are stopping short of calling on him to leave the race after newly revealed text messages showed he suggested that a colleague be shot. Gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger and lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi called Jones' texts inexcusable, as did Virginia's two Democratic senators. US Sen. Tim Kaine was asked Monday by CNN's Manu Raju if he still supports Jones, who apologized after the texts were revealed. So if I put the comments, which are clearly beyond the pale, against knowing this guy for 25 years, I'm still supporting Jay Jones,” he said. The decision to scold but not abandon Jones speaks to the party's overall desire to beat a prominent state-level incumbent – and, as some Democrats said Monday, a belief that President Donald Trump has changed traditional standards of decorum. Jones is running against Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, whom Trump has backed for reelection. Early voting began in Virginia late last month, and it's too late to remove a name or add a replacement to the physical ballot, Brian Tynes, a spokesman for the state Department of Elections, told CNN in an email. Republicans seeing GOP gubernatorial nominee Winsome Earle-Sears trailing Spanberger are hoping to hold onto Miyares' office and energize other campaigns. Miyares announced Monday that his campaign is spending $1.5 million on a pair of ads highlighting Jones' texts and a previous reckless driving charge. “The Democratic Party has to make this decision,” Miyares said when CNN's Kasie Hunt asked him if Jones should drop out. “Think about this: If somebody was applying to be a line attorney in the attorney general's office or a criminal deputy or even serving in a governor's cabinet, and it turned out these messages came out, they would not be hired.” In a private exchange between Jones and Republican Virginia Delegate Carrie Coyner, Jones griped about how the then-Republican speaker of the House of Delegates Todd Gilbert was paying tribute to a former moderate Democratic lawmaker who died, according to screenshots of text messages first reported by the National Review and obtained by CNN. He went on to say in the text messages that Gilbert and his wife are “breeding little fascists” in reference to Gilbert's children, the National Review reported. Republicans were heavily invested in Miyares before the current news cycle. The incumbent raised $11.2 million for his reelection bid between January 1 and August 31, including $4 million from the Republican Attorney General Association, according to campaign finance data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Jones raised just $8 million over the same period, including $2.1 million from the committee that backs Democratic attorney general candidates. A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted September 25-29, before Jones texts were revealed, showed the Democrat leading Miyares by just 6 percentage points, within the margin of error. Spanberger led Earle-Sears by 12 points in the same poll. The Jones text controversy comes as Republicans are attempting to portray Democrats as extremists in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last month. Democrats have pushed back on that framing, noting the president's own past suggestions of responding to political opponents and protesters with violence. Virginia state Sen. Angelia Williams Graves, a longtime Jones ally, said she condemns political violence and that both sides need to tone down their rhetoric. But she argued Republican calls for Jones to drop out were hypocritical. “Donald Trump said he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot anybody and still be elected. We say, let those without sin cast the first stone. Jay Jones has taken responsibility, apologized, and shown he is committed to serving with integrity and accountability that his public record already shows,” the statement added. Democrats view the contest as part of a larger effort to push back on controversial Trump policies, arguing that a Democratic attorney general would join colleagues in other states to block Trump policies they deem harmful. Miyares, Graham said, would be a “rubber stamp” for the president. Last week Graham wrote a column calling on Jones to drop out “immediately, if not sooner.” Still, he plans to vote for Jones and hope he gets replaced after the election. “I would not have endorsed him, and I'm sure lots of other folks wouldn't have voted for him, if we had known that those texts were out there,” Graham said. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN's Ethan Cohen, Alison Main and Maria Moctezuma contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks told Johnson County Republicans in an August meeting that she'll hold town hall meetings “when hell freezes over.” The Republican, who represents one of the nation's most competitive House districts in southeastern Iowa, has faced questions for months over when she'll hold a public town hall after promising to do so in April. And in the meeting with the Johnson County Republicans of Iowa — which was later posted on YouTube by the county party, where it went largely unnoticed at the time — she was blunt, saying she's already being hounded over Medicaid cuts in the GOP's massive government funding and policy bill. “You know, I don't have to hold a town hall so you can come and yell at me,” said Miller-Meeks, who won by 799 votes in 2024 and faces a likely rematch next year with Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan. “You know, you yell at me in church, you yell at me at the county fair, I'm out in public all the damn time. Miller-Meeks added: “You have plenty of opportunities to yell at me and tell me I should be ashamed of myself, and by the way, I am not.” Miller-Meeks' comments came amid scrutiny over her and many other House Republicans refusing to hold public, in-person town halls. Party leaders, including the National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, have advised against town halls after strong opposition to the GOP's spending cuts burst into view at some town halls this spring. Talk about no taxes on tips, less about Medicaid cuts: How GOP is trying to sell Trump's landmark law Miller-Meeks pointed to independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg criticizing her and other swing district Republicans over their votes for President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. “We took the hard votes on reconciliation. Miller-Meeks told the Johnson County Republicans that she was being pressed on when she'd hold a town hall by Tom Barton, a politics reporter for The Gazette newspaper in Cedar Rapids. Miller-Meeks did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on her August remarks to Johnson County Republicans. She told Barton that Democrats pressing GOP incumbents to hold town halls just want “other people like-minded to scream and yell at people so they can videotape screaming and yelling at people.” “And then other people had, you know, reasonable questions that they wanted answers to, and we were able to do that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Google sign is displayed at the company's office in San Francisco, April 12, 2023. Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store. In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to “enormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.” Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago. In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals. Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions. Those commissions were the focal point of an antitrust lawsuit that video game maker Epic Games filed against Google in 2020, setting up a month-long trial in San Francisco federal court that culminated in the jury's monopoly verdict. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year. In a post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney applauded the Supreme Court for clearing the way for consumers to choose alternative app payment choices “without fees, scare screens, and friction.” Although the Play Store changes will likely dent Google's profit, the company makes most of its money from a digital ad network that's anchored by its dominant search engine — the pillars of an internet empire that has been under attack on other legal fronts. As part of cases brought by the U.S. Justice Department, both Google's search engine and parts of its advertising technology were declared illegal monopolies, too. The government is now seeking to break up Google in the advertising technology case during proceedings that are scheduled to wrap up with closing arguments on Nov. 17 in Alexandria, Virginia.</p>

John Kennedy, R-La., discusses shutdown negotiations, the sentencing of Kavanaugh's would-be assassin and his new book, 'How to Test Negative for Stupid' on 'America's Newsroom.' A weekend away from Washington did little to soften Senate Democrats' resolve as they again blocked Republicans' effort to reopen the government, ensuring the shutdown will last at least a week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and most of his caucus are adamant that unless a deal is struck on expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, commonly known as ObamaCare subsidies, they will not provide the votes needed to fund the government. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are not ready to yield their position on extending ObamaCare tax credits as the government shutdown continues. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, have broken with their caucus to end the shutdown. Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., remains the lone Republican to buck his party. Senate Democrats have remained steadfast in their demand that a deal must be reached to extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They argue that unless Congress acts, Americans who rely on the tax credits will see their healthcare premiums skyrocket. Both Senate leaders are encouraging talks among rank-and-file members to find a solution, but neither side can agree on when exactly the subsidies should be dealt with. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Republicans are open to negotiating an extension to expiring ObamaCare tax credits, but only after the government reopens. "I think a lot of it would come down to what the White House lands on that, but certainly not without reforms. And we all know the program is broken, it needs to be fixed, so that would be certainly a starting place." Schumer wants an additional bulwark added to a deal: President Donald Trump has to sign off on it, given that there may be resistance among House Republicans to extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. "A lot of Republican senators in the Senate do, but they're not enough. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., speaks to reporters before a Senate luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 12, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) When asked if he would work to make a deal with them on ObamaCare subsidies to reopen the government, he said, "Yeah." "I'd like to see a deal made for great healthcare," Trump said. Schumer fired back in a statement that Trump's "claim isn't true — but if he's finally ready to work with Democrats, we'll be at the table." And Fetterman, who has routinely voted against shutting the government down regardless of which party controlled the Senate, recognized that without Trump's greenlight, a deal would go nowhere. He gave the example of a bipartisan border deal negotiated between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate in 2023 that was sidelined under orders from Trump. Trump tanked that, and he wasn't the president, and he didn't have to sign that thing," Fetterman said. "So what I'm saying, where's the leverage? Because ultimately, doesn't he have to sign off on any of it anyway?" Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

Chicago FOP President John Catanzara and former federal prosecutor Jonathan Fahey discuss the CPD's conduct as anti-ICE protests occur in Chicago on ‘America Reports.' A far-left professor at the University of Chicago was arrested Friday and charged with violent felonies stemming from riots at an ICE facility in the suburbs of the city. Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi of the University of Chicago's Department of Comparative Human Development was arrested on Oct. 3 and charged with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor, the Cook County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday to Fox News Digital. Abdelhadi was released from custody after her initial appearance on Saturday. Court records show her next scheduled hearing is Tuesday. A university spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital that Abdelhadi is an associate professor at the school. Left-wing agitators have been rallying outside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, for weeks. Rioters have blocked ICE vehicles from exiting the facilities, and have been involved in a slew of violent confrontations with police, leading to more than a dozen arrests. Posts from Abdelhadi's X account show that she was at the rally on Friday. A day before her arrest, she appeared on a podcast called "Movement Memos," which is affiliated with the far-left publication Truthout. During that interview, she recalled her previous experiences at the riots at the Broadview facility. "These people are terrorizing our communities and they're setting up shop," she said, referring to federal immigration officials. And so it felt really important to join protesters out there to say, not in our city, not in our name, not in our backyard." She later expressed her frustration at centrist liberals. Abdelhadi made headlines earlier this year when she cursed out her employer at a July conference called Socialism 2025. Federal law enforcement agents confront demonstrators protesting outside an immigrant processing center on Saturday in Broadview, Illinois. One protester allegedly threatened to kill federal officers. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that," she said. However, she reasoned that teaching there was her only chance to have any power. "Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. Federal law enforcement arrive near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., on Friday, Oct. 3, 2025. Socialism 2025 described itself as a "a four-day conference bringing together thousands of socialists and radical activists from around the country to take part in discussions about social movements, abolition, Marxism, decolonization, working-class history, and the debates and strategies for organizing today." The professor spoke on a panel called "Revolutionary Accompaniment: Holding Each Other When Things Fall Apart." According to the Truthout interview, she also organizes with Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at the University of Chicago, and has referred to the war in Gaza as a "genocide." "This is a painful lesson that a lot of us in the Palestine solidarity movement have been learning is that we don't have power… what we don't have is power… the question I'm asking myself, and I'm asking you to ask yourself, ‘is where can I actually build power?'" Federal law enforcement agents break up protesters outside of an immigrant processing center with a barrage of tear gas and pepper balls on Sept. 27, 2025, in Broadview, Illinois. The demonstrators were protesting a recent surge in ICE apprehensions in the Chicago area, part of a push by the Trump administration dubbed Operation Midway Blitz. "Do you see that fight for Palestine is the fight for the whole world? Abdelhadi did not return a request for comment. Fox News' David Spector contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Wisconsin Capitol is seen, Oct. 24, 2023, in Madison, Wis. (AP Photo/Scott Bauer, File) MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Monday asked a judge to immediately put on hold his order that would require elections officials to verify the citizenship of all 3.6 million registered Wisconsin voters before the next statewide election in February. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Maxwell scheduled a hearing on the request for Oct. 31, saying issuing an immediate stay would violate due process. The fight over verifying the citizenship status of voters in battleground Wisconsin comes as President Donald Trump's Department of Justice has sought voter records from at least 26 states, including Wisconsin. Trump's Justice Department is taking steps to crack down on voter fraud and noncitizen voting, both of which are rare but have been the subject of years of false claims from Trump and his allies. They sought a court order requiring the Wisconsin Elections Commission and state Department of Transportation to verify the citizenship of all applicants registering to vote. They argued that the state elections commission is failing to investigate unlawful voter registrations and not taking steps to ensure that noncitizens are not voting. The state justice department argued that there is no requirement or duty under Wisconsin law for the elections commission and transportation department to share and match data to remove non-citizens from the statewide voter list. Maxwell ruled Friday that the elections commission is “violating state and federal statutes by maintaining an election system that potentially allows individuals on to the voter rolls who may not be lawfully entitled to cast a vote in Wisconsin.” He also prohibited accepting any new voter registration request “without verification that the applicant is a U.S. citizen.” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat who is considering running for governor, argued Monday that the court's order would “require a massive overhaul of Wisconsin's voter registration system and the creation of new verification requirements not otherwise provided for by statute.” Further, the judge's order does not explain what it would entail to verify that an applicant is a U.S. citizen. Requiring additional documents, like a U.S. passport, will take time to implement, Kaul argued. Any disabling of the voter registration system while those changes are implemented would violate the rights of others who are trying to register, Kaul argued. The state receives an average of 200 online voter registrations each day, he said. A spokeswoman for the state elections commission did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</p>

The White House blasted a federal judge who temporarily blocked the Trump administration twice from dispatching National Guard troops to Oregon in October, asserting that President Donald Trump has "undisputed authority" to deploy troops to Portland amid ongoing immigration protests there. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a ruling late Sunday blocking the Trump administration from sending California National Guard troops to Oregon — or any other state as Trump advances his quest to deploy troops to major U.S. cities to tackle crime and to keep watch on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt discredited Immergut's ruling Monday and said that the Trump administration was appealing the decision. FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE "I think her opinion is untethered in reality and in the law," Leavitt told reporters at a White House press briefing. … The ICE facility has been really under siege. And, by these anarchists outside, they have been, disrespecting law enforcement. Law enforcement officers stand after deploying tear gas outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility during a protest Oct. 4, 2025, in Portland, Oregon. Earlier Monday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said that Immergut, a Trump appointee, has no authority to bar the president from sending troops to Oregon, and blasted the decision as one of the most "egregious" orders he's ever seen. "A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property," Miller said in a Monday X post. "Today's judicial ruling is one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen — and is yet the latest example of unceasing efforts to nullify the 2024 election by fiat." "Remember: all of this is about preventing the removal of illegal alien trespassers from the United States at any cost," Miller said. The Sunday temporary restraining order came just hours after Trump signed off on mobilizing California National Guard troops to Portland, despite Immergut's initial restraining order Saturday blocking the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to the city. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller blasted the decision as one of the most "egregious" orders he's ever seen. "How could bringing in federalized National Guard from California not be in direct contravention to the temporary restraining order I issued yesterday?" The Trump administration has argued that the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, is necessary to defend ICE officers amid ongoing protests at an ICE facility there. Miller previously railed against Immergut's first restraining order barring the Trump administration from sending troops to Portland, Oregon, and said Saturday the deployment is "an absolute necessity to defend our personnel, our laws, our government, public order and the Republic itself." Miller's posts come amid recent scrutiny for denouncing judges. For example, Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman of New York singled out Miller and the "extreme right" for "threatening judges" who rule against Trump after a fire broke out at a South Carolina Circuit Court judge's property Saturday. Trump's effort to deploy National Guard troops to U.S. cities comes just after he told military leaders in September that they could be tasked with neutralizing the "enemy within" and that Democratic-led cities where he's sending troops could serve as "training grounds." President Donald Trump speaks to senior military leaders Sept. 30, 2025, in Quantico, Virginia. The effort is controversial, given that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 puts restrictions on deploying U.S. troops to enforce domestic law. National Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and typically are overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from states to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Newsom responded to Immegut's order late Sunday, and said: "We just won in court — again." "Trump's abuse of power won't stand," Newsom said in a post on X.

A FBI memo dated Sept. 27, 2023, is photographed Monday, Oct. 6, 2025, after being released by several Republican senators, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI in 2023 analyzed phone records of more than a half dozen Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into efforts by President Donald Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to information released Monday by GOP senators. The disclosure adds new detail to the since-shuttered investigation by the FBI and former special counsel Jack Smith into the steps Trump and allies took in the run-up to the Capitol riot to undo his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump was indicted in August 2023 with conspiring to overturn the results, but the case was abandoned after Trump's win the following year because of a Justice Department legal opinion that says sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution. The subpoena for the phone records was disclosed by several Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that oversees the FBI. Grassley said the document memorializing the “preliminary toll analysis” was found in response to his request. The investigative step was authorized by a grand jury, the senators said. The document suggests the analysis was conducted by an FBI special agent whose name was redacted and it was authorized by two supervisory agents. It does not say how or why those lawmakers were identified or whether any meaningful tips or leads emerged from that investigative work. After the voting was disrupted by the rioters on Jan. 6, 2021, some voted to certify the results, while others still voted against certification. The senators said they would not be conducting their own investigation because they expected FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino — both Trump loyalists — to review the matter. Grassley suggested that more people at the FBI would be fired over the investigation, saying, “If heads don't roll in this town, nothing changes.” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said on social media that he had “grave concerns” about the incident. “I fully support Senate committees getting to the bottom of this outrageous abuse of power and weaponization of the government,” said Thune, a South Dakota Republican.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A protester, draped in an altered American flag, watches as law enforcement officers try to disperse protesters near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Ore. on Sunday, Oct. 5, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets. Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump's aggressive use of the National Guard. At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans. Speaking with reporters, President Trump was asked if he would invoke the Insurrection Act. “What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump's attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor's objections. Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America's long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands. Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.” U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments. While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it's typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security. The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge's decision to block the deployment in Portland. Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it's the courts that have ignored constitutional limits. “A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump's immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.” Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Trump's opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power. With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm. “The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Around 2 p.m. Saturday, top White House adviser Stephen Miller took to X to warn of a “growing movement of leftwing terrorism” that is “shielded by far-left Democrat judges.” But it didn't come from a “Democrat judge”; it came from someone Trump himself had nominated in 2018, US District Judge Karin Immergut. She did so both for the administration's initial attempted National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon, and then again after suggesting it had defied her initial order by attempting to send in California troops. She even floated the idea that Trump was effectively trying to illegally implement “martial law.” Despite the administration's claims of what Miller has labeled a left-wing “legal insurrection,” the list of judges ruling against the president includes a fast-growing number of Republican- and even Trump-appointed ones. To date, GOP-appointed judges have ruled against the administration in more than a dozen high-profile cases. And their ranks include at least eight Trump-appointed judges. They've also often used strong language that suggested Trump and his administration were blatantly violating the law. The rhetoric around these cases is getting increasingly ugly, with some Trump allies taking Miller's cue and calling for impeaching judges or disregarding their rulings. Elon Musk has even called efforts to thwart Trump's actions “treason.” But the legal paper trail suggests something else entirely: that Trump is simply trying to do lots of illegal things — so much so that it forces even GOP- and Trump-appointed judges to call that out. The case: Trump has sought to use the troops to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has faced protests, which the administration has cast as violent. In the judge's words: “This historical tradition boils down to a simple proposition: this is a nation of Constitutional law, not martial law. Defendants have made a range of arguments that, if accepted, risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.” Read the filing here. The administration's action “does appear to be in direct contradiction of my order,” she said. The case: Trump sued the entire federal court bench in Maryland over judges' orders putting a two-day pause on deportations. The cases: A series of cases has dealt with the administration's attempts to rapidly deport migrants without due process, often by using a centuries-old law called the Alien Enemies Act , which had previously been reserved for wartime. In the judge's words: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” Read the filing here. In the judge's words: The administration's claims that parents in Guatemala had asked to be reunited with their children “crumbled like a house of cards about a week later. In the judge's words: “Defendants have provided no evidence, or even any specific allegations, as to how Cristian, or any other Class Member, poses a threat to public safety.” Read the filing here. In the judge's words: “A country's encouraging its residents and citizens to enter this country illegally is not the modern-day equivalent of sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt or to otherwise harm the United States.” Read the filing here. Judges: Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh (as part of a majority whose size was unclear) In the court's words: “Notice [for immigrants] roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.” Read the ruling here. Judges: US Court of International Trade Judges Timothy Reif and Jane Restani (as part of a three-judge panel) “If there is a benign explanation for the Government's decision, it has not been presented here. The case: Several academic institutions sued, arguing that the administration has carried out an ideological deportation policy aimed at pro-Palestinian viewpoints that chills the speech of others who would support that cause. The case: The administration sought to ban race-based considerations in schools and universities as part of its anti-diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In the judge's words: “This is a blatantly unconstitutional order.” “It has become ever more apparent that, to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals. The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or simply ignore, whether that be for political or personal gain.” Read the judge's comments here. In the judge's words: “Agencies do not have unfettered power to further a President's agenda.” Read the filing here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Democratic FBI Director James Comey denied any knowledge of files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to letters reviewed by the Washington Examiner. However, Comer withdrew the demand after Comey and former Justice Department leaders provided written statements. “Given that I do not possess knowledge and information relevant to the Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and related matters, I offer this letter in lieu of a deposition that would unproductively consume the committee's scarce time and resources,” Comey wrote in a letter. Trump allies have long accused Comey, an Obama-era official, of misleading Congress and authorizing politically motivated leaks about the FBI's probe into Trump campaign associates in 2016. Just earlier this month, Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to move “without delay” in pursuing charges against several former Obama-era officials. It also alleges that Comey made a false statement in violation of 18 USC 1001. The former FBI director is set to appear before a court later this week for his arraignment. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, is set to preside over the case. Former Attorneys General Merrick Garland and Eric Holder told the House Oversight Committee they have no knowledge of files related to Epstein. The committee also backed off compelling in-person interviews with Attorneys General Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales last month. The committee also withdrew a subpoena for former FBI Director Robert Mueller, citing his declining health. The Trump administration insisted there was no “client list” that would have implicated famous and powerful people involved in Epstein's alleged sex trafficking ring that involved underage girls. The committee originally issued 10 subpoenas for depositions earlier this year, including former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, from August through October. Barr's transcript from his testimony was released earlier this month. Alexander Acosta, former Department of Labor secretary and former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, testified before the committee last month after a separate subpoena. Acosta granted Epstein what many believe was a “sweetheart deal.” However, it was one signature short of forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to put Massie's Epstein transparency bill on the House floor for a vote. After Democrats won a recent special election in Arizona, Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva is expected to sign the Epstein discharge petition and reach 218 necessary signatures to compel floor action.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the global auto industry hasn't given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it's not all-electric, as they had expected. And they don't want to fall too far behind China's massive EV surge. “They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla's sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers. And it's unlikely they'll get back up for a long time afterwards. While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. “I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event. Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia. But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny's plan. Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn't hit the target. Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July. California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases. Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid-vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE). But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. And America's car companies are saying they didn't see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline. The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn't have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM's investors presentation last month. But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand. “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That's going to take a little bit of time. We'll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.” Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars. And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology. As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said  it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in Chiles v. Salazar, a case challenging Colorado's ban on certain forms of counseling for youth experiencing gender dysphoria. The stakes couldn't be higher for vulnerable young people and their families. Tyler Deaton leads American Unity Fund, which advocates for LGBT rights within conservative circles. We've frequently disagreed — sometimes profoundly — on questions of marriage, sexuality, and religious liberty. Yet we've joined forces to file an amicus brief in this case because we share a fundamental conviction: Children struggling with gender dysphoria deserve compassion, individualized attention, and comprehensive mental healthcare, not a system that pushes only one predetermined outcome. Colorado's 2019 law — versions of which have been passed by over 20 other states — prohibits mental health professionals from providing any counseling that doesn't “affirm” a minor's stated “gender identity.” In practice, this means therapists can only validate a child's desire to pursue sex change interventions, whether social, medical, or surgical; they cannot explore underlying issues, address co-occurring mental health conditions, or help children find ways to understand themselves that don't include medically or surgically modifying their developing bodies. However, helping children work through distress about puberty — a universally difficult time — bears no resemblance to the coercive practices many gay and lesbian adults condemn. It's guiding them onto a medical conveyor belt that itself exposes them to serious risks of fundamentally experimental interventions that carry serious risks: impaired cognitive function, infertility, reduced bone density, and other lifelong health consequences. Censorship has lately been a potent tool of far-left and far-right activism as censors embrace the illiberal impulse to silence or “cancel” any viewpoint they find objectionable. Instead, their businesses are being put under a microscope and damaged, ultimately resulting in fewer children having access to help and guidance when they most need it. Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have all reversed course on so-called “gender-affirming care” after systematic reviews found the evidence weak or nonexistent, and instead recommend psychotherapy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently concluded that “the best available evidence indicates that puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery have not been shown to improve mental health outcomes” for youth with gender dysphoria. Detransitioners — young adults who medically “transitioned” as minors and later regretted it — consistently report that their gender dysphoria stemmed from other issues that went ignored or unexplored and that they were fast-tracked toward permanent bodily modifications when what they needed was mental health support. Colorado's law doesn't just violate counselors' free speech rights; it abandons vulnerable children to an experimental medical pathway that increasingly looks like malpractice. Whatever one's views on LGBT issues, surely we can agree that children deserve protection, not politics. Ryan T. Anderson is president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. Tyler Deaton is a senior advisor at American Unity Fund. They filed an amicus brief in Chiles v. Salazar supporting the petitioner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Venezuela warned the U.S. government that the American Embassy in Caracas could be targeted in a “false-flag” operation, National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez said on Sunday. Rodríguez said the United States and an unspecified European embassy had been warned in three separate channels that “extremist sectors of the local Venezuelan right” are looking to plant explosives at their locations. Rodríguez did not specify which extremist group would try to carry out the attack, who would be framed, or the motivation for such a plan. The State Department suspended operations at its embassy in Caracas and evacuated all diplomats in March 2019, during President Donald Trump's first administration. U.S. forces have carried out at least four strikes on vessels in international waters that U.S. officials have said were cartel members smuggling drugs that would end up in the U.S. Traditionally, the U.S. Coast Guard would interdict these vessels, search them, and, if needed, arrest those on board and give them due process. These strikes have raised legal questions about the military's use of lethal force, while Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said they would continue as needed. After the most recently announced strike on a Venezuelan boat, Hegseth said U.S. intelligence confirmed “without a doubt” that the vessel “was trafficking narcotics, the people on board were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.” He did not share what intelligence confirmed those conclusions. Trump informed Congress last week that the U.S. is in a “non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, declaring some cartels to be terrorist organizations and their members “unlawful combatants.” Trump has also publicly said the U.S. military could carry out operations on Venezuelan soil, which would be an escalation in its operations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In states such as Maryland, the role diversity, equity, and inclusion-like policies embedded in federal contract requirements are playing in discouraging development has come into focus as efforts begin to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge. Nationwide, and in the country's most populous blue cities, builders have expressed concern over a slew of labor, environmental, and safety mandates instituted under Democrats, which they argue have suppressed companies' ability to operate competitively. These include a 2022 order creating project labor union requirements, requirements on “prevailing wages,” and a 2024 rule listing two chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. And environmental concerns — are there spaces that we can't build, or do you need to do a huge study to make sure that there's some sort of plan because there's a five-eyed caterpillar that lives within the range?” said Wayne Winegarden, senior fellow of business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute. The 2024 rule expanding requirements around PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” was spearheaded by the Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency before trickling down to affect billions of dollars in development and thousands of workers. “That liability is what's going to prevent contractors from bidding on major infrastructure projects where there might be PFAs contamination,” said AGC regulatory counsel Spencer Phillips, whose organization represents over 33,000 firms in the construction industry. “Members have told us that they're declining a bid on those types of projects, particularly airport projects, because PFAs contamination is pretty ubiquitous.” He said he believes smaller and traditionally nonfederal contractors lack the resources to navigate payroll and recordkeeping requirements associated with the regulation. Prevailing wage regulations have sparked extensive debate in New York City, the country's largest metropolis, and contributed to criticism that they have contributed to the Big Apple's housing affordability crisis. Residents faced a housing crisis of record proportions as construction ground to a halt over the summer, largely due to the end of crucial tax incentives for developers, the renewal of which was blocked by liberals partly because of concerns that they needed an update to expand prevailing wage regulations. They advocated a replacement measure that mandated prevailing wage laws apply to projects built under the tax exemption, which was previously exempt from such requirements. By November 2024, former President Joe Biden's marquee 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act awarded $568 billion in federal funding to over 66,000 projects across the country, with a catch: Most projects awarded IIJA funding must comply with various federal regulations, including the prevailing wage rule and requirements set by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. The Transportation Department program requires recipients of DOT funds to award 10% of federally assisted contracts to DBEs, defined as firms at least 51% owned by women or minorities. States such as Maryland have added regulations on top of the federal diversity requirements for many infrastructure projects, with critics arguing they have contributed to delays on multiple high-level developments. DBE requirements, currently being battled in court, have affected contracts involving projects ranging from the Golden State's high-speed rail project and the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore to the Brent Spence Bridge Project, all of which have faced delays and escalating costs. The $3.6 billion Brent Spence Bridge recently faced a lawsuit alleging that the project's lead contractor reneged on an agreement to use a more diverse set of subcontractors, as 9%, or about $320 million, of the construction project's funds, was set to go to DBEs. “We appreciate the need to attract new people into this industry,” said Brian Turmail, who leads strategic initiatives at AGC. “But for 50 years, at some level or another, public owners, at the state and local level, sometimes at the federal level, have been putting in place, sort of set aside for minority firms, and they haven't measurably increased the percentage of minority ownership of construction firms in this country. They don't meet their policy objective while needlessly raising the cost of projects.” Turmail pointed to the Brent Spence Bridge's paralyzed development as a prime example of regulations, including permitting requirements, impeding progress. A decade later, taxpayers had spent more than $100 million on plans for a new bridge, years before the project was given the federal green light to proceed with construction in 2022. A design was unveiled earlier this year, with construction projected to begin in 2026 after environmental advocates sued the project last year, alleging that health and environmental effects were overlooked. The permitting process in some of the country's largest blue cities has been similarly accused of preventing construction on housing and other priorities. One recent example in Los Angeles showcased the obstacles contractors often face: Developer Cityview became one of only six large apartment developments under construction in the nation's second-most populous city after going through a three-year process to get approval, according to CoStar. The project survived an environmental appeal, required a legal settlement, and ultimately advanced only after qualifying for streamlined review under state law. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) eased some CEQA standards to help Los Angeles rebuild after the fires in January. However, he has faced criticism over his rationale for allowing such regulations to restrict development elsewhere. “Certainly, any type of moves like that is helpful,” Winegarden said. Is the question, and right now, no, it's not.”</p>
