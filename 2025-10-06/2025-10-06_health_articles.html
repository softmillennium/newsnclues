                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardiovascular-related health problems may occur in as many as 1 out of every 7 pregnancies, even among people who don't already have heart disease, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation. A review of more than 56,000 pregnancies occurring between 2001 and 2019 within the Mass General Brigham health care system in New England found a steady rise in cardiovascular-related complications during pregnancy. Conditions such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, blood clots, hypertensive disorders, and maternal death affected approximately 15% of pregnancies. The increase was most pronounced among individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, but it was observed across all age groups and even among those without prior health issues. These increases were impacted by a rise in health risk factors present before and during pregnancy. Most of these health risk factors can be prevented through lifestyle changes or medication. And don't overlook the postpartum period, which also carries important health considerations. Starting before pregnancy and continuing after birth, there are valuable opportunities to make heart-healthy choices that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and support long-term wellness."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New artificial intelligence-generated images that appear to be one thing, but something else entirely when rotated, are helping scientists test the human mind. The work by Johns Hopkins University perception researchers addresses a longstanding need for uniform stimuli to rigorously study how people mentally process visual information. "These images are really important because we can use them to study all sorts of effects that scientists previously thought were nearly impossible to study in isolation-everything from size to animacy to emotion," said first author Tal Boger, a PhD student studying visual perception. "Not to mention how fun they are to look at," adds senior author Chaz Firestone, who runs the university's Perception & Mind Lab. The team adapted a new AI tool to create "visual anagrams." An anagram is a word that spells something else when its letters are rearranged. Visual anagrams are images that look like something else when rotated. This is an important new kind of image for our field. If something looks like a butterfly in one orientation and a bear in another-but it's made of the exact same pixels in both cases-then we can study how people perceive aspects of images in a way that hasn't really been possible before." The findings are published today in Current Biology. Real-world size has posed a longstanding puzzle for perception scientists, because one can never be certain if subjects are reacting to an object's size or to some other more subtle visual property like an object's shape, color or fuzziness. But if we show people two objects that differ in how big they are-say, a butterfly and a bear-those objects are also going to differ in lots of other ways: their shape, their texture, how bright or colorful they are, and so on," Firestone explained. "That makes it hard to know what's really driving the brain's response. The field has really struggled to address this issue." For example, previous work has found that people find images more aesthetically pleasing when they are depicted in ways that match their real-world size-preferring, say, pictures of bears to be bigger than pictures of butterflies. "We used anagrams to study size, but you could use them for just about anything," Firestone said. "Animate and inanimate objects are processed in different areas of the brain too so you could make anagrams that look like a truck in one orientation but a dog in another orientation. The approach is quite general, and we can foresee researchers using it for many different purposes." Visual anagrams reveal high-level effects with “identical” stimuli.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neuroinflammation damages neurons and can contribute to diseases like Alzheimer's. Cannabidiol (CBD) has anti-inflammatory properties, which suggests that it could combat neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. In a new eNeuro paper, Babak Baban and colleagues, from Augusta University, explored whether CBD can be leveraged as an antiinflammatory treatment in an established Alzheimer's disease mouse model. The researchers assessed two distinct mechanisms for shaping immune responses and regulating neuroinflammation in the central nervous system following CBD treatment via inhalation. With several molecular and genetic measures, they discovered that CBD reduced expression of key regulators for neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's mice, which was associated with less proinflammatory molecules. Baban et al. also identified distinct regulators of the immune response and neuroinflammation with which CBD interacted. Alzheimer's work has long centered on plaques and tangles. But our study shows that chronic autoinflammation is also a core driver of the disease. What's exciting is that CBD not only calms this immune overactivation but, in earlier work, we've shown it can also help clear plaques and tangles through a different mechanism. Together, this points to a multitarget approach with real therapeutic potential." Naeini, S. E., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inhalers are the frontline treatment for asthma and COPD, but they come with a steep environmental cost, according to a new UCLA Health study - the largest to date quantifying inhaler-related emissions in the United States. Researchers found that inhalers have generated over 2 million metric tons of carbon emissions annually over the past decade, equivalent to the emissions of roughly 530,000 gas-powered cars on the road each year. The study, published in JAMA, analyzed emissions from the three types of inhalers approved for asthma or COPD from 2014 to 2024. Metered-dose inhalers contain hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellants, which are potent greenhouse gases that were widely used in products such as aerosol sprays. Inhalers add to the growing carbon footprint of the US healthcare system, putting many patients with chronic respiratory disease at risk. On the upside, there is tremendous opportunity to make changes that protect both patients and the planet by utilizing lower-emission alternatives." Dr. William Feldman, pulmonologist and health services researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and study's lead author Researchers conducted the study using a comprehensive U.S. database capturing inhaler prescriptions at the National Drug Code (NDC) level. Researchers plan to expand their research to examine inhaler-related emissions in specific patient populations, such as the Medicaid population. They will also compare clinical outcomes between of lower- and higher-emission inhalers in the same therapeutic class and explore pricing and patenting strategies that pharmaceutical companies may use as they roll out lower-emission inhaler technologies. "From there, we can identify what's fueling these emissions and develop targeted strategies to reduce them-benefiting both patients and the environment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research investigating health outcomes in NCAA athletes during their first year after leaving college sports found that some health measures were worse than expected, but others actually improved. In athletes that are ending their collegiate careers, those with more concussions reported worse outcomes on certain health measures. Further, those with increased number of years playing their primary sport reported better mental health scores." Reid Syrydiuk, first author on the study and doctoral candidate in kinesiology, University of Michigan Concussion Center The study, which appears in the journal Brain Injury, is also novel in that it explores a period that hasn't been studied much: the time when students are transitioning out of college sport. Most studies on concussions and health fall into one of two categories: acute (hours or days post-injury) or long term (decades into retirement.) This focus leaves a significant gap in understanding the health of athletes as they undergo the massive life change of exiting competitive sport. To that end, researchers analyzed health questionnaires completed within one year of leaving college by 3,663 student-athletes in the NCAA-DoD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium, to assess how concussion history, sport contact exposure and years of participation were associated with their health at the end of their collegiate career, an intermediate time period that has not been studied much. Concussion history: Athletes with three or more concussions across a variety of sports reported increased depressive symptoms and worsened neurobehavioral (e.g., irritability, concentration) symptoms compared to those with no concussions. Sport type comparison: Athletes in contact sports reported better mental health (specifically lower depression scores) and neurobehavioral symptom scores compared to noncontact athletes. "If I consider why these contact sport athletes report better scores on certain outcomes, I think it could be related to the large-team environments they experience," Syrydiuk said. The CARE Consortium is a national concussion research network of NCAA athletes and U.S. military service academy cadets across 30 different institutions. Steven Broglio, director of the Michigan Concussion Center and U-M professor of kinesiology, is a principal investigator on the CARE study. An important practical application is identifying groups that could benefit from early intervention and support as they leave their college athletics, Syrydiuk said. "This time period is important because it hasn't typically been used before in this type of sport medicine research," he said. "It both bridges a gap in literature, which is typically studying concussions in the acute and the long term, and it fosters early support for those leaving sport." Practical applications could include increased monitoring, such as follow-up mental health screenings for identified at-risk groups postgraduation or targeted resources, such as offering access to counseling or tailored transition support programs for those with significant concussion history. The change of leaving sport is a critical moment. "For the majority of these collegiate athletes, their competitive careers end with graduation," Syrydiuk said. We don't want to just ignore them after they've left sport. "If we can identify groups that are more at risk as they're leaving sport versus decades after they've retired, we can intervene earlier and hopefully increase the likelihood of improving their self-reported health. By identifying who needs support as they transition out of sport, we have a better chance of preventing their health from worsening over time."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a study led by Dr. Dong-Hoon Kim and Professor Yong Taek Jeong at Korea University College of Medicine, published in the International Journal of Oral Science on September 10, 2025, reveals the key players in this process. The team discovered that sweet-sensing taste cells survive nerve injury thanks to a protein called c-Kit - and that these cells are essential for taste bud regeneration. To understand the significance of these findings and what they mean for everyday taste, the researchers spoke about their work in more detail. Q: What do your findings reveal about taste buds? Prof. Jeong explained, "Our taste buds are made up of various cells that detect different flavors like sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami. It's long been known that these taste buds are closely connected to our taste nerves, as they are where the initial taste signals are formed before being sent to the brain." Jeong's team confirmed what scientists have known for decades - that when the nerves to a taste bud are cut, the bud degenerates and later regenerates as the nerves regrow. But their study advanced this understanding by showing that the extent of degeneration and recovery depends on the type of taste cell involved, with sweet-sensing cells proving far more resilient than other types. "We used nerve transection in mice to mimic injury and found that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells consistently survived. In organoid cultures, these cells continued to grow even when survival factors were withdrawn. But when we blocked c-Kit with imatinib, the surviving sweet cells disappeared and regeneration was delayed. Some Type III cells acquired stem-like properties, helping repair the epithelial lining around taste buds. This shows that multiple cell types are involved in recovery - c-Kit+ sweet cells lead regeneration, while Type III cells contribute to repair," Prof. Jeong said. Q: What could this mean for the future of taste research? "This is the first discovery that allows us to selectively control specific types of taste cells. While it does not immediately translate into treatment, it provides a foundation for future work on taste resilience and recovery. In the long term, this could guide new approaches to improving nutrition, supporting patients with taste disorders, and even advancing flavor science. By identifying c-Kit as a key factor in sweet cell survival, we now have a building block for more precise control over taste," Jeong noted. This study shows that c-Kit–expressing sweet cells are central to taste bud regeneration after nerve injury, with Type III cells also contributing through repair. By identifying c-Kit as a protective factor, the research explains why some taste qualities persist longer than others and lays the groundwork for future efforts to selectively control taste. c-Kit signaling confers damage-resistance to sweet taste cells upon nerve injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Results from a randomized clinical trial published in Pediatrics show that pediatricians who received targeted educational and clinical decision-support tools were significantly more likely to advise parents to introduce peanut-containing foods early – an approach recommended by national prevention guidelines but often underused in practice. We found that supporting pediatricians with training, electronic health record prompts, and educational materials for parents significantly improved their ability to counsel families on early peanut introduction." Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, lead author, pediatrician and researcher at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, and Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine "Because pediatric visits at four and six months are so busy, this support is critical to ensure families receive clear guidance," Dr. Gupta added. "Our hope is that these conversations will help parents feel confident introducing peanut products early. The randomized trial included 30 pediatric practices in the Chicago and Peoria regions, spanning federally qualified health centers, private clinics, and academic practices. Intervention practices received a clinician training video, an electronic health record (HER)-embedded decision-support tool, and visual aids for parents; control practices did not. The primary outcome was clinician adherence to guidelines, documented in EHR data at the four- or six-month well-child visit. Lucy Bilaver, PhD, lead statistician for the study and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, noted the importance of leveraging EHR data for this pragmatic trial. "We were able to measure the primary outcome by making use of the clinical notes and structured data that pediatric clinicians generate during these well-child visits." "While more work is needed, the success of this intervention supports wider dissemination to prevent peanut allergy in children," said Dr. Gupta. Dr. Gupta holds the Mary Ann and J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>International Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW) takes place globally from October 6-10. The survey asked over 1,000 American adults questions about their understanding of plasma donation and lifesaving plasma-derived medicines. Plasma, a component of blood, is essential in producing treatments for a variety of serious health conditions, including immune deficiencies, bleeding disorders, severe burns, and more. It is also used in everyday health care settings, such as during surgeries, childbirth, and organ transplants. The need for plasma-derived medicines continues to rise as science reveals new uses and indications, as advances in standards of care expand their role in treatment. Eight in ten survey respondents have never donated plasma. The survey also revealed a perceived disparity between blood and plasma donation, with 65% of respondents believing there is a greater need for donated blood than plasma, and 60% feeling that blood donation benefits more people. During IPAW, it's important to recognize plasma donors as everyday heroes because, as the survey shows, Americans know that plasma donation saves lives." Anita Brikman, President and CEO of the Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association "As a patient who relies on the generosity of plasma donors, I feel optimistic about the survey results," said Lillie Hunnicut, a Seattle-based plasma advocate and common variable immune deficiency patient who shares her journey on social media as @chronically.lils. "Donating plasma helps create medicines that help me and many others thrive! Thanks to my plasma-derived therapy, I can now run, hike, climb, and be active and present in my daily life in a way that I wasn't for several years before my diagnosis and treatment. I am so grateful to the many donors who have given me not just my life back – but have strengthened my sense of hope in humanity." "An estimated half a million Americans have been diagnosed with a primary immunodeficiency (PI), though the actual number is likely much higher due to widespread underdiagnosis," said Jorey Berry, President and CEO of the Immune Deficiency Foundation. "Many individuals with PI depend on life-saving plasma-derived medicines that cannot be manufactured synthetically and can only be produced through the generosity of human donors. It is my hope that this survey and International Plasma Awareness Week will shine a much-needed spotlight on the critical, ongoing need for plasma donation and help raise awareness of these often-overlooked immune system disorders."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Through landmark new guidelines released today, leading reproductive health agencies are calling for a major shift in how postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is prevented, diagnosed and treated. Even when not fatal, it can lead to lifelong physical and mental health impacts, from major organ damage to hysterectomies, anxiety and trauma. Postpartum hemorrhage is the most dangerous childbirth complication since it can escalate with such alarming speed. While it is not always predictable, deaths are preventable with the right care. These guidelines are designed to maximize impact where the burden is highest and resources are most limited – helping ensure more women survive childbirth and can return home safely to their families." Many PPH cases occur without identifiable risk factors, meaning early detection and rapid response is critical. Typically, PPH has been diagnosed as a blood loss of 500 mL or more. Now, clinicians are also advised to act when the blood loss reaches 300 mL, and any abnormal vital signs have been observed. To diagnose PPH early, doctors and midwives are advised to monitor women closely after birth and use calibrated drapes – simple devices that collect and accurately quantify lost blood – so that they can act immediately when criteria are met. In rare cases where bleeding continues, the guidelines recommend effective interventions such as surgery or blood transfusion to safely stabilize a woman's condition until further treatment becomes available. "Women affected by PPH need care that is fast, feasible, effective and drives progress towards eliminating PPH-related deaths," said Professor Anne Beatrice Kihara, President of FIGO. "These guidelines take a proactive approach of readiness, recognition and response. They are designed to ensure real-world impact – empowering health workers to deliver the right care, at the right time, and in a wide range of contexts." The guidelines emphasize the importance of good antenatal and postnatal care to mitigate critical risk factors such as anaemia, which is highly prevalent in low- and lower-middle income countries. Anaemia increases the likelihood of PPH and worsens outcomes if it occurs. Recommendations for anaemic mothers include daily oral iron and folate during pregnancy and intravenous iron transfusions when rapid correction is needed, including after PPH, or, if oral therapy fails. The publication also discourages unsafe practices such as routine episiotomies while promoting preventive techniques like perineal massage in late pregnancy, so as to reduce the likelihood of trauma and severe bleeding after birth. During the third stage of labour, the guidelines recommend administering a quality-assured uterotonic to support uterine contraction, preferably oxytocin or heat-stable carbetocin as an alternative. If intravenous options are not available and the cold chain is unreliable, misoprostol may be used as a last resort. "Midwives know first-hand how quickly postpartum hemorrhage can escalate and cost lives," said Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent OBE, ICM's Chief Midwife. But to end preventable deaths from PPH, we need more than evidence and protocols. The guidelines are accompanied by a suite of training and implementation resources, developed with partners including UNFPA. These tools consist of practical modules for frontline health workers, national-level guides for introducing new practices, and simulation-based training to strengthen emergency response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A familiar allergy spray may do more than ease sneezing, researchers find azelastine could help block COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, pointing to an accessible new line of defense. Study: Azelastine Nasal Spray for Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 Infections: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial. A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine discusses the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to placebo. Azelastine is a nasal antihistamine spray widely used to manage allergic rhinitis. Recent studies suggest that it exhibits antiviral activity in vitro against several respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2; however, its clinical efficacy remains unclear. These antiviral effects may arise following previously reported interactions between azelastine and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is primarily used by SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into cells. Other studies suggest that azelastine treatment inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) enzyme, which mediates viral attachment to the host cell. Azelastine also appears to induce changes in the σ-1 receptor and inhibits intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. Previous small randomized trials suggest that azelastine reduces the viral load in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus suggesting its potential effectiveness as a preventive. The current study was a single-center, phase II randomized controlled trial comparing the use of azelastine nasal spray with placebo in 450 individuals. A significant majority of study participants received one or more COVID-19 vaccinations, with the cohort receiving a median of three shots. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.1% azelastine or placebo nasal spray three times every day for a total of eight weeks. Notably, this dose of azelastine exceeds the twice daily use that is typically prescribed to manage moderate to severe allergic rhinitis. Study participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rapid antigen tests (RAT) twice weekly throughout the study period, and any positive test result was subsequently confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Study participants who experienced respiratory symptoms but tested negative by RAT also underwent a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. The azelastine group was less likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection than controls at 2% and 6.7%, respectively. This observation indicates that azelastine reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by about 70%. Symptomatic COVID-19 infections were less likely in the azelastine group, with azelastine recipients remaining positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 1.7 days less than the control group, as assessed by self-reported RAT. Aside from COVID-19, rhinovirus infections were the most common infection reported among study participants. Azelastine treatment was similarly found to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections, with 2% of recipients infected as compared to 6% in the placebo group. Overall, respiratory infections, as detected by PCR, affected 9% of the azelastine group as compared to 22% of controls. Participants who had antibodies indicating prior SARS-CoV-2 infection showed somewhat lower odds of testingpositive again, suggesting that baseline immune status modestly inflenced infection risk. Importantly, adverse events were similar in overall frequency between groups but more commonly considered treatment-related in the azelastine group. These findings support the potential of azelastine as a safe prophylactic approach warranting confirmation in larger, multicentric trials.” The overall rate of new viral infections was low, thus indicating that azelastine may have broad antiviral activity. In particular, azelastine conferred protection against symptomatic rhinovirus infection, which may arise due to inhibition of the rhinovirus receptor ICAM-1. The authors noted that this is one of the first clinical trials to show reduced rhinovirus infection rates following a single therapy. Azelastine is a safe, easily available, and convenient approach for pre-exposure prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be easily used in high-risk settings like public meetings or during travel. Nevertheless, the researchers cautioned that the study's single-center design, modest sample size, and potential unblinding due to azelastine's bitter taste limit generalizability. They also acknowledged that the placebo formulation itself could have had mild protective effects by stabilizing the nasal barrier. The study was funded by Ursapharm Arzneimittel GmbH, the manufacturer of azelastine nasal spray, and conducted in collaboration with Saarland University researchers. Despite these promising findings, larger trials must be conducted to validate these observations and explore the potential utility of azelastine for other respiratory viruses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An analysis of 240,000 Americans reveals that the rise in alone time began long before the smartphone boom. It points to age, life stage, and social change as the real forces behind America's loneliness epidemic. In a recent study in PLoS One, researchers examined how birth cohort, time period, and age shape the time that people spend alone when social media and smartphone use are widespread. Their findings show that social isolation has increased sharply over the past two decades, accelerating since the mid-2010s. However, smartphones alone cannot explain these changes, with generational differences and aging contributing to isolation. Surgeon General described isolation and loneliness as a national epidemic in 2023, pointing to online entertainment, remote work, smartphones, and social media as contributing factors. While these technologies allow new ways to stay connected, critics argue they reduce face-to-face connections and weaken real-world support networks. Evidence cited for rising isolation often comes from time-trend studies, such as the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which shows a steady rise in the time that people spend alone since 2003. However, these analyses may confuse three separate influences: age (isolation tends to rise later in life), period (broad societal changes such as new technologies), and cohort (differences between generations). Research shows that age may have a U-shaped effect, with social isolation rising notably after midlife due to retirement, loss of peers, and other life transitions. Cohort effects may also play a role: younger generations who grew up with smart devices may rely more on digital than in-person interactions. In comparison, older generations maintain different social patterns. Prior evidence on generational differences is mixed, with some studies suggesting younger cohorts are less socially engaged offline, and others showing stability in family and friend connections. The ATUS, conducted by the Census Bureau, collects nationally representative 24-hour diaries of daily activities through telephone interviews. Social isolation was measured as minutes spent alone during non-work activities, since work-related “who” data were inconsistently available before 2010 and could bias comparisons. The models also controlled for weekends versus weekdays and holidays, since social contact patterns vary by day type. This approach overcomes the statistical challenge that age = period – cohort by distinguishing nonlinear effects and estimating a “canonical solution line” of possible linear effects. Weighted regression models, adjusted for sampling design and non-response, estimated the net contributions of cohort, age, and period. Analyses were stratified by gender, with results visualized using two-dimensional APC plots. The researchers found that Americans are spending increasingly more time alone in non-work activities. Age patterns followed a U-shaped curve, with social contact highest in the mid-30s before declining steadily into older age. Cohort effects revealed that older cohorts (born before 1940) spent the most time alone, with levels dropping significantly among those born in the 1970s–1980s and rising again for the youngest cohorts. However, the authors emphasize that it is difficult to fully disentangle cohort effects from age effects in the ATUS data, meaning that some generational differences may reflect life-course patterns rather than actual cohort change. Advanced APC modeling confirmed that period effects (societal changes such as the spread of smartphones) did contribute to rising isolation, particularly after the mid-2010s. Yet cohort and age effects were much stronger influences. Quantitatively, the age effect was about five times larger than the period effect, roughly a 150-minute difference between mid-30s and late-70s adults, compared to a 30-minute rise over the 2003-2022 period. Gender differences emerged, with women showing steeper increases in isolation later in life, partly reflecting higher widowhood rates. This study demonstrates that while societal shifts, such as smartphone adoption, have contributed to rising social isolation, age and cohort dynamics are far more influential. This suggests that aging processes, including retirement, family changes, and widowhood, drive much of the isolation crisis. Cohort effects also indicate that older generations experience substantially higher isolation than younger ones, although these generational interpretations are tentative, given the overlap between age and cohort influences. Key strengths include using two decades of nationally representative ATUS data and applying advanced APC modeling, which allows a clearer separation of cohort, age, and period influences. However, limitations remain, including reliance on cross-sectional data, difficulties distinguishing age from cohort effects, and modest assumptions required in APC modeling. Overall, the findings reinforce the Surgeon General's warning and highlight older adults as a priority group for interventions to reduce social isolation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cervical epithelial cells are far from passive bystanders in the body's immune system. That's the conclusion of an international research team led by Associate Professor Cindrilla Chumduri from Aarhus University, and now published in the journal Science Advances. Using patient-derived 3D mini-organs, so-called organoids, and single-cell mapping technologies, the team has, for the first time, shown how distinct epithelial cell types in the cervix detect, respond to, and help neutralize infections. Importantly, the study demonstrates that these organoids faithfully recapitulate native human cervical tissue at single-cell resolution, making them powerful discovery platforms for infections, cancer and regenerative biology. "We've demonstrated that the cervix is not just a physical barrier but a truly immunocompetent tissue that orchestrates complex defense mechanisms," says Cindrilla Chumduri, associate professor at the Department of Biological and Chemical Engineering at Aarhus University. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, they mapped the gene activity of thousands of individual cells in the organoids to reveal their role in immune defense. The study found that various epithelial cells collaborate in a highly organized defense network. Within each region, specialised epithelial subtypes take on distinct tasks, such as repair, regeneration, or immune amplification. The outer ectocervical squamous cells reinforce the tissue barrier, while deeper endocervical columnar cells act as immune signalers, switching on interferon pathways, antimicrobial defenses, and antigen presentation, triggering alarms. They picked up distress signals from neighboring cells and initiated a defense response. It shows how incredibly sophisticated our tissues are," says Postdoc Pon Ganish Prakash, the study's first author. The team also decoded cellular conversations, revealing how signaling between epithelial subtypes balances defense with repair. Some subtypes acted as hubs, coordinating the activity of their neighbors. These discoveries open new opportunities for vaccines and treatments that stimulate the cervix's local defense system, rather than relying solely on the systemic immune response. We see huge potential in developing mucosal vaccines that can activate local immunity right at the infection site." The patient-derived organoids also offer a powerful new platform to study how infections like HPV and chlamydia affect cervical tissue over time, and how co-infections may increase disease risks. They allow us to test ideas and treatments in highly realistic models, far more accurate than traditional lab methods," explains Postdoc Naveen Kumar Nirchal, co-author of the study. Each subtype has its own job in protecting the cervix and preventing spread of infections to upper reproductive organs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have developed a new structure determination method using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which shows how different parts of complex molecular machinery like enzymes move while they help catalyze reactions. The method promises unprecedented access to the mechanisms by which biomolecules work, and how they relate to illnesses. Enzymes are indispensable to the function of all biological organisms, including humans. While snapshots captured using X-ray or cryo-electron microscopy have revealed their intricate molecular structure, they are a constant blur of motion when they are at work. Their atomic scale structure is constantly changing, capturing other biomolecules and helping them react in a carefully choreographed sequence. While clearly important, these rapid motions at the nanometer scale are difficult to capture. Now, a team of researchers led by Associate Professor Teppei Ikeya from Tokyo Metropolitan University have used NMR spectroscopy to capture how different parts of enzymes move. Essentially, ensemble structure is the collection of all states a macromolecule can take, and how likely it is to take each. The team demonstrated their method with yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1 (YUH1), an enzyme in yeast that helps it recycle ubiquitin, a protein that regulates various intracellular events. By integrating multiple analytical methods using NMR spectroscopy, they were able to create an ensemble map for YUH1 for dynamics over the millisecond time scale. This new mechanism was supported by the way in which mutant versions with incomplete "gating lids" failed to show the same enzymatic activity. The team's findings reveal how the dynamic nature of enzymes plays an important role in how they function. The method can be applied to a vast array of biological structures in their natural environment, promising a new approach for scientists to access underlying mechanisms and potential pathologies.
