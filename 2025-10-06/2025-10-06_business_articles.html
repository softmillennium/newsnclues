                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday explained why he's bullish on Take-Two Interactive, saying it's set to dominate the video game space now that its top competitor is going private. "This was an industry with three major players, but now, with Activision gone and EA going private, Take-Two's now the only major publicly-traded American video game company that's a pure play," Cramer said. Not only were some very sophisticated investors willing to pay a premium for EA, but Take-Two has real scarcity value now." Take-Two is known for a number of popular video game series, namely the Grand Theft Auto franchise. The company is gearing up for a May 2026 release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," the latest iteration of the series, which gamers have been anticipating for more than a decade. Its predecessor, "Grand Theft Auto V," is one of the best-selling video games ever, having sold more than 200 million copies since it came out in 2013. Take-Two's stock has climbed over the last few months, and shares are currently up 39.6% year-to-date. Last week, the company's peer Electronic Arts announced it would be acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners in a deal worth $55 billion. Cramer noted that Electronic Arts' takeover comes two years after Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, another major American video game publisher. He also said that while Microsoft and Sony have large gaming divisions, most of their sales come from other businesses. Cramer also pointed to several aspects of Take-Two's business he finds impressive, including results from its most recent quarter. The company beat Wall Street's estimates and raised its full-year forecast for net bookings. Take-Two said new player accounts for GTA Online have grown more than 50% year-over-year, Cramer noted. He also said the company has other successful franchises beyond GTA, including sports game NBA 2K. While most of Take-Two's games are played on Playstation, Xbox and PC, Cramer noted its mobile business is growing nicely. "GTA VI" is likely to be a success, Cramer continued, even if the release date is delayed. "Just keep in mind, if you're taking the plunge into Take-Two here, you have to be able to stomach any delays to 'GTA VI,'" he said. "In fact, you should expect delays — video games aren't like movies, which come out on a regular schedule." Take-Two did not immediately respond to request for comment.

So, at OpenAI's big DevDay conference on Monday, I headed straight to a presentation by Scotty Huhn, who is part of a team that builds tools that help OpenAI's Sales, Customer Success, and Operations teams do their jobs more effectively. Huhn walked a packed crowd through three OpenAI software tools: GTM Assistant, OpenHouse, and Support Agent. Famously, workplace chat giant Slack used to be a game developer called Tiny Speck, and spun out its messaging tool into a full-fledged business (Salesforce bought Slack for nearly $30 billion in 2020). Huhn also noted in his presentation, and in comments afterwards, that OpenAI is open-minded about build-versus-buy decisions when it comes to workplace software. Huhn also noted that OpenAI uses Sales Cloud, Salesforce's customer-relationship-management software, as a "source of truth" for the startup's sales teams. He said some of the skills that were distilled for this tool came from a talented human sales employee called Sophie. The tool helps staff with planning for meeting potential clients, customer demos, and follow-ups after these touchpoints. Another real human employee at OpenAI had developed about 100 customer demos, and the startup used these to train its GTM Assistant tool to create better demos. Now, this knowledge has been spread among the broader team, which numbers more than 400, Huhn explained. Any missing stuff can be called out by employees and fed back into the system, constantly improving it, he added. Next up was OpenHouse, an internal HR tool that taps into existing workplace software, such as Slack and Workday, to help employees connect with each other better and keep up with company policies and other information. In one example, Huhn shared a recent sales trip to New York. OpenHouse suggested four or five staffers, and Huhn reached out to a specific person who helped him prepare better. Interestingly, there was another huge spike in recent weeks, per the chart. The tool has improved OpenAI's support ticket deflection rate, which measures how many customer requests are dealt with quickly and easily. More customer questions have been solved, and positive reviews are way up, according to data Huhn shared during the presentation. The tool has helped OpenAI bake standards and knowledge into its customer support operation, partly by taking interactions and feeding them back into evaluation processes at the end, which improves the system over time. Huhn finished by pitching the audience on using AI in general to improve their own operations. He stressed that the skills OpenAI distilled into its own AI tools ultimately came from the startup's employees, including that talented sales staffer, Sophie.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to halt key parts of a judge's order requiring Alphabet's Google to make major changes to its app store Play, as the company prepares to appeal a decision in a lawsuit brought by "Fortnite" maker Epic Games. The justices turned down Google's request to temporarily freeze parts of the injunction won by Epic in its lawsuit accusing the tech giant of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and pay for transactions within apps. A federal appeals court in July upheld the judge's sweeping order against Google. The injunction issued last year by U.S. District Judge James Donato requires Google to allow users to download rival app stores within its Play store and make Play's app catalog available to competitors. Those provisions do not take effect until July 2026. The judge also said Google must allow developers to include external links in apps, enabling users to bypass Google's billing system. That part of the injunction is due to take effect later this month. Donato issued his order in a lawsuit that Epic filed in 2020 against Google, alleging its restrictive app store rules violated antitrust law. Google has called Donato's order unprecedented, and said it would cause reputational harm, safety and security risks and put the company at a competitive disadvantage if allowed to take effect. Google in its Supreme Court filing said the changes would have enormous consequences for more than 100 million U.S. Android users and 500,000 developers. Google said it plans to file a full appeal to the Supreme Court by October 27, which could allow the justices to take up the case during their nine-month term that began on Monday. Epic has said Google is relying on what it called "flawed security claims" to justify its control over Android devices. Epic had urged the justices to allow Donato's injunction to take effect "so consumers and developers can benefit from competition, choices and lower prices." In July, a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction, ruling that the record in Epic's lawsuit was "replete with evidence that Google's anticompetitive conduct entrenched its dominance."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned Monday that OpenAI's deals with Nvidia and AMD are purely announcements, not deployments. "Now we will see what gets delivered," the Altimeter Capital founder told CNBC. OpenAI's megadeal with AMD and its relentless push to expand artificial intelligence capabilities underscores the intensifying competitive landscape. Gerstner said the deals provide "more evidence that the world will remain compute-constrained despite best efforts to bring massive supply online." Experts say it's also another validation of the AI arms race heating up, with AI a key element in the geopolitical race between the U.S. and China. OpenAI's Chinese rival DeepSeek sent shockwaves last year when it claimed to have a lower-cost AI model than its U.S. peer. And Deepseek has continued to innovate, delivering new open-sourced models using domestically made AI chips. Last week, the U.S. government issued a report warning of DeepSeek's national security concerns, Axios reported. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Center for AI Standards and Innovation said DeepSeek provides Chinese Communist Party views more frequently than U.S. models, according to Axios. OpenAI's partnership with AMD is raising hopes that it is taking the right steps to increase production and  build more complex AI models. "What we're really seeing is a world where there's going to be absolute compute scarcity, because there's going to be so much demand for AI services, and not just from OpenAI, really from the whole ecosystem," OpenAI President told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Monday. "And so that's why it's just so important for this whole industry to come together." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A top federal prosecutor in Virginia is resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to seek a criminal indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime antagonist of Trump, MSNBC reported Monday. The prosecutor, Elizabeth Yusi, works in the U.S. Attorney's Office  Eastern District of Virginia, which recently obtained an indictment of another target of Trump's ire, former FBI Director James Comey. "Yusi, who oversees major criminal prosecutions in the Norfolk office of the Eastern District of Virginia, has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC," according to MSNBC's report. "Yusi plans to present her conclusion to the president's new interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, in the coming weeks, they said," MSNBC reported. Halligan was installed in that job by Trump after her predecessor,  Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure from Trump after opposing the filing of charges against Comey. Halligan soon afterward got a grand jury to indict Comey on charges of lying during testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020. Trump over the weekend called James "SCUM" in a social media post that urged her removal as attorney general. In an earlier social media post, on Sept. 20, Trump called on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute James, Comey, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Bill Pulte, whom Trump appointed to head the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has suggested that James committed mortgage fraud in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home, where her niece lives. James's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has denied the suggestion that James said the home was her primary residence to obtain a more favorable loan rate. "Lowell noted that a power-of-attorney form had mistakenly listed the house as a primary residence, but that James herself checked 'no' on the loan application when asked if the house was her primary home," MSNBC reported. "In addition, according to Lowell, James also sent an email to her mortgage broker stating the house 'WILL NOT be my primary residence.' James, in early September, appealed an intermediate appellate court's decision tossing out a $500 million penalty  on Trump and his company in connection with business fraud.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AppLovin shares plummeted on Monday after Bloomberg reported that the SEC has been probing the mobile advertising company over its data-collection practices. The agency has been looking into whether the company violated agreements on pushing targeted ads to consumers, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report said that the SEC is responding to a whistleblower complained filed this year along with multiple short-seller reports, and added that neither the company nor its officials have been accused of wrongdoing. An AppLovin spokesperson said the company doesn't typically comment on the "existence or non-existence" of regulatory matters. "That said, as a global public company, we regularly engage with regulators and if we get inquiries we address them in the ordinary course," the spokesperson said in a statement. "Material developments, if any, would be disclosed through the appropriate public channels." AppLovin's stock has been on a tear, jumping about 80% this year after soaring more than 700% in 2024. The surge has been driven by the company's artificial intelligence technology that's allowed it to provide better ad targeting capabilities to brands. Last month, AppLovin was added to the S&P 500, replacing MarketAxess Holdings, at the same time that Robinhood joined the index in place of Caesars Entertainment. In March, Fuzzy Panda Research advised the committee for the large-cap U.S. index to keep AppLovin from becoming a constituent. Three notable short-seller firms, including Fuzzy Panda, have slammed AppLovin of late. The latest was Muddy Waters Research, which in March said the company's ad tactics "systematically" violate app stores' terms of service by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, Google, and others." In so doing, AppLovin is funneling targeted ads to users without their consent, Muddy Waters said. Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research put out reports the prior month, taking aim at AppLovin's AXON software, which drove its earnings growth and stock surge. After those reports were published, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote a blog post, defending his company's technology and practices, and taking aim at the short sellers trying to profit from AppLovin's decline.

Deloitte has agreed to partially refund an Australian government department after errors were discovered in a report completed partly using the technology. The Big Four firm had been contracted to conduct an assurance review of the country's Targeted Compliance Framework (TCF), part of the IT system that administers welfare and benefits payments. But the final report, published in July, was found to contain multiple errors, including academic references to people who didn't exist and a made-up quote from a Federal Court judgment, the Australian Financial Review first reported. The new copy deletes more than a dozen nonexistent references and footnotes, rewrites the reference list, and corrects multiple typographic errors, the AFR reported. In the updated report, Deloitte also disclosed that its methodology "included the use of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) large language model (Azure OpenAI GPT — 4o) based tool chain licensed by DEWR and hosted on DEWR's Azure tenancy." The detail that AI was used was not part of the report published in July, according to AFR. Deloitte "confirmed some footnotes and references were incorrect" on the review and has agreed to repay the final installment under its contract, a DEWR spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider. Deloitte did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider about whether AI caused the errors.</p>

Bari Weiss is now the top editor at CBS News, and she's starting day one with an "open mind" and a sense of urgency, according to a memo she sent to the newsroom on Monday. Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer who founded the anti-establishment media company, "The Free Press," just sold her company to CBS News owner Paramount for roughly $150 million, a source familiar with the deal said. As part of the deal, Weiss is now editor-in-chief of CBS News, while "The Free Press" will continue to operate separately. In her introductory memo, obtained by Business Insider, Weiss listed 10 core journalistic values she would champion at CBS News, including remaining "fair, fearless, and factual" and holding "both American political parties to equal scrutiny." Weiss said in a statement that the deal would allow The Free Press' "ethos of fearless, independent journalism to reach an enormous, diverse, and influential audience." Paramount CEO David Ellison said Weiss "is a proven champion of independent, principled journalism, and I am confident her entrepreneurial drive and editorial vision will invigorate CBS News." Read the full memo that Weiss sent to CBS News employees below: The opportunity to build on that legacy with you—and to renew it in an era that so desperately needs it—is an extraordinary privilege. I want to hear from you about what's working, what isn't, and your thoughts on how we can make CBS News the most trusted news organization in America and the world. What I can tell you on day one is that I stand for the same core journalistic values that have defined this profession since the beginning, and I will continue to champion them alongside you:</p>

The tech hiring market is being pulled in two directions: a flood of candidates for certain roles and stark shortages in others. While many tech jobs attract an oversupply of applicants, the study found that key areas, such as cloud computing, data analytics, and AI development, are still starved for qualified professionals. "What began as a cyclical downturn in tech hiring may now be entering a new phase — one shaped by the rise of AI, increased requirements, and less demand for entry-level talent," Indeed wrote in a report released on Monday. The study analyzed data from Indeed and Glassdoor on tech jobs, in combination with a commissioned survey of 1,035 tech workers in the US conducted by YouGov. The Indeed study identified tech jobs that have been axed the most when companies adjust their operations to embrace generative AI. Here are the top four roles that got cut in AI-inspired reorganizations: Indeed found that after such reorganizations, companies often reallocated resources to new tech roles. The top skills requested in tech job listings posted in the first half of 2025 include Python, SQL, and Amazon Web Services, according to Indeed data. Indeed also looked at which areas of tech exhibited the largest increases in job listings. Employers are beginning to think less about individual tools and more about clusters of tech skills packaged together, according to the study by Indeed. Python, machine learning, and data analysis are increasingly inseparable, while AWS, DevOps, and CI/CD often appear in tandem, according to the data. These clusters reflect how technical professionals are expected not only to master a language or technology, but also to possess capabilities across different technologies. Roles that once centered on traditional coding are being redefined to include prompt engineering, AI integration, and the responsible deployment of AI systems, according to Indeed. The gap between some tech job postings and available talent is widening, leaving employers scrambling to compete for a limited pool of specialists, according to Indeed. To bridge the gap, Indeed suggested that companies sharpen recruitment campaigns around what highly sought-after candidates actually value, from career growth to cutting-edge project opportunities.</p>

The Taiwanese American CEO is widely credited with transforming AMD from a struggling semiconductor firm on the brink of collapse into a global powerhouse competing head-to-head with Intel and Nvidia. When Su joined AMD in 2012, the company's market value was under $2 billion. Within a decade of her leadership, AMD's innovations in high-performance computing and graphics, especially the Ryzen CPUs and EPYC server processors, catapulted the company's value to roughly $270 billion as of October 2025. AMD's two largest competitors, Nvidia and Intel, are now working together in a strategic collaboration. Under the second Trump administration, export regulations related to China, one of AMD's largest markets, are also constantly changing. Here's a look at the timeline of Su's career, from her early life in New York City to her role as one of the most influential women in tech and innovation: The family eventually settled down in Queens, New York City. She eventually attended The Bronx High School of Science and graduated in 1986. Su attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston for many years and focused on electrical engineering. She eventually completed her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees all at MIT throughout the 1990s. Su's doctoral work on MOSFETs — tiny electronic switches inside computer chips — helped cement her future in some of the world's best-known semiconductor companies. Her later role as senior vice president and general manager at Freescale, where she prepared the company for its IPO, gave Su the experience she needed to take on roles beyond research. Su joined AMD in 2012 as the general manager of Global Business Units. AMD's market cap that year was a little less than $2 billion. At that time, most of AMD's revenue came from traditional chips for PCs. AMD began to adopt a "semi-custom" approach, which involved taking its core technologies and modifying them based on individual customer needs. This approach helped secure contracts to design and manufacture chips for Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which reduced reliance on the PC market. In October 2014, Su was promoted to become President and CEO of AMD. In 2014, AMD had a large but scattered portfolio of chips for PCs, embedded systems, graphics, and low-power mobile, but the lack of focus was causing the company to lose market share to Nvidia and Intel. In a change of direction for the company, Su decided to discard the market of low-power chips with small margins to focus on producing high-end chips for the cloud, data centers, and consoles. Before Su started gracing magazine covers, she went viral in a clip from the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, where Formula 1 commentator Martin Brundle yelled, "Excuse me, Ma'am, do you speak English?" "I'm with AMD," Su said, a response that immediately gained her the internet reputation of being humble. The original clip on YouTube has garnered more than 750,000 views and continues to circulate on Instagram Reels as an example of humility. Su also regularly appears at MIT's doctoral commencement ceremonies and established the Lisa Su Fellowship Fund, which supports female graduate students at MIT who have made accomplishments in nanotechnology. Su leads a very private life outside her role at AMD. There are no verifiable records of Lin's profession, and he is not a public figure, though the pair often appear in public events together. Su told Wired what keeps her going: She boxes with a trainer at her house for exercise, enjoys a good passion tea lemonade from Starbucks, and gets between five and six hours of sleep every night — seven on weekends. Su's work at AMD was recognized by Time magazine in 2024, which named her CEO of the Year. She became the first woman to receive this title. They are first cousins, once removed, with Huang being the elder. Su's maternal grandfather is the eldest brother of Huang's mother. Despite both immigrating to the US from Taiwan as children, they did not grow up together and had never met until well into their respective careers. On September 18, Intel and Nvidia announced a strategic collaboration to develop AI infrastructure and personal computing products together, sending Intel shares up 23% as of market close on the same day and denting AMD's stock. The collaboration is anticipated to create significant pressure on AMD by combining Nvidia's AI expertise with Intel's hardware. In March, a team of analysts from SemiAnalysis published a report that AMD's graphics processing unit is still inferior to that of Nvidia's, because AMD's existing software is preventing the chip from reaching its full potential. "Feedback is a gift even when it's critical," Su wrote in a post on X after the call, "We have put a ton of work into customer and workload optimizations, but there is lots more we can do to enable the broad ecosystem." In April, AMD estimated that the company would take a $800 million hit in revenue after Trump announced more stringent chip export controls that would ban MI308 from reaching its intended market. However, if we're not able to fully have our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play," said Su in a US Senate hearing in May regarding export controls. In July, the restriction was lifted, and AMD said it would resume compliant shipments to China. By September, both Nvidia and AMD agreed to share 15% of their revenues from chip sales to China with the US government, in exchange for maintaining their export licenses. On September 4, Su attended an AI task force meeting at the White House, led by first lady Melania Trump, and subsequently attended a dinner event hosted by Trump alongside some of the biggest names in tech, including Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Su had previously endorsed the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, though she was not a member of a formal advisory board. In a September interview with Fox Business, Su said the AI Action Plan is an "excellent blueprint for what it takes for America to lead." The move gives AMD a significant boost against Nvidia. It gives OpenAI the opportunity to take a roughly 10% stake in AMD, with shares vesting as the companies hit deployment targets and AMD hits share price targets. "This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Sam Altman, cofounder and CEO of OpenAI, said.</p>

In Atlanta and Austin, for instance, companies like Uber and Lyft started offering rides in driverless cars earlier this year, but some riders have told me they've had to go out of their way to hail one. Where I live, in Washington, DC, you can spot self-driving cars on the road — Google's Waymo, for one, is testing them in the market — but they're not yet available to customers. In San Francisco, meanwhile, self-driving cars are everywhere. On a trip there last week, I couldn't walk around the areas like Union Square and Market Street in the city center without seeing a car drive by without anyone at the wheel. It was a strange sight for me, but I shouldn't have been surprised. Waymo has been operating driverless rides in San Francisco since 2022, and the company opened the service up to anyone who downloads its app in the city last year. After days of seeing robotaxis pass me on the street, I decided to hail a Waymo car and see what it's like to ride one in a city where they've become so ubiquitous. Despite not having a human driver to pay, Waymo charged me more than Uber or Lyft would have for the same trip. After booking with Waymo, I pulled up the two other ride-hailing services to compare prices. An UberX ride would have cost around $13, while Lyft, which was running a discount when I checked, would have charged about $10. A Waymo spokesperson said that the company looks at multiple factors when pricing rides, such as the trip's duration and distance. "During busier times, such as morning rush hour and weekends, prices may be higher," the spokesperson said. Self-driving cars, especially ones operated by Waymo, are everywhere in the center of San Francisco. During the six-minute wait for my ride, I noticed at least a half-dozen other Waymo vehicles drive by, including two right next to each other. Going around town over the previous couple of days, I found out how hard it was to even walk around a city block without seeing at least one or two self-driving cars. I initially missed the notification that my car had arrived. While it took less than a minute to walk there, I wondered why the car had not navigated to my designated pick-up point. Waymo uses several factors, such as zoning, traffic, and walking distance, to determine where its vehicles pick up and drop off passengers, with the goal of "balancing safety and convenience," the Waymo spokesperson said. I knew that this was my car from the license plate, which was on-screen in the Waymo app. The street where my car stopped wasn't as busy as the one I waited on, which might explain why it was there. It reminded me to buckle my seatbelt and said that I shouldn't touch the steering wheel or the pedals. Some people I know swear that they'll never get in one of these cars because no one is behind the wheel. I didn't find it that strange, in part because I was traveling along city streets at low speeds. Fortunately, my destination was on a less-busy street than the one where I hailed the car, so it was able to pull up directly in front of my destination. As I got out, the Waymo app prompted me to leave a review and offered walking directions to my destination (which I didn't need, in this case). I felt safe riding in Waymo's vehicle, and with the company's expansion to other cities, I would try one again. If Uber and Lyft are cheaper, I'd likely take a ride with one of those services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Africa has dispatched a team of investigators to France following the sudden death of its ambassador, Nathi Mthethwa, who was found dead in his Paris hotel room earlier this week. French authorities have launched an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his passing, while Pretoria has called for a thorough investigation to determine the cause of death. National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five seasoned police officers will work alongside French authorities to ensure a thorough and transparent inquest. Ambassador Emmanuel Nkosinathi “Nathi” Mthethwa, 58, was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday, September 30, at the Hyatt Regency in western Paris. The South African diplomat had been reported missing the day before after his wife said she received a distressing message from him, in which he apologized and suggested he intended to take his life. President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed sorrow over the incident, calling Mthethwa's passing “tragic” and offering condolences to his family. His appointment as ambassador to France began in December 2023, following a long political career in which he served as Minister of Police and Minister of Sports, Arts & Culture. Complicating matters, Mthethwa had in recent weeks been mentioned during testimony at a judicial commission investigating political interference and corruption in South Africa's criminal justice system. A close ally of former South African President Jacob Zuma, who is himself facing corruption charges, Mthethwa's career was marked by controversy. His tenure as police minister remains indelibly linked to the 2012 Marikana massacre, one of South Africa's darkest post-apartheid tragedies, when police opened fire on striking miners, killing 34. National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola confirmed that five officers have been deployed to Paris to work with French authorities on the probe into Ambassador Nathi Mthethwa's death. He said the officers' role is to “support a thorough and transparent inquest.” Also join us across all of our other channels - we love to be connected!</p>
