                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff used to live and die by the hoodie. 3, who has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in in 2025, has established herself as a bona fide trendsetter. Over the course of her career, as Coco Gauff's game has evolved, so too has her fashion sense. She's now regarded as one of the most fashion-forward players on the Hologic WTA Tour, a true trendsetter. It's quite a long way from when she first turned pro back in 2018, when she lived and died by the hoodie. "I used to be a hoodie connoisseur," the World No. 3 said ahead of her opening-round match at this week's Wuhan Open. "I owned, like, 70-something hoodies and having all those ... it was really bad. I'm not very talented in a lot of things, so I think clothes is just a way to express myself." We'd argue Gauff's lack of talent argument, as she's won two Grand Slam titles and is firmly entrenched in the Top 5 ahead of the year-end WTA Finals in Riyadh, where she's already qualified and is the defending champion. The American has worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in this year, each of which has received rave reviews. As for her wardrobe off the court, she doesn't plan much in advance. Gauff takes an organic, in-the-moment approach: How she feels when she gets out of bed dictates her choice for the day. "Some days I wake up feeling really feminine and [I want to wear] skirts and stuff. Other days I wake up feeling like a tomboy. It just kind of depends on what my mood is, which is why it's always hard for me to plan outfits in advance. She received a bye in the first round of Wuhan, the final WTA 1000 tournament of 2025, and will play unseeded Moyuka Uchijima in the second round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings put on his running shoes to track down a drop shot from the Dutchman but was unable to make up the ground. After lunging forward to get a racquet on the ball, Auger-Aliassime took a slight tumble and found himself sitting on the hard courts at the ATP Masters 1000 event. Just as he was preparing to return to his feet, a ball kid made his way onto court and offered his hands to the 25-year-old, who was successfully pulled to his feet, with the ball kid receiving loud cheers from the crowd. Auger-Aliassime went on to seal a 6-4, 7-5 win and will next play Lorenzo Musetti or Luciano Darderi. Auger-Aliassime is 10th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and is aiming to make his second appearance at the Nitto ATP Finals, to be held from 9-16 November. He holds a 36-19 record on the season, according to Infosys ATP Stats and married long-term partner Nina last month.
