                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The holy grail of personal computing has always been a single, seamless experience that follows you from your pocket to your desk. For decades, this dream has been a graveyard of ambitious failures. Google's effort isn't just another Chromebook; it's a full-fledged effort to scale the world's dominant mobile operating system into the laptop form factor. Google's Android PC initiative represents a direct assault on the traditional Windows PC market and a strategic challenge to Apple's carefully segregated ecosystem. However, to succeed where others have so spectacularly failed, Google must learn from the ghost of its most notable predecessor: Microsoft's Windows 8. To understand why Google's new venture has a fighting chance, one must first diagnose the fatal flaws of Microsoft's attempt at a unified OS with Windows 8 and the Windows Phone. Microsoft's strategy was to take the dominant desktop OS, Windows, and shrink it to fit on a phone, while simultaneously forcing its touch-centric “Metro” interface onto a billion mouse-and-keyboard users. It was a bold, top-down strategy that backfired for two critical reasons. Developers for mobile were overwhelmingly focused on iOS and Android, and they had little incentive to rebuild their apps for the sliver of the market using Windows Phone. The platform became a wasteland of missing apps — no Snapchat, no native Gmail, and a constant stream of major services pulling their support. The Metro UI, with its live tiles, was actually quite innovative for a phone. Google's smartphone-first strategy holds a fundamental advantage: It already has absolute victory in the app war. The Google Play Store contains virtually every application and service a consumer could want. The challenge is not attracting developers from scratch but instead encouraging them to optimize their existing Android apps for a larger, landscape-oriented screen with keyboard and mouse input — a far simpler task. Billions of people are intimately familiar with Android's navigation, notification system, and settings menus. An Android PC would feel like a natural, more powerful extension of the device they already use for hours every day. For all its engineering prowess, Google's history is littered with the corpses of brilliantly engineered products that were crippled by inept marketing and a confusing brand message: Google+, Stadia, Allo, and the convoluted early branding of its Pixel phones. Without a massive, clear, and sustained marketing campaign that highlights a unique value proposition — perhaps seamless app continuity with your phone, unlike anything else — these devices could easily get lost in a crowded market, repeating the mishaps of the past. If Google can overcome its marketing hurdles, an Android PC could accelerate the inevitable blurring of lines between smartphones and personal computers. The rise of Android PCs as a smartphone-first computing platform exposes a strategic vulnerability for Apple, which maintains three largely separate operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, and macOS — on hardware that increasingly uses the same silicon, resulting in redundant development and creating a less-than-seamless user experience. Google, whose revenue is driven by advertising and services, doesn't care what device you use as long as you are logged into its ecosystem. An army of affordable, capable Android PCs powered by efficient Qualcomm chips directly attacks the heart of the Windows laptop market. To mitigate this, Microsoft must ultimately refine its own Windows on Arm experience, ensuring seamless performance and compatibility with legacy apps. More importantly, it must lean into its core strengths: the deep integration with enterprise and the unparalleled library of powerful, professional software that will not be coming to Android anytime soon. Google's venture into Android PCs with Qualcomm is the most credible attempt yet at creating a unified computing platform. The smartphone-up strategy is fundamentally sound, leveraging an unbeatable app ecosystem and a user base of billions. However, the project's success hinges on Google's ability to do something it has historically struggled with: market a product with clarity, passion, and persistence. If it can, this initiative won't just create a new category of laptops; it could fundamentally reshape our concept of a “personal computer,” putting immense pressure on both Apple and Microsoft to adapt or risk being rendered obsolete by the tiny computer in everyone's pocket. For years, digital artists have been caught in a frustrating compromise. Do you choose the slick, consumer-friendly experience of an Apple iPad, with its beautiful screen but glossy, imprecise drawing surface? With the release of Wacom's MovinkPad 11, that compromise is officially over. This device isn't just another tablet; it's a focused, masterfully engineered tool that sets a new benchmark for portable digital creation. The MovinkPad's OLED screen is a different class entirely for artists. Because each pixel is its own light source, it can achieve perfect, absolute blacks. This creates a level of contrast and color vibrancy that makes digital paintings pop with a depth and accuracy an iPad simply cannot match. Wacom's MovinkPad 11 pairs an OLED display with pro-level pen input, offering digital artists a portable creative tool without compromise. This isn't the slick, glass-on-glass feeling of an iPad; it provides a satisfying, paper-like resistance that gives artists the tactile feedback needed for precise linework. Paired with Wacom's latest Pro Pen 3, which uses battery-free EMR technology and boasts an imperceptible level of latency, the drawing experience is second to none. An iPad is a general-purpose computer that can also be used for artistic purposes. For that price, you are getting a display technology and a pen experience that far surpasses what Apple offers for creative work. It is, without a doubt, the ultimate portable canvas.

And to understand that while Apple's mission is to provide a walled garden, Windows has been and is used in a million different scenarios. Taking away options will ALWAYS hit some of your customers. And there are a gigantic amount of applications where you want local system accounts only. Yes, Dear Microsoft, computers without an Internet connection do exist and are a common thing.For us it's Win10 IoT LTSC so we have updates for a couple of more years, and by then hopefully the last remaining software and hardware we have will be usable with Linux.

I've got Linux all over the place, in many cloud envs, and on older hardware. But I finally committed to it on my big, meaty, main desktop. I had to hack a few minor hardware things. Nothing ChatGPT couldn't solve.I'll never do Microsoft again. I will prob add Apple MacBooks to my life, but my main grunt machine is likely to stay Linux. I had to hack a few minor hardware things.

To extend, maybe someone could build a "SysAd AI" distribution that administers itself given natural language directions? Let me know if anyone wants to invest. Think MS is in for a rough ride on Windows. Short of corporate world - Excel/Sharpoint/AD - there is just no moat. And mac side is obviously competitive on various fronts too. This is partially why major (effective) anti-cheats have migrated to the Kernel. Windows allows the big-budget games, which are often competitive games, to operate with a higher level of game integrity, which leads to more revenue generation.MacOS is not an attainable gaming support platform in general, as the people who are interested in the AAA games are going to need a Pro series or similar quality device which prices a large part of the current windows gaming audience out.As an example: it's not too expensive to buy a laptop that runs valorant, and then be funneled into the skin shop. You can get a lot more sales that way than you can through the crowd of people who are on MBP, though perhaps the MBP crew is more likely to be a whale.note: Valorant is not supported on MacOS due to the anticheat requirement, but the hypothetical still stands.

On the other hand the anti cheat side has been really ratcheting up with newer releases requiring Win 11 and Secure Boot. I somewhat hope and fear we might get a blessed version of SteamOS for the Deck that is heavily locked down and has kernel/hypervisor level anti cheat functions added to it. Essentially allowing for a boot mode similar to current consoles.

Windows on ARM has the same issues, but Prism isn't as good at x86 emulation. It's also about the market accessibility and penetration. When the base level MBA at it's lowest RAM settings is reliably running AAA games is when you might see more interest in the platform from those studios because much like the iOS market, people running Mac tend to be more readily monetized, especially through things like in-game cosmetics. The performance boost is needed when you are running Windows games under emulation.Emulation overhead is also an issue for Proton on Linux or Windows on ARM. We have decades of training in the consumer market for very simple install patterns using UIs, and minimal messing with configurations. That means you'll need a commercially backed OS where developers maintain all the things needed to support near infinite peripheral connections for a variety of use cases, clear anti-cheat interfaces, and likely clear DRM hooks as well. My hypothesis is that for Linux Gaming to truly take off, you'll need a true desktop (not steamdeck which i use weekly) that makes it a handful of "clicks" to get whatever they want installed working. That means you'll need a commercially backed OS where developers maintain all the things needed to support near infinite peripheral connections for a variety of use cases, clear anti-cheat interfaces, and likely clear DRM hooks as well. Edit: I'd guess a lot of them just follow whatever instructions they are given, and create the online account. If Microsoft thought there was a chance of serious rebellion, they wouldn't be doing it. After a lifetime of Windows use, I'd even say MacOS is almost on par with Linux for development, while Windows' best feature on this front is WSL so you don't have to use Windows. IMO the two biggest pains with MacOS is (1) brew is not as good as any other package manager in my experience (mostly in bugs that need manual fixing) and (2) Docker naturally is much worse (not just for performance, but for requiring 'Docker desktop'.) All the other pains are just the myriad niceities I miss from a lifetime of mostly Linux that MacOS just can never have. Stuff like Quickbooks, AutoCAD/Autodesk, off the top of my head It has changed somewhat since!Who gives a shit about QB? You can also just switch accounting vendor - there are quite a few. Double book keeping is a good 600 years old and can be considered pretty open source these days.You may even do some real good to your business (if you think you need QB) by going old school and really getting to grips with the numbers. Also grab an exercise book to act as a cash book and a couple of notebooks to document the system. Now, you will need to do docs too so you will need a drawing board to design your forms ...Now CAD is not the most common business software in use by anyone which is probably why you went for AutoCAD (which you have heard of), rather than, say, Solidworks or Catia.

I hate Microsoft and Windows just as much as the next self-respecting nerd, but this is no less a lol right now than it was 20 years ago. It's like Linux users all play the same 15 titles that have Linux support and think those 15 games reflect broad ecosystem support. Your grandma is not going to use Linux. I don't see windows losing desktop share anytime soon. Microsoft has a strong cycle of "applications run on Windows" -> "device vendors choose to bundle Windows" -> "people use applications on Windows", but that has been eroded, in part thanks to Wine and the work put in by people at Valve.If someone who uses their computer to browse the web and check the email picked up a laptop pre-installed with Ubuntu, they'd likely be perfectly fine with it.

If you saw the same report of that, it turned out to be a UA anomaly. Most likely very few people actually went back to Win 7, which now has quite bad compatibility with newer hardware and software. Is there a sensible % increase?I've been using Linux desktop for a decade now and I am certain it still used by few, and nothing has changed recently. I've been using Linux desktop for a decade now and I am certain it still used by few, and nothing has changed recently. I wouldn't get too excited about that. That might just be because people are moving off of desktops entirely and now only own mobile devices, a market where Linux may as well not exist (excluding Android). The number goes up, because at large, the portion of people who run Linux desktops are less likely to pivot to using only a mobile phone as they tend to be hobbyists/enthusiasts. Everyone really should be on Secure Boot / Bitlocker / TPM2.0 in the Windows space. If you dont care about security, you probably dont care about security updates, you can remain with Windows 10.Thats not to say that they went about this in a pro consumer way.

They use this overloaded language because it's so hard to argue against. Oh you must not care about being secure huh?? My point was, if you dont care about Secure Boot / Bitlocker / TPM2.0, then you probably dont also care about security updates. If your thoughts were terminated, that was entirely self inflicted. And how long would you expect Microsoft to write updates for computers with insecure boot chains, and secure boot chains? How much should they spend on mitigations for classes of attack that you can shut down just by updating? Why would they risk being seen to support a platform, that they consider a potential vector of incredibly bad PR, just for end user convenience? They have been browbeaten into being extremely security conscious, especially after the SMB stuff.Personally, my Win 10 laptops are becoming Debian laptops as god intended. Microsoft will never change its ways, no matter how much windowdressing they use underneath it is the same evil empire that it always was. Really my only complaint is the lack of a nice, modern desktop UI framework but you can't win them all. If it's so easy, which are these ways, then? Do you think they'll remain available indefinitely?Not that I don't underwrite the risks involved in getting your OS from untrusted or unreputable sources Not that I don't underwrite the risks involved in getting your OS from untrusted or unreputable sources I use this both personally and my work environment. Not only are you then not relying on modifying OS ISO's or compilations, but an XML file is relatively easy to verify that only the settings you have set are the ones being input into the system if you utilize a third party tool like the one available at schneegeas.de The pain is really starting to seem like a lower cost every day. What makes Linux especially painful to windows users is they basically need to relearn how to solve the same sort of problems they've forgotten they've been solving all the time in windows, but in Linux. Which makes the effort novel and thus especially noticeable.Basically it takes accepting one is going to get smacked with fractal side quests of searching how to fix problems for a bit, but it does get better fairly quickly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI's DevDay 2025 featured a major focus on vibe coding. The company, which boasts that it now has more than 800 million weekly active users for ChatGPT, announced a variety of new tools for developers during its annual event in San Francisco. Headlining the announcements: the ability to build with apps directly in ChatGPT (including eventually allowing “mature experiences” once age verification is in place) and the introduction of a toolkit that will help users build and deploy their own AI agents. In OpenAI's apparent effort to turn ChatGPT into a full-on frontend development environment, the company announced its new Apps SDK (Software Development Kit) that will allow devs to pull in supported third-party apps to complete tasks. In a demo, the company showed ChatGPT working with Zillow to generate a map of homes available for sale in Pittsburgh. The functionality should allow users to create tools using third-party apps, which they can preview directly within ChatGPT. According to OpenAI, Apps SDK is available immediately for Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans. Support will be available out of the gate for Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow. For now, users will only be able to make and use the apps in preview, but it plans to allow developers to submit apps later this year, with a directory for apps planned so that developers can share their vibe-based creations. There are lots of details yet to come regarding what comes from Apps SDK. Altman promised monetization guidelines, for instance, are in the pipeline. Also on the way: “mature experiences.” According to OpenAI's App developer guidelines, “Apps must be suitable for general audiences, including users aged 13–17. Apps may not explicitly target children under 13.” But that won't be the case forever. “Support for mature (18+) experiences will arrive once appropriate age verification and controls are in place,” it reads. The company recently introduced age verification tools designed to shift underage users into a ChatGPT experience with much stricter guidelines following a wrongful death lawsuit filed against the company by the family of a teenager who died by suicide after extensive conversations with the chatbot. In addition to Apps SDK, the company also rolled out its AgentKit API (Application Programming Interface), which will allow users to build their own agentic AI tools. Sticking with the vibe coding theme, AgentKit's primary feature is its Agent Builder, which allows users to program their AI agent's functionality through a visual interface. Things might no be going according to the AI master plan.</p>

I spent last weekend at Maryland's 3DPrintopia, a celebration of all things 3D printing. The event is an eclectic mix of the latest tech, mixed with homebrew 3D printers, merchants, and geeks showing off their latest projects. Over 3000 visitors and hundreds of exhibitors gathered, from big company CEOs to Cub Scouts racing their first 3D printed (not-a-pinewood) derby car. In 2026, 3DPrintopia will move to the massive Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, with 63,000 square feet of space to spread out on. Prusa Research CEO Josef Průša was seen at the festival, greeting old friends and checking out new makes, printed by fans of his 3D printers. Ryan Reid had quite the showstopper with his COREBot, a battery-powered CORE One printer mounted on remote-controlled treads that could print while being driven around the festival floor. “We shared the spec sheet with our friends from NASA and their reaction for that it's too good to be true,” he said. Here on Earth, the polycarbonate material is useful for 3D printing electronic cases and, in certain applications, can be used as an alternative to the costly and difficult-to-print PEEK. Jeff from RainMotorsports started printing in 2021, but found the old, wooden-framed Ultimaker Cupcakes fascinating. He gives them a bit of love and tuning – and new firmware – in order to get them running again. David Tobin, Executive Producer for 3D Printing Nerd YouTube channel, has added a new title to his name: Shoe Designer. David showed off a pair of shoes that he designed and is selling on the Zellerfeld platform, a German company that manufactures 3D-printed shoes with custom TPU pellet-fed FDM printers. I didn't want any of that," Tobin said. "I wanted to use additive manufacturing for functionality. I wanted these to be shoes that you could wear and no one knows you're wearing 3D printed shoes.” His shoes are designed with skateboarding in mind, have plenty of air flow, and are also machine washable. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Unlike other 3D printed shoes we've been seeing around convention halls in 2025, these are professionally 3D printed by Zellerfeld, which also makes the NIKE Air Max 1000. Zellerfeld also welcomes new designers to join the platform and gives detailed instructions on how to digitally cobble a perfect pair of TPU shoes. Co-owner Melissa Kaye said CookieCad will kick off 2025 by donating 500 spools of colorful filament to partner organizations like MakeGood, the Controller Project and the Sanjay Mortimer Foundation. Controller Project founder Caleb Kraft said accessibility tools too often look medical and boring. CookieCAD makes PLA, PETG, ABS, and TPU in fun, sparkly colors, which is even more important for MakeGood, which creates kids' mobility devices. Philip Dunham, a designer from MakeGood, said it's amazing how modern 3D printers allow him to print customized adaptive devices for users that would never be commercially viable with injection molding. At the CookieCad booth, Dunham showed off a fully 3D printed toddler mobility trainer printed in bright pink PETG with a neon yellow TPU seat and wheels. The HueForge team announced a new feature of its amazing “painting with filament” app called “FlatForge”. No longer limited to just stacking layers of filament, the new technique can put several colors on the same layer. It can be used by Bambu AMS-style systems, or tool changers like the Prusa XL and Snapmaker U1. They can also be more easily added to the top of ordinary 3D prints. The printer is still under development and will be updated with full nozzle probing, an all-metal heat break, the flexibility to support several brands of boards, and be run from a USB-C power bank.

We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Big Deals Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is. We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. This compact kit includes all the essential tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx/Torx security, and many others. MSI has some great bundles on offer, and this AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD are all available as a bundle for just $738.99. Also, you don't have to select the SSD, so you can trim off around $100 and bring this bundle down to $639.99. This deal won't last long, so make sure to jump on it if you're after the fastest CPU for gaming. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds. The SN770M, our "portable gaming king" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class. You can read more details about these drives here. The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale. This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface. The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage. The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly. The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty. The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price. This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports. We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP. Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere. For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build. If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model. The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage. As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that. Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an "Action Ring" menu. A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months. Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. There are many more 4TB SSDs on sale, as well as plenty of 8TB SSDs, which you can find in our constantly updated 4TB and 8TB SSD deals post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift once said, “You deserve to own the art you make.” Apparently, that doesn't apply to the millions of artists who have had their works fed into the data wood chipper that is generative AI tools. Instead, sharp-eyed Swifties started to spot what appeared to be AI-generated imagery within the teaser videos, and launched full Swift-vestigations into the situation. The alleged generative AI material appeared in a series of short promotional videos. The videos, originally uploaded via YouTube Shorts, are no longer available, but Gizmodo reviewed purported re-uploads found online. Each video featured letters which, when put together, provided the phrase, “You must remember everything, but mostly this, the crowd is your king.” But the mystery that Taylor's king took more of an interest in seemed to be, “Why do some of these videos look a little off?” No one from Swift's camp has confirmed in any way the use of generative AI in the promotional videos, but there is certainly enough on-screen to create suspicion. Users have pointed out clipping and disappearing imagery in some videos that suggest that what you're seeing is created with generative AI. Gizmodo reached out to Google for comment regarding its involvement in the videos, but did not receive a response at the time of publication. This is AI, watch the hanger randomly disappear Taylor swift a billionaire, is using AI for promotion. this is ai + either taylor is the powerful woman that has power over every aspect of her art (music, promo etc)so she definitely approved this or she doesn't let's not switch narratives only when it benefits taylors ok? — fifo | the life of a showgirl 🍂🍁 (@closureblvd) October 5, 2025 Not a criticism of Taylor herself, moreso her team/company…. the lettering on this treadmill is a very well known indicator of AI generated text. Generative AI systems are notoriously bad at generating text because, while these systems have been trained on massive sets of data and images containing text, the model has no concept of what it's actually “looking” at. This is why generative AI models can spit out images of watches and clocks, but it's often hard to get them to display specific times, because the model has no idea how to tell time. The Swift diehards took particular offense to an AI-generated version of a piano and guitar that was used on Swift's Eras Tour, which shouldn't be surprising given how big a deal was made of those custom-made instruments at the time. Gizmodo reached out to representatives for Taylor Swift, as well as Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of “Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” for comment regarding the potential use of generative AI in the making of these promotional videos, music videos, and the film. On its face, this appears to be a pretty major blunder. You can't tell your superfans, who think every word you speak and image you post contains secret messages, to look for clues in an AI-generated video and not expect them to spot inconsistencies. But hey, maybe these weird anomalies are just part of another Easter egg reveal, right? Vibe-coded apps offering 18+ content is a recipe for success, right? If you thought social content was trash already, just wait, the worst is yet to come.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our latest Startup Radar spotlights Seattle-area companies building software for everything from insurance commissions to leadership training. Read on for brief descriptions of each company — and a pitch assessment from GPT-powered “Mean VC,” which we prompt to offer both positive and critical feedback. The business: A project management platform that aims to turn vibe coding into a “multiplayer experience” by using multi-agent orchestration and other AI-powered tools. Co-founders Tehani Cabour and Shawn Yang both worked at French software giant Dassault Systèmes. Mean VC: “Riding the ‘agentic swarm coding' wave with a multiplayer twist could make CodeChimp the darling of dev teams sick of solo LLM prompts and endless PR reviews. But buzzwords and cohorts don't ship stable code — unless you prove clear productivity gains and developer trust, you'll drown in the same hype pool as every other AI-coding startup chasing GitHub's shadow.” Handles donor development, ticketing, marketing, communications, class registration, tuition, and more. Co-founder Max Thayer was a founding member of Anker US and helped lead business development manager at e-commerce agency Oceanwing. Mean VC: “Targeting arts organizations with a unified CRM and ticketing platform is smart — this niche is underserved, loyal, and still trapped in spreadsheet purgatory. But calling yourself ‘Ticketmaster for the performing arts' is a dangerous flex unless you plan to match its scale, integrations, and uptime — otherwise, you're just a boutique tool with Broadway dreams and community-theater resources.” The business: AI-powered operating system for insurance distribution that automates commission tracking and reconciliation. The company has raised a pre-seed round from AI2 Incubator and other investors. But insurance tech is a graveyard of integrations and edge cases, so unless Rem nails data accuracy and carrier cooperation, it'll spend years debugging spreadsheets instead of scaling revenue.” The business: AI training platform built on a developmental psychology framework to help leaders improve how they communicate, coordinate, and collaborate — both internally and with customers. Also partners with training providers to turn their frameworks into AI simulations and coaching tools. Leadership: CEO Tammy Wang held data science leadership roles at Korn Ferry and Riviera Partners, and was a senior director at Zillow. Mean VC: “Blending developmental psychology with AI-driven leadership training is a clever way to move beyond generic chatbots and into measurable behavioral change. Still, the corporate training market is littered with ‘transformational' tools that never survive budget season — Simsola will need undeniable ROI data, not just eloquent theory, to stay in the lineup.” The business: Developing an SDK for spatial AI reasoning and memory. Vergent recently won a pitch event at AI House in Seattle. Mean VC: “Building an SDK that gives LLMs genuine spatial reasoning is ambitious and could open up massive new verticals — from robotics to AR design to autonomous inspection. But ‘pre-launch, no revenue, won a pitch' is startup bingo for ‘impressive demo, unclear business,' and unless Vergent quickly proves a commercial use case, it'll stay more sci-fi than SDK.” Join BMC and Ben Rogojan (aka the Seattle Data Guy) for an evening of data, drinks, and drop-in networking at Rhein Haus Seattle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. As part of Best Buy's “Techtober” sales event, I stumbled upon the best laptop deal I've seen in a while. It's for $450 off the Acer Swift 16 AI (8/10, WIRED Recommends), costing $800. Now, I'm not saying $800 qualifies this as a “budget” laptop, but you have to check out the specs on this thing to see why I'm raving about the discount. That OLED screen even has a 120-Hz refresh rate. Importantly, it also comes with an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V CPU, an efficient processor known for getting great battery life and decent performance. Our own testing resulted in 13 hours of YouTube video playback, which isn't quite as long as other laptops with this chip. Look, the Acer Swift 16 AI wouldn't be my first choice based on looks alone. It's a bit chunkier than I'd prefer at 0.79 inches thick. Another really solid option I'm seeing is the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $900. It has a slightly smaller 15.3-inch screen, but it's a match with the Acer Swift 16 for specs, including the CPU and OLED display. Best Buy's Techtober runs through October 12, which just so happens to align with Amazon's October Prime Day sales event, also known as Big Deal Days. That being said, there will be a lot of great laptops on sale during Prime Day, so make sure to check back for the list I curated of all the best laptop deals happening this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI announced on Monday that it will acquire several data centers' worth of chips from AMD in a blockbuster deal that could also give OpenAI the option to acquire a roughly 10 percent stake in the chipmaker. It's another bold bet from OpenAI that demand for generative artificial intelligence will continue rising—bubble be damned. OpenAI said in a blog post this morning that it would commit to purchasing 6 gigawatts' worth of AMD chips over the next several years. The deal also involves AMD issuing OpenAI the right to purchase up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock (roughly a 10 percent stake). OpenAI will be able to acquire the stock as it deploys AMD's chips. "Our view is that we're nowhere near the top of the demand curve as every major enterprise, cloud provider, and sovereign initiative is scaling AI infrastructure in parallel," says Forrest Norrod, an executive vice president at AMD. Today's announcement should also help AMD challenge Nvidia in supplying chips for AI training and inference. This deal is just the latest in a string of data center investments involving OpenAI and other tech firms. Shortly after his inauguration in January, US president Donald Trump announced that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle would invest $100 billion in building AI data centers on US soil and would pour up to $500 billion into AI infrastructure over time. “There's this basic story that scale is the thing, and that's been true for a while, and it might still be true,” Jonathan Koomey, a visiting professor at UC Berkeley who studies computing and data center efficiency, told WIRED in September, talking about an OpenAI-Oracle deal to create three new data center sites. Derek Thompson, a prominent economics reporter, noted in a recent post that the tech industry is projected to spend around $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year—while demand for AI services from US consumers stands at just about $12 billion a year, according to one study. OpenAI had a strategic relationship with AMD prior to today's announcement. Su said that AMD has been getting feedback from customers for a few years as the company has been designing the upcoming MI400 series of chips, and that OpenAI is one of those marquee customers. Altman noted on stage that the industry's move toward reasoning models has been putting pressure on AI model makers in terms of efficiency and long-context rollouts and that OpenAI needs “tons of compute, tons of memory, and tons of CPUs,” in addition to the Nvidia GPUs that the generative AI industry is so reliant on. Su, at that event, described Altman as a “great friend” and an “icon in AI.” Update 10/02/25 3:00pm ET: This story has been updated to include additional comment AMD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,” Altman said. The launch highlights OpenAI's push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman described as like Canva for building agents. “It's a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,” Altman said. Evals for Agents introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform. Finally, AgentKit includes access to OpenAI's connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an “admin control panel” while maintaining security and control. To prove how easy it is to use AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is Amazon priming little kids for future careers as delivery drivers? The new, 92-page Amazon holiday gift catalog features a ride-on delivery van suitable for kids ages 2 and up. It does come with three little Amazon boxes which feature wooden toy vehicles inside. Maybe it can be loaded with books for a real throwback Amazon vibe. The van, by longtime toy wagon maker Radio Flyer, sells for $46 online. Foot power is about as sustainable as it gets, so the vans should help with Amazon's push to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. And finally, little 2-year-old delivery drivers are probably still in diapers, so the toy van is unlikely to need one controversial accessory — the alleged (and disputed) driver pee bottles that created such a public relations mess for the company several years ago.
