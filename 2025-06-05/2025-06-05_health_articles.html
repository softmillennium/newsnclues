                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that poor sleep quality is related to relationship insecurity, which moderates the effect of sleep quality on daily feelings of jealousy. Results show that anxious attachment, which involves difficulties with trust and low self-esteem in relationships, was related to poorer sleep quality. The study also found that poor sleep quality was associated with more daily feelings of jealousy, but this effect was only significant for those with high levels of attachment anxiety. Interestingly, poor sleep wasn't uniformly related to all negative socioemotional outcomes. This suggests that attachment style might shape which emotions are most affected by sleep quality." The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. In addition to adequate duration, healthy sleep requires good quality, appropriate timing and regularity, and the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders. The study involved 68 young adults who completed questionnaires about sleep and relationships. They also completed daily self-reports capturing experiences of social emotions and behaviors over a two-week period. "People with anxious attachment, or those who struggle with insecurity in relationships, may be especially vulnerable to feelings of envy and jealousy when they're sleep deprived," said Alvarado. "This helps us understand why some individuals may have more difficulty navigating social situations when they're tired and could inform more targeted interventions that consider an individual's relationship style when addressing sleep issues." The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Tuesday, June 10, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. 0163 Sleep Quality and Social Interaction: The Moderating Role of Attachment Style.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with multiple collaborators, have developed a compact diagnostic platform that can evaluate antibody protection against COVID-19 using only a single microliter of fingertip blood. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge and individual vaccination or infection histories grow more complex, there is an urgent need for accessible tools that can assess immune protection quickly and accurately. The TOI platform addresses this challenge by combining microfluidic biosensing and chemiluminescence detection in a portable format suitable for both clinical and field use. This design supports the rapid and quantitative evaluation of IgG binding levels, binding kinetics, and virus inhibition capacity-all using only a small drop of fingertip blood, without the need for complex laboratory equipment or large sample volumes. Compared with traditional assays such as ELISA or virus neutralization tests (VNTs), TOI significantly reduces testing time and operational demands. These features enable accurate, high-resolution immune analysis at the point of care. A key innovation in the methodology is the development of RIVIA 2.0, a rapid in vitro inhibition assay that emulates viral neutralization. Central to this advance is the rational protein engineering of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S-ECD) trimers, synthetically optimized with orientation-specific Avi-biotin tags to ensure consistent and functional surface presentation. These engineered protein probes, paired with human ACE2-Fc receptors, form a highly controlled binding interface that enables precise measurement of neutralizing antibody activity within just 20 minutes. By applying synthetic biology principles to optimize these probes, RIVIA 2.0 significantly improves the speed, reproducibility, and scalability of functional immune testing over conventional neutralization assays. The system was validated with 135 samples from 113 individuals, including a subset followed over six months. The results confirmed TOI's ability to detect broad-spectrum and high-titer antibody responses, particularly among individuals with hybrid vaccine regimens. Importantly, the researchers proposed a preliminary IgG concentration threshold (~20 ng/mL) associated with reduced short-term infection risk, highlighting TOI's potential for predictive immune monitoring. Beyond COVID-19, the platform could be adapted for other infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, or future viral threats. It also holds promise for therapeutic antibody development and vaccine efficacy studies. This study demonstrates how TOI bridges the gap between advanced laboratory diagnostics and real-world application. By combining speed, sensitivity, and multi-dimensional immune assessment in a highly compact format, TOI sets a new benchmark for personalized and scalable infectious disease management. The research was led by SIAT in collaboration with Peking University, Changping Laboratory, Shenzhen University, the National Innovation Center for Advanced Medical Devices, Sino Biological Inc., University of Michigan, and the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Birmingham spin-out Linear Diagnostics has been awarded £1m funding to finalize the development of a rapid test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in partnership with the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre (HRC) in Diagnostic and Technology Evaluation and the North East Innovation Lab, part of Newcastle Hospitals. Linear is developing a low-cost, accurate, near-patient diagnostic platform, that aims to diagnose infection from a single sample faster than any commercially available alternative. The funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation programme covers a three-year package of work, which will culminate in the first test of the technology on clinical samples in a real-world setting, and readiness for clinical trials. The company has now shown that it can detect bacterial STIs, urinary tract infections, and viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 in as little as 5 minutes. It is here that rapid testing is essential to stop the chain of transmission, so patients can be diagnosed and start treatment within one clinic visit. The most difficult criteria to achieve in diagnostic testing is combining rapidity with accuracy. While rapid lateral flow meets the ideal timeframe of 20 minutes to diagnosis, it struggles to meet market requirements for high sensitivity and specificity. And while Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests deliver high accuracy, samples are sent to laboratories for analysis, meaning the waiting time for results may be days. We are developing a near patient device that will overcome this conundrum." Dr. Jean-Louis Duprey, Head of Research and Development at Linear Diagnostics The HRC, hosted by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with Newcastle University, will help to evaluate the technology. Dr. Jana Suklan, Senior Methodologist at the HRC, said: "The NIHR HRC in Diagnostic and Technology Evaluation is delighted to be collaborating with the North East Innovation Lab to support Linear Diagnostics with their exciting technology. Through reviewing clinical guidelines and speaking with healthcare professionals as well as patients and the public we will pinpoint how the platform can be developed and used so it can improve patient care."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Giving a P2Y12 inhibitor anti-clotting drug to patients with coronary artery disease is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke compared with traditional aspirin, with no increased risk of major bleeding, finds a study published by The BMJ today. P2Y12 inhibitors are often given to patients alongside aspirin ("dual therapy") after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) - a procedure to widen or unblock a coronary artery - to help prevent cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. After several months, patients are usually switched from dual therapy to lifelong aspirin, but some trials have suggested that a P2Y12 inhibitor may be more effective for long term prevention than aspirin. To explore this further, researchers analysed individual patient data from five randomized clinical trials involving 16,117 patients (average age 65; 24% women) who were assigned to a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) or aspirin after completing dual therapy following PCI. After an average follow-up period of around 4 years, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy was associated with a 23% lower risk of an outcome that combined cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke, compared with aspirin, with no significant difference in major bleeding. This means that for every 46 patients taking a P2Y12 inhibitor instead of aspirin after dual therapy, one cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke would be prevented. When considering outcomes individually, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy reduced heart attacks and stroke compared with aspirin. But they say no significant difference in major bleeding between groups was seen, and results were consistent after further analyses accounting for factors such as age, sex, geographical region, smoking, previous heart attack or stroke, underlying conditions and medication history, suggesting they are robust. "Overall, this study supports preferential P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy prescription over aspirin due to reductions in major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) without increasing major bleeding in the medium term," say researchers in a linked editorial. However, they note that "medium term efficacy does not necessarily extend lifelong, which is the duration we advise patients to continue these medications." As such, they suggest that "a large-scale globally representative trial directly comparing different monotherapy strategies (including discontinuation) with extended follow-up would benefit our understanding of the long-term impact of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy across the treatment class for secondary prevention following PCI."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), led by Jorge Alegre-Cebollada, has developed an innovative method, called TEVs-TTN, for studying the specific mechanical functions of proteins through their controlled cleavage, a process that renders the proteins unable to sense and transmit mechanical force. The study, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, demonstrates that interrupting mechanical transmission by the protein titin precipitates muscular diseases. This finding opens new routes to understanding muscular dystrophies and other diseases associated with the protein titin. Mutations in the titin gene (TTN) are a leading cause of congenital muscular diseases and cardiomyopathies, explains first author Dr. Roberto Silva-Rojas: "Many of these mutations generate a prematurely truncated form of the protein, impeding its correct anchoring in the sarcomeres and disrupting muscle function." Through controlled cleavage of titin with TEVs-TTN, the CNIC team was able to replicate the sarcomere disorganization typical of patients with titin mutations. As Silva-Rojas explains, muscles with cleaved titin show similar defects to those observed in patients, including cell-volume reduction, nuclear internalization, mitochondrial aggregation, and interstitial fibrosis. This makes TEVs-TTN an ideal tool for testing therapies designed to mitigate the effects of impaired sarcomere integrity." Nevertheless, these cells survived, suggesting that similar processes might operate in other situations, such as muscle tears, heart failure, or cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy. Just as titin is critical for force transmission in sarcomeres, other proteins, such as dystrophin, dystroglycan complexes, integrins, and lamins, play critical roles in extracellular matrix regulation and cell membrane integrity. These advances, in turn, could pave the way to the development of new therapeutic strategies for many diseases beyond those affecting muscle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milan, have found that gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in combination with AAV6 vectors can trigger inflammatory and senescence-like responses in blood stem cells, compromising their long-term ability to regenerate the blood system. The study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, outlines new strategies to overcome this hurdle, improving both the safety and efficacy of gene-editing-based therapies for inherited blood disorders. The research was led by Dr. Raffaella Di Micco, group leader at SR-Tiget, New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Investigator and Associate Professor at the School for Advanced Studies (IUSS) of Pavia, in collaboration with Professor Luigi Naldini, Director of SR-Tiget, and several European research partners. Homology-directed repair (HDR)-based gene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) holds great promise for the treatment of genetic blood diseases. Despite significant advances in HDR-based gene editing, translating these approaches into safe and effective clinical therapies for patients remains a major challenge. While the technology shows strong potential in laboratory settings, achieving reliable, durable outcomes in human hematopoietic stem cells - without compromising their function - has indeed proven difficult. This reduces their ability to regenerate blood cells after transplantation, which can limit the long-term success and therapeutic benefit of gene therapy." We were surprised by the persistence of senescence-like features even months after transplantation," says Dr. Anastasia Conti, first author of the study and Project Leader in Dr. Di Micco's lab. "Our findings suggest that stem cells retain a 'memory' of the genetic engineering process. These adverse effects are not just transient stress responses-they can lead to lasting impairments in stem cell function. To counteract this adverse effect, the researchers tested two complementary strategies:transient p53 inhibition and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, particularly Anakinra - a clinically approved IL-1 receptor antagonist. "Both approaches significantly reduced senescence markers in edited HSPCs and improved their ability to regenerate a healthy, diverse blood system in preclinical models. Importantly, Anakinra also reduced potential genotoxic events, such as large deletions and translocations, suggesting a safer profile compared to p53 inhibition alone" says Dr. Conti. These findings help explain setbacks observed in recent clinical trials involving HDR-based gene editing in blood stem cells and offer a concrete path to enhance outcomes. The strategies proposed could be especially valuable for diseases requiring long-term correction and stem cell engraftment, such as immunodeficiencies or bone marrow failure syndromes" concludes Dr. Di Micco. With a longstanding history of pioneering gene therapy technologies, SR-Tiget continues to lead international efforts to optimize CRISPR-based treatments for safe clinical translation. Senescence and inflammation are unintended adverse consequences of CRISPR-Cas9/AAV6-mediated gene editing in hematopoietic stem cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A baby's makeup of gut bacteria - their microbiome - which starts to form as soon as they are born, could help protect against viral infections later in childhood, a new study suggests. As part of the largest study of UK baby microbiomes to date, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University College London (UCL) found that babies with a specific mix of gut bacteria at one week old, which was only found in some babies born vaginally, were less likely to be hospitalised for viral lower respiratory tract infections (vLRTI) in the first two years of life. Building on previous findings from the UK Baby Biome Study, this new research suggests that certain microbiome compositions could give different benefits, such as protection against viral infections. While further research is needed to prove this link, these findings could help shape future research and prevention efforts for childhood respiratory diseases, including the development of effective infant therapeutic probiotics to reduce the risk of respiratory infections in infants. Overall, this study sheds more light on how the gut microbiome in early life plays a role in our future health and underscores the importance of even larger studies such as the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project. The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of millions of microbes that are vital for human health and important in immune system development. A different study from the same team also found that all UK babies have one of three bacteria within the first week of life, called pioneer bacteria. Two of these, Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) and Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve), are considered beneficial as they help promote the development of a stable microbiome. In new research that builds on both of these studies, the team at the Sanger Institute and UCL analysed stool samples from 1,082 newborns to understand how pioneer gut bacteria acquired in the first week of life may affect their health outcomes later in infancy. The researchers found some babies born vaginally, with a higher amount of pioneer bacteria B. longum in their early gut microbiome, alongside other similarly beneficial Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species, such as B. bifidum and B. dorei, had a lower risk of being admitted overnight to hospital for vLRTI, when compared to all other babies. This was still seen after taking account of important confounders, such as babies receiving antibiotics, and whether babies were fed with breastmilk, formula, or both. However, not all babies born vaginally had the same microbiome composition. The team identified two other groups of babies based on their microbiome profile, who had a higher risk of hospital admission for vLRTI compared to those in the B. longum group. These other microbiome profiles were found in babies born vaginally and by C-section. It's important to note that the team observed this finding as an association, otherwise known as correlation, and further research is needed to prove any causal links. While this study has examined only one common health outcome in children - respiratory viral infections - future research with a much larger cohort is needed to investigate whether the possible protective effects of B. longum, or other potentially beneficial pioneer bacteria such as B. breve, may be linked to other health outcomes. Dr Cristina Garcia-Mauriño, first author of the study at UCL, said: "Viral lower respiratory tract infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalisation in young children, and our research raises the possibility that certain early gut microbiomes might help lower this risk. Further research to confirm and explore the factors behind this, including if there is an interaction between the gut microbiome and the lung microbiome, could lead to new ways to help prevent respiratory infections in childhood." While observational, our findings that certain infant microbiomes are linked to a lower risk of viral respiratory infection in childhood are striking and new. Professor Louise Kenny, Lead Investigator of the Children Growing up in Liverpool (C-GULL) study and previously a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, who was not involved in this study, said: "A Caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby. Dr. Trevor Lawley, senior study author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and co-lead of the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project, said: "Within the first few days of our lives, our microbiomes are already thriving ecosystems that develop and adapt with us as we age. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that the pioneer gut bacteria acquired in early life may influence health later on, highlighting how gut microbes could help protect us from infections and other diseases. Different types of infant gut bacteria may provide different benefits, and understanding these could pave the way for developing targeted infant probiotics to support early microbiome development. In the future, we might be able to create personalized interventions that optimise a child's gut microbiome based on their unique microbial profile, promoting better health and development."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant will aid Wayne State University researchers in measuring the effects of fentanyl during pregnancy on maternal behaviors and offspring at birth through early development. This two-year, $423,500 grant, "Understanding the effects of gestational fentanyl exposure on external morphology, neonatal opioid withdrawal, and brain volume, morphology and neurochemistry of offspring," is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the NIH. I was working on the study of illicit fentanyl use and Susie's lab was looking at the effects of opioids, including morphine and buprenorphine, during pregnancy." Both researchers credited a news report and a previous NIH grant received by Brummelte to examine the effects of opioids during pregnancy as what inspired them to explore this area. "An NBC news report came out that was based on a published study suggesting there's a new syndrome called fetal fentanyl syndrome related to fentanyl use during pregnancy," said Perrine. "This was characterized by birth defects such as facial abnormalities, webbed toes and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. The team will also measure brain volume, morphology and the neurochemistry of offspring using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in vivo. "No previous studies used proper animal models to study the effects of fetal fentanyl syndrome," said Brummelte. "In humans, timing, exposure, the dose and so forth can make interpreting findings difficult so we wanted a more controlled study using the funds from this grant." "We want to see if it is just fentanyl or if there are other factors at play such as polydrug use or genetic predisposition that can contribute to these defects." Perrine and Brummelte hope their findings may help mitigate adverse health outcomes of infants exposed to fentanyl during pregnancy. "Once we find out what specifically is causing these defects, we can start looking for solutions to prevent them or address them," said Brummelte. "R21 awards from the National Institutes of Health help support researchers explore new research ideas that could foster innovative ideas that may one day lead to breakthrough discoveries," said Ezemenari M. Obasi, Ph.D., vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. Perrine and Brummelte will have that may lead to new knowledge about the impact of fentanyl on unborn children."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will GII.17 remain on top, or could another variant emerge next? Research: Increasing Predominance of Norovirus GII.17 over GII.4, United States, 2022–2025. A recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases reported rising predominance of norovirus GII.17 in the United States (US). Noroviruses are genetically stratified into 10 genogroups (GI to GX) and further into 48 genotypes and 60 P-types. GI and GII genogroup viruses are responsible for the most outbreaks. Between 2011 and 2024, GII.4 viruses accounted for over half of outbreaks in the US in each season (September to August). In 2014, several Asian countries found that a GII.17 strain had completely replaced the GII.4 Sydney strain, and it was also detected in the US and Europe. Nevertheless, GII.4 viruses rebounded in 2016, regaining their global predominance. The likely ancestor of the current GII.17 virus is a strain that caused an outbreak in Romania in 2021. However, during the 2023-24 season, several countries recorded increased GII.17 outbreaks and cases. First, they examined the genotype distribution of outbreaks between September 2022 and April 2025 using CaliciNet, the norovirus outbreak surveillance network of public health laboratories in the United States, which serves as a valuable early warning system for emerging strains. Genotypes were categorized into three groups: GII.4 (including GII.4 Wichita, GII.4 Sydney, and GII.4 San Francisco), GII.17, and all other genotypes. Moreover, by the 2024-25 season (data up to April 2025), GII.17 accounted for 75.4% of outbreaks so far, whereas GII.4 outbreaks accounted for 10.7%. Increase in outbreaks of norovirus GII.17 over GII.4, United States, 2022–2025. The 2024–25 season is truncated to September 2024–April 2025. Peak norovirus activity was observed in February, March, and January, in 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons, respectively. The distribution of GII.17 and GII.4 outbreaks showed no regional differences. This shift coincided with a decline in GII.4, which had traditionally been the leading cause of outbreaks in the US. However, during the 2024-25 season, it began in early October. Meanwhile, the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons followed a more typical pattern with cases declining in the spring months. With the decline in GII.4 outbreaks, whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season remains unclear. In summary, GII.17 accounted for 75% of all outbreaks in the 2024-25 season so far, replacing GII.4 as the predominant strain in the United States. Further genomic analyses of GII.17 and identification of neutralizing antibodies against GII.17 could help determine whether the GII.17 strain will persist. In addition, continued surveillance of norovirus is necessary to determine whether GII.17 will remain the predominant strain. Tarun is a writer based in Hyderabad, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While UK families cherish the togetherness of takeaway nights, new research uncovers surprising trends about who is most likely to indulge, challenging assumptions about income, convenience, and the real meaning of family meals. Friday night tradition reigns supreme: Takeaways weren't just occasional; they became a ritual, with 75% of families specifically choosing Friday or Saturday dinners for their shared takeaway meals. In a recent article published in the journal Appetite, researchers at the University of Reading, UK, investigated how families incorporate takeaway food – defined as hot food prepared away from home, collected or delivered, and eaten at home as part of a shared family meal – into shared family mealtimes. They aimed to understand the emotional and social benefits of eating together as a family that might counterbalance, though this remains unproven, the poor nutritional quality of their meals. They found that almost all families (96%) reported at least occasional takeaway use, although most had takeout less than once a week. Parents viewed it positively as an enjoyable, convenient treat that fostered family connection. While most parents expressed positive views, some also acknowledged guilt or concern about the healthiness of takeaways. Parents from low-income households and the most deprived neighborhoods were more likely to consume takeaways frequently. However, this pattern was non-linear: high-income households showed a similar frequency to low-income ones, suggesting complex socio-economic influences. "Break from the grind" mentality: Parents didn't just find takeaways convenient; they described them as a vital "break from the grind" of daily meal planning, cooking, and cleanup, reducing stress and workload. These options fall under the UK's broader definition of takeaway food, which typically refers to hot meals collected or delivered for consumption at home. However, strong evidence suggests that takeaway food is nutritionally poor, being high in saturated fat, salt, and sugar. It is associated with higher calorie intake, increased body fat, and risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Despite these concerns, family mealtimes, regardless of the food served, are associated with numerous positive developmental outcomes. Research suggests that regular family meals are linked to enhanced mental health and well-being in children and adolescents, as well as decreased involvement in high-risk behaviors. Although preparing meals can be stressful for parents, they generally value the shared experience and often prioritize health in their meal planning. In this context, takeaway food may reduce conflict and ease preparation while still promoting family togetherness. Yet, it remains unclear whether these social benefits can counterbalance the nutritional drawbacks. This study, therefore, aimed to explore how often and why UK families consume takeaway food for family mealtimes, and under what circumstances. Frequency Takeaway Food Consumed for Family Mealtimes (N = 189) Joint decision-making wins: Choosing wasn't left to one person. Nearly three-quarters of families (73%) reported everyone having input on both the restaurant and what to order, making it a shared family activity. This cross-sectional study employed an online survey to investigate how UK families utilize takeaway food for family meals, focusing on parents of children aged 18 years or younger residing in the UK. Recruitment combined broad outreach via social media and parenting forums with focused efforts to reach underrepresented groups, such as single parents, ethnic minorities, and low-income households, through targeted platforms and community noticeboards. Participants who accessed the survey were first presented with study information and definitions of key terms, such as "takeaway food" and "family mealtime." The questionnaire, developed by the researchers, consisted of five closed-ended and six open-ended questions assessing frequency, timing, participants, and reasons for takeaway use. It also captured decision-making processes related to ordering and consumption settings. Quantitative data were analyzed using binary logistic regression to explore which socio-demographic factors predicted frequent takeaway consumption. Variables for the regression model were selected through univariate analyses, and categorical variables were collapsed when needed for statistical validity. TV dinners vs. table talk: While over half (54%) ate their takeaways at the table together, almost a third (32%) opted for TV dinners, enjoying their meals in front of the screen in the living room. About one-third lived in more deprived areas, though the sample underrepresented ethnic minorities (14% vs 18% national average) and overrepresented degree holders (78% vs 34% nationally). Takeaway food was consumed infrequently (less than once a week) by 74% and frequently (once a week or more) by 26%. Regression analysis revealed that middle-income households were significantly less likely to frequently consume takeaway food compared to low-income households. Participants from moderately deprived areas were also less likely to consume frequently than those in the most deprived areas. Takeaway food was most commonly consumed during Friday or Saturday dinners (75%). Families usually ate together at the table, made joint decisions about orders, and mostly ordered through food apps, especially pizza. Convenience, ease, enjoyment, and treating the family were key motivations. Downsides included high cost, unhealthiness, occasional guilt, and dissatisfaction with quality or service. The researchers found that while takeaway consumption was common, it was usually infrequent, framed as a convenient and enjoyable family treat. Socio-demographic analysis revealed a non-linear relationship where both low- and high-income families consumed takeaway more frequently than middle-income families, indicating complex socio-economic dynamics. The study's mixed-methods design and efforts to recruit a diverse sample strengthened its findings. Future research should explore broader eating patterns and socioeconomic status-linked motivations, particularly how families balance convenience and enjoyment with nutritional concerns.
