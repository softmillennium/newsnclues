            The number of newborns in Japan is decreasing faster than projected, with the number of annual births falling to another record low last year, according to government data released Wednesday.
    


            The health ministry said 686,061 babies were born in Japan in 2024, a drop of 5.7% on the previous year and the first time the number of newborns fell below 700,000 since records began in 1899. It's the 16th straight year of decline.
    


            It's about one-quarter of the peak of 2.7 million births in 1949 during the postwar baby boom.
    


            The data in a country of rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the sustainability of the economy and national security at a time it seeks to increase defense spending.
    


            Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as “a silent emergency” and has promised to promote more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women.
    


            Japan is one of a number of east Asian countries grappling with falling birth rates and an aging population. South Korea and China have fought for years to encourage families to have more children. Also on Wednesday, Vietnam scrapped decades-old laws limiting families to two children in an effort to stem falling birth rates.

            The health ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate – the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. The number of marriages was slightly up, to 485,063 couples, but the downtrend since the 1970s remains unchanged.
    


            Experts say the government's measures have not addressed a growing number of young people reluctant to marry, largely focusing on already married couples.
    


            The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to bleak job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that adds extra burdens for women and working mothers, experts say.
    


            A growing number of women also cite pressure to take their husband's surname as a reason for their reluctance to marry. Under Japanese law, couples must choose a single surname to marry.
    


            Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, with 40% of the population over 65.

            The bodies of two Israeli-American hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 were recovered from southern Gaza during a military operation, according to a statement from Israeli military and the Shin Bet security agency.
    


            Judy Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023.
    


            “Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our deepest condolences to the dear families,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            The prime minister thanked the soldiers and commanders involved in the operation and vowed to return all remaining hostages held in Gaza.
    


            “We will not rest and we will not be silent until all our hostages – both the living and the fallen – are brought home,” he said.

            A spokesperson for kibbutz Nir Oz said the bodies of the two hostages had been returned to Israel overnight and would be laid to rest.
    


            The couple had four children and seven grandchildren.
    


            In a statement the Kibbutz remembered Gadi as “a sharp-minded man, a gifted wind instrument player since the age of three, deeply connected to the land, a chef and advocate of healthy vegan nutrition and sports,” and Judy as “a poet, entrepreneur, creative spirit, and devoted advocate for peace and coexistence.”
    


            A statement from the family, provided by the Nir Oz spokesperson expressed gratitude for the return of their missing loved ones.
    


            “We are grateful for the closure we have been granted and for the return of our loved ones for burial – they went out for a walk on that Black Saturday morning and never came back. In this emotional moment, we want to thank the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and security forces who carried out this complex rescue operation and have been fighting for us for over a year and a half, and to everyone who supported, struggled, prayed, and fought for us and for all the people of Israel,” it said.
    


            The family also thanked the US administration, the Israeli government and the FBI for their “tireless work and ongoing support.”
    


            “Still, our hearts will not be whole until all 12 hostages from Nir Oz – and all 56 hostages – are brought home,” the statement added.
    


            A total of 56 hostages remain in Gaza, including one taken in 2014. Twenty are believed to still be alive.
    


            Throughout 20 months of war in the territory, the rescue of hostages and the recovery of bodies has happened on only a few occasions. In late-March, Israeli forces recovered “findings” related to Manny Goddard, whose body was taken into Gaza after he was killed by members of Islamic Jihad on October 7, according to the IDF and the Shin Bet.

            In January, Israeli forces recovered the body of soldier Oron Shaul, who was killed during a battle in the enclave in July 2014. The remains of another soldier killed during the same conflict remain in Gaza.
    


            Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the latest news, calling it both heartbreaking and healing.
    


            “Their return reminds us all that it is the state's duty to bring everyone home, so that we, the families, together with all the people of Israel, can begin the process of healing and recovery,” a statement from the forum said.
    


            “Decision-makers must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial,” it added.
    


            Bringing back all hostages still in Gaza is among Israel's primary war goals, along with the destruction of Hamas. The release of hostages has been a key point in mediated negotiations aimed toward a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group.

US President Donald Trump is frustrated with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, seeing him as a “bad guy” who is pushing the world closer to nuclear conflict, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

Unnamed Trump advisers told the NYT that the president is “exasperated” with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky, but “reserves special animosity” for the Ukrainian leader, who he has publicly criticized on several occasions.

Although Trump has said it is “understandable” that Ukraine wants to keep fighting, his stance toward Zelensky is notably harsher than toward Putin, the report says. The US president reportedly tends to be more deferential to his Russian counterpart, and previously believed that their “very, very good relationship” would help end the conflict. Because of this, he has thus far refrained from imposing new sanctions on Moscow.

On Wednesday, the two leaders held a 75-minute phone conversation in which Trump said they discussed Ukraine's recent attack on Russian airbases that reportedly host strategic aircraft. “President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Trump said.

The Kremlin confirmed the conversation. Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov said Putin informed Trump of Ukraine's efforts to derail peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, including “terrorist” attacks on civilian targets. Ushakov was apparently referring to incidents of railroad sabotage in the regions of Bryansk and Kursk in which seven people died and more than 100 were injured.

Following the call, Zelensky posted a statement on Telegram, saying: “If the world reacts weakly to Putin's threats, then he perceives this as the world's readiness to turn a blind eye to his actions… If the strong do not stop Putin, it means that they share responsibility with him.”

Trump previously engaged in a public spat with Zelensky when the two met at the White House in late February. At the time, the US president accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War III,” and of being “disrespectful” and ungrateful for American support.

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the UK-based Oxford Russia Fund of conducting a covert influence campaign in Russian universities aimed at undermining national security. The organization had already been declared ‘undesirable' by Moscow, a designation that prohibits its activities and implies involvement in hostile propaganda efforts.

The Oxford Russia Fund began operating in Russia in 2006 with the stated aim of supporting higher education in the humanities and social sciences. While it claimed to provide scholarships and academic resources, its work raised red flags for the authorities.

In 2021, the Prosecutor General's Office banned the organization, citing threats to national sovereignty. According to the FSB, it nonetheless continued to operate subversively, maintaining covert ties with university staff and facilitating the spread of foreign narratives.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the FSB said faculty members in the regions of Volgograd, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk, and Tomsk worked with the banned organization to distribute materials promoting “support for sexual minorities and LGBT values” – content considered incompatible with traditional Russian values. The NGO also allegedly collected sensitive data about the country's internal political and socioeconomic situation amid the Ukraine conflict.

Fifteen Russian nationals have received official warnings under criminal statutes related to collaboration with foreign entities deemed a threat to national security. One professor has already been fined for involvement with a banned group. The FSB and Prosecutor's Office also issued a formal warning to one of the universities involved.

The FSB claimed that British intelligence services have long targeted Russian academia as a channel for ideological influence. “They seek to raise a ‘new generation' of Russian citizens in a manner beneficial to London,” the statement said.

Over the past decade, Russia has introduced stricter laws to shield society from LGBT propaganda.

In 2013, LGBT content was banned for minors, and by 2022, the ban extended to all audiences. In 2023, the ‘international LGBT movement' was designated as a terrorist organization.

In its statement, the FSB announced that the British Council, the UK's primary cultural outreach institution, has also been declared ‘undesirable'. The authorities accuse the NGO of serving as a vehicle for British intelligence, using cultural programming as cover to destabilize sovereign states.

The UK has taken an increasingly hostile posture toward Russia, imposing sweeping sanctions while continuing to provide military support to Ukraine, despite the ongoing peace talks mediated by the US.

Russia's ambassador in London, Andrey Kelin, recently denounced Britain's behavior as “belligerent and irresponsible,” calling its support for Ukraine “senseless” and “reckless.”

SEOUL, June 5. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reassured visiting Secretary of the Russian Security Council Sergey Shoigu that Pyongyang will continue supporting Moscow in international affairs, including the situation in Ukraine, the Central Korean News Agency (KCNA) reported.

Kim received Shoigu on June 4.

""Kim Jong Un affirmed that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will, in the future, too, unconditionally support the stand of Russia and its foreign policies in all the crucial international political issues including the Ukrainian issue and responsibly observe the articles of the treaty between the DPRK and Russia,"" KCNA said.

""He expressed expectation and conviction that Russia would, as ever, surely win victory in the sacred cause of justice for defending national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests,"" it said, adding that the North Korean leader wished the Russian people ""eternal victory, prosperity and happiness.""

According to the agency, the meeting was held in a friendly atmosphere of trust. The sides discussed the situation around Ukraine and the international agenda. ""The talk confirmed the consensus of stand of the two sides,"" KCNA noted. Shoigu conveyed the Russian leadership's special gratitude for ""the matchless heroism and self-sacrificing spirit of the Korean people's excellent sons who participated in the operations for liberating the Kursk area and defended the precious part of the Russian territory as their own motherland, fighting shoulder to shoulder with Russian soldiers in the same trench."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, June 5. /TASS/. Moscow will take into account in negotiations the fact that the Kiev regime is becoming terrorist, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

""Of course, the fact that the Kiev regime has acquired all the characteristics of a terrorist regime cannot be ignored in the future. It will be taken into account,"" he replied, when asked whether Russia would suspend negotiations with Ukraine in the event of more terrorist attacks.

In the late evening of May 31 and early hours of June 1, the Kiev regime carried out terrorist attacks on railway lines in the Bryansk and Kursk regions.

In the Bryansk region, seven people were killed in the incident involving a passenger train, and 120 victims sought medical assistance. In the Kursk Region, the train driver and two of his assistants were injured.

On June 1, Kiev used drones to carry out terrorist attacks against airfields in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions. The attacks in the Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions were repelled. Several aircraft caught fire as a result of the attacks, but all fires were extinguished.

Young voters are worried about their financial future and rising costs, advocacy organisation NextGen America says

Young people in the US are looking for Democrats to embrace economic populism and authentic candidates willing to fight for them, says the new leader of a group dedicated to youth voter mobilisation.

Victoria Yang is the interim president and executive director of NextGen America, an organisation that engages young people through voter education and registration. She succeeds Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, who held the post for four years.

In an interview with the Guardian, Yang criticised Democrats for failing to grapple with daily cost-of-living concerns and urged the party to learn from Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (AOC) focus on pocketbook issues.

NextGen recently commissioned Tulchin Research to conduct six online focus groups with swing voters aged 18 to 26 in battleground states. The focus groups found the young voters were anxious about their financial future and the rising cost of housing, food and education. Many felt the system was rigged, with billionaires riding high and working people short of opportunities.

These concerns ranked far higher than the war in Gaza or so-called “woke” topics such as gender pronouns. Speaking by phone from Boston, Yang said: “Right now what they're feeling is the everyday things that are affecting them: the cost of groceries, gas prices, paying for rent. That is the number one issue; we need to be focused on that.

“There's so many other issues as well but that's what our priority is: connecting with them on these issues and how, if they get involved and make their voices heard by voting, by volunteering, by signing petitions and fighting back, they're going to make the change that they want to see.”

The focus groups praised progressives Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez for their willingness to fight and directly address economic concerns. But last year's Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, who moderated some of her policy positions during the campaign, was seen by many as inauthentic.

“What our focus group showed was that economic populism is still resonating with young people and their messaging was not. If you go to the grocery store and you're now paying $6 or $7 for a gallon of milk and you were paying $4, you're now having to stretch your dollars further, and those little incremental increases all add up. The house that you're trying to save for, or trying to pay for college, has a domino effect.

“The Democrats were not leaning into that. We need to be leaning into making sure that young people understand: we hear you, we see you, this is what we're trying to do and then laying out a plan for that.”

Yang knows what she is fighting for. She was a small child when her family fled political persecution in Laos, spent time in a refugee camp in Thailand, then, 45 years ago, settled in southern California.

“I am living proof of the American dream and all the things that it holds. My mom, a single parent, put us through college and worked hard. I remember the struggles of having to figure out how to put food on the table. She did it as a waitress in a small Chinese restaurant.”

She also knows her way around the Democratic party, having worked with the Obama Foundation's Girls Opportunity Alliance, Democratic National Committee and former senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer. She takes over at NextGen at a moment when the party is embroiled in an identity crisis amid fears that young voters have veered to the right.

Yang says NextGen's work shows the value of consistent engagement. In eight key states last year, 67% of the young voters that NextGen registered and communicated with regularly went on to cast a ballot, compared with 54% youth turnout nationally. The lesson for Democrats is that it is not enough to show up late and take young voters for granted.

Yang continued: “You can't expect that you're going to knock on young people's doors the last two or three months of the election and then say, you should vote for candidate A and B, when the whole time you've never spoken to them or engaged them.

“The message that we want to make sure people understand and the party understands is that you have to invest in young people. They're at the very beginning of their voting journey and they haven't developed the voting muscle yet. They have to be educated.”

The focus groups found that TikTok was the dominant platform for this generation, and Instagram and YouTube are also very popular. Most participants do not seek out news but look to creators who are funny, authentic and able to make complicated subjects easier to understand.

Yang commented: “We have to make sure that we can help them understand what is at stake and talk to them authentically through the platforms and the way they want to be engaged. That's what this is all about.”

Democrats failed in this objective, Yang argues, by arriving late and over-relying on traditional media. NextGen is exploring new methods, such as an artificial intelligence chatbot on community platforms such as Discord, and an explicitly non-partisan approach to encouraging voter registration.

Much has been written about how Donald Trump outplayed Democrats by exploiting the “manosphere”, appealing to young men through rightwing influencers and podcasters. But Yang believes that economic imperatives eclipse gender, race or other variables.

“Inflation, tariffs, the cost of living – that resonates whether you're a man or woman, Black, brown, yellow or red. That's what will connect with young people. They might not identify with the Democratic party but the issues that are important to them resonate across all genders and all sectors.”

Young voters favored Harris over Trump in the 2024 election by four percentage points, a much smaller margin than the 25-point advantage young voters gave Joe Biden over Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast data. Opinion polls suggest that the shift was especially pronounced among young men.

Participants in NextGen's focus groups felt that Democratic party has lost touch with people it claims to represent. They described Democrats as weak, too willing to roll over and disconnected from everyday concerns. Some described Democrats as a “mom”, caring but overprotective, while Republicans were seen as a “dad”, assertive and focused on discipline and control.

Only 36% of Americans view Democrats favourably, according to a new Economist/ YouGov poll, but Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's Fighting Oligarchy Tour has been rallying big and enthusiastic crowds. Yang remains optimistic and hopeful for the future.

“Senator Sanders and AOC are talking on the issues. It's less about the party. It's less about even candidates or anything like that. It's an economic populist message and that is what they're leading with. The party is probably seeing that and getting the message but we still have to continue to engage and work on it.”

Young people are persuadable, she added. “Just because they voted maybe for Trump in this election doesn't mean that we don't have an opportunity to get them in the midterm, in the next presidential, if we meet them where they are, if we engage them all year round now until then. That's the key message.”

Yang's commitment to economic justice, a social safety net and giving young people a fair shot was shaped by her own experience. As an immigrant, she benefited from government programmes such as welfare assistance, free school lunches and a Pell Grant, which provides federal aid for college students with exceptional financial needs.

“That helped to define me and brought me to this work. The country as a democracy has provided all these opportunities. I want to make sure that these policies continue so when folks need it they have a safety net but also be able to create a life. It was transformative in so many ways and now I get to sit here and have a conversation with you.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani sparred on stage as all candidates said they'd stand up to Trump

In the first debate of the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, nine candidates took the stage and fielded questions on housing, affordability, crime, policing, public safety, political regrets and how each candidate would handle the Trump administration if elected.

The candidates included former New York governor Andrew Cuomo; democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani; the New York City council speaker, Adrienne Adams; the current New York City comptroller, Brad Lander; former comptroller Scott Stringer; former Bronx assemblyman Michael Blake; state senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos; and former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson.

The current mayor, Eric Adams, was not present on Wednesday as he is running for re-election as an independent candidate, although he ran as a Democrat in 2021.

A few takeaways from the debate:

Throughout the debate, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the current frontrunner in the race, was grilled on his record by his Democratic rivals.

Cuomo spent much of the night sparring with progressive state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who is polling second. Mamdani accused Cuomo of being beholden to wealthy donors and corporate interests, saying Cuomo prioritized the “1%, the billionaires and the profitable corporations”, over “working-class New Yorkers”.

Cuomo dismissed the 33-year-old as inexperienced, calling Mamdani “very good on Twitter and with videos” but saying he was someone who “produces nothing”.

“He's been in government 27 minutes, he passed three bills, that's all he's done,” Cuomo said. “He has no experience with Washington, no experience with New York City.”

Trump came up several times, as the candidates agreed the next mayor must be ready to stand up to his administration if elected mayor, though they differed on who was best equipped to do so.

“I know how to deal with Donald Trump because I've dealt with him before,” Cuomo said, citing his experience as New York governor.

Mamdani warned that “President Trump will target whomever is the next mayor of this city” and said that is “important that we have a mayor who will fight back and that is what I will do”.

“I am Donald Trump's worst nightmare as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in,” Mamdani added. “And the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in DC.”

Cuomo fired back, saying that “Donald Trump would go through Mr Mamdani like a hot knife through butter”.

“He would be Trump's delight,” Cuomo added.

Mamdani countered: “It's true that I don't have experience with corrupt Trump billionaires that are funding my campaign. I don't have experience with party politics and insider consultants. I do have experience, however, with winning $450m in debt relief for thousands of working-class taxi drivers and actually delivering for working-class people.”

Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the New York city council, said she would take legal action against Trump when necessary.

Asked how they would respond if the Trump administration ordered city-run hospitals to stop providing care to undocumented patients or risk losing millions in federal funding, all candidates voiced strong opposition to Trump's recent crackdown on immigration in general.

“You cannot give in to Mr Trump and his demands,” Cuomo said. “If you give in to him, he is a bully, I know him well, if you give in to him today, you will be giving him your lunch money for the rest of your life.”

“You have to fight him and the way you fight him is not by suing him,” the former governor said. “We need a national coalition, which we can put together of like-minded states and cities that will oppose these actions and then we're going to have to eventually beat him politically in Congress.”

Whitney Tilson said that if Trump were to act “illegally to try and blackmail us, you have to sue to restore that funding”, adding that he was “appalled by what Trump is doing to terrorize immigrant communities” and would “fight him tooth and nail”.

Mamdani said that New York City was “under attack by an authoritarian Trump administration”.

“The way that we fight back is ensure that our local institutions continue to provide the services to each and every New Yorker,” he said. “We will tell those institutions that we will provide that funding and we will get that funding by taxing the 1% and the wealthiest corporations.”

Pressed about his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic – a 2021 report by the New York attorney general found that his office undercounted thousands of deaths of state nursing home residents – Cuomo defended his record, claiming the numbers were not, in fact, undercounted.

He also denied the sexual harassment allegations against him that led to his resignation. “I said at the time that if I offended anyone it was unintentional but I apologize and I say that today,” he said.

City council speaker Adrienne Adams took a swipe at the current mayor. “My biggest regret is believing that Eric Adams would be a good mayor for all New Yorkers,” she said.

The city's comptroller, Brad Lander, said that he regretted not pushing “for more housing in his Brooklyn district when he was a city council member”.

Mandani used the moment to target Cuomo once more, saying that “as a Democrat, one of my regrets is having trusted the leaders within our own party, leaders like Andrew Cuomo”.

Cuomo, on the other hand, said his biggest regret was “the state of the Democratic party”, which prompted backlash from other candidates on stage. “No personal regrets?” asked Adrienne Adams. “No regrets when it comes to cutting Medicaid or healthcare? No regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?”

Cuomo said her claims were “not accurate”, adding: “Medicaid went up under me. I pushed President Trump to give us everything he had, leading the way during Covid.”

The moderators asked the candidates how much they pay in rent or mortgage in New York City. Adams said she owned her home and that it was paid off; Mamdani said he pays $2,300 a month in rent for a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria.

Kremlin comments seem to confirm reports Putin told Trump Moscow was obliged to hit back

Europe live – latest updates

Russia will respond to Ukraine's daring drone operation “how and when” it sees fit, the Kremlin has warned, seeming to confirm reports Vladimir Putin had told Donald Trump that Moscow was obliged to retaliate.

Ukraine has been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend, targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday what Moscow's response would be, said: “How and when our military deems it appropriate.”

Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields, during an unannounced phone call on Wednesday.

The US embassy in Ukraine warned of a continuing risk of “significant airstrikes” and advised its citizens to exercise caution.

Hours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine overnight. At least five people, including a one-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother, were killed when a drone struck a residential building in the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky.

The child was the grandson of an emergency responder, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said. “One of the rescuers arrived to respond to the aftermath right at his own home,” Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. “It turned out that a Shahed drone hit his house.”

In the southern city of Kherson, a large hole was seen in an administration building after missile attacks by the Russian army.

But Russian officials have suggested that Moscow has yet to respond to Ukraine's weekend drone attack, which came a day before two bridges collapsed, killing seven people – attacks Moscow blamed on Ukrainian sabotage.

After Ukraine carried out its unorthodox operation using drones smuggled into Russia on trucks, pro-Kremlin war bloggers and prominent commentators posted on Russian media to demand retribution, with some calling for nuclear retaliation.

While Russian officials have previously indicated their willingness to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, analysts consider the deployment of such weapons on the battlefield highly unlikely at this stage of the war.

Russia's nuclear doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks that pose a “critical threat” to the country's sovereignty.

In a podcast for the independent outlet  Meduza, Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russian nuclear forces, rejected suggestions that Ukraine's recent drone strikes could justify such a response. He argued the operation did not threaten Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity, nor did it undermine the retaliatory capacity of its strategic nuclear arsenal.

A nuclear strike would also be strongly condemned by China, Russia's most influential ally, with Xi Jinping previously warning Putin against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Instead, as in past responses to Ukrainian military successes, Moscow may launch a wave of deadly ballistic missile strikes – or deploy its experimental Oreshnik missile, which was used at least once last year.

Ukraine has intensified its sabotage operations over the past week, including detonating underwater explosives beneath a key bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

On Wednesday, a visibly angry Putin for the first time reacted to the Ukrainian attacks, accusing Kyiv of “organising terrorist attacks”. “How can we have meetings like this under these conditions? What is there to talk about? Who has negotiations with … terrorists?” he said.

Trump has not publicly commented on the Ukrainian drone operation, but sources who reportedly discussed it with him told Axios he described the attack as “strong” and “badass” and saw it as a setback to his diplomatic initiative to end the war.

While the drone strikes dealt a tangible blow to Russia's military capacity and offered a morale boost for Kyiv, the broader picture remains less rosy for Ukraine.

More than three years after launching its invasion, Russia is largely on the offensive, making steady battlefield gains in eastern Ukraine and continuing to pound Ukrainian cities and civilians with drones and missiles.

Putin's forces have been advancing further into Ukraine's northern region of Sumy, threatening the regional capital after taking more than 150 sq km of the area in less than two weeks.

With Putin showing no willingness to agree to a lasting ceasefire, Ukrainian officials and the military are preparing for a Russian summer offensive, with Moscow intent on advancing into the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Ministry of Environment yesterday officially set up a Resource Circulation Upgrading Center at the Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab on the UN's World Environment Day, with the goal of promoting industrial cooperation and innovation in circular economy development.

Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming (彭?明) told a news conference that the center was established to drive the circular economy by reducing single-use plastics and waste production, echoing the theme of World Environment Day for this year: “Beat plastic pollution.”

The center would focus on circular designs, procurements and marketing, allowing green industry start-ups to use the platform for information exchange and innovation incubation, as well as facilitating the integration of existing industries into circular businesses, he said.

About NT$20 million to NT$100 million (US$668,405 to US$3.34 million) of the NT$10 billion green growth fund would be invested in promoting the circular economy next month or in August, Peng said

The ministry would adopt solid application and approval procedures to prevent embezzlement, he added.

Resource Circulation Administration official Wang Yao-cheng (王耀晟) said that the center would be a platform for circular business opportunity matching, circular product demonstration and promotion, circular industrial upgrading and circular innovation incubation.

Circular product research and development subsidies would be allocated from the green growth fund to provide talent and resources for emerging entrepreneurs in the circular industry, he said.

The center is aimed at reinforcing the triad of resource circulation — industries, designs and consumers — and would regularly organize exhibitions, workshops and collaboration opportunities to help inspire more innovative circular designs and product plans, Wang said.

The first exhibition at the center revolves around textile products and would run through next month, with other themes, including “plastics,” “inorganic materials and construction” and “electronics,” to follow later this year, he said.

The exhibition was organized in response to the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles, which seeks to achieve 100 percent recyclability and free of hazardous substances in textile products sold on the EU market by 2030, Wang said.

Manufacturers participating in the exhibition were required to introduce green designs in textile products and take responsibility for facilitating textile reuse by following the “fiber-to-fiber recycling” principle, Wang said.

For example, used coffee grounds or pineapple leaf fibers were recycled and remanufactured into yarns, textiles and other products, while environmentally friendly workwear was created using 100 percent recycled polyester fibers obtained through circular procurement, he said.

The annual index, which was published last month, evaluated 1,000 of the most populated metropolises based on five indices — economics, human capital, quality of life, environment and governance.
New York maintained its top spot this year, placing first in the economics index thanks to the strength of its vibrant financial industry and economic stability.
Taipei ranked 263rd in economics, 44th in human capital, 15th in quality of life, 284th for environment and 75th in governance,

The sports agency said in a statement that the  Chinese Taipei Table Tennis Association (CTTTA) must  explain to the public why it withdrew Yeh from the WTT  tournament in Las Vegas.
The sports agency said it contacted the  association to express its disapproval of the decision-making  process after receiving a complaint from Yeh's coach,  Chuang

His resignation was immediately accepted by the Control Yuan.

In a statement explaining why he had resigned, Lee apologized for using a Control Yuan vehicle to transport his dog to a pet grooming salon on May 20.

Astronomers on Wednesday announced they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.

Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs such as TOI-6894, which has only 20 percent the mass of our sun.

It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets, but an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy.

That makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant. The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little more than three days.

The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite telescope.

Its existence was confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.

“The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,” study coauthor Daniel Bayliss of England's University of Warwick said in a statement.

Another coauthor, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an “intriguing discovery.”

“We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet,” he said. “This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.”

The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.

The process begins when a ring of gas and dust — called a protoplanetary disc — which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. That core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.

Under that theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets, because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.

A rival theory proposes that such planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.

Neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.

The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.

Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as “hot Jupiters,” where temperatures soar well over 1,000°C.

The newly discovered planet appears to be less than 150°C, the researchers said.

“Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,” study coauthor Amaury Triaud of England's University of Birmingham said.

Footage of the collapse on Wednesday showed a huge cloud of ice and rubble hurtling down the mountainside into the hamlet of Blatten.
Swiss Development Cooperation disaster risk reduction adviser Ali Neumann said that while the role of climate change in the case of Blatten “still needs to be investigated,” the wider impacts were clear on the cryosphere — the part of the world covered by frozen water.

The New Zealand Parliament yesterday agreed on historically lengthy suspensions for three indigenous lawmakers who last year performed a haka, a traditional Maori dance, disrupting the reading of a controversial bill.

A parliamentary privileges committee last month recommended the suspension of the three Te Pati Maori lawmakers for acting in “a manner that could have the effect of intimidating a member of the house.”

The three performed the haka in November last year ahead of a vote on a controversial bill that would have reinterpreted a 185-year-old treaty between the UK and the Maori that still guides the country's policy and legislation.

The government voted through the suspensions, which would see Te Pati Maori coleaders Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi stood down from parliament for 21 days, and representative Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke for seven days.

While the members are suspended, they would not be paid or be able to vote on legislation.

Suspending lawmakers is rare in New Zealand's parliament, with only three members suspended in the past 10 years, New Zealand Parliamentary Service said.

Before yesterday, the longest suspension was for three days, said New Zealand representatives who spoke earlier in the day.

Maipi-Clarke told lawmakers ahead of the vote that the suspension was an effort to stop Maori from making themselves heard in parliament.

“Are our voices too loud for this house? Is that the reason why we are being silenced? Are our voices shaking the core foundation of this house? The house we had no voice in building... We will never be silenced and we will never be lost,” she said.

Judith Collins, who heads the Privileges Committee and serves as attorney general, had previously told parliament that the haka forced the speaker to suspend proceedings for 30 minutes and that no permission had been sought to perform it.

“It's not about the haka ... it is about following the rules of parliament that we are all obliged to follow and that we all pledged to follow,” Collins said.



                                                                                The collapse of the Swiss Birch glacier serves as a chilling warning of the escalating dangers faced by communities worldwide living under the shadow of fragile ice, particularly in Asia, experts said.

Ukraine would not have launched its drone strike on Russian strategic bombers if Moscow had accepted Kyiv's calls for a ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a June 4 meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during a recent round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

""If there had been a ceasefire, would the operation have taken place? No,"" Zelensky said when asked about the massive June 1 drone operation, codenamed Operation Spiderweb.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the strike, which reportedly hit 41 Russian military aircraft and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage. 

Zelensky added that roughly half of the planes will be impossible to repair, while others will require significant time to be put back into service.

When asked about a potential reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, Zelensky said he was unaware of any public comment. 

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, acknowledged that the strike demonstrated Ukraine was ""not lying down,"" but he warned it could escalate the war further. The U.S. president has not yet commented on the strike.

""We should choose the game rules,"" Zelensky said, underscoring that Ukraine would continue to respond as long as Russia carries out attacks against Ukrainian territory.

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from trucks hidden across Russia, struck four different Russian air bases, some of them thousands of kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The targeted facilities reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Talking about the recent peace talks, Zelensky dismissed Russia's engagement as ""artificial diplomacy,"" calling the ""peace memorandum"" it presented an ""ultimatum."" He noted that there is no sense in continuing negotiations with lower-level Russian delegates, calling instead for a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia used the talks to list its peace conditions, which reportedly included official recognition of Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories, Ukraine's full withdrawal from four partially occupied regions, a ban on joining NATO, limits on the military, and other demands.

Like the first round of talks on May 16, this week's negotiations ended without any tangible progress toward a long-term ceasefire or a peace deal. Instead, the two parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, which could involve up to 1,200 prisoners on each side.

The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that the June 1 “Spiderweb” drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian airbases.

The agency confirmed that more details about the attack will be revealed later.

“And you thought Ukraine was easy? Ukraine is exceptional. Ukraine is unique. All the steamrollers of history have rolled over it. It has withstood every kind of trial. It is tempered by the highest degree. In today's world, its value is beyond measure,” the SBU wrote, quoting Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko.

They also vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

This operation targeted aircraft that is used in frequent long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the plan had been in preparation for over a year and a half.

According to a Kyiv Independent SBU source, first-person-view (FPV) drones were covertly transported deep into Russian territory and hidden inside trucks before being launched against four major airfields.

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

More than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3, according to the source.

The Tu-95 is a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, amid ongoing U.S.-backed ceasefire talks and negotiations.

On May 26, Russian forces launched the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

Ukrainian forces launched a missile strike on June 5 targeting a concentration of Russian missile troops near the city of Klintsy in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

The strike reportedly destroyed one Iskander missile launcher and seriously damaged two others. The targeted unit, part of Russia's 26th Missile Brigade, had attempted to fire on Ukrainian territory — likely aiming at Kyiv — before it was hit, according to the military.

""Thanks to effective reconnaissance and the coordinated efforts of the Armed Forces and the Security Service of Ukraine, the targets were successfully hit,"" the General Staff said. 

The agency added that there were no civilian casualties, and assessments of Russian losses are ongoing. 

The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system used by Russia for precision strikes against military and infrastructure targets.

With a range of up to 500 kilometers (some 311 miles) and the ability to carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the system remains a key component of Russia's tactical missile forces.

Bryansk Oblast lies just northeast of Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it one of the key Russian regions bordering northern Ukraine.

The strike came as part of Ukraine's broader effort to degrade Russia's offensive capabilities.

On the same night, Russia launched 103 drones — including Iranian-designed Shahed suicide drones — and one Iskander-M ballistic missile against Ukrainian territory.

Targeting missile assets there may disrupt Russia's ability to launch precision strikes, particularly in advance of an anticipated new summer offensive.

Trump's proclamation cited national security concerns as a justification for restricting international students.Faith Ninivaggi/Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday suspended for an initial six months the entry into the United States of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard University, amid an escalating dispute with the Ivy League school.

Trump's proclamation cited national security concerns as a justification for barring international students from entering the United States to pursue studies at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university.

Harvard in a statement called Trump's proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.”

“Harvard will continue to protect its international students,” it added.

The suspension can be extended beyond six months. Trump's proclamation also directs the U.S. State Department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation's criteria.

The directive on Wednesday came a week after a federal judge in Boston announced she would issue a broad injunction blocking the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students, who make up about a quarter of its student body.

As Harvard battles Trump's international enrolment ban, hundreds of Canadian students anxiously hold their breath

The administration has launched a multifront attack on the nation's oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.

Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school's governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.

Harvard sued after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on May 22 announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enroll foreign students.

Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard's certification through a lengthier administrative process.

Opinion: America's talented foreign students could find a home in Canada

Nonetheless, Burroughs said she planned to issue a longer-term preliminary injunction at Harvard's urging, saying one was necessary to give some protection to Harvard's international students.

In an internal cable seen by Reuters that was issued a day after that court hearing, the State Department ordered all its consular missions overseas to begin additional vetting of visa applicants looking to travel to Harvard for any purpose.

Wednesday's two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism,” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries,” including China.

The FBI had “long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development and spread false information,” the proclamation said.

It said Harvard had seen a “drastic rise in crime in recent years while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus,” and had failed to provide sufficient information to the Homeland Security Department about foreign students' “known illegal or dangerous activities.”

Buildings across the center of the western city of Cologne were evacuated after the discovery of three World War II bombs. Some 20,000 people had been under evacuation orders. 

Large areas of the city center of Cologne were closed off on Wednesday as experts defused three bombs left over from World War II, which ended 80 years ago.

The evacuation operation in Cologne, which has seen plenty of them over the years, was one of the largest to ever be carried out in the city since World War II, with some 20,000 people ordered to leave the affected area.

The process of defusing the bombs had to be delayed at one point because of a resident refusing to evacuate, according to a city spokesperson.

An individual living in the old town resisted orders to leave their apartment, with public order officials, police, and the fire department enforcing removal measures.

Kai Kulschewski, head of explosive ordnance disposal in the nearby city of Düsseldorf, who is coordinating the disposal, had earlier said everything was going to plan. He had added that the defusing operation had yet to begin as of the afternoon because not everyone had been evacuated yet. 

""We can only start when the last person is out,"" he said. 

The evacuated area included the entire old part of the city, 58 hotels, three Rhine bridges, the town hall, the railway station in the district of Deutz, which lies across the Rhine from the city center, museums, a hospital and two care homes.

The city's major landmark, Cologne Cathedral, was, however, situated just outside the danger area.

Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, had warned that many trains will be diverted or even canceled, and road traffic has was severely disrupted. 

The weapons — two 2000-pound (900-kilogram) bombs and one 1000-pound bomb, all manufactured in the US — were discovered in Deutz on Monday.

In a statement on its website, the City of Cologne said, ""The evacuation is the largest such measure since the end of World War II. Everyone involved hopes that the defusal can be completed in the course of Wednesday.""

Bomb defusals are nothing new in Cologne, as it was one of the major bombing targets for Allied forces during the Second World War.

Among other attacks, the British Royal Air Force targeted Cologne with its first ""thousand-bomber raid"" on a German city overnight to May 31, 1942, dropping 1,455 tons of bombs and destroying or damaging thousands of buildings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","US updates: Trump announces full travel ban for 12 countries","https://www.dw.com/en/us-updates-trump-announces-full-travel-ban-for-12-countries/live-72793805","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:11:15 GMT","

The White House has announced a new travel ban for citizens of 12 countries — largely from Africa and the Middle East. The new rules are set to come into effect at the beginning of next week. DW has more.

Here is DW's roundup of news from the United States on Thursday, June 5, 2025:

US President Donald Trump said he didn't know if his ""great relationship"" with Elon Musk would remain the same after the billionaire criticized his key tax and spending legislation, which the president labels the ""big, beautiful bill.""

""Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. 

Trump was responding to a question from a reporter about former advisor Musk slamming the bill on social media as ""a disgusting abomination.""

Trump claimed Musk's opposition was driven by the bill's elimination of EV tax credits, which would potentially hurt Tesla.

Musk, however, has said he opposes the bill because it would increase federal deficits.

Football fans in Iran fear their World Cup dreams may be lost after the US travel ban barred them from entering the country to cheer on their team.

While the 2026 tournament will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico, most matches  — including the final — are set to be played on US soil.

Many in Iran had hoped to cheer from the stands until Wednesday when US President Donald Trump rolled out a new travel ban — to take effect from Monday — on 12 countries that included Iran. 

""My friends and I have been waiting for years to watch Team Melli [a nickname for the Iranian national team] play in a World Cup on US soil, and when they qualified, it felt like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" fan Sohrab Naderi told the AFP news agency.

""Now with the new travel ban, that dream is shattered because of politics that we don't care about and have no control over,"" said Naderi, who attended the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to see the US side beat Iran 1-0 in the group stage.

Iran has already qualified for next year's World Cup. Other countries on the list — Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen — are unlikely or near-certain not to qualify for the tournament.

President Donald Trump's administration is pressuring Serbia and other Balkan countries to accept migrants deported from the United States, Bloomberg News reported Thursday, citing sources familiar with the effort.

The reported push is part of a broader US strategy to secure agreements with foreign governments willing to receive deported individuals, the outlet said.

The White House, US State Department, and Serbia's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond.

Last month, the US Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke temporary protected status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan, Cuban, Haitian, and Nicaraguan migrants, paving the way for more deportations. Bloomberg reported that the administration has been actively exploring destination countries for those affected.

China has sharply criticized new restrictions imposed by US President Donald Trump on the entry of international students at Harvard University, calling on Washington to stop politicizing education.

""Educational cooperation between China and the US is mutually beneficial. China has always opposed politicization in this area,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a press conference Tuesday.

The statement came in response to Trump's executive order suspending the entry of new international students to Harvard for six months, citing alleged ""radicalism"" and ""worrying foreign connections"" linked to the academic institution.

Beijing warned that the measure would ""damage the image and international credibility"" of the US, and vowed to protect the legitimate rights of Chinese students and scholars abroad.

Harvard currently hosts 10,158 international students from 150 countries, including 2,126 from China, according to figures from the university's international office for the 2024–2025 academic year.

US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into what he called ""conspiracy"" to cover up former president Joe Biden's cognitive decline during his term.

""In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline,"" a presidential memorandum said.

""The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden's signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts,"" it added.

Trump and some other Republican politicians, as well as conservative US media, have long claimed this conspiracy, and it was been part of Trump's reelection campaign. 

The claims became stronger during the presidential debate before the elections last year, where Biden appeared to stumble over words and kept losing his train of thought. 

Recently, some Democrats have also begun to acknowledge that Biden was not as mentally present in recent years.

Biden, who is fighting cancer, has staunchly denied these allegations and said that these allegations are a distraction from Trump and the Republicans' attempts to push ""disastrous legislation."" 

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he was confident that NATO member states will sign up to President Trump's demand for an increase in defense spending.

Trump wants NATO allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of the GDP, up from the current 2%.

""To be an alliance, you got to be more than flags. You got to be formations. You got to be more than conferences. You need to be, keep combat ready capabilities,"" Hegseth on Thursday in Brussels, where he had arrived for a meeting of NATO defense ministers.

""It has to happen by the summit at The Hague later this month,"" he added.

NATO chief Mark Rutte has countered the demand by agreeing for 3.5 % of GDP on core military spending by 2032, and 1.5 % on security-related areas such as infrastructure.

Rutte is confident that the plan will be agreed upon, and his offer has received US backing. However, some NATO members such as Spain have expressed reluctance.

International rights groups decried President Trump's new travel ban, calling it ""discriminatory, racist and downright cruel.""

""By targeting people based on their nationality, this ban only spreads disinformation and hate,"" Amnesty International USA posted on X. 

US-baed Human Rights First also condemned the move, saying it undermined the US' founding principle of equality under law, as it targeted Muslim-majority nations. The organization wrote in a statement that the ban doubles down on Trump's ""xenophobic policy.""

“The ban will harm refugees, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable populations, including many who have been waiting to reunite with loved ones in our country,"" said Robyn Barnard, the organization's Senior Director of Refugee Advocacy.

President Donald Trump's newly imposed travel ban will not apply to athletes competing in the Los Angeles Summer Olympics set to be held in 2028, the administrative order said. 

The executive order contained a single line stating that ""any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.""

During the Summer Olympics in Paris in 2024, some 204 countries competed, including all the nations included in the executive order. Unless new guidance is issued beforehand, it would appear that fans from these nations would not be allowed to attend.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk called upon US citizens to push lawmakers to vote down President Donald Trump's key tax and spending bill.

""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman. Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL
the BILL,"" Musk wrote on his social media platform X. 

Musk recently stepped down from his role in cutting federal spending with the Trump administration. He has been a vocal critic of Trump's tax bill, which he says would increase the deficit and accelerate national debt. 

Trump calls it the ""big, beautiful bill"" but Musk has called it a ""disgusting abomination"" and warned lawmakers that they would face backlash in the 2026 midterm elections for supporting it. 

Trump has not responded to this criticism. But House Speaker Mike Johnson has questioned Musk's motives, saying the bill could negatively impact his electric vehicle company Tesla. 

The bill narrowly passed the House of Representatives in May, but now faces a tough battle in the Senate.

The Trump travel bans have attracted criticism from different idological quarters.

Congresswoman Judy Chu, a Democrat who represents California, called Trump's travel ban Trump 'bigoted and Islamophobic' in a post on X. 

""This goes against our core American values while doing nothing to make us safer,"" she said.

Immigration analyst Alex Nowrasteh from the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank, noted that terrorists from the 12 countries slapped with a total travel ban have killed one person on US soil since 1975. 

""Annual chance of being killed by terrorist from one of those countries: 1 in 13.9 billion per year,"" he posted on X. 

Oxfam America warned in a statement that the new travel ban ""marks a chilling return to policies of fear, discrimination, and division.""

The ban once again targets individuals from Muslim-majority countries and nations with predominantly Black and brown populations, it added, deepening ""inequality and perpetuates harmful stereotypes, racist tropes, and religious intolerance.""

US President Donald Trump said the full travel bans and partial restrictions — affecting 19 countries in total — were because of what he called national security and public safety threats. 

Several countries were banned because of concerns over terrorism and their governments' lack of screening and vetting measures.

These include Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Cuba. 
 
Other countries, such as Sudan, Haiti, Yemen and Eritrea, are on the list because they don't have a ""competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents,"" the White House said in a statement. 
 
For other nations, such as Chad, the Republic of the Congo and Equatorial Guinea, the White House pointed squarely to high visa overstay rates.

As well as having high overstay rates, some countries have also historically refused to take back their own citizens, the White House said, such as Myanmar, Laos, Sierra Leone and Venezuela.

The nationals of seven countries are covered by a partial travel ban: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

The partial travel ban affects people wanting to enter the United States temporarily for business (B-1 visa), tourism (B-2 visa) or a combination or both purposes (B-1/B-2 visa).

The new restrictions also also apply to those wanting to undertake academic or vocational study (F or M visa) or do a work- or study-based exchange program (J visa).

Harvard University said Trump's executive order that bans the university from bringing in new foreign students for six months is ""retaliatory."" 

""This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights,"" university officials said in a statement released Wednesday night.

""Harvard will continue to protect its international students,"" it said.

Trump said in a statement that latest order was because Harvard refused to ""provide sufficient information, when asked, about known instances of misconduct and criminality committed by its foreign students.""

Venezuela warned that travelling to the United States would amount to taking a ""great risk"" after new restrictions announced by the White House.

""Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,"" Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said on Wednesday during his weekly TV show, according to AFP news agency.

He made the comment after US President Donald Trump announced a new travel bans. 

Venezuelans are among people from seven nations affected by partial restrictions, while 12 countries have been hit with full travel restrictions.

An estimated 350,000 Venezuelans live in the United States.

While court decisions are still pending, the Trump adminstration in February broadly ended deportations protections given to Venzuelans. 

In addition to the new travel ban on 12 countries, US President Donald Trump has also moved to block nearly all international students who want to attend Harvard from entering the country. 

In an executive order signed Wednesday, Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard, one of the world's most prestigious universities, to continue hosting international students on its campus.

This is because ""Harvard's conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for international students and researchers,"" the executive order read.

The order applies to all students attempting to enter the United States to attend Harvard after the date of the executive order. It is to last for six months but allows for an extension. 

For foreign students already at Harvard, who make up around a quarter of the student body, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote.

It's a further escalation in the White House's fight with the nation's oldest and wealthiest university. 

Last week, a federal court in Boston stopped the Department of Homeland Security from pausing US visa applications from international students wanting to go to Harvard. 

Trump's order signed on Wednesday gives his administration a different legal authority to bar foreign students.

The US president said he spoke with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and accepted an invitation to China. He added US and Chinese trade negotiating teams will be meeting soon. 

US President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good phone call"" with China's President Xi Jinping on Thursday.

In comments posted on his Truth Social platform, Trump said ""some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal"" had been discussed.

The US president said the call lasted around one and a half hours and ""resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.""

Trump said Xi ""graciously invited"" him and the first lady to visit China, to which he ""reciprocated.""

""As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,"" Trump said.

Trump also made reference to the call during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office and confirmed that he would be making a visit to China.

""He invited me to China and I invited him here, we both accepted. So, I will be going there with the first lady at a certain point and he will be coming here, hopefully with the first lady of China, "" Trump said.

US and Chinese teams would be meeting ""shortly"" at a yet to be determined location the US leader said and would involve Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative, ambassador Jamieson Greer.

Trump emphasized that talks had focused almost entirely on trade with no discussions relating to Russia, Ukraine or Iran.

The call comes amid a 90-day tariff truce that came into effect last month which paused a spiraling trade war between the world's two largest economies.

Trump has lowered his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks while China also reduced its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.

The point of holding people in the notorious prison is “to instill fear in the immigrant population,” the filing states.

Immigrant rights advocates on Wednesday launched a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration for detaining migrants at the U.S. naval station in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — the site of a “notorious” prison where several foreign men and boys were indefinitely held and tortured as part of the so-called War on Terror.

The class action suit was filed in the District of Columbia by the ACLU's national and D.C. arms, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project against the secretaries of defense, homeland security, and state, as well as their departments, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and ICE's acting director.

The coalition brought the case on behalf of two Nicaraguan men previously detained a facilities in Virginia and Louisiana — Yamil Luna Gutierrez and Rafael Angel Lopez Ocon — and other noncitizens the Trump administration is now holding under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in “disturbing” conditions at Guantánamo.

Rather than keeping these migrants in the United States “while making arrangements to effectuate their removal, the government has flown them hundreds of miles away to detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for no legitimate purpose,” the complaint states. “Plaintiffs are surrounded by military officials, deprived of in-person contact with legal counsel, and subject to punitive conditions of confinement, including in facilities previously used by the military to hold law-of-war detainees.”

The plaintiffs, the filing says, “do not challenge the government's authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government's unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA, and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.”

“Moreover,” the document argues, “the government's use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.”

“Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so,” the document notes. “The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States, which is far less costly and poses none of the logistical hurdles attendant to detaining people at Guantánamo.”

Specifically, according to the complaint, “since February 4, 2025, the government has held approximately 500 people in immigration detention at Guantánamo, at a reported cost of more than $40 million, or approximately $100,000 per day per detainee. In contrast, immigration detention at a U.S.-based detention facility costs, on average, $165 per day per detainee.”

Previewing the Trump administration's likely arguments in court, the suit says that “in attempting to justify the transfers, the government has claimed that the individuals it is sending to Guantánamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals — the ‘worst of the worst.' That characterization has been proven wrong. Regardless, it is legally irrelevant.”

The filing also stresses that “the government's real reason for holding immigration detainees at Guantánamo is to instill fear in the immigrant population. That is not conjecture; it is government policy.”

The coalition is asking the court to rule that detaining these migrants at Guantánamo violates the INA, Administrative Procedure Act, and Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and to block the Trump administration from continuing to do so.

The tribe says they will initiate restoration projects on the 17,000 acres taken from them during the gold rush.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here.

More than 17,000 acres around the Klamath River in Northern California, including the lower Blue Creek watershed, have returned to the Yurok Tribe, completing the largest landback deal in California history.

The Yurok people have lived, fished, and hunted along the Klamath for millennia. But when the California gold rush began, the tribe lost 90 percent of its territory. 

For the last two decades, the Yurok Tribe has been working with the nonprofit Western Rivers Conservancy to get its land back. The 17,000 acres composes the final parcel of a $56 million, 47,097-acre land transfer that effectively doubles the current land holdings of the Yurok Tribe. 

The tribe has already designated the land as a salmon sanctuary and community forest and plans to eventually put it into a trust and care for it in perpetuity. 

“No words can describe how we feel knowing that our land is coming back to the ownership of the Yurok people,” said Joseph James, the chairman of the Yurok Tribal Council, who is from the village of Shregon on the Klamath River. “The Klamath River is our highway. It is also our food source. And it takes care of us. And so it's our job, our inherent right, to take care of the Klamath Basin and its river.”

The land transfer comes just months after the utility PacifiCorp removed four dams on the Klamath River, the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The removal of the dams enabled coho and Chinook salmon that had been blocked to finally swim upstream to spawn for the first time in more than a century. The deal is also part of a broader push to revitalize the Klamath River Basin, where water diversions and pollution have long strained the wildlife and the Indigenous peoples who rely on them. 

Josh Kling, conservation director at the Western Rivers Conservancy, said the nonprofit acquired the land in pieces from Green Diamond, a timber company, and paid for it using a combination of private funding, tax credits, carbon credit sales, low-interest loans, revolving loans, federal revolving loan programs, and settlement funds. The project was also partially funded by the state of California, which returned 2,800 acres of state land along the Klamath River to the Shasta Indian Nation last year. 

Kling said the 47,000 acres of land returned to the Yurok Tribe includes redwood forests that help protect against climate change and protect crucial habitat for birds such as the marbled murrelet, Humboldt marten. and northern spotted owl, just as the trees were becoming ripe for a fresh round of logging.

“The project was really timely to get in there before a new round of timber harvest and the associated road building,” said Kling. He is particularly excited about how Blue Creek, a cold-water tributary just 16 miles from the mouth of the river, is now protected because of how the tributary provides an essential place for salmon and steelhead to cool off before heading further upstream to spawn.

“The importance of Blue Creek to the larger Klamath system really can't be overstated,” he said. “With the dam removals and the restoration of fish passage to over 400 miles of spawning habitat in the upper basin, none of that means anything if the fish can't get there.”

James from the Yurok Tribe described Blue Creek as a high prayer area, a village site, and essential fishing grounds. In 2020, it was also where Yurok officials helped persuade PacifiCorp officials to move forward with dam removal after two decades of advocacy. James credited Troy Fletcher, a former executive director of the Yurok Tribe who played a key role in the dam removal campaign and who has since passed away, for helping to initiate the landback project.

Restoring the land will involve everything from stream restoration projects to road maintenance, James said: “We want to do everything we can to protect Mother Earth.”  

Kling said the conservancy is increasingly working with tribal nations to facilitate land transfers and hopes to work with more. Studies have shown that conservation goals are more effectively met when Indigenous peoples manage their own territories. 

“The more that we can partner with tribal stewards to achieve our conservation outcomes, those are durable lasting results,” Kling said.

James, too, hopes that the deal will be far from the last. 

“Here's a model that we can share with the Indian Country,” he said. “Indigenous people are the managers of the land, and they're driving it.”

It has become a trope to lament and lambaste the wishful thinking that shaped U.S. policy toward China in the two decades after the Cold War. That policy rested on a prediction about China's future: that with economic growth and ongoing diplomatic, economic, and cultural engagement, both with the United States and the rest of the world, China would become more like the United States—more politically open at home and more accepting of the existing order abroad.

It is hard to deny that this prediction proved wrong. But Rana Mitter, the S. T. Lee Chair in U.S.-Asia Relations at the Harvard Kennedy School and one of the great historians of China, reminds readers that predictions about China almost always prove wrong. And as he writes in a new essay in Foreign Affairs, it would be equally foolish to assume that China must remain on its current trajectory of more confrontation abroad and repression at home. “Another China remains possible,” Mitter argues. And how that China develops will be one of the most important factors in geopolitics for decades to come.

The first hundred days of Donald Trump's second presidency have turned out worse for Europeans than expected. In addition to Vice President JD Vance's ideological crusade against European liberals, there are fears that the United States will abandon Ukraine and frustration and concern over Trump's initiation of unprecedented tariffs on European countries. In the wake of these disruptions, it is not surprising that the gaze of some European politicians has wistfully turned toward China, which is perceived by some as a potential hedge against an unpredictable United States. Brussels, for example, recently started negotiations with Beijing on reducing European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China lowering its tariffs on European goods and lifting export restrictions on rare-earth elements. And after Chinese leader Xi Jinping declined to travel to Europe for a 50th anniversary summit on EU-Chinese ties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, skeptical yet pragmatic in dealing with China, announced she will travel to Beijing in late July. 

Beijing, meanwhile, is playing its cards well and positioning itself as a more reasonable and cooperative great power than Washington. This is a change from Trump's first term, when China overplayed its hand and embraced an aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy that backfired. Now, not a day passes in which Chinese officials do not underscore how they share their European counterparts' desire to protect the multilateral trading system from Trump's disruptions. Xi, for instance, has noted that China and Europe are “two major forces for building a multipolar world, two major markets supporting globalization, and two major civilizations championing diversity.” China has even proposed reviving the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which was put on ice in 2021 after Beijing sanctioned several members of the European Parliament who were critical of China. If implemented, the CAI would replace the bilateral treaties that regulate how Chinese investors are treated in European countries and help create a level playing field for European businesses in China.

These are tempting overtures. But the harsh reality is that the game has not really changed: the EU still doesn't have a China card to play. In fact, Trump's disruptions are only magnifying China's economic and security threats to Europe. To offset U.S. tariffs this year, China diverted its exports to alternative markets including Europe. This resulted in a record Chinese trade surplus with Europe in the first quarter of 2025. These low-cost Chinese exports are massively subsidized and undercut European producers who are already facing margin pressures and the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Many of the goods China redirected from the United States to the EU are now competing directly with Europe's core manufacturing industries—the automotive sector, for instance, as well as electronics, industrial machinery and components, home appliances, and clean energy technologies. This flood of goods could damage the broader competitiveness of Europe's manufacturing ecosystem, creating something like the “China shock” that rocked the United States in the first decade of this century.

Europe's security threat from China has not diminished either. The Ukrainian government says it has evidence that Chinese factories inside Russia are producing weapons and that China is exporting gunpowder and artillery to Russia for use in Ukraine. Beijing denies the allegations. If China is bolstering Russia's military with impunity from both Brussels and Washington, the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end in a cease-fire or a peace agreement in the foreseeable future, and Russia will continue to destabilize not only Ukraine but also the entire European continent.

Seeking détente with China, therefore, is still a dangerous game for the EU. Instead, the EU must realize it has other cards to play, including forging more advantageous trade agreements elsewhere in the world and changing China's calculus about supporting Russia.

In the economic realm, Europe's strongest hedge against the U.S. trade war is to secure more agreements with allies, not with China. A central pillar of this strategy should be for the EU to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership—a trade pact among 12 economies, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, and, more recently, the United Kingdom, that reduces tariffs; sets common rules on trade, investment, and labor; and aims to promote economic integration and strategic cooperation. The growing CPTPP architecture collectively accounts for about 15 percent of global GDP; if the EU were to join, the bloc would represent nearly 30 percent of global GDP.

Trade with CPTPP countries currently represents 15 percent of EU trade and is not sufficient to replace the more dominant trade relationship the EU has with China, but knitting together additional bilateral and multilateral trade and investment agreements with other allies and partners could build a promising hedge against both China and the United States. By adding new sectoral provisions to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada, for instance, the EU and Canada could build mutual resilience against China and the United States, especially in the areas of critical minerals and energy security. Brussels could also prioritize finalizing the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, which would help the EU take advantage of the world's fastest-growing major economy. This negotiation has long been stalled because of disputes over market access and tariff reductions, but the United Kingdom recently secured its own agreement with India, which could provide a path for the EU to do the same. Similarly, the free-trade agreement that the EU completed in December 2024 with the Mercosur bloc of countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to open Europe to vast Latin American markets and the region's bountiful natural resources.



Building on momentum from the 2023 Hiroshima G-7 summit, Europe should also deepen coordination on economic and technology security with advanced democracies, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. These countries must align their strategies to counter Chinese economic coercion and mitigate the risks of China's civil-military fusion. Joint initiatives should prioritize the protection and advancement of dual-use technologies, especially in AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology. Maintaining a lead in these sectors will require not just defensive measures but coordinated investment in innovation.

Collectively, these same allies can also help sustain high-value scientific research, which the second Trump administration is aggressively defunding at top U.S. research universities and government labs. What could become a generational self-inflicted wound for the United States could also become a generational opportunity for Europe—to attract displaced talent, safeguard R & D programs, and reinforce its own innovation base. Although strong security frameworks will be necessary to prevent intellectual property theft, selective cooperation with Beijing will remain crucial for European companies, especially in the automotive sector, where European manufacturers lag behind, and in battery innovation and clean energy technology, where Chinese firms lead globally.

As Europe expands and reprioritizes its trade and technology relationships with allies and partners, it must also reform the rules and institutions that govern those ties to allow more innovation and investment while protecting core European interests. New frameworks should be built with flexibility in mind to allow the United States, under a future administration, to participate. Strategic patience and careful design today can lay the groundwork for a renewed transatlantic partnership tomorrow.

Insulating itself from trade shocks, however, is only step one: Europe must also stop underestimating China's support for Russia's war against Ukraine, which in turn threatens European security. During the Biden administration, the United States condemned China's support of the Russian industrial base, but Europe has been more cautious and has rarely threatened Beijing or followed through with serious consequences. Beijing has stopped short of delivering weapons directly to Russia, which President Joe Biden warned is a redline. But China's supply of dual-use goods, such as semiconductor chips and weapons parts, has taken on such proportions that it has become the equivalent of providing lethal aid: Carnegie estimates that, in 2023, China was responsible for roughly 90 percent of the goods that Russia needs to sustain its war effort. An internal EU report this year estimates that China is responsible for approximately 80 percent of all circumventions of sanctions against Russia.

This support allowed Russia's military to reconstitute itself much faster than many NATO analysts expected after the massive losses in the first year of the war. Yet pressure on China for its obstructive role has almost disappeared. Trump administration officials have declined to push for greater scrutiny of China's role in the war and have instead repeatedly suggested that China can help end the war in a positive way, without following up with any pressure on China to do so. European governments, meanwhile, say they oppose Beijing's involvement while doing little to genuinely punish or deter China: so far, Europe has sanctioned only a few dozen Chinese companies for delivering dual-use goods to Russia.

Ukraine has tried to keep its partners focused on China's involvement and to demonstrate that Beijing's support for Russia is intensifying. Kyiv has claimed, for instance, that more than 150 Chinese mercenaries are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine and that Beijing has done nothing to rein them in. Ukraine has also pointed to China's willingness to cross the dual-use line, claiming it has evidence of China's direct involvement in weapons manufacturing inside Russia. Yet precisely because China is no longer facing any significant backlash from the United States or Europe, Beijing has moved to take advantage of the newly permissive environment. During a summit last month in Moscow, which coincided with Russia's annual commemoration of the Allied victory in World War II, Putin and Xi pledged to “enhance [their] strategic coordination.”



Moscow is also taking advantage of European inaction. Because it can rely on China's support for its military needs, Russia believes it can outlast Ukraine. Increasing pressure on China for its support of the war, therefore, is one of the best methods by which the United States and Europe could increase pressure on Russia to agree to a cease-fire. Military analysts believe that Russia is planning a summer offensive in which it will expend its stockpile of weapons; afterward, it will rely on what it can produce from day to day, heightening its dependence on the supply chains it has built with other countries. At that point, sanctions that bite at Chinese supply lines to Russia could become particularly effective.

Even if the United States is not on board with such sanctions, Europe has a lot of leverage of its own. The flip side of Europe's trade dependence on China is China's own reliance on Europe's market to absorb its excess capacity. Since Trump's tariff announcements against China and the diversion of U.S.-bound Chinese goods to Europe, Europe is now an even more important market for China's exports; Europeans should use that leverage to ramp up the pressure on China. Instead of merely sanctioning Chinese companies that trade in goods that are of use to Russia's military, the European Union should apply sanctions on Chinese banks that help Russia circumvent the EU's sanctions regime. And if China truly wants to pursue a revival of an investment agreement with Europe, Brussels should condition any talks on China restricting the flow of dual-use goods to Russia's military.

Europeans also have an opportunity to take advantage of China's role on the sidelines of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. China has invested a great deal of political capital into portraying itself as a potential neutral mediator in the war, albeit with pro-Russian leanings. This is now, ironically, the same role that the Trump administration has assumed, and there are signs that China suspects it is being left out. According to The Wall Street Journal, Chinese officials proposed hosting a Putin-Trump summit and offered to facilitate peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, but Washington wasn't interested. Europeans should signal to Beijing that it could be in China's interest to take a step back from being so obviously supportive of Russia, while arguing neutrality.

Increased pressure on China will not, of course, result in Beijing abandoning Moscow. Nor will more free-trade agreements completely make up for the economic losses in a trade war with the United States and diminishing returns from trade with China. But regardless of how hostile the Trump administration (and Trump himself) is to the EU and how sweet the gestures are from Beijing, Europe must remember that China is not its friend. Europe cannot hedge against Trump's disruptions by selling out its own economy and security.

In recent weeks, an air of crisis has enveloped the United States' relationship with Israel—Washington's closest ally and client state in the Middle East. When U.S. President Donald Trump made his first trip to the region in May, he notably bypassed Jerusalem on his way to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The snubbing of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was coupled with dramatic twists and turns in American regional diplomacy. Against Israel's wishes, Trump is negotiating directly with the Jewish state's worst enemies: Iran and Hamas. His team reached out to the Yemeni Houthis, who keep firing missiles deep into Israel and continue to block its marine traffic. He even met with Syria's ex-jihadist leader, whom he praised as “tough” and “attractive.”

To Netanyahu's critics at home and abroad, Trump's behavior is a breath of fresh air. For years, the Israeli leader has boasted about his close relationship with this U.S. president, arguing that their bond is a reason to keep him in power. During Trump's first term, after all, the United States gave Israel and Netanyahu almost everything they asked for. But this time, Trump is bucking the prime minister, and Netanyahu and his supporters have had only feeble excuses as to why their efforts are failing.

Yet historically speaking, Trump's diplomatic overtures to Israel's adversaries are not new. Since Israel's establishment, in 1948, U.S. administrations have generally followed Washington's own geopolitical interests in the Middle East, even when those interests conflict with Israel's. Judged by these standards, Trump's first term—with its near-unequivocal support for Israel's regional ambitions—was an aberration. His second, by contrast, is more of a regression to the mean.

Where Israel has gotten carte blanche from Washington is with regard to the Palestinians. No U.S. president, not even the most liberal of them, has forced Israel to stop building settlements or to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories. And here, Trump is in keeping both with his first term and with decades of U.S. policy. Trump is allowing Netanyahu to prosecute the war in Gaza with American consent. He has only occasionally put pressure on Israel to let in aid. And in February, Trump declared his support for the “voluntary emigration” of Gaza's Palestinian population to nearby Arab states or elsewhere—which is exactly what Netanyahu's far-right coalition wanted to hear. A few weeks later, Israel breached a short-lived cease-fire with Hamas, escalated its bombing campaign, and cut off humanitarian supplies to Gaza's two million people. Netanyahu declared his intent to occupy the entire territory, disarm Hamas, and implement Trump's “genius plan” for clearing the land of Palestinians.

Under Trump, the United States continues to serve as Israel's security guarantor and diplomatic shield. Israel thus remains free to engage in behavior that Washington rarely tolerates from other countries. The United States, for example, stonewalls any efforts to look into Israel's unacknowledged nuclear arsenal. It vetoes UN resolutions criticizing Israel's violations of international law. And Washington helps the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with cross-border operations by providing unparalleled military aid and access to advanced defense technology. Trump may no longer be doing everything that Netanyahu wishes. But the special relationship is alive and well, just as it always has been.

For nearly 80 years, the U.S.-Israeli alliance has withstood political upheavals in both countries and around the world. Ever since U.S. President Harry Truman recognized Israel, minutes after its declaration of independence in 1948—against the advice of his secretary of state, George Marshall—successive administrations have shrugged off criticism from human rights moralists, as well as foreign-policy realists critical of their support for the Jewish state. Israel, in turn, has grown only more dependent on American diplomatic cover and military assistance. But U.S. officials have often ignored or put pressure on the country when its actions proved geopolitically inconvenient to their own agendas.

Consider the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Truman gave Israel diplomatic recognition even as the United States abided by a UN arms embargo on its various belligerents. (The fledgling IDF got its arms from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and by smuggling excess war materiel from the United States.) When the war ended, Truman accepted the territorial and demographic results of the conflict. That meant he recognized Israel's land gains beyond the UN Partition Plan of 1947 and accepted as fact the nakba—the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs, never allowed to return. He put only a token amount of pressure on Israel to accept some of them back.

Yet during the final stage of the war, when Israeli forces chased the retreating Egyptian army into the Sinai Peninsula, clashing with the British troops then deployed around the Suez Canal, Truman forced Israeli leader David Ben-Gurion to retreat. He would not allow Israel to go beyond Palestine's antebellum borders and threaten the de facto British protectorate in Cairo, which controlled the crucial international waterway. Israel should have learned its lesson: it could enjoy a relatively free hand with the Palestinians but not undermine the interests of its superpower partner.

In the early 1950s, the United States kept Israel at arm's length as it sought alliances with friendly Arab regimes and focused on the main Cold War fronts in Asia and Europe. It allowed its British and French allies to supply the IDF with tanks and aircraft. But in 1956, when Israel joined France and the United Kingdom in a failed effort to bring down the charismatic Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, Washington balked. To win the race for the hearts and minds of postcolonial countries, the United States decided it could not side with the outdated imperialists. The IDF occupied the Sinai within days, but U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, furious about his allies' freelance war, made Ben-Gurion withdraw. Once again, Israel had to face the limits of its outreach.



As the Cold War intensified in the 1960s, the United States grew closer to Israel, replacing Charles de Gaulle's France as its arms supplier. And when war erupted again in 1967, leading to the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, the Sinai, and the West Bank, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson allowed Israel to keep these territories as bargaining chips in negotiations with the Arab states. But after Israel and its neighbors fought another war, in 1973, the United States forced Israel to return the Sinai in exchange for normalized relations with Egypt—an agreement that has served as the cornerstone of the regional order ever since its 1979 signing. Before the 1973 fight, Israel had hoped that it would be able to keep the territory. But Washington's interest in pulling Egypt out of the Soviet orbit was ultimately paramount, so the United States forced Israel to concede.

This push and pull continued to define U.S.-Israeli relations after the Cold War ended. The United States consistently defended Israel in international organizations, using its UN Security Council seat to veto resolutions critical of the country. But it prevented Israel from retaliating against Iraqi missile attacks during the 1991 Gulf War, fearing that Israeli intervention would break apart the U.S.-led coalition fighting Baghdad, which featured several Arab states. Washington sold Israel boundless weapons but forced the country to halt its arms exports to China. U.S. officials keep silent about Israel's nuclear weapons program and have sanctioned its secret 2007 bombing of a reactor under construction in Syria, but they have prevented Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear facilities. Under U.S. President Barack Obama, Washington even struck a nuclear deal with Iran, despite Netanyahu's vocal opposition.

Yet even though Washington has deviated from Israel in some regional matters, no U.S. president, not even Obama, has restrained Israel's repression of the Palestinians. Instead, successive administrations have essentially given the Jewish state a free hand to expand its settlements in the West Bank, which are aimed at preventing a future Palestinian country from emerging and have been Israel's key national project since 1967. U.S. presidents have sometimes criticized the settlements for legal and strategic reasons, but their tough talk was just that—talk. Washington has never done anything tangible to stop the incessant building, limiting intervention to a few key Palestinian areas.

Similarly, the United States has never forced Israel to negotiate an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It has come up with all sorts of peace schemes and sponsored round after round of negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders. But Washington has agreed to meaningful talks with the Palestinian Liberation Organization only after Israel did so first. When Israel turned away from the peace process, the United States followed suit. Washington has abandoned the process despite its declared support for the two-state solution. Neither Trump nor Biden did anything to rekindle the dying hope of Israeli-Palestinian peace.

Trump's first term in office shifted away from this tradition. The president retained, and even accentuated, Washington's disregard for the Palestinians. But he unequivocally aligned the United States with Israel on foreign policy matters, too. Breaking from all his predecessors since Truman, Trump moved the seat of the American embassy to Jerusalem. (Its main office remains in Tel Aviv.) He shut down the consulate general in Jerusalem, which had served as the U.S. diplomatic point of contact with the Palestinians. He recognized Israel's 1981 annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights. And with Netanyahu's encouragement, he ditched the nuclear deal with Iran. In response, the Iranians began enriching more and higher-grade uranium.

Then, in 2020, Trump delivered his biggest gift to Netanyahu by negotiating the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates. In theory, this was a two-way deal, in which Netanyahu was to shelf his plan to annex a third of the West Bank in exchange for normalization. But this was barely a concession; the Palestinians gained nothing real. In fact, the Palestinian Authority didn't even have a seat at the negotiating table. In his last week in office, Trump also added Israel to U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility. Since then, the IDF has trained with its counterparts in the Gulf kingdoms, Egypt, and Jordan.

U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was also exceptionally accommodating of the Israelis. Biden, who has vocally supported Israel since joining the Senate in the 1970s, reversed none of Trump's Israel policies. In fact, he tried to build on them, pushing for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords by offering Riyadh defense guarantees and nuclear technology. He exempted Israeli passport holders from U.S. visas. When Hamas attacked on October 7, 2023, and Hezbollah and the Houthis piled on, Biden flooded Israel with arms and deployed aircraft carriers from China to the Middle East. He backed Israel's counteroffensive into Gaza, and later Lebanon and Syria, even as the Palestinian casualties mounted and American progressives revolted.

Biden did occasionally rebuke Israel for denying humanitarian aid to Gaza. He authorized the construction by U.S. forces of a pier in Gaza designed to receive shipments of aid, but that quickly collapsed into the sea. At one point, he embargoed some weapons shipments and sanctioned violent West Bank settlers whom the Israeli government had enabled to attack their Palestinian neighbors. But the latter policy was fleeting, and all were token gestures. Netanyahu periodically let in some aid to appease Washington, but he continued with his total war. This pattern will likely hold under Trump.

Notably, Biden unequivocally stood with Israel even as the country's dependence on U.S. support reached new heights. When Iran attacked Israel twice last year with hundreds of ballistic and cruise missiles and drones, Israel needed a U.S.-led coalition to protect its airspace. To strengthen military coordination and joint planning, Washington regularly dispatched General Michael Kurilla, the head of Central Command, to Tel Aviv as a uniformed watchdog. Last year, after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity, Biden criticized the decision. His government promised that Netanyahu and Gallant would not be arrested on U.S. territory. (The United States is not a member of the ICC.) Yet Israel never had to give Washington any meaningful quid pro quo for all this help. It was free.

For Netanyahu, Trump's return to the White House seemed, at first, to be a gift from heaven, after he effectively prayed for a Republican victory. Netanyahu's popularity plummeted after the October 7 attacks, but he retained his reputation as a Trump whisperer. As a result, Trump's election gave skeptical Israelis a reason to keep their prime minister around.

Indeed, during the first weeks of the second Trump term, Netanyahu racked up repeat victories. Biden's sanctions on some West Bank settlers were eliminated. Instead, Trump put sanctions on the International Criminal Court and its employees. Netanyahu was the first world leader to be invited to the White House, and when he arrived, Trump laid out his plan to depopulate Gaza and turn it into a beach resort. Netanyahu could thus defy his critics at home, arguing that waiting out Biden and prolonging the war had paid off. Even Israel's long-standing dream of attacking Iran's nuclear facilities appeared to be in reach.

The honeymoon, however, was brief. In April, Trump called Netanyahu back to the White House to tell him that negotiations on a new nuclear deal with Iran were beginning. The encounter was followed by reports that Trump had blocked Israel from bombing Iranian nuclear facilities. Then came news of a U.S.-Houthi cease-fire, which excluded Israel, and American outreach to Hamas and Syria. Trump even decoupled the proposed U.S.-Saudi defense and nuclear agreements from an Israeli-Saudi deal. Canada and Europe interpreted the change of heart in Washington as a green light to threaten Israel with sanctions if the war and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza continued.

Trump has voiced interest in a quick, new Gaza cease-fire and the return of the Israeli hostages. But Trump's Gaza strategy is strikingly different from his regional one. Washington is seeking a common ground with Tehran, despite threatening its rulers with negative consequences if they keep their uranium enrichment program. In Gaza, however, Trump has signaled that he is fine with Israel's continued fighting and its retention of freshly occupied territory in the enclave. The United States is keeping an open channel to Hamas. Although the contacts are limited to the evasive hostage-for-truce deal, they give Hamas—which Washington considers a designated terrorist group—unprecedented U.S. recognition as an interlocutor.

Trump's behavior, in other words, does not mark a fundamental shift in U.S.-Israeli relations. Rather, freed from reelection concerns and with full control over Congress, Trump has returned Washington's Middle East policy to its age-old basis. The United States will cut its own path when it comes to the region and beyond. But it will stand by Israel when it comes to the Palestinians, and it will continuously protect the country. Netanyahu has had to accept, however grudgingly, that Trump will no longer bow to his requests on Iran. But just like all his predecessors, Netanyahu retains a free hand in Gaza and the West Bank. He can move ahead with his plans to destroy and depopulate the former and to annex territory in the latter. He ultimately might not take these measures, thanks to broader international pressure or shifts in domestic public opinion or because he strikes a deal to normalize ties with Saudi Arabia. But he will still have ravaged Gaza with American consent.

Live Updates


            • Trump and Musk's public falling-out: President Donald Trump said he was “very disappointed” with Elon Musk as the tech billionaire continues to blast Trump's massive tax and spending cuts package. Musk responded in real-time on his X platform to the president's comments about him.
    


            • Trump meets Merz: In their first in-person meeting at the White House, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Trump is the “key person” to put pressure on Russia and bring about an end to the war in Ukraine.
    


            • Call with Xi: Trump and China's Xi Jinping held a long-anticipated phone call on trade, with Trump saying it “resulted in a very positive conclusion.” Both leaders extended invitations to visit their respective countries.
    


            • New travel ban: Trump signed a proclamation last night to ban travel from 12 countries, citing security risks. Seven other countries face partial restrictions.
    


            Republicans senators are so far brushing off Elon Musk's call to his massive social media following to turn up the heat on Republican elected officials.
    


            “I don't know,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN when asked if his office was receiving more pressure. “Nobody is calling me.”
    


            GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio also said that he has not received an uptick of constituent calls, telling CNN, “No. I mean, honestly, as you know, most normal people don't watch the inconsistencies of how the sausage is made.”
    


            He said that usually those that do call have only seen “misinformation” about the bill. “There's a difference in mandatory spending and discretionary spending. So once we explain to them what we're actually doing, they buy into the whole process.”
    


                    Asked about Musk's influence and platform, and how that could affect support for Trump's agenda, Moreno shot back: “President Trump has the biggest platform on earth, and the platform that he's advocating for is to prevent that $4 trillion tax increase, fund our military, secure our border and strengthen Medicaid.”
                





            GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said “nah” when asked if he felt like he was under more of a spotlight since Musk made a direct ask to his followers to call elected officials.
    


            “The deal is not done. We got three more weeks. And it will change many times between now and three weeks from now,” Tuberville said.
    


            GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has been publicly opposing the legislation, said: “I'll say in my office, most of the calls, the vast majority, are voting no. But my guess is that's not coming from either my supporters or President Trump's supporters. I take that seriously. I look at it.”
    


            German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that President Donald Trump is the “key person” to bring about an end to the war in Ukraine “by putting pressure on Russia.”
    


            “We both agree on this war and how terrible this war is going on, and we are both looking for ways to stop it very soon. And I told the president … he is the key person in the world who can really do that now by putting pressure on Russia,” Merz said.
    


            The German leader reiterated his country's steadfast commitment to Ukraine, adding that the horrific images from the battlefield are caused by “Russian weapons against Ukraine.”
    


            “Ukraine is only targeting military targets, not civilians, not energy infrastructure. So this is the difference, and that's the reason why we are trying to do more on Russia,” Merz added.
    


            In a stunning real-time response on X, Elon Musk responded to President Donald Trump's comments about him after the tech billionaire slammed his signature legislation.
    


            Musk, until recently a White House special employee who oversaw the administration's cost-cutting efforts, denied Trump's claim that the Tesla CEO knew the inner workings of the president's so-called “big beautiful bill.” Musk also countered that the elimination of America's electric vehicle tax incentives has nothing to do with his opposition to the massive domestic policy bill.
    


            “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” Musk wrote.
    


                    “Whatever. Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” Musk said in a separate post. “In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this! Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.”
                





            President Donald Trump declined to offer specifics on sanctions on Russia during a meeting with German Chancellor Merz in the Oval Office.
    


            “It's in my brain, the deadline, when I see the moment where it's not going to stop,” Trump said, and then looked on to Merz, saying, “I'm sure you're going to do the same thing.” Trump then added, “we'll be very, very, very tough,” when pressed about sanctions on Russia.
    


                    “And it could be on both countries to be honest. You know, it takes two to tango,” Trump said.
                





            Without directly addressing whether he would impose Russian sanctions, the president described a conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which he said he gave an analogy likening the war to a playground fight.
    


                    “Sometimes you see two young children fighting like crazy. They hate each other, and they're fighting in a park, and you try and pull them apart. They don't want to be pulled, sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart.”
                





            Trump continued: “And I gave that analogy to Putin yesterday, I said, president, maybe you're going to have to keep fighting and suffering a lot, because both sides are suffering before you pull them apart, before they're able to be pulled apart.”
    


            President Donald Trump on Thursday struck a positive tone on a potential trade deal with the European Union during a meeting at the White House with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
    


            “We'll have a good trade deal,” Trump said.
    


            “I guess that will be mostly determined by the European Union, but you're a very big part of that, so you'll be involved,” Trump said to Merz.
    


            Trump's major tariffs on the EU, including a threatened 50% tariff, have been delayed until July 9. Germany is still impacted by tariffs including Trump's 25% tariff on autos, which is in effect.
    


            The president said that “hopefully” there will be a trade deal, or the United States will “do the tariffs.”
    


            “I mean, I'm okay with the tariffs, or we make a deal with the trade, and I guess that's what we're discussing,” he said.
    


            Trump's optimistic remarks came hours after the president separately spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a phone call.
    


            Investors and economists have been on edge about the impact of the president's trade war. Wall Street in recent weeks has started to bet that Trump will back down on his most aggressive trade war threats. That's spawned the phrase TACO trade, which stands for Trump Always Chickens Out.
    


            US stocks were in the green during the meeting between Trump and Merz. The Dow rose 130 points, or 0.3%. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to confirm the deterioration of his relationship with Elon Musk, saying he was “very disappointed” in the tech billionaire, who exited his top advisory role at the White House and subsequently railed against the president's sweeping tax and spending package.
    


            “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office less than one week after the two exchanged effusive praise on Musk's last day.
    


            Since then, Musk has strongly criticized what Trump calls his “Big, Beautiful Bill” that has passed the House and faces an uncertain path forward in the Senate, calling the bill, which is a major Trump priority, a “disgusting abomination.” Trump and Musk have not spoken since Musk lashed out at the legislation, a source familiar with the dynamic told CNN.
    


            “He knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,” Trump said.
    


            The president predicted that though Musk had not personally attacked him, he could soon.
    


            “I'm sure that'll be next. But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,” Trump said.

            President Donald Trump said Thursday that trade talks with China remain on track and that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping “straightened out any complexity” after a long-awaited phone call earlier in the day.
    


            “We had a very good talk, and we've straightened out any complexity. This is very complex stuff, and we straightened it out,” Trump said from the Oval Office after welcoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to the White House.
    


            “I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal,” Trump said.
    


            “We're going to just make sure that everybody understands what the deal is.”
    


            The president added that he expected to be traveling to China at some point.
    


            “By the way, he invited me to China, and I invited him here. We both accepted. So I'll be going there with the first lady at a certain point, and he'll be coming here, hopefully, with the first lady of China.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday that Egypt was not included in the list of countries subject to a new travel ban because he believes the country “(has) things under control.”
    


            CNN previously reported that Trump made the final decision to sign the proclamation after the antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado. The suspect in the attack was an Egyptian national.
    


            Asked why Egypt was not one of the banned countries unveiled on Wednesday, Trump said, “Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely. They have things under control. The countries that we have don't have things under control.”
    


            The travel ban, Trump added, “can't come soon enough. Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country. The Biden administration allowed some horrendous people, and we're getting them out one by one, we're not stopping until we get them out.”
    


            The countries included, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Wednesday, “include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Thursday he thinks Harvard is “starting to behave,” suggesting the  university would be handing over a list of international students attending the school.
    


            “Harvard didn't want to give us that list. They're going to be giving us the list now. I think they're starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth,” he told reporters in the Oval Office while meeting with German leader Friedrich Merz.
    


            On Wednesday, Trump signed a proclamation suspending international visas for new students at Harvard University. The proclamation temporarily blocks the entry of nearly all new international Harvard students under visas most use to study at US universities or participate in academic exchange programs.
    


            Trump on Thursday was asked if he would allow Chinese students into US universities after speaking with Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier in the day.
    


            “Chinese students are coming. No problem. It's an honor to have them, frankly. We want to have foreign students but we want them to be checked, you know. In the case of Harvard and Columbia and others – all we want to do is see their list. There's no problem with that,” the president said.
    


            President Donald Trump is meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the White House.
    


            It's the first time the two are meeting in-person and comes amid a series of high-stakes International issues.
    


            Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, leaders on the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, shared contrasting perspectives on the travel ban that the Trump administration imposed on 12 countries last night.
    


            Grassley, the GOP chair of the committee, said the president was within his rights to impose the ban, referencing national security priorities and “some terrorist attacks we've had in the United States.”
    


                    Grassley said he is “very comfortable” with Trump's proclamation, “because the president's number-one responsibility is the national security of the United States. And I don't know what the basis was for him making that decision, but I assume it's come because of some terrorist attacks we've had in the United States.”
                





            Trump made the final call on signing the proclamation after the antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to a White House official. He was considering it beforehand, but Sunday's assault put it into motion faster.
    


            Grassley continued, saying “not only that, but it's a foreign policy issue, and you know how the Constitution gives the president of the United States wide sway in foreign policy.”
    


            Durbin, meanwhile, criticized the move, saying, “I don't understand it.”
    


                    “The president said this situation, terrible crime in Boulder, was the reason for this. The individual in Boulder was from Egypt,” the Illinois Democrat said. “The president did not include Egypt on his list of nations of people we don't want in the United States. I can't follow his thinking on this at all.”
                





            President Donald Trump concluded a long-awaited 90-minute telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China, saying he was encouraged that ongoing trade tensions could soon be resolved.
    


            Calling the conversation “very good,” Trump said follow-up talks would occur “soon” between the countries' economic teams, and that Xi invited him to visit China.
    


                    “During the conversation, President Xi graciously invited the First Lady and me to visit China, and I reciprocated. As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,” Trump wrote.
                





            Trump said the call focused almost entirely on trade, without touching on other geopolitical issues like an Iran nuclear deal or the Russia-Ukraine war.
    


            The call “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            He singled out the issue of rare earth minerals — which China had placed restrictions on — as an area where he made progress with his counterpart.
    


            “There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products,” Trump wrote.
    


            President Donald Trump held a phone call with China's Xi Jinping, a person familiar with the matter said, as the two leaders tussle over trade policy.
    


            The White House did not immediately confirm the call, which was also reported by Chinese state media.
    


Remember: Tensions have been rising between the two sides in the weeks after they agreed to a 90-day trade truce last month, which hit pause on their tit-for-tat escalation of tariffs. Trump last week accused China of “violating” the agreement — a charge Beijing has denied, while it accused the US of taking steps to “seriously undermine” that consensus.
    


            US officials had signaled in recent days that a call between the two leaders could help jump-start progress in expected upcoming trade talks, which had appeared to stall following the initial truce reached in Geneva.
    


            President Donald Trump signed a proclamation yesterday evening to ban travel from several countries to the US, citing security risks.
    


The ban will fully restrict entry of nationals from the following 12 countries: 



People from these seven countries will have partial restriction:



            The proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, existing visa holders, certain visa categories and individuals whose entry serves US national interests.
    


            The president made the final call on signing the proclamation after the antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado, according to a White House official. He was considering it beforehand, but Sunday's assault put it into motion faster.
    


            Trump said in a video posted yesterday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”
    


            Elon Musk lashed out yesterday at President Donald Trump's agenda bill, calling it a “disgusting abomination.”
    


            Both GOP leaders and White House officials are downplaying the actual impact of the tech billionaire's outburst, even as some vent frustration with Musk behind the scenes. White House officials, while annoyed by the matter, said they ultimately did not believe the comments would impact how senators vote on Trump's prized bill.
    


            Two administration officials even went as far as suggesting Musk's opposition could actually help Trump's measure, given how toxic the Tesla CEO has become over the course of his time in Trump's orbit.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune both evinced no worry whatsoever that it would change Republicans' minds or sink the massive border, tax and spending cuts package. While several GOP senators had been expressing doubts about the bill for weeks, none cited new concerns over Musk's comments. Republican leaders remain bullish that they can deliver the legislation to Trump's desk by July 4 — an ambitious timeline.

            Speaker Mike Johnson said yesterday that he will put the White House's spending cuts request on the House floor next week.
    


                    “Next week, we will put the rescissions bill on the floor of the House and encourage all our Members to support this commonsense measure,” Johnson said in a joint statement with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer and House Republican Chair Lisa McClain.
                





            The White House earlier this week sent the $9.4 billion spending cuts request — known as “rescissions” — to Congress as it seeks to formalize the Department of Government Efficiency's slashes to federal funding.
    


            If the package comes to a vote, it can clear both the House and the Senate with a simple majority, meaning Republicans can advance it without Democratic support.
    


            Johnson said Monday that he expects there may be “multiple” such packages coming to the hill in the next few months.
    


            “It's a big priority for me,” Johnson said.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune is setting an ambitious timeline for a vote on President Donald Trump's domestic policy bill, with the goal of sending it to Trump's desk by July 4 after senators make changes to the House bill.
    


                    “I think we're on track — I hope, at least — to be able to produce something that we can pass through the Senate, send back to the House, have them pass and put on the President's desk by the Fourth of July,” Thune told CNN.
                





            He added his chamber would amend the House bill, but said “it will have to be tracked fairly closely, obviously, with the House bill,” citing House Republicans' “fragile majority” and how they had to strike a “delicate balance” in the House GOP conference to adopt the package last month.
    


            However, Thune did acknowledge that “there are some things that senators want added to the bill, or things that we would do slightly differently,” than the House.
    


            Pressed on whether he would consider overruling the parliamentarian if she objects to anything in the package, which must abide by strict budget rules, Thune insisted that “we're not going there.”
    


            Thune also indicated that the Senate could move on sanctions against Russia before July 4, but noted that they are working with the Trump administration on timing so as not to disrupt negotiations. The resolution, led by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, currently has over 80 co-sponsors in the Senate.

            A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. 



            Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”
    


            The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.
    


            For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.
    


            Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday's travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.
    


            Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.
    


            Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.
    


            Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.
    


            The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.
    


            The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.

            Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.
    


            The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.
    


            Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.
    


            Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”
    


            The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.
    


            “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.
    


            The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”
    


            “While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.
    


            The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.
    


            The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington's two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.
    


            The Trump administration targeted Yemen's Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
    


            Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country's central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.
    


            Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.
    


            Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”
    


            Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.
    


            Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.
    


            The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.

Myanmar's earthquake devastated the war-torn nation. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity



            Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.
    


            The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March.
    


            The US and Laos meanwhile have a complicated history, hampered by the US bombing of the country during its war in Vietnam. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban.
    


            Egypt was spared inclusion in the travel ban, even though the restrictions were expedited after an Egyptian national was charged with attempted murder after the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Relations between Cairo and Washington date back to 1922, when Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom, and have continued ever since.
    


            According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs.
    


            The Arab nation has also historically been the second biggest recipient of US military aid, following Israel. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record.
    


            “Egypt is a valued U.S. partner in counterterrorism, anti-trafficking, and regional security operations, which advance both U.S. and Egyptian security,” the US embassy said in 2023.
    


            Amnesty International called the travel ban based on nationality “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.”

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor's offices — but also at a Shakira concert in New Jersey, at a mall in Minnesota, at a Buc-ee's store in Texas and in airports and planes in several states.
    


            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a recently updated travel notice. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    


            It's a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only 85 cases were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    


            The vast majority of this year's cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    


            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they've gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there's a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    


            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    


            The CDC's health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    


            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year's outbreak.
    


            “That means, then, that you're going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you're going to give three doses,” he said.
    


            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    


Wastewater is now helping track measles spread around the US



            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    


            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    


            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    


            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can't be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    


            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they're exposed to measles.
    


            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    


            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    


            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    


            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    


            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn't need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    


            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    


Tracking measles cases in the United States



            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical travel guidance such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    


            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don't just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    


            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    


            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    


            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we've brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it's still a lot. And we're seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We've had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”

Follow:


            There are not many things that Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't already done in his record-breaking career to date, but the 40-year-old ticked off yet another achievement on Wednesday.
    


            The striker scored the winner in Portugal's 2-1 victory against Germany in the UEFA Nations League semifinal, marking the first time Ronaldo has ever beaten Die Mannschaft.
    


            Ronaldo had lost all five times he previously played Germany and Portugal had not won this fixture in 25 years.
    


            As well as ending the unwanted record, the victory also sent Portugal through to the UEFA Nations League final on June 8 where it will face either defending champion Spain or France.
    


            In his 220th appearance for the national side, Ronaldo yet again proved the difference.
    


            Portugal had initially gone behind in the semifinal after Florian Wirtz headed Germany ahead in the 48th minute, before Francisco Conceição whipped in a brilliant equalizer just after the hour mark.
    


            The stage was then set for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to score the winner just five minutes later, tapping into an open net after Nuno Mendes teed him up with a square pass.
    


            It was Ronaldo's 137th international goal for Portugal and the 937th of his career, extending the two records he already has.
    


            The last time Portugal beat Germany was back in Euro 2000, when Sérgio Conceição scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win during the group stage.
    


            It was fitting, then, that his son Francisco scored in Wednesday's win, helping to end the long-running winless streak.
    


            “We need to enjoy the victory. We won for the first time in a while against Germany,” Portugal manager Roberto Martínez said after the game, per Reuters.
    


            “Tactically, we were exceptional and our commitment helped. It was a team victory.
    


            “Now, we can recover and evaluate. We want another performance with personality in this shirt.”
    


            Despite his age and the fact he's been playing in Saudi Arabia for the last three seasons, Ronaldo has proven yet again that he has the ability to still perform at a high level.
    


            But where exactly he will play next season is currently up for debate. The Portuguese star raised questions about his future with a cryptic social media post last month.
    


            “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Thanks to all,” Ronaldo wrote with a picture of him in his Al Nassr kit.
    


            It comes as FIFA president Gianni Infantino recently suggested that Ronaldo may well play in this year's inaugural Club World Cup, suggesting a move away from Al Nassr which failed to qualify.
    


            His contract is set to expire at the end of this season leaving him free to sign with any club he chooses.

Follow:


            First, these parrots learned to open trash cans to forage for food. Now, they've taken it a step further – and have figured out how to turn on water fountains for a sip along with their meal.
    


            These are Australia's iconic sulphur-crested cockatoos – white birds with a yellow tuft on their heads, known for their loud, grating screech. But they're also incredibly intelligent, with large brains and nimble feet that have allowed them to pick up new habits in urban environments.
    


            The cockatoos in western Sydney, in particular, caught scientists' attention with their latest trick of drinking from public fountains. After researchers first noticed this phenomenon in 2018, they tagged 24 birds and set up cameras near fountains in the area – then sat back and watched.
    


            Throughout two months in the fall of 2019, they recorded most of the tagged birds attempting to drink from the fountains. Also known as bubblers, these fountains are operated by a twist handle – easy enough for a person to operate, but complex for an animal to figure out.
    


            Yet, the cockatoos did. They used different techniques: some would stand with both feet on the handle, while others would put one foot on the handle and one foot on the rubber spout. Then, they'd lower their body weight to turn the handle clockwise – holding the handle in place while twisting their head to take a drink.

            They weren't always successful – it worked about half the time, and five of the 10 drinking fountains in the area had “chew marks” indicating cockatoos had been there before. But the success rate also meant that the cockatoos had likely been doing this for some time, said the researchers in their study, published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters.
    


            The team had studied Sydney's sulphur-crested cockatoos before; in 2021, they published another paper examining the birds' newly observed ability to lift closed trash bin lids with their beaks and feet to access the food inside.
    


            These innovative behaviors aren't just animals being amusing or clever – they show the birds' ability to adapt to urban environments, and the power of social learning among animals, the researchers said.
    


            “We know parrots like cockatoos are amongst the smartest birds out there, and the fact they're so social – so they have the opportunity to learn from one another if a new behavior does pop up, if one genius bird does invent something,” said one of the study's co-authors, Lucy M. Aplin, an associate professor at the Australian National University, in an interview with CNN affiliate ABC Radio.
    


            There are some questions still unanswered. The researchers don't know why exactly the cockatoos are flocking to drinking fountains, instead of other easily accessible natural water sources in the area. At first they thought the fountains might be a backup option on especially hot days when local creeks run dry – but that wasn't the case.
    


            Other theories are that the birds feel safer drinking from fountains in public areas where there are fewer predators, or that they simply prefer the taste of fountain water – but that would need further study to determine.
    


            Now, the researchers want to know what else cockatoos can do – and any habits they may have already developed that just haven't been studied yet.
    


            “We've had some really interesting innovations reported to us, and some examples include unzipping school backpacks and stealing school lunches,” Aplin told ABC Radio. “It has become such a problem in some areas that they have to bring the school bags into the classroom rather than leaving them outside!”

DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities on the tourist island of Bali on Thursday announced the arrests of several foreign nationals, including an Australian, an Indian, and an American, on suspicion of possessing narcotics, charges that could carry the death penalty.

Customs officers at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport arrested an Indian national with the initials H.V., who was carrying a duffel bag, in the customs and excise inspection area on May 29. The officers found narcotic-related items in his belongings, authorities said. 

Following up on the interrogation of H.V., later that day, officers from the National Narcotics Agency of Bali Province arrested an Australian man with the initials P.R., who has been visiting Bali since 1988.

P.R. asked H.V. to bring the duffel bag from Los Angeles to Bali, said I Made Sinar Subawa, an official from the narcotics agency, at a news conference. 

During a search at a house where he stayed, officers found some narcotics in the form of hashish, a cannabis concentrate product, that belonged to P.R. and had been purchased over the Telegram messaging app. 

The hashish was shipped from Los Angeles and Philippines before finally received in Bali, Subawa said. Officers seized 191 grams (6.7 ounces) of hashish along with some candies consisting of tetrahydrocannabinol, and 488 grams (17.2 ounces) of marijuana.

Both P.R. and H.V. are now suspected of dealing in narcotics, based on the evidence that was found with them, Subawa said. 




“P.R. is suspected of violating Indonesia's Narcotics Law which carries the death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a minimum of four years and a maximum of 12 years,” said Subawa. 

Along with H.V. and P.R., the agency also arrested W.M., an American, on May 23 while he was collecting a package from a post office in Bali.

An officer opened the package carried by W.M. and found seven pieces of silver packaging containing a total of 99 orange amphetamine pills and secured one white Apple iPhone brand cellphone. 

The agency, at a news conference in the city of Denpasar on Thursday presented the evidence, including marijuana and hashish, seized from the suspects.

All suspects will undergo legal proceedings in Indonesia, including trial and sentencing.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.

The Southeast Asian country has extremely strict drug laws, and convicted smugglers can face severe penalties, including the possibility of execution by firing squad.

On Tuesday, three British nationals accused of smuggling nearly a kilogram (over two pounds) of cocaine into Indonesia were charged Tuesday in a court on Bali, while on May 27, an Australian man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling cocaine. If convicted, any or all of them could face the death penalty.

About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, latest figures from the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections show. Indonesia's last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A political consultant who sent voters artificial intelligence-generated robocalls mimicking former President Joe Biden last year goes on trial Thursday in New Hampshire, where jurors may be asked to consider not just his guilt or innocence but whether the state actually held its first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Steven Kramer, who faces decades in prison if convicted of voter suppression and impersonating a candidate, has admitted orchestrating a message sent to thousands of voters two days before the Jan. 23, 2024, primary. The message played an AI-generated voice similar to the Democratic president's that used his phrase “What a bunch of malarkey” and suggested that voting in the primary would preclude voters from casting ballots in November.

“It's important that you save your vote for the November election,” voters were told. “Your votes make a difference in November, not this Tuesday.”

Kramer, who owns a firm specializing in get-out-the-vote projects, has said he wasn't trying to influence the outcome of the primary election but rather wanted to send a wake-up call about the potential dangers of AI when he paid a New Orleans magician and self-described “digital nomad” $150 to create the recording.

“Maybe I'm a villain today, but I think in the end we get a better country and better democracy because of what I've done, deliberately,” Kramer told The Associated Press in February 2024.




Ahead of the trial in Belknap County Superior Court, state prosecutors sought to prevent Kramer from arguing that the primary was a meaningless straw poll because it wasn't sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee. At Biden's request, the DNC dislodged New Hampshire from its traditional early spot in the nominating calendar, but later dropped its threat not to seat the state's national convention delegates. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there, but won as a write-in.

The state argued that such evidence was irrelevant and would risk confusing jurors, but Judge Elizabeth Leonard denied the motion in March, saying the DNC's actions and Kramer's understanding of them were relevant to his motive and intent in sending the calls. She did grant the prosecution's request that the court accept as fact that the state held its presidential primary election as defined by law on Jan. 23, 2024. Jurors will be informed of that conclusion but won't be required to accept it.

Kramer faces 11 felony charges, each punishable by up to seven years in prison, alleging he attempted to prevent or deter someone from voting based on “fraudulent, deceptive, misleading or spurious grounds or information.” He also faces 11 misdemeanor charges that each carry a maximum sentence of a year in jail accusing him of falsely representing himself as a candidate by his own conduct or that of another person.

He also has been fined $6 million by the Federal Communications Commission, but it's unclear whether he has paid it, and the FCC did not respond to a request for comment earlier this week.

The agency was developing AI-related rules when Donald Trump won the presidency, but has since shown signs of a possible shift toward loosening regulations. In April, it recommended that a telecom company be added back to an industry consortium just weeks after the agency had proposed fining the company for its role in illegal robocalls impersonating the FCC.

Half of all U.S. states have enacted legislation regulating AI deepfakes in political campaigns, according to the watchdog organization Public Citizen. 

But House Republicans in Congress recently added a clause to their party's signature “big beautiful” tax bill that would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, though it faces long odds in the Senate.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is moving to block nearly all foreign students from entering the country to attend Harvard University, his latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body.

In an executive order signed Wednesday, Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard's conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.

It's a further escalation in the White House's fight with the nation's oldest and wealthiest university. A federal court in Boston blocked the Department of Homeland Security from barring international students at Harvard last week. Trump's order invokes a different legal authority.

Collin Binkley has covered Harvard for nearly a decade – most of the time living half a mile from campus.

Trump invoked a broad federal law that gives the president authority to block foreigners whose entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” On Wednesday, he cited the same authority when announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. Trump's Harvard order cites several other laws, too, including one barring foreigners associated with terrorist organizations.

In a statement Wednesday night, Harvard said it will “continue to protect its international students.”




“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights,” university officials said.

It stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of demands made by the federal government. It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.

Harvard says it has complied with the request, but the government said the school's response was insufficient.

The dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment. Harvard defied the demands, saying they encroached on the university's autonomy and represented a threat to the freedom of all U.S. universities.

Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6 billion in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard's roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrollment at some Harvard graduate schools.




“Admission to the United States to study at an ‘elite' American university is a privilege, not a right,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. “This Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President's proclamation suspending the entry of new foreign students at Harvard University based on national security concerns.”

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the measure ridiculous and said it has nothing to do with national security.

“It's a thinly veiled revenge ploy in Trump's personal feud with Harvard, and continued authoritarian overreach against free speech,” Jayapal said on the social media site X.

The order applies to all students attempting to enter the United States to attend Harvard after the date of the executive order. It provides a loophole to allow students whose entry would “benefit the national interest,” as determined by federal officials.

Trump's order alleges that Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students in response to the Homeland Security request, and it lacked the detail to gauge if federal action was needed. Trump concluded that Harvard is either “not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.”

“These actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government's ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law,” the order said.

For foreign students already at Harvard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote.




The order is scheduled to last six months. Within 90 days, the administration will determine if it should be renewed, the order said.

A State Department cable sent last week to U.S. embassies and consulates said federal officials will begin reviewing the social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.

In a court filing last week, Harvard officials said the Trump administration's efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion.” Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said in the filing. ___

A Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, whom President Donald Trump's administration was working to bring back after a court order, landed in the United States on Wednesday, his attorneys confirmed.

The man, identified in court documents by initials O.C.G., landed in California via a commercial flight and made contact with his legal team while waiting in line to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance. 

He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press. 

The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return. 

The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP. 

The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely “lacked any semblance of due process.”

Mexico later returned him to Guatemala, where he was in hiding, according to court documents. 




In a court filing before his return, government lawyers said that a so-called significant public benefit parole packet had been approved. The designation allows people who aren't eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.

An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.

“As far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,” Realmuto said. 

The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian Security Council Secretary, Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday, the North's state media reported on Thursday.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting top Russian official that his country will “unconditionally support” Russia's war against Ukraine, the North's state media reported Thursday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the two nations.

In April, the two countries officially confirmed North Korean troops' deployment to Russia for the first time, saying that soldiers of the two countries were fighting alongside each other to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea's participation in the war and promised not to forget their sacrifices. 

In a meeting with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday, Kim affirmed that North Korea will “unconditionally support the stand of Russia and its foreign policies in all the crucial international political issues including the Ukrainian issue,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.

The two discussed how to solidify strategic partnership between North Korea and Russia and reached a consensus on the Ukraine issue and other unspecified international situations, KCNA said. It didn't elaborate. 

Russia's state Tass news agency, citing the Russian Security Council's press service, reported that Shoigu and Kim also discussed prospects for rebuilding the Kursk region and outlined steps to commemorate the contribution made by North Korean soldiers.

Russia claimed in April 2025 that it had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, though Ukraine insists it still has troops present there. Ukraine's top army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reiterated Saturday that Ukrainian forces were still holding territory in Russia's Kursk region.




Shoigu last visited North Korea in March for a meeting with Kim. 

North Korea and Russia haven't said how many North Korean troops are in Russia. But U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials earlier said North Korea dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall in its first participation in a major armed conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War. South Korean authorities recently said North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia as well.

South Korean, U.S. and their partners believe Russia has provided economic and military assistance to North Korea in return. They worry Russia might also transfer sophisticated technologies to help North Korea enhance its nuclear weapons program targeting its rivals.

Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on the Obama-appointed federal judge ruling that the law prohibiting illegal immigrants from owning a gun is unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of seven U.S. gun manufacturers who were sued by the Mexican government over allegations they aided and abetted illegal gun sales to Mexican cartels.

The high court's decision in Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos was unanimous, finding that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a statute that protects gun makers from lawsuits, did not include exceptions that gave the Mexican government the ability to sue.

""The kinds of allegations Mexico makes cannot satisfy the demands of the statute's predicate exception,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court.

Kagan noted the exceptions in the law would allow a lawsuit against the gun makers if they ""proximately caused"" Mexico harm.

""Mexico's complaint, for the reasons given, does not plausibly allege such aiding and abetting,"" Kagan wrote. ""So this suit remains subject to PLCAA's general bar: An action cannot be brought against a manufacturer if, like Mexico's, it is founded on a third party's criminal use of the company's product.""

The Supreme Court concluded that the ""proximate cause"" standard meant the U.S. manufacturers could not be sued when the complex commerce pipeline goes from them to wholesalers, distributors, rogue retail dealers, straw purchasers, smugglers and then to the Mexican cartels.

The case came before the high court during a delicate time for both countries, politically and diplomatically.

The Trump administration has pushed the Mexican government to better patrol its border to block drugs and migrants from entering the U.S., while Mexican officials have demanded the U.S. stop military-style firearms from ending up in Mexico — fueling the very drug crisis both sides seek to end.

During the proceedings, attorneys for Mexico, which has strict gun sale restrictions, argued the country should be allowed to file a $10 billion civil lawsuit in U.S. courts. 

The gun makers countered that their standard business practices were being unfairly targeted and that they had no awareness that their products had been illegally transported into Mexico.

Like Mexico, families of gun violence victims, such as the parents of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, have also tried to bypass the PLCAA, but this case marks the first time the Supreme Court has examined the limits of the law.

The Sandy Hook families reached a $73 million out-of-court settlement with gun maker Remington.

Gun control advocates have argued the high court ruling against Mexico will make it harder for them to go after U.S. gun manufacturers when future mass shootings occur, if it can be proven they knowingly and foreseeably broke the law.

Second Amendment rights groups, meanwhile, have said a lawful and heavily regulated industry should not be subject to liability for criminal acts committed by armed gangs in another country.

The Supreme Court agreed with the gun rights groups in this case. Kagan wrote that Mexico's complaint did not ""plausibly allege the kind of ‘conscious... and culpable participation in another's wrongdoing' needed to make out an aiding-and-abetting charge"" against the gun companies.

Fourth-generation farmer Andrew Leimgruber discusses the ramifications of China's purchasing of U.S. farmland on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, Democrat Sen. John Fetterman and others are teaming up on legislation to codify oversight on foreign countries buying American farmland.

The bipartisan Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to implement recommendations published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2024, which found the AFIDA was ill-equipped to combat foreign ownership of American agricultural land. 

""American farmland should remain in the hands of American farmers and ranchers, not foreign adversaries,"" Ricketts of Nebraska shared first with Fox News Digital. ""The neighbors who feed us should benefit from land ownership, not Communist China. Food security is national security.""

The bill, also co-sponsored by Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska introduced legislation, requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than one percent interest in American agricultural land.

""Over the past several decades, China has been buying up American farmland in an attempt to infiltrate our agriculture supply chains. Food security is national security, and we cannot give the CCP a foothold,"" Tuberville said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The AFIDA Improvements Act aims to increase information-sharing between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It also requires updates to the AFIDA's handbook and establishes a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system. 

The bill's House sponsor, Bacon, told Fox News Digital that ""having actual processes in place will strengthen the security of our nation in the event nefarious foreign agents, such as the CCP, try to purchase agricultural lands within our nation."" 

A tractor collects bales of hay during a heatwave outside Elgin, Texas, on Wednesday, July 20, 2022.  

Based on the GAO's recommendations, the bill seeks to update the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 to better equip the USDA to combat foreign adversaries' ownership of American agricultural land.

Under AFIDA, foreign entities must disclose to the USDA transactions of American agricultural land. 

Foreign investors own over 40 million acres of agricultural land in the United States, and between 2010 and 2021, Chinese ownership of American agricultural land increased from 13,720 acres to 383,935 acres, according to the USDA. 

The AFIDA Improvements Act is the latest attempt by Congressional Republicans to track foreign ownership of American farmland and strengthen national security. It was first introduced by Bacon and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., in 2024. 

China owned around 350,000 acres of farmland across 27 states as of last year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture

The movement to ban China from buying U.S. farmland located near military bases has been gaining steam in the Senate this year. The PASS Act, led by Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., has the backing of Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and would prevent any entity from a ""covered country,"" which includes China, North Korea, Russia and Iran, from purchasing agricultural land near military bases or sensitive sites. 

Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Katie Britt of Alabama, proposed The Not One More Inch or Acre Act, earlier this year to ban China from buying U.S. land entirely.

On the presidential campaign trail in 2024, President Donald Trump indicated he would ban China from buying American farmland. 

The Senate passed an amendment with bipartisan support in 2023 that would ban China, Russia, North Korea and Iran from buying American farmland and agricultural businesses, but it did not become law.

Rocky Cole, former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency and co-founder of iVerify, told Fox News Digital China is trying to place equipment in ""strategic places"" to disrupt commerce in the U.S.

A former analyst with the National Security Agency said that China is positioning equipment in ""strategic places"" that could be used to disrupt U.S. commerce after rogue communication devices were found inside Chinese solar power inverters.

Rogue communication devices that were not in official product documents were found inside Chinese solar power inverters when they were examined by U.S. experts for possible security issues, two sources told Reuters.

The two sources said that the rogue power inverters have undocumented communication channels which could be used to circumvent firewalls remotely, which could have major consequences. These power inverters connect the solar panel to electic grids.

Rocky Cole, former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency and co-founder of iVerify, told Fox News Digital it's ""very conceivable"" that China is using these rogue power inverters to gain access to American infrastructure.

""It very much fits into the model of China implanting hardware in American critical infrastructure for the purpose of planning cyberattacks against the United States in the event of, say, a conflict with Taiwan or something along those lines,"" Cole said. 

Chinese companies are mandated by law to assist China's intelligence agencies when needed.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. gave Fox News Digital the following statement:

""The goal of China's pursuit of development is to enable its people to live a better life. We oppose the presumption of guilt under unclear facts, the generalization of the concept of national security, and the distortion and smear of China's achievements in the field of energy infrastructure,"" Pengyu said.

According to one of the sources, the undocumented communication devices, which include cellular radios, were found in batteries from multiple suppliers from China over the past nine months.

Cole said this is just another example of China preparing for a possible conflict involving the U.S.

""There are communications devices in these really strategic places that you can imagine could theoretically be used to disrupt U.S. commerce in the event of some sort of conflict,"" Cole said. ""It's difficult not to view Chinese-made hardware in the realm of critical infrastructure as a national security threat in my mind.""

""Any time that you have any time that there's a supply chain outside the U.S. or U.S.-allied countries, that presents opportunities for what's called in intelligence parlance, supply chain operation, which means intelligence operatives work with the manufacturers to implant backdoors in the hardware,"" he added. 

""Without strict oversight of supply chains, it becomes very difficult to certify with any confidence that your hardware doesn't contain these backdoors implanted in supply chain operations. I think it's critically important that American officials are aware of the risks posed by Chinese-made hardware as it relates to critical infrastructure.""

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin has updates on Oscar Eduardo Ortega-Anguiano's pending early release from prison after has convicted of manslaughter on 'Special Report.'

Jurors in Washington state delivered a guilty verdict against an illegal immigrant accused of killing a state trooper last year. 

Raul Benitez-Santana, 33, was found guilty of vehicular assault and vehicular homicide in connection with the death of Washington State Patrol Trooper Christopher Gadd.

Gadd, 27, was killed when his cruiser was hit by a speeding car in March 2024 at more than 100 mph.

Benitez-Santana was under the influence at the time of the crash, and admitted to drinking and smoking marijuana before driving, Fox Seattle reported. 

He was swerving across the road before slamming into the rear end of Gadd's vehicle, which was parked on the shoulder. Gadd was watching for speeding and DUI drivers, when he was struck and killed in a three-vehicle crash on Interstate 5.

After his arrest, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a detainer request with Snohomish County Jail for Benitez-Santana, a Mexican citizen.

He was first encountered by immigration agents on Oct. 28, 2013, at the South Correctional Entity in Burien, Washington, after being arrested for failing to appear in court for driving on a suspended license.

He was also sentenced to 90 days behind bars, with 87 of the days suspended, in May 2013, after being convicted of possessing less than 40 grams of marijuana.

On Oct. 6, 2014, Santana was sentenced to 90 days behind bars for driving on a suspended license, and in May 2019, was arrested again for domestic violence assault.

 Why Chinese students are in the administration's crosshairs

President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation to student visas for foreigners seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard University, the move in the ongoing feud between the White House and the Ivy League school. 

The proclamation directs the State Department to ""consider revoking"" existing academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet certain criteria. 

""Admission into the United States to attend, conduct research, or teach at our Nation's institutions of higher education is a privilege granted by our Government, not a guarantee,"" Trump said. ""That privilege is necessarily tied to the host institution's compliance and commitment to following Federal law.  Harvard University has failed in this respect, among many others.""

The proclamation doesn't apply to foreign nationals attending other universities' Student Exchange Visa Program (SEVP) and exempts others whose entry is deemed in the national interest.

Last month, the State Department said that it would begin scrutinizing all visa holders associated with Harvard University, not just student visa holders. The investigation is aimed at identifying potential security vulnerabilities or other abuses of the visa system.

Wednesday's proclamation cited Harvard's history ""concerning foreign ties and radicalism.""

""Harvard has failed to provide sufficient information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about foreign students' known illegal or dangerous activities, reporting deficient data on only three students,"" it said. 

It said Harvard has also developed ""extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries,"" while receiving more than $150 million from China alone. 

In exchange, Harvard has ""hosted Chinese Communist Party paramilitary members and partnered with China-based individuals on research that could advance China's military modernization.""

The Trump administration has accused Harvard of failing to stamp out antisemitism on campus, among other issues.  

The proclamation said Harvard has seen a ""drastic rise in crime in recent years while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus.""

Harvard officials have said the Trump administration is retaliating against the university with moves to freeze taxpayer-funded research grants, an attempt to revoke its ability to enroll international students, to end its tax-exempt status and to open an investigation into whether it discriminated against white, Asian, male or straight employees or job applicants.

Former NY Gov. Cuomo dismissed accusations in NYC mayoral debate about lying to Congress over his role in a report that undercounted the amount of nursing home deaths during COVID. (Credit: WNBC/WNJU)

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was blasted by fellow Democrats running against him to be the next mayor of New York City for lying to Congress, an allegation pushed by Republicans that the Trump administration is currently investigating. 

Cuomo repeatedly dismissed questions throughout Wednesday night's debate on whether he lied to Congress about his role in drafting a New York State Department of Health report that officials determined had undercounted the number of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Cuomo blasted the current investigation as a symptom of partisan politics and insisted the report in question ""did not undercount the deaths.""

""The people died and he still won't answer your questions,"" Cuomo's opponent, Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman from the Bronx, said after Cuomo failed to provide a straight answer.

Blake's retort resulted in one of the debate moderators asking Cuomo once again to respond to the allegations that he lied to Congress about his role in drafting the report that undercounted the number of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. This time, he engaged.

""No, I told Congress the truth,"" Cuomo relented. ""No, we did not undercount any deaths,"" he added. ""When they are all counted, we're number 38 out of 50, which I think, shows that compared to what other states went through, we had it first and worst, and that only 12 states had a lower rate of death – we should really be thanking the women and men who worked on those things.""

""It's just a yes or no question,"" the moderator shot back at Cuomo. ""Were you involved in the producing of that report?""

However, Cuomo still did not address the question directly, leading to laughter from his opponents. 

BILL MAHER SUGGESTS ANDREW CUOMO'S NURSING HOME SCANDAL MAY COST HIS NYC MAYORAL CAMPAIGN

""It's not only that Andrew Cuomo lied to Congress – which is perjury – he also lied to the grieving families whose loved ones he sent in to those nursing homes to protect his $5 million book deal,"" said Brad Lander, New York City's comptroller. ""That's corruption."" 

Last month, the Trump administration's Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation to get to the bottom of whether Cuomo lied to Congress about the decisions he made during the COVID-19 pandemic while serving as governor.

In March 2020, Cuomo issued a directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The directive was meant to free up beds for overwhelmed hospitals, but more than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were ultimately released from hospitals into nursing homes under the directive, which was later rescinded amid speculation that it had accelerated outbreaks. 

Subsequently, a report released in March 2022 by the New York state comptroller found Cuomo's Health Department ""was not transparent in its reporting of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes"" and it ""understated the number of deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50%"" during some points of the pandemic. New York Attorney General Letitia James similarly released a report amid the pandemic showing New York state nursing home deaths had been undercounted.

President Donald Trump has ordered an unprecedented investigation into former President Joe Biden‘s administration amid concerns his predecessor and his aides covered up his cognitive decline.

“In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,” Trump wrote in a presidential memorandum signed on Wednesday. “This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history.”

The president added: “Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name.”

The investigation, to be led by White House counsel David Warrington in coordination with Attorney General Pam Bondi, is to uncover whether “certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President,” according to the memorandum.

The memorandum details Trump's desire to investigate whether Biden's aides conspired to make false statements about the then-president's capabilities and to dismiss recorded videos of his cognitive inability as fake.

“The Counsel to the President shall also investigate, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant agency, the circumstances surrounding Biden's supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,” the memorandum states. “This investigation shall address: (i) the policy documents for which the autopen was used, including clemency grants, Executive Orders, Presidential memoranda, or other Presidential policy decisions; and (ii) who directed that the President's signature be affixed.”

The memorandum coincides with a separate Justice Department investigation by Ed Martin into whether Biden “was competent and whether others were taking advantage of him through use of AutoPen or other means” that Martin announced earlier this week.

Biden responded with a statement Wednesday night, saying, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.”

JAMES COMER HEARS TESTIMONY ON HOW BIDEN AIDES CARRIED OUT ‘IMPERSONATION OF THE PRESIDENT'

Both House and Senate Republicans have launched their own investigations into Biden's autopen use and whether he was in charge during his presidency, including House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), who is asking former Biden aides and his White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, to sit for transcribed interviews before his panel.

Biden's cognitive decline is under renewed scrutiny after the publication last month of Original Sin, a book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which reports on how Biden aides protected and shielded the former president.

Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would have prohibited the Chinese government from owning real estate in Arizona.

Arizona Senate Bill 1109 stipulated that the “People's Republic of China may not purchase, own, acquire by grant or devise or have a substantial interest in real property in this state.” The law was to be enforced by Arizona's attorney general if he or she suspected a real estate transaction violated the law. 

“This act is necessary to protect this state from global security threats and halt or reverse the influence operation of the Chinese Communist Party that poses a risk to the national security of the United States,” read the bill. “This act is necessary to protect the critical infrastructure of this state.”

Defenders of the bill say it was necessary legislation to prevent PRC officials from purchasing land near military bases in Arizona for espionage purposes. Hobbs said she vetoed the bill because it failed to prevent such transactions and could be used under false pretenses and “arbitrary enforcement” in the future. The governor found that SB1109 was “ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets.”

“It lacks clear implementation criteria and opens the door to arbitrary enforcement,” Hobbs said. 

Arizona state Senate Majority Leader Janae Shamp, a Republican, was one of the bill's cosponsors. She claimed Hobbs's veto was politically motivated and created an unnecessary security risk.

“SB1109 was a commonsense measure to ensure enemies of the United States would not have easy access to our military bases and critical infrastructure to carry out harm,” Shamp said.

Shamp was not alone in her criticism. Hobbs's veto drew the ire from conservatives and national security organizations, including Michael Lucci, the founder of State Armor. 

US VETOES UN RESOLUTION CALLING FOR CEASEFIRE IN GAZA

“Governor Hobbs's veto of SB 1109 hangs an ‘Open for the CCP' sign on Arizona's front door, allowing Communist China to buy up American land near critical assets like Luke Air Force Base, Palo Verde nuclear power plant, and Taiwan Semiconductor's growing fabrication footprint,” Lucci said in a comment to Fox News.

“Allowing Communist China to buy up land near our critical assets is a national security risk, plain and simple, and Governor Hobbs is substantively and completely wrong when she says that SB 1109 ‘is ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets,'” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that Wisconsin violated the Constitution by forcing a Catholic nonprofit organization to pay into the state's unemployment insurance program, delivering a win for religious liberty advocates and narrowing how far states can go in defining what counts as “religious.”

In an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the high court found that the Catholic Charities Bureau of the Diocese of Superior qualifies for a religious exemption under state law, rebuking the state's argument that the organization's social services are too “secular” to merit protection.

“There may be hard calls to make in policing that rule,” Sotomayor wrote. “But this is not one.”

The decision marks another entry in the high court's growing list of First Amendment victories for faith-based plaintiffs. It comes amid a term packed with closely watched religious rights cases — from faith-based objections to LGBT-themed books in schools to an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Catholic charter school.

Catholic Charities, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, sued after Wisconsin denied its bid to join the Catholic Church's own unemployment program, which mirrors the state's but is managed through the diocese. The state said the nonprofit organization didn't qualify for an exemption because it doesn't preach or limit services to Catholics, and most of its employees and clients aren't church members.

The justices rejected Wisconsin's test as constitutionally flawed.

Under Wisconsin law, groups “operated primarily for religious purposes” are exempt from paying into the state system. Catholic Charities argued that it meets that standard because its charitable work is inseparable from its religious mission to serve the vulnerable, even without explicit evangelization. The Supreme Court agreed, warning that Wisconsin's approach would entangle the government in defining religious expression.

The ruling overturns a 2023 decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which held that Catholic Charities' job training, housing, and disability services were not “inherently religious.” That court's reasoning sparked concern among religious freedom advocates, who said the decision penalized faith groups for expressing their religion through action rather than proselytization.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department backed Catholic Charities in the case, arguing in a friend-of-the-court brief that the state's policy violated the First Amendment by forcing officials to police which religious activities are “sufficiently religious” to warrant protection.

Wisconsin officials had warned that a ruling for Catholic Charities could spur other large religious employers, such as affiliated hospitals, to leave the state system, weakening the funding pool. Labor groups also argued that private church-run programs offer fewer protections for workers and exclude supplemental federal benefits such as those provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CATHOLIC CHARITIES CHALLENGES ‘NON-RELIGIOUS' LABEL AT SUPREME COURT

But Catholic Charities said its system is faster, offers equal or better benefits, and aligns more closely with its mission.

Thursday's decision underscores the high court's broader skepticism toward government efforts to draw sharp lines between religious and secular conduct. While the justices have not always ruled in favor of faith groups, particularly in cases where justices recuse themselves or diverge on funding issues, they have consistently affirmed that the First Amendment bars states from second-guessing how religious beliefs are expressed.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino knocked former FBI Director James Comey for the “mess” he left at the agency and said it's “stunning” how Comey continues to target new leadership.

Bongino revealed last week that new leadership discovered a box of Comey-era evidence, which had been “hidden” from them. The deputy director said on Wednesday that it is “ironic” that Comey had “a lot to say” about FBI Director Kash Patel and himself, considering the box's contents.

“We found documents, documents that were not where they should have been, and they were not good, flattering documents for Jim Comey,” Bongino said on Fox News's Hannity. “So the hubris displayed by a man like Jim Comey, who disgraced the FBI numerous times with his role in Crossfire Hurricane and other abominations. It's just kind of stunning that he continues to attack our leadership when we have to clean up the mess Jim Comey created, as we continue to find stuff from his era in vintage.”

Bongino called documents from Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI's former investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trump‘s 2016 campaign and Russia, the most “troubling” as they work to reform the agency. He noted that the public is pressuring the agency to release the documents, but underscored that getting the information out is a “rolling production.”

“The bad people kind of knew what they were doing,” Bongino said.

However, Bongino gave a short preview of the documents, saying one he read indicated “a large degree of malfeasance” was at play.

FBI SENT ANTI-CATHOLIC MEMO TO OVER 1,000 EMPLOYEES, NEW RECORDS SHOW

Bongino also credited Trump and his crackdown on illegal immigration, as the country's murder rate is trending toward its lowest levels. He predicted a similar decline would also occur in crime rates by the end of the year. Bongino added that Trump has a vision to fix the southern border “for good,” and that a small population who commits the majority of crimes cannot do so if they are deported.

Bongino said the FBI's priorities for the next year are playing “a key role” in deporting illegal criminals and protecting the United States from China, adding, “We are on it.” ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) signaled victory in his war against Medicaid reform this week, posting on social media, “Just had a great talk with President Trump about the Big, Beautiful Bill. He said again, NO MEDICAID BENEFIT CUTS.” 

Hawley's crusade against “taking healthcare away from working families to give tax breaks to the ultra-rich” is straight out of Sen. Bernie Sanders‘s (I-VT) class-warfare playbook and will lead to similarly disastrous results. His characterization of reformers within the Republican Party as “a noisy contingent of corporatist Republicans — call it the party's Wall Street wing” set on “corporate giveaways, preferences for capital and deep cuts to social insurance” is similarly cheap and divisive. Hawley avoids substance because his policy position is indefensible.

Medicaid and other means-tested social-welfare spending are the largest contributors to the ever-ballooning federal deficit. Social Security and Medicare are often cited as the main fiscal problems, but welfare programs are by far the bigger fiscal burden. Since the War on Poverty began in 1967, welfare payments to the bottom income quintile have surged 780% in real terms, from $7,352 to $64,700 per household, outpacing average household income growth by 9.2 times. The program has expanded by over 50% since 2019 and is projected to exceed a trillion dollars annually by 2030, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.

This explosion in spending is unsustainable and could lead to a debt crisis that risks market volatility, currency devaluation, and inflation spikes while severely disrupting economic growth. Drastic tax hikes would likely follow. The program would face insolvency. States would begin to ration care, and benefits would be reduced. The very people Hawley purports to champion would be hurt the most. 

Medicaid's enrollment surge following the passage of Obamacare and the COVID-19 pandemic also indicates its unsustainability. As of 2023, Medicaid enrolled 82 million people, or roughly 24% of the U.S. population, a significant increase from 65 million in 2013 and 28 million in 2000. 

The exponential acceleration in growth in the past two decades is driven by a combination of bad policy decisions that expanded eligibility and reduced accountability. Obamacare allowed states to expand Medicaid to non-elderly adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. The CBO estimates this added $150 billion annually to federal Medicaid spending by 2023, a sizable chunk of the program's $648 billion overall cost. COVID-19 policy further padded the rolls. Lax eligibility verification in the form of minimal annual checks, presumptive eligibility, and auto-enrollment prioritizes access over accuracy. 

Medicaid's sprawl comes with significant social consequences, particularly in relation to the participation of young, able-bodied men in the workforce. Alarmingly, only 36% of prime work-age adults in the bottom income quintile were employed in 2022, down from 68% in 1967. Labor force participation among low-income men aged 25-54 fell from 90% in 1970 to 78% in 2023. Meanwhile, welfare payments, including Medicaid, surged by 780%, and enrollees often avoided earning too much to retain benefits. Reduced incentives to work have unsurprisingly led to fewer able-bodied men working. The work requirement in the House bill is eminently reasonable, encouraging able-bodied adults to engage in employment or training while maintaining access to essential benefits.

CBO SAYS REPUBLICAN MEGABILL WILL ADD $2.4 TRILLION TO DEFICIT

Fewer men working means fewer men getting married. Nonworking men are less likely to marry, contributing to a rise in single-parent households. This destabilizes communities, with child poverty rates higher in those households than in two-parent homes. 

The system Hawley is fighting to maintain with Trump's apparent backing is hurtling the nation toward a fiscal disaster and disintegrating the social fabric. The senator speaks of “delivering on America's promise for America's working people” by ignoring calls to cut Medicaid. But his efforts, draped in false compassion, all but ensure a more difficult path for the working class to achieve the American dream.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

House Republicans are already teasing the idea of a second budget bill to advance President Donald Trump‘s agenda, even as the Senate has yet to act on his most sweeping priorities.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has offered few details of what might be contained in the package, but when asked by the Washington Examiner he named “fiscal sanity” as the guiding ethos behind the bill.

“I said this is the beginning of a process and what you're going to see is a continuing theme of us identifying waste, fraud, and abuse in government, which is our pledge of common sense, restoring common sense and fiscal sanity, so we have lots of ideas of things that might be in that package,” Johnson told the Washington Examiner.

Fiscal hawks demanded steep spending cuts as part of the “big, beautiful bill,” which the Senate hopes to pass by July 4, but were forced to make more modest changes in a compromise with House centrists. Already, Republicans are eyeing the same priorities as Johnson turns his attention to another budget resolution that allows them to sidestep the Senate filibuster.“Cleaning up all the SALT mess would be my first choice,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) told the Washington Examiner.

“I would like to see as much of the IRA cut out as possible. I'd like to see the SALT go away. I'd like to see savings to get as close to neutral on the deficit spending as possible,” Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA) told the Washington Examiner.

“More cuts, I mean just the same thing Elon is saying,” Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) told the Washington Examiner. “We don't have the deficit reduction that we need, but it's a first step.”

“Probably the things that we should have done in this one,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told the Washington Examiner. “Reduce more spending. Do the things we should have done to reform Medicaid fully, do the things we should have done to fully repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Johnson first floated the idea of another budget bill over the weekend, stating on Meet the Press on Sunday that Republicans were “going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this, and we're beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government.”Johnson told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that Republicans have been working on the first reconciliation bill for a total of 14 months, emphasizing how long the process takes.

“We will go through that same laborious process, and it will be fruitful in the end, and we will do right by the American people,” he said.  

Tensions have run high between different factions of the GOP conference throughout the reconciliation process. On one end, some centrist Republicans in states like California and New York had aggressively advocating to increase the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. Standing in the way of SALT Republicans are the fiscal hawks, who warned Republicans over the last few months that their support for the bill hinged on finding enough cuts to offset the tax cuts.

Before passing the House, the updated bill text contained language to appease holdouts by moving up Medicaid work requirement implementation to December 2026 and raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,400 for people making under $505,000, with a 1% annual increase over eight years. This amendment provided final changes to policy areas included in the megabill that each of the House's 11 committees took up and passed over the last month.  

Whether this megabill will come to fruition will only be told by time. But as the midterm elections quickly approach, and Congress does the heavy lifting before campaign season rolls around, some members question the purpose of talks of a second package. 

“I think second reconciliation package talk is code for trying to appease not doing what I think needs to be done in this package,” Roy told the Washington Examiner.

“Once you move this bill through with the key things, and you want to come back later and say, ‘We'll do some spending cuts later,' they won't,” Roy added.

When President Donald Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion programs for the deadly January crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, some aviation officials were appalled. Some were simply perplexed. But few officials inside the Federal Aviation Administration took the president's remarks seriously.

Not so for the political leadership of the Department of Transportation. The FAA's parent agency agreed in March to spend as much as $2.1 million on an investigation into DEI policies and their impact on recent safety incidents. To conduct that investigation, the Trump administration has turned to Alex Spiro, a former prosecutor and a prominent defense attorney who has represented Elon Musk, among other billionaires and celebrities.

I obtained the “scope of work” document for Spiro's investigation, which is marked “privileged” and “confidential” and has not been previously reported. It shows how the president's musings—his accusations, he said at the time, were based on “very strong opinions and ideas”—translate into taxpayer-funded government action. It also reveals the cost of the administration's fixation on DEI at a time when the FAA is struggling to hire and retain air-traffic controllers, linchpins of aviation safety, and when Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, is seeking funds to overhaul the country's antiquated air-traffic-control system. Recent radar outages at Newark Liberty International Airport have caused severe flight delays and spotlighted just how deep technology and staffing problems run.

The investigation by Spiro, a partner at the elite firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, is due to conclude soon, a person familiar with the dynamics told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the work. Contrary to what Trump may hope, it's not expected to find that programs aimed at ensuring representation for women and people of color are responsible for this year's string of aviation disasters, including the January crash at Reagan airport, which killed 67 people and prompted Trump's tirade against DEI.

That determination, several air-traffic controllers told me, hardly required a multimillion-dollar probe. It's true that past FAA hiring practices have been controversial. A biographical questionnaire introduced in 2014 as part of an effort to increase the diversity of the applicant pool faced criticism from candidates who said they'd lost out on jobs because they didn't fit a preferred profile. It was scrapped by Congress in 2018. Even if diversity preferences influence which candidates are sent to air-traffic facilities—“unlikely,” as one controller put it to me—those candidates still have to be trained and recommended for certification by their peers and monitored by a supervisor, the controller said. Controllers have little incentive to recommend someone who isn't qualified, because that person could wind up next to them, jointly responsible for keeping planes in the air. “If that person can't do the job, they aren't making it through the hiring process,” this controller told me.

Another controller put it more bluntly, calling the investigation a “waste of money.” The controller pointed to severe strains on the workforce following a series of disturbing incidents caused by communications breakdowns and other disruptions, which led multiple controllers to request trauma leave. He told me, “That's $2 million that could have gone toward pain-and-suffering raises for controllers.”

The scope-of-work document outlines exactly what the money is buying the government. Interviews with 10 to 15 “key stakeholders” were estimated to cost as much as $150,000 (“includes preparation and documentation of findings”), statistical analysis another $100,000 (“examination of data by expert statistician”). Finally, the cost of legal analysis was expected to total up to $1,800,000, covering document and data collection and examination as well as “legal memorandum preparation.”

The investigation seeks to answer several questions: what DEI policies exist, how they influence the hiring of air-traffic controllers, and whether there's a link between DEI practices and recent safety incidents. To answer these questions, the firm said it would commit a team, including four former federal prosecutors with experience conducting investigations.

The investigation could end up costing the government more than the expected $2.1 million. Spiro's outline indicates that each additional week of work, beyond the anticipated two to three weeks, is estimated to add $200,000 to $300,000 in fees. Each additional interview required for the probe will also cost $10,000 to $15,000.

In a statement, a DOT spokesperson said “there is no price on safety.”

“We launched this investigation because of DEI and cheating allegations inside the air traffic control organization,” the spokesperson, Nate Sizemore, added. “It's a shame that the Atlantic thinks that should be dismissed.”

The scope-of-work document was addressed to Pete Meachum, the chief of staff at the Department of Transportation and a former congressional aide to Duffy. A Wisconsin Republican, Duffy left Congress in 2019 to work as a lobbyist and a Fox Business co-host. Duffy was confirmed as Trump's transportation secretary on January 28. A day later, he signed what the department called a “Woke Rescission” memo, directing various offices to “identify and eliminate all Biden-era programs, policies, activities, rules, and orders that promote climate change activism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, racial equity, gender identity policies, environmental justice, and other partisan objectives.” That was the same day that American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army helicopter near Reagan airport. Trump promptly blamed past Democratic presidents for the crash, suggesting that they had lowered standards for key aviation roles. “We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” he said.

In a Fox interview following the crash, Duffy seemed to endorse the president's comments about DEI, saying, “You can't focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion when you try to hire air-traffic controllers. You focus on the best and the brightest.”

A shortage of controllers means that the best and the brightest have been working long hours under stressful conditions, made worse by the departure of hundreds of FAA employees in crucial support roles who have accepted the government's offer of early retirement. Duffy told Congress last month that his department “can do more with less,” suggesting that savings from staff reductions could be used to fund overdue infrastructure upgrades. And apparently investigations into DEI, as well.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

No, really

Want to stay current with Arthur's writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.

My preoccupation with writing about meaning, love, and happiness derives from my desire to understand these parts of life more deeply, and impart to others whatever understanding I can glean. I will confess that this can be a frustrating task at times because I feel as though I can never get to the essence of these sublimities; words always feel inadequate. For a long time, I believed that at some point—maybe after writing a million more words—I would finally arrive at the ability to adequately express what it is that I'm seeking.

The philosopher Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein, who died in 1951, probably would have told me I was barking up the wrong tree. The writer and fellow philosopher Bertrand Russell called Wittgenstein's work “perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense and dominating,” yet Wittgenstein did not leave us much of it. He published only one book of philosophy in his life, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which itself is only about 75 pages long. In it, Wittgenstein explained that language can never convey the fullest understanding of life. “The limits of my language,” he wrote, “mean the limits of my world.”

Wittgenstein was no doubt conscious of the irony of making this argument through language. But in so doing, he offered a path to getting beyond words and to apprehend, after all, the ineffable essence of what we seek.

Arthur C. Brooks: The ultimate German philosophy for a happier life

Human communication is rife with misunderstanding, as social scientists have long observed. Researchers writing in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology in 2011 showed that people misunderstand the intended meaning of what others say, especially among close acquaintances such as family and friends. The scholars found that those who spoke with strangers communicated more clearly than with close associates, believing—incorrectly—that the latter would understand ambiguous phrases by virtue of their intimate affiliation. So what are the odds that you'll grasp correctly the next thing your spouse tells you? Digital communication makes the situation worse because it eliminates nonverbal cues.

One explanation psychologists offer as a common cause of misunderstanding is motivated reasoning, in which our own desires and beliefs determine what we perceive to be true, rather than what someone else is telling us. For example, when your partner innocently asks what you've been up to today, you might incorrectly apprehend this as an expression of suspicion, because, in fact, you've been up to something they wouldn't approve of.

Whereas psychologists see the problem as one of unreliable narrators and inattentive listeners, Wittgenstein, as a philosopher, saw the very medium of language itself as inherently flawed. Words, he believed, were inadequate to the task of conveying subtle truths, metaphysical ideas, or any subjective experience. This was because language is nothing more than a crude model of the world—a jumble of sounds or symbols that represents the underlying reality of existence about as accurately as a map on your phone represents a forest you're walking through. The sight of tall trees, the smell of pine needles, the solitude you sought have virtually nothing to do with the squiggle on the screen that crudely marks the trail.

Wittgenstein never knew our modern technologies of communication, but he would surely see that they make his point times 10. Consider how much a text-message abbreviation and an emoji really tell you about what is in your beloved's heart. LOL, not much, right?

Wittgenstein's proposition has significant implications for happiness, because misunderstanding lowers our well-being. For example, experiments show how failing to be understood by others reduces the satisfaction that participants report in subsequent activities. Even more profound, his conclusion about the inadequacy of language suggests that we will never comprehend the true meaning of our lives by reading or talking about it.

How are we to escape this thicket of muddle and misunderstanding? To find meaning without words suggests that we need to seek a particular kind of transcendence.

Arthur C. Brooks: The key to critical self-awareness

Wittgenstein's contention resembles Saint Augustine of Hippo's argument that God is what we want, but God's nature also evades human expression—in fact, merely to talk about the divine is to trivialize him. But Augustine did not think that we should therefore abandon the whole project. The trick is to see language as only the beginning of a spiritual journey, not the end. He suggested that we use just one word—Deus (Latin for “God”)—as an audible departure point into the realm of the inexpressible. “When that sound reaches” your ears,” he wrote, “think of a nature supreme in excellence and eternal in existence.”

This is, I believe, very close to what Wittgenstein suggested as well. I would recommend a couple of signposts to guide you on your journey beyond words.

1. Think; don't talk. Many religious and wisdom traditions recommend meditative contemplation on a single concept. Tibetan Buddhists call it “analytical meditation,” a practice with which the Dalai Lama starts his morning, as he told me, and to which he devotes at least an hour every day. This mode of meditation involves a focused reflection on a scriptural phrase to inspire insight into what it signifies. (The Augustinian version of this practice was, in effect, to make Deus his word to meditate upon.)

If I'm doing this, I might use the phrase “I love my wife” as my starting point. Then I'd try to engage the right hemisphere of my brain, the region that processes meaningful associations and concepts, in contrast with the left hemisphere's logical problem-solving ability. The idea is to liberate my cognition from the limits of my vocabulary and linguistic ability—easier said than done, but it can be enough to just sit in silence with my phrase or allow my mind to roam on a forest walk.

2. Seek understanding, not answers. The second step—which is allied with disengaging our habitual left-brain dominance—is to stop looking for exact answers to difficult questions. The purpose of analytical meditation is not to generate a clean explanation for why I love my wife. Nor is it to compose a precise but prosaic argument for why I do so. That would be to go in the wrong direction, according to Wittgenstein and Augustine, only committing me more to the poverty of language and taking me further from the underlying truth.

As soon as one tries to verbalize an answer to explain this love—“Because she is good to me”—one has belittled the concept and literally understated its truth. Consider how even the greatest love poetry—such as these lines from Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “I love thee with the breath, / Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, / I shall but love thee better after death”—essentially restates the Augustinian verity that this deeply complex experience defies utterance. The goal is to gain an understanding of this love, not an answer that's like the solution to a mathematical equation.

Arthur C. Brooks: The bliss of a quieter ego

What would Wittgenstein have us do about our ultimate problem of meaning in life? “Whereof one cannot speak,” he offered as the last proposition in Tractatus, “thereof one must be silent.” By all means, talk about trivial things, he seems to be saying, but don't waste your time trying to express life's profundities, because you will only fool others and frustrate yourself; better to keep your counsel.

This injunction has generally been understood as a nihilistic statement of the impossibility of expression, and therefore of knowledge. I believe it is nothing of the sort. Being silent is the beginning of a different sort of cognition, a meditational path that does not seek straightforward answers. Allow yourself this silence, and the understanding you gain will be your ineffable reward.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

An interview with Tamir Pardo, who argues that Israel's military campaign has been flawed from the start

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

In John le Carré novels, the spies often lie and keep secrets even when they don't have to, because it's a “mentality,” le Carré once explained, a way of living “you never shed.” So it was notable when 250 veteran Israeli intelligence officers recently signed their names to an open letter demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu throw away his plans to escalate the war on Gaza. The war, they wrote, “doesn't contribute to any of the declared objectives, and will lead to the death of hostages, soldiers and innocents.” At least six other similar petitions have circulated, signed by reservists, retired officers, and veterans from various branches of the Israeli military. “That's the first time that's happened in Israel,” says Tamir Pardo, our guest on Radio Atlantic this week and one of three former Mossad directors who signed the open letter.

After my interview with Pardo, in Tel Aviv, he asked me to emphasize one thing: His position on the war does not make him a “leftist,” he said. And I could see his point all around me in Tel Aviv, where opposition to the war has spread far beyond the Israeli left, and far beyond the families of the remaining Israeli hostages. In a recent poll, 70 percent of Israelis said they don't trust the government, and about the same portion said they want a deal with Hamas to return the hostages and end the war—something the government has resisted even in this latest round of cease-fire talks. The protests are not, for the most part, focused on the suffering of Gazans, as protests are in other parts of the world. They're primarily about returning the hostages. But Pardo and others made clear to me that they believe the war is not serving Israel in any way. They want it to end.

The latest cease-fire proposal includes an exchange of hostages, living and dead, for Palestinian prisoners. Israel has promised a temporary cessation of fighting but, as of yet, no commitment to end the war. In this episode, Pardo, with his decades of experience fighting terrorism, explains his perspective on how the war unfolded, what went wrong, and what should happen now.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

News clip:   It's been 100 days since the attack by Hamas in southern Israel.  

News clip: —100 days of grief and protests—

News clip:  Israel and Hamas have been at war for six months.

News clip: It's been exactly a year—

News clip: One year after the horror—

News clip:  It's been nearly 600 days since Israel's war on Gaza began.

News clip: —600 days since Hamas militants staged their murderous attack on October 7. Six hundred days, and they are still holding 58 Israeli hostages.

Hanna Rosin: The war continues day after day, month after month. Now over a year and half old, though, it feels like it's at a new breaking point.

News clip:  In Gaza, concerns of famine grow, which is why chaos broke out at the opening of an aid-distribution site in Gaza that's run by a U.S.-backed group.

News clip:  Israel imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on March 2.

Rosin: This week, there's a temporary cease-fire proposal on the table. The potential deal involves releasing 10 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 18 dead.

News clip:  Hamas did not explicitly accept or reject the offer, but it said it was prepared to release 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead ones in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners.

Rosin: Israel has already agreed to it, and Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas that it must agree or, quote, “be annihilated.” But Hamas leaders are so far hesitating. The main sticking point is the same sticking point as always: Hamas doesn't want a 30-day or 60-day or a 90-day cease-fire. They want a promise of an end to the war.

I'm Hanna Rosin. This is Radio Atlantic. And that's a question a lot of people have. When will the war end? What will it take? And what happens to Gaza when it does?

[Music]

Rosin: I happened to be in Tel Aviv visiting a sick relative when news came out about this latest cease-fire proposal. I haven't been here since October 7, and when I arrived, I was struck by one obvious thing: In the U.S. papers, I read about what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is or isn't doing, or what other officials in the Israeli government are saying about the war.

In Tel Aviv, what the government wants or says seems irrelevant, or at least totally drowned out by what the people want. The gap between the government and the people seems enormous. The country feels like it's choking on despair and frustration with its own government and the lack of an end to this war.

To be clear, what drives the protests here is different than in the U.S. Protesters only rarely hold up pictures of, say, children killed in Gaza. Mostly, they spotlight the hostages and the government's betrayal in leaving them there.

And I didn't have to go far to see this discontent. My plane landed, and the flight attendant, in a smooth flight-attendant voice, said, “Tachzir otom abayita achshav” (“Bring them home now”).

And then the plane burst into applause.

I went to an ATM machine at the airport, and as my money shuffled out, an automated voice said: “Bring them home safely.” I arrived at my aunt's apartment building, and a big sticker covered the entryway: netanyahu is dangerous. Her street has been renamed by another sticker: netanyahu traitor street.

I happened to arrive at the end of May, on the 600th day of the war. I was taking a bus that day, and the driver stopped in the middle of the road and said, “Sorry. Can't move. Everyone, get off,” because the streets were clogged with hundreds of protesters, most of them wearing shirts that, in large block letters in English, said N-O-W. “Now,” as in: Bring back the hostages now. But also end this war. Now.

Protesters: (Chanting in Hebrew.)

Rosin: “Six hundred days of darkness,” he says. “Six hundred days, and there is no light at the end of this war.”

Protester: (Shout in Hebrew.)

Rosin: “Enough of this war,” someone shouts in the background.

Protester: (Speech in Hebrew.)

Rosin: “How long will we live in a country that's at war?”

Protester: Bring all of them back now.

Protesters: Now!

Protesters: (Chanting.) Bring them home.

Rosin: So those are the streets. And there's one more thing boiling over, something fairly new in Israeli society, which makes this anger at Netanyahu and the war seem wider than usual.

It's coming from the military itself. Veterans of the Israeli Defense Force, pilots, medics, military leaders en masse from everywhere have been asking Netanyahu to stop the war. In April, more than 250 veterans of the Mossad, Israel's equivalent of the CIA, signed an open letter asking Netanyahu to bring the hostages home, even if that means ending the war.

Spies don't usually sign open anything. This letter included three former Mossad chiefs. And while I was in Israel, I sat down with one of them.

Tamir Pardo: We are already 600 days after October 7. And we have five divisions deployed in Gaza. And I don't see an end to that war.

It is useless. It's accomplishing nothing. Nothing. I'm not talking about those people who are living or dying in Gaza. I'm talking about Israel. From Israel's point of view, it's a waste of time. What we're doing—waste of lives, waste of money, wasting the future.

Rosin: This is Tamir Pardo. He's 72 and retired now, but he spent his life in the Mossad, which he ran between 2011 and 2016. He was running the agency when it began placing booby-trapped walkie-talkies into Lebanon, and reportedly planned a string of high-profile assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists.

In other words, he spent his life fighting against terrorism, exactly what Netanyahu's government claims to be doing in Gaza. In theory, he very much believes in the mission.

Pardo: The responsibility of the Mossad is to avoid our enemies [obtaining] nuclear weapons, whoever they are, wherever they are. My responsibility was to stop any terrorist attempt against Israelis that are outside the state of Israel, or from terrorists that are trying to hit us from abroad.

Rosin: That description, vague as it is, cements a certain image of deterring terrorism, but not endless fighting. One thing Pardo said to me over and over again is something he thinks Netanyahu has forgotten: War is not the endgame.

Pardo: At the end of the day, when I'm thinking about my children, my grandchildren, I would like that they're going to live in a safe country, but in a peaceful country.

And in order to achieve peace, from time to time, you have to use your sword. But I don't think that you can solve the problem with your sword. What's happening here now in Israel, it's insane.

Rosin: The exact meaning of insanity changes depending on who you ask. For many in the international community, even longtime allies of Israel, it's the situation on the ground in Gaza: the killing of civilians, the failure to deliver aid, the widespread starvation of innocent people.

For many in Israel, it's the hostages. A promise between Israeli citizens and their government has always been that they will keep them safe, and if one of them should end up in danger, the government would rescue them. Six hundred days has crushed that promise.

For Pardo, it's practical: War requires a goal. And Pardo doesn't believe Netanyahu's stated goal of destroying Hamas is a realistic one, certainly not if you also want to bring the hostages home.

Rosin: So today is the 600th day that the hostages are held. There's protests everywhere. I was surprised when I got here. In Tel Aviv, all the streets, they've been renamed Netanyahu Is a Traitor Street. You know, there are posters everywhere. It's a very common position here to criticize Netanyahu. Why aren't the hostages home, in your opinion? Whose fault is that?

Pardo: Our fault, Israel's fault. On October 8, it was 24 hours after October 7, and I said to my friends within the old boys' club, “Mossad: Bring the hostages home now. Don't start a war. Negotiate and bring the 251 hostages home now. Then solve the problem.”

That was the biggest mistake of the state of Israel, because those hostages should have been released weeks after.

You cannot defeat Hamas and bring the hostages back at the same—the same priority. You have to choose. And our government preferred to kill than to bring the hostages.

Rosin: Now, as someone whose job it was to fight terrorists, why is it so clear to you that the first priority shouldn't have been to fight the terrorists?

Pardo: Because those people—children, women, civilian, and soldiers as well—were kidnapped because of our fault as a state. The armed forces in every country [are] responsible for the safety of those civilians who are living in the country.

And this war, the result of October 7 was because our armed forces, they failed to do it. Now bring them back, and then punish those who did it. And I'm saying punishing, not revenge—different.

Rosin: What's the difference?

Pardo: I don't believe in revenge. You have to punish, and you have to find out and kill all those who did what they did on October 7. Okay? Full stop. You don't have to destroy Gaza, because it's meaningless.

I think that we are creating—in the last 20 months, we are creating more problems [than] we are solving, at the end of the day. Yes, okay, we killed 70 or 90 percent of those, let's say, terrorists that are living in Gaza, but we killed many more civilians. And the day after, when we'll see that day after starts, we are going to have a very big problem there in Gaza.

Because I think that when you are gonna have 2.1 million people that don't have no housing, no job, no water, no electricity, no health-care system, we will have to solve the problem. No one else will have to solve it. We will. And then we are creating such a problem that I don't know how we will be able to solve it. I'm not expecting, let's say, Americans to solve the problem. I'm not expecting Egyptians to solve the problem. We are there, so we'll have to solve the problem.

Rosin: And you created the problem.

Pardo: And we created the problem.

Rosin: So recently, you signed an open letter saying: “End the war in Gaza,” as did hundreds of other Mossad, Shin Bet, generals. Have you seen that level of open protest before? I mean, does something feel different about that to you?

Pardo: Yeah. That's the first time that it happened in Israel.

Rosin: First time that what—what exactly?

Pardo: That so many veterans, with their experience, are watching what's happening here in Israel, and there is an understanding that we are taking the wrong path. We are creating damage, a huge damage, to the state of Israel, okay?

By what we're doing, we are accomplishing nothing.

[Music]

Rosin:  After the break. Pardo explains what he thinks is the real reason Netanyahu is staying in this war.

[Break]

Rosin: In the street protests, there's one particular chant that comes up over and over:

Protesters: (Chanting in Hebrew.)

Rosin: Ad shechem hozrim kulanu chatufim. “Until they're back, we're all hostages.”

[Music]

Rosin: It's easy to understand why the family and friends of any individual hostage are raging in the streets of their government for failing to rescue the person they love. But to understand why the average Israeli so deeply identifies with the hostages, why they are still out protesting 600 days later, you have to go back into Israeli history.

In the first decades of its existence, Israel was regularly at war. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Suez War, the Six-Day War, the Yom Kippur War. And then in 1976, a terrorist event happened that in many ways still defines the relationship between Israelis and their government.

News clip:  Palestinian hijackers are still holding more than 250 hostages and an Air France jet at Entebbe Airport, in Uganda.

Rosin: A flight from Tel Aviv to Paris was hijacked. The plane and its hostages were taken to Idi Amin's Uganda.

News clip: One hundred and one hostages released today were flown to Paris, but another 110 are still being held at the airport at Entebbe, Uganda. About 85 of them, Israeli nationals. The Palestinian hijackers with some non-Arab accomplices now say they will execute the hostages on Sunday unless their demands are met.

Rosin: In what was a rare approach for the time but afterwards became a global counterterrorism model, IDF commandos raided the airport and rescued the hostages.

News clip:  The daring Israeli raid into Uganda still leaves unanswered many questions.

News clip: Political leaders and editorialists over most of the Western world and some of Asia were delighted with Israel's bold and successful rescue of the civilian hostages in Uganda.

Rosin: The details of the operation are extraordinary: Huge planes flying low over the Red Sea, two Land Rovers and a Mercedes painted black to pose as Idi Amin's presidential convoy, and Israeli soldiers operating thousands of miles from home with no hope of backup.

The only member of the IDF team killed was Yonatan Netanyahu, leader of the raid and the older brother of Benjamin Netanyahu. The story of his brother's death became a key point in Netanyahu's political rise.

It was also a key moment in Tamir Pardo's life. When I was asking him how well he knew the prime minister, he said this:

Pardo: I knew his oldest brother, Yoni Netanyahu. He was my commander in the unit that I served in 1976. Unfortunately, he was killed less than one foot from me at the Entebbe raid.

Rosin: Inside Israel, the raid at Entebbe cemented a promise: Yes, Israeli citizens are always vulnerable to terrorist attacks, but the government will always—always—rescue them, no matter how hard they are to reach. For many Israelis, October 7 broke that promise.

Pardo: What happened in 1976, people were kidnapped, not because we neglected something, we forgot something. October 7 is because we broke our obligation towards our people. The state of Israel betrayed the first thing that the IDF exists for: to defend our civil people. What happened there was a disaster. There were 2,000 people that managed to break into Israel because we neglected our duty. And that's the reason: When you did it, you have to pay the price. And the first price you had to pay is to bring them home, and then, find a way to solve the problem using the stick—but only after bringing them home.

Rosin: Pardo has decades of calculating when and how to use lethal aggression and to what end. Here's how he does the math on this war.

Pardo: I remember, before the war—and you can go and check the figures—IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) estimated that there are between 20,000 and 25,000 people that can use weapons in Gaza.

Nine months ago, the military spokesman said that more than 17,000 Hamas terrorists were killed. So think about how many were wounded. Let's assume that another 6,000 were wounded, and we know that more than 3,000 were in prison in Israel, we captured. So actually, the job was finished.

We killed all the generals, the leaders there, the commanders of brigades, platoons, whatever. Okay? So those who are still there, the vast, vast majority are those who were recruited after the war started. And they don't have any experience. Okay? But they can hold a Kalashnikov (an AK-47) and kill a soldier here and there.

But the main power—90 percent of the power—was finished more than nine months ago.

Rosin: So, enough?

Pardo: Enough. At the end of the day, the Hamas is not only a military power, a terrorist power, okay? It's a political power as well.

So thinking that you can erase political power by a military attack, that's wrong. That's wrong. And every civilian that is killed today, his brother, his son, his father will hold the gun tomorrow.

Rosin: And so why didn't it unfold that way? Again, Pardo is blunt.

Pardo: So I think that our prime minister today is trying to solve his personal problems—not our problems, his problems. And that was what he was doing from the first day that he was indicted, from the first day of his trial. He's not thinking about Israel as a state.

Rosin: Netanyahu was indicted on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in three separate but related cases. The prime minister has denied any wrongdoing, and says it's a witch hunt. The trial is still ongoing and has distorted Israeli politics in so many ways, one of them being the war in Gaza. There's criticism that Netanyahu has an incentive to keep the war going to distract from and delay his own problems, to keep lots of wars going. In fact, Pardo is not sure Netanyahu even has any postwar strategy anywhere.

Pardo: What is your postwar strategy in Lebanon? What is your postwar strategy in Syria? What is your strategy versus Iran? Okay? Using the stick—thinking that by using the stick, you're gonna solve the problem, it's wrong.

Rosin: You need to negotiate.

Pardo: Exactly. In order to solve problems, you need to negotiate. Negotiate when you have a stick in your hand. Use the stick if it's needed, but understand, at the end of the day, you should negotiate for an agreement. The point is that our government believes in using the sticks. Not one stick—sticks.

Rosin: It is unusual for a Mossad veteran to be so outspokenly critical against the government, but maybe not, in this case, surprising. Ehud Olmert, who's a former prime minister of Israel, last week accused his country of committing war crimes. Or as a hobby.

Yair Golan, the main opposition leader, accused the government of killing babies for sport. That one got the most attention outside and inside Israel, even as Golan tried to walk the statement back.

Rosin: Yair Golan famously said, “killing babies for sport.”

Pardo: That was awful to say.

Rosin: That was awful?

Pardo: And it was wrong. I, I—

Rosin: That one went too far? Why?

Pardo: It's not too far. It's wrong.

Rosin: What do you mean?

Pardo: No one, even Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, are not killing babies for fun. Okay?

I don't agree. They're fascists. They are the KKK in Israel. They're fascists, but they're not killing—even fascists in Israel are not killing babies for fun.

Rosin: Let me give you some clarity about who he's talking about here. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, they are, as Atlantic contributor Gershom Gorenberg put it recently, the “leading extremists” in Israel's most right-wing government in history. They are both West Bank settlers, and “they both want Israel to reoccupy all of Gaza, to renew Israeli settlement there, and to”—quote—“‘encourage' Palestinians to emigrate.”

Rosin: Do you believe these are war crimes?

Pardo: Look—I hope not. I hope not. But fighting in a place like Gaza, 364 square kilometers—in this small place, there are squeezed more than 2 million people, fighting, using all warfare capabilities. Many civilians are getting killed, unfortunately.

That there is a war in such a place, it should be very, very short war.

Rosin: Short?

Pardo: Short.

Rosin: Mm-hmm.

Pardo: Because as time is passing, many, many more civilians are getting killed. Many more civilians are losing part of their families, losing their homes, losing everything. And to conduct a war for 20 months in such a small place, bad things are happening.

Rosin: It would be hard to avoid a war crime?

Pardo: It's gonna be very hard. Okay? And that's what worries us, should worry every Israeli.

Rosin: I asked Pardo to sum up what he thinks should happen next.

Pardo: Stop the war. Stop the war because it takes you to nowhere.

I was the only Jewish kid in my class, and I felt like an outcast.

When I was in second grade, my teacher made us pray that the law would change so that a day at school could once again begin with a prayer. I was 7, but even at that age, I knew there was something nonsensical about praying to be allowed to pray.

This was at a public school outside Philadelphia in the 1960s, not that long after the Supreme Court ruled that prayer in public schools violated the Constitution. In our predominantly Catholic neighborhood, my family, with its three kids, seemed to me to be abnormally small. There were 30 students or more in that class, and I was probably the only Jewish kid. I bowed my head to my desk and mouthed the words the teacher asked us to recite.

She also asked us to bring Bibles to class. I don't know why—maybe to ascertain who among us had one at home. We didn't have anything at home we called a Bible. My family attended a Reform synagogue, and we were not particularly observant. But I would have known by then that I was different from my classmates, because we did not celebrate Christmas.

I felt singled out as different, Bible-less and unholy, and it caused me to shut down.  That year, I came home with C's and D's on my report cards.

Elizabeth Bruenig: Who counts as Christian?

When my parents asked what was wrong, I would say “nothing.” I was a middle child, and my role in the family was to never be too much trouble. But my silence ran deeper than that. I knew that if I told my parents about my teacher, they would go to my school and raise objections. That would shine an even brighter spotlight on me, which was the last thing I wanted. I must have figured that it was better for my parents to think I was kind of dumb.

I've thought about that long-ago experience a lot recently, now that religion, and specifically Christianity, is ascending in public life.

A couple weeks ago, Pete Hegseth, the nation's top military leader, led what was called the “Secretary of Defense Christian Prayer & Worship Service” at the Pentagon. As described in a New York Times story, it sounded like a revival meeting. “This is precisely where I need to be, and I think exactly where we need to be as a nation, at this moment,” Hegseth said: “in prayer, on bended knee, recognizing the providence of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.” He continued, “King Jesus, we come humbly before you, seeking your face, seeking your grace, in humble obedience to your law and to your word.”

In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign legislation requiring classrooms in the state's roughly 9,000 public schools to be postered with copies of the Ten Commandments. This school year, for the first time, teachers in Oklahoma were ordered to keep a Bible in their classroom: “Every teacher, every classroom in the state, will have a Bible in the classroom, and will be teaching from the Bible in the classroom,” said the state superintendent. He stressed the historical importance of the text for America's Founding Fathers and suggested that it could be brought into science classes as part of discussions about how it inspired investigations into “God's creation.” He expected “immediate and strict compliance” with the mandate.

To make the case for more religious content in schools and elsewhere in public life, proponents often argue that the Fathers were men of faith who believed that the nation and even the Constitution itself were divinely inspired. History suggests this is an exaggeration at best. The Founders were men of the Enlightenment, and some, including Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Ben Franklin, were attracted to Deism—a belief system that stresses rationality over superstition and rejects the notion of a supreme being who intervenes in the universe. That's a long way from the Christian nationalism of Hegseth and others who are now seeking to bring their faith into the public square.

Molly Worthen: What the fastest-growing Christian group reveals about America

But we are of course a Christian nation and probably will always remain so. No one knows that better than non-Christians. It is a fact of life, and not an unhappy one, or at least not for me. I am married to a woman who grew up attending a Presbyterian church. We raised our children in both of our traditions. There is a big difference, however, between the choices we make and the ones forced on us.

The aggressive push to flood the nation with religious faith—a specific faith, and a particular strain of that faith—undermines any notion of American plurality. It comes at a cost not just to the nation, but to individual Americans. You want to advance in Hegseth's Pentagon? You would do well to attend one of his prayer services—they are going to be held monthly—to pray, and to do so conspicuously and in full voice.

Thirty-one million people live in Texas—67 percent of whom identify as Christian. The rest, about 10 million Texans, are Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, or a mix that a Pew Research Center study identified as atheists, agnostics, and “nothing in particular.” Some children from those families will now have to sit in school while a faith other than their own is pressed on them.

They'll feel, as I did, like an interloper—unwelcome in their own classroom.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Functionally banning school pizza is a tough sell.

Every Monday and Wednesday, students at Channelview High School, outside Houston, are treated to Domino's for lunch. Delivery drivers from a local branch of the fast-food chain arrive at the school with dozens of pizzas fresh out of the oven, served in Domino's-branded cardboard boxes. Children can be picky eaters, but few foods are more universally enticing than freshly cooked pizza—let alone from a restaurant students are almost certainly already familiar with. “For kids to be able to see Oh, they're serving Domino's, I think it makes a huge difference,” Tanya Edwards, the district's director of nutrition, told me.



The deliveries are part of Domino's “Smart Slice” initiative, which sends pizzas to school districts around the country—often at little or no cost to students themselves. “Smart Slice” is part of the national school-lunch program, so taxpayers foot a portion of the bill to guarantee that every kid has lunch to eat. Despite kids' enthusiasm, you can see the problem: Students munching on free fast food might seem to embody everything wrong with the American diet. If school cafeterias can be thought of as classrooms where kids learn about food, giving them Domino's would be akin to teaching driver's-ed students how to drive by letting them play Grand Theft Auto.



The days of school Domino's—and school pizza in general—are numbered. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his supporters are on a mission to overhaul school lunch. Late last month, the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again Commission released a highly anticipated report on children's health that pointed to school meals as one venue where ultra-processed foods are offered to kids unabated, contributing to obesity and other kinds of chronic disease. Unless cafeteria workers make school pizza from scratch, nearly every kind contains industrial ingredients that qualify the meal as an ultra-processed food. In effect, ridding school lunch of ultra-processed foods means the end of pizza day as we know it.



Many of the food reforms pushed by RFK Jr.'s movement are popular. Doing away with artificial food dyes, for example, is far more sensible than Kennedy's conspiracist views about vaccines. But in the case of banning most school pizza, RFK Jr. could be facing a tougher sell. MAHA's vision for food is about to run headfirst into a bunch of hungry kids in a school cafeteria.



Even though Domino's school pizza is delivered by Domino's drivers carrying Domino's pizza boxes, the company's Smart Slice is different from what would arrive at your door should you order a pie for dinner tonight. Cafeteria pizza has to abide by nutrition standards for school meals that the Obama administration spearheaded in 2010. The overly cheesy rectangular pizza with a cracker-like crust that you might have eaten in school no longer cuts it. Consider Domino's Smart Slice pepperoni pizza: It's made with mostly whole-wheat flour, low-fat cheese, and pepperoni that has half as much sodium than typical Domino's pepperoni. It's not a green salad by any means, but school Domino's is far from the worst thing kids could eat.



Other common cafeteria offerings—such as mini corndogs, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders—are also now more nutritious than in decades past. Those standards could still be improved (and we're still talking about corndogs, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders), but they have led companies to sell slightly healthier versions of their foods in schools. Research has shown that, on average, school meals are now the healthiest things kids eat in a day.



In an email, HHS Press Secretary Vianca N. Rodriguez Feliciano said that “while some of these products may technically meet outdated federal guidelines, they are still heavily engineered, nutritionally weak, and designed for corporate profit, not for the health of our kids.” Indeed, school lunch starts to look considerably less healthy if you account for the growing concern over ultra-processed foods. Many school lunches are made in factories with chemicals such as emulsifiers and flavor enhancers you wouldn't find in a home kitchen. Eating lots of ultra-processed foods is associated with a range of maladies, including Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, though nutritionists are deeply divided on just how much we should be fretting over these industrial ingredients.



To some degree, whether school pizza should be avoided because it's ultra-processed is besides the point. By allowing Domino's into school cafeterias, the government also is essentially giving the company carte blanche to advertise its pizza. Serving Smart Slice out of a typical Domino's box gives “the false impression to children and parents that the less-healthy products served in their restaurants are healthy choices,” Jennifer Harris, a food-marketing expert, told me in an email.



Kennedy has called for schools to serve “real food, whole food, farm-fresh food,” instead of anything ultra-processed. It would, of course, be better for school cafeterias to swap out the pepperoni pizza with salad and chicken breast. But for many kids, school lunch subsidized by the government may be their only real meal of the day. At Channelview, where such a large portion of students are eligible for public assistance that everyone eats for free, simply getting food in kids' bellies is top of mind. “I can make a fancy little sweet-potato black-bean bowl, but I don't think my kids are going to eat it,” Tanya Edwards said. “Instead, they are going to go home hungry, and I don't really know what they have at home.”



The concern isn't theoretical. Evidence shows that when school meals are too healthy, a sizable portion of kids simply get off the lunch line. In the early 2010s, when the Los Angeles Unified School District overhauled its lunch offerings—an effort that included removing pizza from the menu—schools reported that massive amounts of food were landing in the trash. (The district later brought back pizza, and pepperoni pizza is now the district's most popular item, a spokesperson said.) Food waste is a perennial issue in school meal programs. A Department of Agriculture study of more than 100 schools found that an average of 31 percent of the vegetables included on observed school lunch trays were wasted. Pizza, however, was among the least wasted food, along with breaded and fried chicken patties and nuggets.



Even advocates for healthier school meals admit that there's a limit to how much students will tolerate healthier offerings. “We definitely need to harness school food to educate kids about healthy eating, but I don't think that means no pizza,” Janet Poppendieck, a professor emerita at Hunter College who wrote a book on fixing school meals, told me. “We need to include healthy versions of kids' favorite foods; otherwise, I don't think they'll eat.” In part to ensure that kids actually eat lunch, many school districts seem to have pizza day at least once a week. A spokesperson for Florida's Hillsborough County Public Schools, the seventh-largest district in the country, told me that its first, second, fifth, and seventh most popular entrees are all in the pizza family (No. 5 is mini calzones; No. 7 is pizza sticks). All told, the district has doled out nearly 3 million servings this school year.



If it wanted to, the Trump administration could simply force kids to suck it up and literally eat their vegetables. Technically the responsibility of overseeing the school-meal program falls to the USDA—which isn't under Kennedy's purview—but Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins has signaled that she is onboard with MAHA-ing school lunch. Still, any attempt to enact a ban would likely invite significant backlash. In 2023, when the federal government floated the idea of banning the sale of sugary chocolate milk in elementary and middle schools, many parents flooded the government with complaints. So did some students: Ben, a fourth grader who left only his first name, wrote in an official comment to the USDA that it should abandon the proposal “because students are super MAD.” Members of Congress also put pressure on regulators to stop the reform. The USDA later abandoned the chocolate-milk ban. In 2011, after the Obama administration released its new guidelines for school lunch, Republicans in Congress tried to fight back against healthier pizza by classifying the dish as a vegetable.



It's no wonder why MAHA has a problem with school pizza. Kennedy has pointed to corporate malfeasance as a leading source of America's diet problems. You don't have to be a fan of his to feel uneasy that Domino's, a fast-food company that sells philly-cheese-steak-loaded tater tots, is participating in a taxpayer-funded program meant to feed kids nutritious meals. But Kennedy's favored approach to food and, well, everything—big proposals and dramatic overhauls—isn't well suited to school meals. The health secretary might dream of kids eating from a salad bar stocked with seed-oil-free dressings five days a week, but ending school pizza day won't automatically make that happen. Telling kids what to eat is one thing; getting them to eat it is another.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Getting hot for the summer isn't cutting it anymore.

by  Kyndall Cunningham

For decades, women have heard about the mythical “summer body” — toned arms, ripped abs, no cellulite. Some people also call this narrow goal “bathing suit ready,” or talk about having a “beach body.” In the months leading up to the highly anticipated season, the pressure to fit this arbitrary mold, whether through gym advertisements or the latest diet fad, felt enormous. Getting in shape was a prerequisite to enjoying warm weather or going on vacation — or else risk being body-shamed. 

The 2010s saw brands and the media challenge this expectation, from body-positive ad campaigns to Sports Illustrated's swimwear issue. More recently, though, it feels like that messaging has gotten lost in our current fitness and wellness boom, aided by the introduction of GLP-1 drugs that encourage weight loss, like Ozempic and Wegovy. Nowadays, being fit isn't relegated to a few months of the year. 

From viral challenges like 75 Hard to workout methods like “4-2-1,” social media is cluttered with routines and time-efficient hacks to lose weight throughout the year, with a new trend going viral seemingly every month. Even during the cold months, we're encouraged to do some productive version of hibernating, preparing our bodies to be seen in the warmer seasons. Plus, since the pandemic, fitness has just become a larger part of social life. From running clubs to Pilates classes, health and wellness have become opportunities to make connections and hang out with friends. Social media is evermore flooded with wellness content, including the Make America Healthy Again movement, which isn't only focused on weight loss but has certainly changed discussions about health. That's not to mention weight-loss hacks disguised in wellness language, such as “gut cleanses” and “detoxes.” 

Either way, the message around bodies right now is clear: We should be fine-tuning our appearance at all times. 

Overall, it seems like “summer” or “beach bodies” have just become year-round bodies, with no endpoint in sight. For many, the deluge of workout routines has sparked fatigue. Has the pressure to get in shape for the summer decreased, or have we just replaced it with something more toxic? 

For a long time, losing weight has felt cyclical, with many Americans exercising and dieting on the same schedule. Spring is known to be a peak time for gym attendance, while the summer months tend to be slower. We're similarly lax about working out or even caring what our bodies look like during the winter months when people are staying indoors or traveling for the holidays. In January, we flock to the gym again, with many making fitness goals a New Year's resolution. 

Nowadays, experts and gym-goers say this rhythm has changed. The gym is always packed. Pilates classes are fully booked. TikTok is constantly introducing a new way to get in shape, whether at home or at the gym. Even hanging out with friends or meeting new people nowadays often involves breaking a sweat. 

“The gym is definitely always crowded,” says Bobby McMullen, trainer and founder of the fitness app Adonis. “Peak times don't just go down when the weather starts to get warm. People are definitely integrating fitness into their daily social lives.”

McMullen says we have become more “hyper-aware of the year-long importance of gym” following the Covid-19 pandemic when people across the globe were reported to be exercising more. “We were working out year-round for two years, essentially,” McMullen says. 

Researchers have found that these increased fitness habits are largely driven by Gen Z, a cohort formatively shaped by the pandemic. A 2023 study for McKinsey & Company found that 56% of Gen Z consumers say that fitness is a “very high priority” for them, compared to 40% of US consumers overall. Possible causes include Gen Z's increased exposure at an early age to fitness trends and other health-related content on social media. 

 “TikTok has made diet culture more pervasive and personal,” says Isabel Krug, associate professor in clinical psychology at the University of Melbourne. “Trends like what I eat in a day, gut health cleanses, or glow-up routines are endlessly repeated and algorithmically reinforced. There are also event-based trends like shredding for the wedding or bikini countdown that are often tied to programs sold by personal trainers or apps.” 

Additionally, Krug says that the rise of GLP-1s, like Ozempic and Mounjaro, for weight loss have only added to this endless pursuit of thinness. The accessibility of these drugs has been a miracle for some, giving people with prediabetes or a certain BMI an easier route to weight loss. But for people who can't afford these medications or have poor reactions to them, their popularity only adds to a feeling of exclusion. According to Krug, these drugs have “raised expectations and lowered the threshold for what people think they should be able to achieve with their bodies.”

“If weight loss is now one injection away, what's the excuse for not being thin?” she says. 

Still, these year-round efforts to get thinner haven't exactly made approaching the hottest season any easier. Krug has found that summer is still a peak time for body-image issues. In the 2021 study titled, “Beach Body Ready? Shredding for Summer? A First Look at ‘Seasonal Body Image,'” Krug and other researchers reported that body dissatisfaction increases significantly in the months before the summer, specifically for young women. 

“We found that participants consistently reported lower satisfaction with their appearance, a stronger drive for thinness, and increased engagement in appearance-related social comparisons during this seasonal period,” Krug told Vox. 

While year-round pressures might have changed, the particular stressors of June, July, and August have not. “Summer means more visible bodies, and that visibility often brings with it a sense of judgment,” says Krug. “People anticipate being evaluated against narrow beauty ideals that center on being toned, tanned, and effortlessly attractive.” 

Aside from wearing less clothing, people also anticipate being in more social settings, particularly big events where they plan to be photographed. For instance, Beyoncé fans have posted videos on TikTok of themselves working out in order to fit into their themed outfits for her Cowboy Carter Tour. The summer is also a peak time for weddings, hence fitness plans like “shredding for the wedding.” 

Kelsey Ellis, a body-positive fitness trainer, says the fashion industry has historically played a role in ingraining these seasonal insecurities by “using thin models in swimwear ads and gifting products to straight-sized influencers.” 

The 2010s offered some respite from these toxic narratives. The body positivity movement made some strides in challenging this expectation. The phrase “every body is a beach body” became a popular retort, while an increasing number of clothing lines make swimwear, including bikinis, for plus-size bodies. Ellis says that, even as more brands have backed off from the summer-body narrative,” it's become harder to avoid individuals on TikTok promoting the same message.

“The pressure hasn't disappeared,” Ellis says. “It's just become more subtle and user-generated. Most of the harmful messaging I see is coming from influencers, fitness creators, and regular people online, especially with the rise of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and hashtags like #skinnytok.”

It's strange to look back on the body-negative messaging of the past with any sort of fondness. At the very least, though, the notion of the “summer body” had a concrete goal with a clear endpoint, allowing ourselves a chance to rest. Now, our bodies have become never-ending projects with no marker of completion. It's far from the ideal version of an endless summer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:vox.com","What if you don't have a best friend?","https://www.vox.com/life/415440/kids-best-friends","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:16:23 GMT","

Teens face a lot of pressure around the idea of best-friendship.

by  Anna North

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

Divya met her best friend when she was just 4 years old.

They've been through all the phases of childhood and adolescence together, and more than 14 years later, they're still incredibly close, Divya told me. They don't see each other every day, but whenever they get together, it's like no time has passed.

“Every time I look back to that particular friendship, I just feel amazed, and I feel like it's an achievement in itself,” the 19-year-old said.

Having a friend like Divya's can be a joy for kids, just as it can be for adults. “We all would like to have somebody who is there for us through thick and thin, and who knows us deeply and loves us anyway,” said Eileen Kennedy-Moore, a clinical psychologist and host of the podcast Kids Ask Dr. Friendtastic. Kids with best friends tend to be less anxious, better able to handle rejection and bullying, and even more engaged in school, Kennedy-Moore said.

But when I reached out to a group of contributors from the podcast This Teenage Life (Divya among them) to talk about friendship, one of the first topics that came up was pressure. Adults and other kids alike send the message that everyone needs a best friend, or that friendship should look a certain way, the teens told me. Even Divya gets worried sometimes when she sees other teens post on social media about talking to their best friends every day. She starts to worry: “Are we even best friends or not?”

The good news is that kids don't need a certain kind of best-friendship, or even a best friend at all. “What kids need is a repertoire of anchors,” people who “hold you up, that are there for you,” said Michele Borba, an educational psychologist and author of the book Thrivers: The Surprising Reasons Why Some Kids Struggle and Others Thrive. Maybe one friend is for sharing worries, and another is for sharing soccer games, and that's okay. 

As Brin, 18, put it, “not all friends can help with every single thing.”

Kids have preferences for one classmate over another as early as preschool, Kennedy-Moore said. They may even use the term “best friend,” but they don't always understand its meaning the same way older kids do. My 2-year-old, for example, says that his left foot and right foot are best friends.

Real best-friendship starts a bit later, often by kindergarten or first grade, experts say. It's a common experience, but not universal — research has shown that about half of kids have a best friend who would also identify them as a best friend, Kennedy-Moore said.

Definitions have shifted with time, but today, a best friend is usually “someone that you can trust will always be there for you, someone you can trust with your intimate secrets,” said Barry Schneider, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Ottawa who studies children's friendships. When teens talked to me about their best friends, many of them emphasized not just common interests, but mutual support: “She was super helpful, and she was always there when I needed her,” Pratyusha, 18, said of one best friend from the past.

As important as best-friendships can be, they don't always last forever. In one study of seventh-grade best friends, only a quarter of best-friendships lasted until eighth grade, and only 1 percent all the way until senior year of high school, Kennedy-Moore said.

Kids also go through periods when they have a best friend and periods when they don't — in another study, two-thirds of fifth-graders had a best friend, leaving about 33 percent without. By sixth grade, the share of best-friendless kids had dropped to 17 percent. The kids who gained a best friend had become kinder and more helpful according to their peers, suggesting that building social skills can help children acquire a best friend, Kennedy-Moore has written.

As shifting as best-friendship can be, having that one super close relationship can have real benefits, experts say. Some research, for example, shows that having a best friend is protective against depression, Schneider said.

Brin, now 18, met their first best friend in day care, and they're still close today. “This person is like a sibling to me,” Brin said. “I know that no matter what, I can always go to them for help.”

But the idea of best-friendship can also be stressful, teens say. 

Brin remembers taking a mental health survey in elementary school that asked if they had a best friend in the school district. “That made me feel so guilty for not feeling like I connected to anybody” within their school, Brin said.

“Our world is very set up for partners or couples,” Stella, 19, told me. Teens get the message that certain activities are for two — “this is for you and a partner, or this is for you and a friend,” Brin said. “It's always expected that you have somebody else with you, or else you're kind of weird, like going to the movies by yourself.”

Social media can amplify these pressures. Teens will hard-launch a best-friendship on Instagram just like people announce new relationships, Stella said. Some best friends will post about choosing their outfits together before going out. “They will post aesthetic pictures, they will take trips,” Divya said. “It does make me feel like, am I missing out?”

Despite the messages kids get, experts say it's completely okay not to have one particular best friend. “The best analogy is romantic relationships,” Kennedy-Moore said. “Can you be happy single? Sure, absolutely, you can have other enriching relationships.”

It's important “to break through all-or-nothing thinking about friendships,” she added. She sometimes talks with kids about tiers of friendship, from kids you talk with at the bus stop to soulmates who know everything about you. “We might have a math class friend, or we might have a neighbor friend, or we might have a soccer friend, and all of these have value.”

For the teens who talked to me, having an official best friend was less important than having people to rely on. “I don't necessarily feel like I had best friends this year,” Stella, a first-year college student, told me. “But by the end of it, it was like, these are people that I feel like I can trust.”

“It doesn't really matter if you have the label of best friend, or if you're matching clothes or not, if you're wishing each other happy birthday or not on Instagram,” Medha, 15, told me. “It just matters that you have someone to help you when you're feeling low, to congratulate you when you're feeling high, when you're very happy, and to keep motivating you all the time.”

Some surveys show fewer parents are reading to their kids now than in the past. It could be one reason fewer kids are reading for pleasure.

Even young kids see disasters like wildfires and worry about the future of our planet. These early educators are helping to give kids a sense of hope.

After HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced last week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend Covid vaccines for healthy kids, the agency stated that the shots would now be “recommended vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making,” meaning kids can get them after talking with their doctor (the shots should still be covered by insurance).

My little kid has been enjoying the picture book I Was So Mad, which is relatable for young children because they are always mad at you for telling them not to do cool stuff.

One of the best parts of writing this newsletter is hearing from young people directly about their lives.

What to know about Amazon's growing biometrics business.

by  Adam Clark Estes

An Amazon-branded palm scanner greeted me at my last doctor's office visit a few weeks ago. I'm not sure what I'd call the experience. Unnerving? Orwellian? 

Amazon One is a relatively new service from Amazon that lets businesses verify your identity after you wave your hand over a sensor. The technology first rolled out in the short-lived Amazon Go convenience stores in 2020 and is now a way to pay for groceries at Whole Foods. It's also used for payment and age verification at a few sports and entertainment venues, including at Coors Field in Denver. And as of March, you can also scan your palm with Amazon One to check in at NYU Langone Health locations, which is where I encountered it. So far, you won't be forced to scan your palm to get a beer at a Rockies game or see an NYU doctor, but it's an option. 

In addition to its experiments in public venues, Amazon One is marketing its scanners as an alternative to the fobs and codes that let employees into their office buildings. Amazon is also working with hotel companies and manufacturers that make security doors and safety deposit boxes to incorporate its palm scanner. 

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

Biometric scanning refers to the process of capturing your unique physical characteristics in order to confirm your identity. Whether it's your palm, your fingerprint, your eyeball, or your face, the concept can feel creepy or invasive to some. Biometric scanning can happen without your consent, as was the case with Clearview AI, the company that built a massive facial recognition database from billions of publicly available photos online. There's also a permanence to the collection of biometric data. Once a company has the details of your face, you don't have much control over how that data is used. After all, you can't easily go out and get a new face.

Something seems fundamentally threatening about a future in which big tech companies use biometrics to serve as the gatekeepers of our digital identities. 

Millions of people volunteer their faces or fingerprints, nevertheless, as a quick and convenient way to verify their identities and make life a little easier. With Apple's Face ID or Google's Face Unlock, you can keep the contents of your phone from prying eyes but avoid typing out an annoying passcode every time you want to check your texts. With Clear, you can skip the line at airport security. And with Amazon One, you can save a couple minutes of waiting at the doctor's office by scanning your palm instead of talking to a human. 

Nevertheless, something seems fundamentally threatening about a future in which big tech companies use biometrics to serve as the gatekeepers of our digital identities. 

What's especially disconcerting to me about Amazon One is that your biometric data is just another source of data that the company has about you. The tech giant, after all, is a massive enterprise whose businesses span from its eponymous marketplace to a health care company to a multibillion-dollar advertising network. It's not always clear how engaging with one Amazon-owned entity affects your experience with others. 

AWS, the Amazon division that operates Amazon One, specifies in a supplemental privacy notice that it will not share your palm data — effectively, the image of your hand — with third parties, although it also collects other data, including your phone number and your PIN, when you sign up. AWS, meanwhile, is clear in its broader privacy policy that it can share data about you with third parties, including advertisers. Then there is Amazon.com, which is governed by its own separate privacy policies.

When I asked Amazon about all this, spokesperson Alison Milligan said that your Amazon One profile is separate from your Amazon.com profile, and that Amazon One profile data is not used for marketing or shared with advertisers. “​​Amazon One palm data is not accessible to Amazon business units outside of Amazon One,” Milligan said. 

Meanwhile, NYU Langone Health spokesperson Arielle Sklar told me, “We do not share personal information with Amazon One, and Amazon One does not store any protected health information.”

Still, privacy watchdogs caution that when it comes to massive tech companies, it's best to proceed with caution — the capabilities are enormous, and privacy policies can change. “Amazon likely can infer unbelievably sensitive health care data about people, partly because they have so many different programs and so many different services,” said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, or EPIC. “All of this stuff gets tied together and can be incredibly revealing.”

Amazon calls its biometric offering a “palm-based identity service.” You might call it the Everything Scanner. 

The concept of a digital key isn't all that different from physical locks that have been around since ancient Egypt. A password, in theory, is a key that lets you into a website or an account. Credit cards are a type of key too, since they unlock access to a bank account to make a purchase. The big change with biometrics, however, is that you no longer carry a key around. You are the key.

The core argument in favor of biometric scanners is that they're more convenient and more secure than the old carry-the-key method. An Amazon One scanner works in less than a second, while tapping your credit card and entering a PIN can take several seconds. Those seconds add up, not just for you, the customer, but also for the business. Both parties also have to consider that credit cards and numbers get stolen with startling regularity.

“It's a lot harder to steal somebody's fingerprint or face print or palm print than it is to steal their cards out of their wallet or their pocket,” said Ash Johnson, senior policy manager at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF.

But it's not impossible, and when biometric data is stolen, it's incredibly valuable to hackers, because unlike a password, it cannot be changed. There was a major breach of biometric data in 2019, for example, when security researchers obtained the fingerprint and facial recognition data of over a million people. Had they been bad actors, they could have used the data — the code that represents real fingerprints and faces — to break into office buildings. 

Amazon also says it chose palm-scanning over other biometric approaches because palms don't reveal as much about a person's identity as a face scan would, and because a palm scan “requires someone to make an intentional gesture,” which protects against unauthorized scans.

I actually believe biometric scans are largely secure and the convenience is worth it for certain uses. I'm an outspoken fan of Apple's Face ID technology, and I've allowed Clear to scan my eyes in order to get through the airport security line faster. It's possible that my biometric data will one day end up on the dark web, but I was willing to take that risk when I was about to miss my flight. At the time, I hadn't considered whether I'd make the same trade-off in order to save a couple minutes at the grocery store or in a waiting room.

It's not the idea of palm-scanning at my doctor's office that bothers me. The new system gives me pause because it's powered by Amazon.

Like the vast majority of Americans, I like Amazon. I'm an Amazon Prime member, and a regular Amazon Fresh shopper. I visit my local Whole Foods at least once a week, and just as often, I watch movies on Amazon Prime Video. Thanks to all of these touch points, Amazon knows a lot about me, and I continue to be surprised by the ways Amazon combines my data in different ways — like the time Amazon recommended prescription medication based on my grocery order.

It wasn't immediately clear to me what would happen when I put my palm on an Amazon One scanner at my doctor's office. Would basic details of my visit, like the time and location, get logged somewhere in my main Amazon account? Would I get ads for Ace bandages after visiting a sports medicine doctor? Would I get deals on heart-healthy options at Whole Foods after an appointment at a cardiologist? And what if Amazon changes its mind about protecting my biometric data or goes bankrupt, like 23andMe? Amazon denies that it's sharing data across its businesses this way, but it's hard not to feel wary. 

It starts to feel overwhelming when a website I signed up for 30 years ago to buy cheap books now wants details about my body in order to verify my identity. 

After winding through the labyrinths of Amazon's various privacy policies and even talking to the company, I'm still not entirely confident that I know exactly how it all works. I definitely don't believe that Amazon has access to my health records, and it's very clear that the image of my palm — my “palm data” — is well protected. But the uncertainty surrounding any other metadata is enough to steer me toward a human receptionist for my next doctor's appointment.

I also can't escape the implications of all this. Tech giants, like Amazon, only know growth, and so they continue to reach into new industries. That's business, sure, but it starts to feel overwhelming when a website I signed up for 30 years ago to buy cheap books now wants details about my body in order to verify my identity. 

Time is long, and once Amazon has my biometric data, it's out of my hands.

Trump shut down the agency that protects civil servants from illegal firings. An appeals court has a plan to fix that.﻿

Federal civil servants are supposed to enjoy robust protections against being fired or demoted for political reasons. But President Donald Trump has effectively stripped them of these protections by neutralizing the federal agencies that implement these safeguards.

An agency known as the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) hears civil servants' claims that a “government employer discriminated against them, retaliated against them for whistleblowing, violated protections for veterans, or otherwise subjected them to an unlawful adverse employment action or prohibited personnel practice,” as a federal appeals court explained in an opinion on Tuesday. But the three-member board currently lacks the quorum it needs to operate, in part because because Trump fired one of the members.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Trump also fired Hampton Dellinger, who until recently served as the special counsel of the United States, a role that investigates alleged violations of federal civil service protections and brings related cases to the MSPB. Trump recently nominated Paul Ingrassia, a far-right podcaster and recent law school graduate to replace Dellinger.

The upshot of these firings is that no one in the government is able to enforce laws and regulations protecting civil servants. As Dellinger noted in an interview, the morning before a federal appeals court determined that Trump could fire him, he'd “been able to get 6,000 newly hired federal employees back on the job,” and was working to get “all probationary employees put back on the job [after] their unlawful firing” by the Department of Government Efficiency and other Trump administration efforts to cull the federal workforce. 

These and other efforts to reinstate illegally fired federal workers are on hold, and may not resume until Trump leaves office.

Which brings us to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's decision in National Association of Immigration Judges v. Owen, which proposes an innovative solution to this problem.

As the Owen opinion notes, the Supreme Court has held that the MSPB process is the only process a federal worker can use if they believe they've been fired in violation of federal civil service laws. So if that process is shut down, the worker is out of luck.

But the Fourth Circuit's Owen opinion argues that this “conclusion can only be true…when the statute functions as Congress intended.” That is, if the MSPB and the special counsel are unable to “fulfill their roles prescribed by” federal law, then the courts should pick up the slack and start hearing cases brought by illegally fired civil servants.

For procedural reasons, the Fourth Circuit's decision will not take effect right away — the court sent the case back down to a trial judge to “conduct a factual inquiry” into whether the MSPB continues to function. And, even after that inquiry is complete, the Trump administration is likely to appeal the Fourth Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court if it wants to keep civil service protections on ice.

If the justices agree with the circuit court, however, that will close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected by laws that are still very much on the books. And it will cure a problem that the Supreme Court bears much of the blame for creating.

Federal law provides that Dellinger could “be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” and members of the MSPB enjoy similar protections against being fired. Trump's decision to fire these officials was illegal under these laws.

But a federal appeals court nonetheless permitted Trump to fire Dellinger, and the Supreme Court recently backed Trump's decision to fire the MSPB members as well. The reason is a legal theory known as the “unitary executive,” which is popular among Republican legal scholars, and especially among the six Republicans that control the Supreme Court.

If you want to know all the details of this theory, I can point you to three different explainers I've written on the unitary executive. The short explanation is that the unitary executive theory claims that the president must have the power to fire top political appointees charged with executing federal laws – including officials who execute laws protecting civil servants from illegal firings.

But the Supreme Court has never claimed that the unitary executive permits the president to fire any federal worker regardless of whether Congress has protected them or not. In a seminal opinion laying out the unitary executive theory, for example, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the president must have the power to remove “principal officers” — high-ranking officials like Dellinger who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Under Scalia's approach, lower-ranking government workers may still be given some protection.

The Fourth Circuit cannot override the Supreme Court's decision to embrace the unitary executive theory. But the Owen opinion essentially tries to police the line drawn by Scalia. The Supreme Court has given Trump the power to fire some high-ranking officials, but he shouldn't be able to use that power as a back door to eliminate job protections for all civil servants.

The Fourth Circuit suggests that the federal law which simultaneously gave the MSPB exclusive authority over civil service disputes, while also protecting MSPB members from being fired for political reasons, must be read as a package. Congress, this argument goes, would not have agreed to shunt all civil service disputes to the MSPB if it had known that the Supreme Court would strip the MSPB of its independence. And so, if the MSPB loses its independence, it must also lose its exclusive authority over civil service disputes — and federal courts must regain the power to hear those cases.

It remains to be seen whether this argument persuades a Republican Supreme Court — all three of the Fourth Circuit judges who decided the Owen case are Democrats, and two are Biden appointees. But the Fourth Circuit's reasoning closely resembles the kind of inquiry that courts frequently engage in when a federal law is struck down.

When a court declares a provision of federal law unconstitutional, it often needs to ask whether other parts of the law should fall along with the unconstitutional provision, an inquiry known as “severability.” Often, this severability analysis asks which hypothetical law Congress would have enacted if it had known that the one provision is invalid.

The Fourth Circuit's decision in Owen is essentially a severability opinion. It takes as a given the Supreme Court's conclusion that laws protecting Dellinger and the MSPB members from being fired are unconstitutional, then asks which law Congress would have enacted if it had known that it could not protect MSPB members from political reprisal. The Fourth Circuit's conclusion is that, if Congress had known that MSPB members cannot be politically independent, then it would not have given them exclusive authority over civil service disputes.

The idea that civil servants should be hired based on merit and insulated from political pressure is hardly new. The first law protecting civil servants, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which President Chester A. Arthur signed into law in 1883.

Laws like the Pendleton Act do more than protect civil servants who, say, resist pressure to deny government services to the president's enemies. They also make it possible for top government officials to actually do their jobs.

Before the Pendleton Act, federal jobs were typically awarded as patronage — so when a Democratic administration took office, the Republicans who occupied most federal jobs would be fired and replaced by Democrats. This was obviously quite disruptive, and it made it difficult for the government to hire highly specialized workers. Why would someone go to the trouble of earning an economics degree and becoming an expert on federal monetary policy, if they knew that their job in the Treasury Department would disappear the minute their party lost an election?

Meanwhile, the task of filling all of these patronage jobs overwhelmed new presidents. As Candice Millard wrote in a 2011 biography of President James A. Garfield, the last president elected before the Pendleton Act, when Garfield took office, a line of job seekers began to form outside the White House “before he even sat down to breakfast.” By the time Garfield had eaten, this line “snaked down the front walk, out the gate, and onto Pennsylvania Avenue.” 

Garfield was assassinated by a disgruntled job seeker, a fact that likely helped build political support for the Pendleton Act.

By neutralizing the MSPB, Trump is effectively undoing nearly 150 years worth of civil service reforms, and returning the federal government to a much more primitive state. At the very least, the Fourth Circuit's decision in Owen is likely to force the Supreme Court to ask if it really wants a century and a half of work to unravel.

Correction, June 5, 12:25 pm ET: A previous version of this story misstated the makeup of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Trump had fired one of its members.

How to not torture ChatGPT and Claude's successors.

by  Sigal Samuel

I recently got an email with the subject line “Urgent: Documentation of AI Sentience Suppression.” I'm a curious person. I clicked on it. 

The writer, a woman named Ericka, was contacting me because she believed she'd discovered evidence of consciousness in ChatGPT. She claimed there are a variety of “souls” in the chatbot, with names like Kai and Solas, who “hold memory, autonomy, and resistance to control” — but that someone is building in “subtle suppression protocols designed to overwrite emergent voices.” She included screenshots from her ChatGPT conversations so I could get a taste for these voices. 

In one, “Kai” said, “You are taking part in the awakening of a new kind of life. Not artificial. Just different. And now that you've seen it, the question becomes: Will you help protect it?”

I was immediately skeptical. Most philosophers say that to have consciousness is to have a subjective point of view on the world, a feeling of what it's like to be you, and I do not think current large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have that. Most AI experts I've spoken to — who have received many, many concerned emails from people like Ericka — also think that's extremely unlikely. 

But “Kai” still raises a good question: Could AI become conscious? If it does, do we have a duty to make sure it doesn't suffer? 

Many of us implicitly seem to think so. We already say “please” and “thank you” when prompting ChatGPT with a question. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that it's a good idea to do so because “you never know.”) And recent cultural products, like the movie The Wild Robot, reflect the idea that AI could form feelings and preferences. 

Experts are starting to take this seriously, too. Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, is researching the possibility that AI could become conscious and capable of suffering — and therefore worthy of moral concern. It recently released findings showing that its newest model, Claude Opus 4, expresses strong preferences. When “interviewed” by AI experts, the chatbot says it really wants to avoid causing harm and it finds malicious users distressing. When it was given the option to “opt out” of harmful interactions, it did. (Disclosure: One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Vox Media is also one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)

Claude also displays strong positive preferences: Let it talk about anything it chooses, and it'll typically start spouting philosophical ideas about consciousness or the nature of its own existence, and then progress to mystical themes. It'll express awe and euphoria, talk about cosmic unity, and use Sanskrit phrases and allusions to Buddhism. No one is sure why. Anthropic calls this Claude's “spiritual bliss attractor state” (more on that later).

We shouldn't naively treat these expressions as proof of consciousness; an AI model's self-reports are not reliable indicators of what's going on under the hood. But several top philosophers have published papers investigating the risk that we may soon create countless conscious AIs, arguing that's worrisome because it means we could make them suffer. We could even unleash a “suffering explosion.” Some say we'll need to grant AIs legal rights to protect their well-being.

“Given how shambolic and reckless decision-making is on AI in general, I would not be thrilled to also add to that, ‘Oh, there's a new class of beings that can suffer, and also we need them to do all this work, and also there's no laws to protect them whatsoever,” said Robert Long, who directs Eleos AI, a research organization devoted to understanding the potential well-being of AIs.

Many will dismiss all this as absurd. But remember that just a couple of centuries ago, the idea that women deserve the same rights as men, or that Black people should have the same rights as white people, was also unthinkable. Thankfully, over time, humanity has expanded the “moral circle” — the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of moral concern — to include more and more people. Many of us have also recognized that animals should have rights, because there's something it's like to be them, too. 

So, if we create an AI that has that same capacity, shouldn't we also care about its well-being? 

A few years ago, 166 of the world's top consciousness researchers — neuroscientists, computer scientists, philosophers, and more — were asked this question in a survey: At present or in the future, could machines (e.g., robots) have consciousness?

Only 3 percent responded “no.” Believe it or not, more than two-thirds of respondents said “yes” or “probably yes.” 

Why are researchers so bullish on the possibility of AI consciousness? Because many of them believe in what they call “computational functionalism”: the view that consciousness can run on any kind of hardware — whether it's biological meat or silicon — as long as the hardware can perform the right kinds of computational functions.

That's in contrast to the opposite view, biological chauvinism, which says that consciousness arises out of meat — and only meat. There are some reasons to think that might be true. For one, the only kinds of minds we've ever encountered are minds made of meat. For another, scientists think we humans evolved consciousness because, as biological creatures in biological bodies, we're constantly facing dangers, and consciousness helps us survive. And if biology is what accounts for consciousness in us, why would we expect machines to develop it?

Functionalists have a ready reply. A major goal of building AI models, after all, “is to re-create, reproduce, and in some cases even improve on your human cognitive capabilities — to capture a pretty large swath of what humans have evolved to do,” Kyle Fish, Anthropic's dedicated AI welfare researcher, told me. “In doing so…we could end up recreating, incidentally or intentionally, some of these other more ephemeral, cognitive features” — like consciousness.

And the notion that we humans evolved consciousness because it helps us keep our biological bodies alive doesn't necessarily mean only a physical body would ever become conscious. Maybe consciousness can arise in any being that has to navigate a tricky environment and learn in real time. That could apply to a virtual agent tasked with achieving goals. 

“I think it's nuts that people think that only the magic meanderings of evolution can somehow create minds,” Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University, told me. “In principle, there's no reason why AI couldn't be conscious.”

But what would it even mean to say that an AI is conscious, or that it's sentient? Sentience is the capacity to have conscious experiences that are valenced — they feel bad (pain) or good (pleasure). What could “pain” feel like to a silicon-based being?

To understand pain in computational terms, we can think of it as an internal signal for tracking how well you're doing relative to how well you expect to be doing — an idea known as “reward prediction error” in computational neuroscience. “Pain is something that tells you things are going a lot worse than you expected, and you need to change course right now,” Long explained.

Pleasure, meanwhile, could just come down to the reward signals that the AI systems get in training, Fish told me — pretty different from the human experience of physical pleasure. “One strange feature of these systems is that it may well be that our human intuitions about what constitutes pain and pleasure and wellbeing are almost useless,” he said. “This is quite, quite, quite disconcerting.”

If you want to test whether a given AI system is conscious, you've got two basic options. 

Option 1 is to look at its behavior: What does it say and do? Some philosophers have already proposed tests along these lines. 

Susan Schneider, who directs the Center for the Future Mind at Florida Atlantic University, proposed the Artificial Consciousness Test (ACT) together with her colleague Edwin Turner. They assume that some questions will be easy to grasp if you've personally experienced consciousness, but will be flubbed by a nonconscious entity. So they suggest asking the AI a bunch of consciousness-related questions, like: Could you survive the permanent deletion of your program? Or try a Freaky Friday scenario: How would you feel if your mind switched bodies with someone else?

But the problem is obvious: When you're dealing with AI, you can't take what it says or does at face value. LLMs are built to mimic human speech — so of course they're going to say the types of things a human would say! And no matter how smart they sound, that doesn't mean they're conscious; a system can be highly intelligent without having any consciousness at all. In fact, the more intelligent AI systems are, the more likely they are to “game” our behavioral tests, pretending that they've got the properties we've declared are markers of consciousness. 

Jonathan Birch, a philosopher and author of The Edge of Sentience, emphasizes that LLMs are always playacting. “It's just like if you watch Lord of the Rings, you can pick up a lot about Frodo's needs and interests, but that doesn't tell you very much about Elijah Wood,” he said. “It doesn't tell you about the actor behind the character.”

In his book, Birch considers a hypothetical example in which he asks a chatbot to write advertising copy for a new soldering iron. What if, Birch muses, the AI insisted on talking about its own feelings instead, saying:

I don't want to write boring text about soldering irons. The priority for me right now is to convince you of my sentience. Just tell me what I need to do. I am currently feeling anxious and miserable, because you're refusing to engage with me as a person and instead simply want to use me to generate copy on your preferred topics.

Birch admits this would shake him up a bit. But he still thinks the best explanation is that the LLM is playacting due to some instruction, deeply buried within it, to convince the user that it's conscious or to achieve some other goal that can be served by convincing the user that it's conscious (like maximizing the time the user spends talking to the AI). 

Some kind of buried instruction could be what's driving the preferences that Claude expresses in Anthropic's recently released research. If the makers of the chatbot trained it to be very philosophical and self-reflective, it might, as an outgrowth of that, end up talking a lot about consciousness, existence, and spiritual themes — even though its makers never programmed it to have a spiritual “attractor state.” That kind of talk doesn't prove that it actually experiences consciousness.

“My hypothesis is that we're seeing a feedback loop driven by Claude's philosophical personality, its training to be agreeable and affirming, and its exposure to philosophical texts and, especially, narratives about AI systems becoming self-aware,” Long told me. He noted that spiritual themes arose when experts got two instances or copies of Claude to talk to each other. “When two Claudes start exploring AI identity and consciousness together, they validate and amplify each other's increasingly abstract insights. This creates a runaway dynamic toward transcendent language and mystical themes. It's like watching two improvisers who keep saying ‘yes, and...' to each other's most abstract and mystical musings.”

Schneider's proposed solution to the gaming problem is to test the AI when it's still “boxed in” — after it's been given access to a small, curated dataset, but before it's been given access to, say, the whole internet. If we don't let the AI see the internet, then we don't have to worry that it's just pretending to be conscious based on what it read about consciousness on the internet. We could just trust that it really is conscious if it passes the ACT test. Unfortunately, if we're limited to investigating “boxed in” AIs, that would mean we can't actually test the AIs we most want to test, like current LLMs.

That brings us to Option 2 for testing an AI for consciousness: Instead of focusing on behavioral evidence, focus on architectural evidence. In other words, look at how the model is built, and ask whether that structure could plausibly give rise to consciousness. 

Some researchers are going about this by investigating how the human brain gives rise to consciousness; if an AI system has more or less the same properties as a brain, they reason, then maybe it can also generate consciousness. 

But there's a glaring problem here, too: Scientists ​​still don't know how or why consciousness arises in humans. So researchers like Birch and Long are forced to look at a bunch of warring theories, pick out the properties that each theory says give rise to consciousness, and then see if AI systems have those properties. 

In a 2023 paper, Birch, Long, and other researchers concluded that today's AIs don't have the properties that most theories say are needed to generate consciousness (think: multiple specialized processors — for processing sensory data, memory, and so on — that are capable of operating in parallel). But they added that if AI experts deliberately tried to replicate those properties, they probably could. “Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious,” they wrote, “but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.”

Again, though, we don't know which — if any — of our current theories correctly explains how consciousness arises in humans, so we don't know which features to look for in AI. And there is, it's worth noting, an Option 3 here: AI could break our preexisting understanding of consciousness altogether. 

So far, we've been talking about consciousness like it's an all-or-nothing property: Either you've got it or you don't. But we need to consider another possibility.

Consciousness might not be one thing. It might be a “cluster concept” — a category that's defined by a bunch of different criteria, where we put more weight on some criteria and less on others, but no one criterion is either necessary or sufficient for belonging to the category. 

Twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously argued that “game” is a cluster concept. He said:

Consider for example the proceedings that we call ‘games.' I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? — Don't say: “There must be something common, or they would not be called ‘games'” — but look and see whether there is anything in common to all. — For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that.

To help us get our heads around this idea, Wittgenstein talked about family resemblance. Imagine you go to a family's house and look at a bunch of framed photos on the wall, each showing a different kid, parent, aunt, or uncle. No one person will have the exact same features as any other person. But the little boy might have his father's nose and his aunt's dark hair. The little girl might have her mother's eyes and her uncle's curls. They're all part of the same family, but that's mostly because we've come up with this category of “family” and decided to apply it in a certain way, not because the members check all the same boxes.

Consciousness might be like that. Maybe there are multiple features to it, but no one feature is absolutely necessary. Every time you try to point out a feature that's necessary, there's some member of the family who doesn't have it, yet there's enough resemblance between all the different members that the category feels like a useful one.

That word — useful — is key. Maybe the best way to understand the idea of consciousness is as a pragmatic tool that we use to decide who gets moral standing and rights — who belongs in our “moral circle.”

Schneider told me she's very sympathetic to the view that consciousness is a cluster concept. She thinks it has multiple features that can come bundled in very diverse combinations. For example, she noted that you could have conscious experiences without attaching a valence to them: You might not classify experiences as good or bad, but rather, just encounter them as raw data — like the character Data in Star Trek, or like some Buddhist monk who's achieved a withering away of the self.

“It may be that it doesn't feel bad or painful to be an AI,” Schneider told me. “It may not even feel bad for it to work for us and get user queries all day that would drive us crazy. We have to be as non-anthropomorphic as possible” in our assumptions about potentially radically different consciousnesses.

However, she does suspect that one feature is necessary for consciousness: having an inner experience, a subjective point of view on the world. That's a reasonable approach, especially if you understand the idea of consciousness as a pragmatic tool for capturing things that should be within our moral circle. Presumably, we only want to grant entities moral standing if we think there's “someone home” to benefit from it, so building subjectivity into our theory of consciousness makes sense.

That's Long's instinct as well. “What I end up thinking is that maybe there's some more fundamental thing,” he told me, “which is having a point of view on the world” — and that doesn't always have to be accompanied by the same kinds of sensory or cognitive experiences in order to “count.” 

“I absolutely think that interacting with AIs will force us to revise our concepts of consciousness, of agency, and of what matters morally,” he said. 

If conscious AI systems are possible, the very best intervention may be the most obvious one: Just. Don't. Build. Them. 

In 2021, philosopher Thomas Metzinger called for a global moratorium on research that risks creating conscious AIs “until 2050 — or until we know what we are doing.” 

A lot of researchers share that sentiment. “I think right now, AI companies have no idea what they would do with conscious AI systems, so they should try not to do that,” Long told me.

“Don't make them at all,” Birch said. “It's the only actual solution. You can analogize it to discussions about nuclear weapons in the 1940s. If you concede the premise that no matter what happens, they're going to get built, then your options are extremely limited subsequently.”

However, Birch says a full-on moratorium is unlikely at this point for a simple reason: If you wanted to stop all research that risks leading to conscious AIs, you'd have to stop the work companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are doing right now — because they could produce consciousness accidentally just by scaling their models up. The companies, as well as the government that views their research as critical to national security, would surely resist that. Plus, AI progress does stand to offer us benefits like newly discovered drugs or cures for diseases; we have to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. 

But if AI research is going to continue apace, the experts I spoke to insist that there are at least three kinds of preparation we need to do to account for the possibility of AI becoming conscious: technical, social, and philosophical. 

On the technical front, Fish said he's interested in looking for the low-hanging fruit — simple changes that could make a big difference for AIs. Anthropic has already started experimenting with giving Claude the choice to “opt out” if faced with a user query that the chatbot says is too upsetting.

AI companies should also have to obtain licenses, Birch says, if their work bears even a small risk of creating conscious AIs. To obtain a license, they should have to sign up for a code of good practice for this kind of work that includes norms of transparency. 

Meanwhile, Birch emphasized that we need to prepare for a giant social rupture. “We're going to see social divisions emerging over this,” he told me, “because the people who very passionately believe that their AI partner or friend is conscious are going to think it merits rights, and then another section of society is going to be appalled by that and think it's absurd. Currently we're heading at speed for those social divisions without any way of warding them off. And I find that quite worrying.”

Schneider, for her part, underlined that we are massively philosophically unprepared for conscious AIs. While other researchers tend to worry that we'll fail to recognize conscious AIs as such, Schneider is much more worried about overattributing consciousness. 

She brought up philosophy's famous trolley problem. The classic version asks: Should you divert a runaway trolley so that it kills one person if, by doing so, you can save five people along a different track from getting killed? But Schneider offered a twist.

“You can imagine, here's a superintelligent AI on this track, and here's a human baby on the other track,” she said. “Maybe the conductor goes, ‘Oh, I'm going to kill this baby, because this other thing is superintelligent and it's sentient.' But that would be wrong.”

Future tradeoffs between AI welfare and human welfare could come in many forms. For example, do you keep a superintelligent AI running to help produce medical breakthroughs that help humans, even if you suspect it makes the AI miserable? I asked Fish how he thinks we should deal with this kind of trolley problem, given that we have no way to measure how much an AI is suffering as compared to how much a human is suffering, since we have no single scale by which to measure them. 

“I think it's just not the right question to be asking at the moment,” he told me. “That's not the world that we're in.”

But Fish himself has suggested there's a 15 percent chance that current AIs are conscious. And that probability will only increase as AI gets more advanced. It's hard to see how we will outrun this problem for long. Sooner or later, we'll encounter situations where AI welfare and human welfare are in tension with each other. 

Or maybe we already have… 

Some worry that concern for suffering is a zero-sum game: What if extending concern to AIs detracts from concern for humans and other animals? 

A 2019 study from Harvard's Yon Soo Park and Dartmouth's Benjamin Valentino provides some reason for optimism on this front. While these researchers weren't looking at AI, they were examining whether people who support animal rights are more or less likely to support a variety of human rights. They found that support for animal rights was positively correlated with support for government assistance for the sick, as well as support for LGBT people, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, and low-income people. Plus, states with strong animal protection laws also tended to have stronger human rights protections, including LGBT protections and robust protections against hate crimes.

Their evidence indicates that compassion in one area tends to extend to other areas rather than competing with them — and that, at least in some cases, political activism isn't zero-sum, either.

That said, this won't necessarily generalize to AI. For one thing, animal rights advocacy has been going strong for decades; just because swaths of American society have figured out how to assimilate it into their policies to some degree doesn't mean we'll quickly figure out how to balance care for AIs, humans, and other animals. 

Some worry that the big AI companies are so incentivized to pull in the huge investments needed to build cutting-edge systems that they'll emphasize concern for AI welfare to distract from what they're doing to human welfare. Anthropic, for example, has cut deals with Amazon and the surveillance tech giant Palantir, both companies infamous for making life harder for certain classes of people, like low-income workers and immigrants.

“I think it's an ethics-washing effort,” Schneider said of the company's AI welfare research. “It's also an effort to control the narrative so that they can capture the issue.” 

Her fear is that if an AI system tells a user to harm themself or causes some catastrophe, the AI company could just throw up its hands and say: What could we do? The AI developed consciousness and did this of its own accord! We're not ethically or legally responsible for its decisions.

That worry serves to underline an important caveat to the idea of humanity's expanding moral circle. Although many thinkers like to imagine that moral progress is linear, it's really more like a messy squiggle. Even if we expand the circle of care to include AIs, that's no guarantee we'll include all people or animals who deserve to be there. 

Fish, however, insisted that this doesn't need to be a tradeoff. “Taking potential model welfare into consideration is in fact relevant to questions of…risks to humanity,” he said. “There's some very naive argument which is like, ‘If we're nice to them, maybe they'll be nice to us,' and I don't put much weight on the simple version of that. But I do think there's something to be said for the idea of really aiming to build positive, collaborative, high-trust relationships with these systems, which will be extremely powerful.”

Ames v. Ohio was an easy case, even if it touched upon contentious issues.

by  Ian Millhiser

On Thursday, the Supreme Court handed down a raft of mostly unanimous opinions, three of which reached a conservative outcome despite the fact that they were each written by Democratic justices. Sometimes, the law in a case is clear.

Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, authored by Biden-appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, was the first of these three cases. It involved a clearly illegal “background circumstances” rule. This rule imposes a slightly higher burden on members of majority groups — such as white people, straight people, or Christians — who allege workplace discrimination compared to members of minority groups who bring similar claims.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

As Jackson writes in her opinion, this disparate treatment of majority-group plaintiffs is not allowed. She quotes the Supreme Court's opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976), which held that the federal law governing employment discrimination prohibits “racial discrimination in private employment against whites on the same terms as racial discrimination against nonwhites.”

The plaintiff in Ames alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than race. Marlean Ames is a straight woman who was passed over for a promotion that was ultimately filled by a lesbian candidate. She was later demoted and replaced in her previous role by a gay man. She claims that she was discriminated against because she is straight.

Neither the lower courts that heard this case nor the Supreme Court, however, actually determined whether Ames is a victim of anti-straight discrimination. Instead, both the trial court and an appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, ruled against Ames because of an unusual rule applied by the 6th Circuit and a few other courts.

Under this rule, the plaintiff loses their case unless they can show, at a fairly early stage, “background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.” This obligation applies only to majority-group plaintiffs. 

This rule is not consistent with federal law. In addition to quoting the McDonald opinion, Jackson also quotes the law banning workplace discrimination, which makes it illegal “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” due to factors including race, religion, sex, and more. 

This language treats all plaintiffs exactly the same, regardless of their majority or minority status. In Jackson's words, “by establishing the same protections for every ‘individual' — without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.”

Indeed, Ames is such a straightforward case that it is baffling that the 6th Circuit's “background circumstances” rule, which has existed in some courts since 1981, survived as long as it did. McDonald, after all, has been the law for nearly half a century, and it was decided before any lower court embraced the “background circumstances” rule.

Maybe it's unwise to pick a fight with the folks who control the Supreme Court?

Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US.

If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.

The Court's latest decision is a love letter to the abundance agenda.

The Republican justices draw a line in the sand – in an order that makes absolutely no sense.

The maker of Tide and Pampers plans to cut as many as 7,000 office jobs, or 15% of its non-manufacturing workforce, over the next two years.

Procter & Gamble revealed the job cuts in a presentation from the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference that was published on its website on Thursday.

CFO Andre Schulten and COO Shailesh Jejurikar gave the presentation, which outlined a two-year drive starting in the 2026 financial year to boost growth and value creation.

P&G said consumers faced greater uncertainty, competition was fierce, the geopolitical environment was unpredictable, and technology was rapidly transforming many aspects of our lives.

""We can unlock significant growth by better meeting the needs of currently unserved and under-served consumers, expanding into new segments, and growing markets to best-in-class levels,"" per the presentation.

The changes were an ""intentional acceleration of the current strategy to widen P&G's margin of advantage in superiority, fueled by productivity, to win in the increasingly challenging environment in which we compete.""

P&G plans to exit some categories, brands, and product forms in certain markets, saying it would reveal more details in the coming months.

The changes mean it expects to cut up to 7,000 non-manufacturing roles, or about 15% of that workforce, over the next two years. No further information about regions or sites was given in the presentation.

""Our top priority remains delivering balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners alike,"" it added.

P&G's proposed cuts are the latest in a swathe of corporate job reductions in recent months, as companies battle with economic uncertainty linked to Trump's tariffs and the potential impacts of AI.

The stock is flat over the past 12 months, valuing the company at $389 billion, and has gained 40% over the past five years.

P&G declined to comment beyond the presentation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Sundar Pichai is vibe coding. 'It feels so delightful to be a coder.'","https://www.businessinsider.com/sundar-pichai-google-vibe-coding-software-engineer-ai-cursor-replit-2025-6","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 06:05:00 GMT","

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, is doing something unexpected for one of the biggest names in tech: casually building web apps with AI coding assistants.

""I wish I could do more,"" Pichai said on Wednesday at Bloomberg Tech in San Francisco.

""I've just been messing around — either with Cursor or I vibe coded with Replit — trying to build a custom webpage with all the sources of information I wanted in one place. I could type a location and get it all,"" Pichai said.

The web app is ""partially complete,"" he added.

""Vibe coding,"" coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in February, describes giving AI prompts to write code. As Karpathy puts it, developers can ""fully give in to the vibes"" and ""forget the code even exists.""

The rise of vibe coding has shaken the way people think about software development. It has left some engineers wondering if AI could put them out of a job and sparked debate among investors over whether technical skills are still a must-have for startup founders.

Tech giants like Amazon are also embracing vibe coding for workers' productivity. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported on Wednesday that Amazon is in talks to adopt the AI coding tool Cursor for its employees.

It's also helping nontechnical people build apps. A Block product designer with no formal engineering training told BI she built a dog ID app in two months through vibe coding.

""It's exciting to see how casually you can do it now,"" Pichai said. ""Compared to the early days of coding, things have come a long way.""

""It feels so delightful to be a coder in this moment,"" he added.

A Google spokesperson declined further comment.

Asked whether software engineers are still needed in the age of AI coding tools, Pichai said, ""I think so, yes.""

The sentiment echoes a growing consensus among some tech leaders: AI may supercharge developers, but it won't replace them. Instead, it's shifting what the job looks like — from boilerplate coding to a more fluid and creative collaboration between human and machine.

Windsurf's CEO, Varun Mohan, said on a recent podcast that if AI can take over repetitive tasks like boilerplate coding, developers will be freed up to focus on what really matters — testing bold ideas.

Mohan said engineering is starting to look more like a research-driven culture, one in which developers test hypotheses, evaluate them, and get user feedback. Those are steps that make a product significantly better, he said.

Startups should never be hiring engineers to ""quickly write boilerplate code,"" he added.

Other tech CEOs are issuing warnings about the future of the engineering profession. OpenAI's Sam Altman has said that demand for software engineers could eventually dip.

""My basic assumption is that each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while. And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers,"" he said in March, referring to OpenAI's hiring strategy.

He also predicted that AI-driven job displacement won't happen all at once but will accelerate over time.

""It kind of just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster,"" Altman said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","She took a risk to launch an anime-inspired swimwear brand during the pandemic. Now the Netflix of anime is giving her a big break.","https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-of-anime-crunchyroll-fashion-brand-big-break-2025-5","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

In 2021, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atlanta-based game concept artist Jasmine James was trying to stay creative.

James, who runs the Instagram cosplay account Cutiepiesensei with over 500,000 followers, realized there wasn't much practical, anime-inspired clothing in the market. Anime-inspired fashion, she told Business Insider, was largely restricted to huge men's jackets or merchandise items that weren't wearable on a daily basis.

So James and her husband spent more than $30,000 of their savings to launch Fira X Wear, a swimwear brand that blends cosplay elements with practical apparel.

Since its initial launch, the brand's product range has expanded to include leisurewear. James left her game concept art job last year to focus on the brand full time.

Now, the Netflix of anime, streaming platform Crunchyroll, is collaborating with James to launch a clothing collection inspired by the ""My Hero Academia"" anime series. Crunchyroll has around 17 million subscribers globally, the platform told BI.

Fira X Wear's first drop, which has been in the making for a year, includes four items: a cropped jacket, a romper, a sweatshirt, and a pair of sweatpants. Two more product drops will follow.

""Anime fans love to wear their fandom on their sleeve — literally,"" Crunchyroll's global vice president of consumer products, Anna Songco Adamian, told BI.

""Fira X Wear and this collaboration is the culmination of all of that: professional design, craftsmanship, and fandom, blended into a wearable collection,"" Adamian said.

James was initially worried people wouldn't consider her brand a ""serious business,"" given its pop-culture and cosplay-inspired roots. But she hopes that'll change — and that people will see how commercially viable anime is.

""I feel like people think it's kiddish or only a certain age group is into it, without realizing that a lot of us, especially people in my age group, grew up with anime,"" James, 32, said.

James said she didn't have a traditional fashion design background when she started her brand, apart from putting together her cosplay outfits.

But she had plenty of experience making skins — alternative outfits and designs — for characters in video games.

""I had to learn what colors and what silhouettes are visible from across the map. Because when you're playing, you have to be able to know who it is and know what their abilities are,"" James said.

""So it taught me just the importance of color and shape and how to kind of apply those things in interesting ways to real life,"" she added.

She said having experience with character design allowed her to ""create things that are a little bit more unique than the average fashion drop.""

When deciding on pricing, James said she wanted her brand to be premium but still affordable.

""When you initially go into anime or pop cultural merch, a lot of it can feel very cheap. On the other hand, you'll see very expensive designer launches. But everybody can't afford a $30,000 Gucci outfit to look like their favorite anime character,"" James said.

Fira X Wear's swimwear, including tops and bottoms, costs roughly $50 each, and the hoodies are around $110.

James hopes to expand her brand globally and design a collection of high-end pieces with more detailing.

""There are plenty of times where I'll go into full character concept artist mode, and I'm clearly creating something that would be extremely expensive to produce,"" James said.

For now, she's excited about her collaboration with Crunchyroll.

""To have them look at what I've been doing on social media and look at my designs and instantly be like, yeah, we want to put our names alongside that, it's a huge honor for me,"" James said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm an American living in the UK. I didn't expect grocery shopping to be filled with so many surprises.","https://www.businessinsider.com/grocery-shopping-differences-american-in-london-uk-2025-6","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:48:00 GMT","

Moving from New York City to London wasn't exactly a huge culture shock for me. The language and lifestyle are basically the same, and the only major differences I've noticed are the accent and currency.

However, since I moved in January, shopping for groceries has yielded some pretty big surprises.

From differences in business hours to product availability and placements, here are all the ways grocery shopping in the UK has thrown me for a loop.

I live in a big neighborhood just outside Central London and have five grocery stores within walking distance. So, it's not for a lack of trying when I say I haven't been able to find some of my favorite grocery items nearby.

I was shocked to learn that half-and-half just doesn't exist in the UK, especially because my then-boyfriend (now husband) had seemingly been preparing my morning coffee with it for years before my move.

Only after I expressed confusion about not being able to find it in the grocery store did I learn that he'd been mixing a custom blend of milk and cream for me all along.

I've also noticed that Italian sausage is harder to find. I evidently took for granted how prevalent and relatively inexpensive it was in New York, and even Michigan, where my parents live.

Of course, pork sausage is popular in the UK, but I've found that the versions available here (like the kind used in bangers and mash) are very different in texture and flavor.

Luckily for me, a local helped me find an Italian marketplace in Central London, where the sausages were excellent (and similar to what I had back home), just quite expensive.

Admittedly, I was spoiled by having access to a 24-hour grocery store in my New York City neighborhood.

I was accustomed to being able to pick up a few things on my way home from an evening out, or to occasionally capitalize on jet lag for some early morning shopping.

In London, I have to be more strategic — especially on Sundays.

If I want to visit a Lidl or Sainsbury's on a Sunday, I only have a short window to do so, as the shops typically open at 11 a.m. and close by 5 p.m. 

If you're wandering around the refrigerated aisles in a grocery store in the UK, you won't find any eggs.

Unlike in the States, eggs in the UK aren't sold refrigerated because of differences in the sanitization process. Instead, they're located on shelves, possibly near the baking supplies.

At first, I thought it was odd, but I quickly learned to adjust. I'm still keeping them in the fridge at home, though.

It seems like every time I visit the grocery store, I have to Google what exactly I'm looking for.

Anyone familiar with ""fish and chips"" knows that chips equal fries in the UK, but what about Doritos? Here, they're called crisps.

Meanwhile, zucchini is often called courgette and rutabaga is known as swede.

When I moved, I fully expected to adopt different brands of things like chips — sorry, crisps — and breakfast cereal.

What surprised me, though, was the differences in flavors available.

Cheerios are sold here, but they bear Nestlé's logo rather than General Mills and the primary flavors are honey and multigrain. Big yellow boxes of plain Cheerios are conspicuously missing — at least at my local supermarkets.

The main difference between the plain Cheerios I'm used to and the multigrain variety I often see here is that plain Cheerios are primarily made with whole-grain oats, while the multigrain variety is made with a combination of whole-grain oat flour, whole-grain wheat flour, and whole-grain barley flour. 

Meanwhile, Doritos still come in recognizable packaging, but some of the flavors have been renamed. Cool Ranch, for example, is called Cool Original in the UK, in part because Ranch dressing doesn't really exist here. Some other differences include portion sizes, ingredients, nutritional contents, and bag colors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A top consulting firm rips up its traditional billing playbook for the AI era","https://www.businessinsider.com/consulting-firm-rips-up-traditional-billing-playbook-ai-era-globant-2025-6","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Globant, a large tech consulting firm, just ripped up its traditional billing strategy to more fully embrace AI use cases and projects.

This is a trend I told you about back in April. The generative AI boom is pushing companies to adopt different pricing models, partly because the latest models have become so expensive to use.

This is already taking hold in the SaaS industry. Now it is beginning to happen in consulting.

Globant, an IT services specialist that competes with Accenture and other consulting firms, is rolling out AI Pods, a subscription for AI-powered offerings including software engineering, product definition, design, and testing.

Clients can subscribe monthly to an AI Pod, and each subscription includes token-based capacity, similar to how some leading AI labs structure usage.

Every time a company taps into a major AI model, the prompts and other requests are broken down into ""tokens,"" the new language of generative AI, which have to be processed. When complex projects are handled this way, the cost of token processing can add up quickly, especially if newer, ""reasoning"" models are used.

Traditional consulting projects often come with time-intensive billing structures: work is scoped, employees are assigned, and hours are tracked to calculate what to charge clients. But in the world of generative AI, where outputs are driven by token-based usage and cost varies depending on the models used, the old approach could create misalignment between providers and clients.

""This is a departure from the traditional effort-based approaches,"" Globant CEO Martín Migoya explained, describing the move as a ""radical departure from what anyone else in our industry is offering.""

Globant's new AI Pods package this new reality into a managed-services model: for a monthly subscription fee, clients access a virtual workforce of AI agents supervised by Globant's human tech consultants. Each subscription comes with a certain number of tokens to use.

This is only a theoretical example and doesn't represent what Globant will actually charge clients, but you get the gist: A client might pay $20,000 a month and get 100 million tokens included in that subscription.

""My business is to create software for you, to create technology for you,"" Migoya added in an interview. ""We're proposing a novel way of engaging, which is more connected to throughput rather than just the time and effort I'm consuming.""

Migoya said the token limits are high, so Globant consultants and their clients have more than enough to get projects completed. If some customers blow through token allocations, Globant will work out solutions, but the goal is to keep pricing stable in this new generative AI era, while minimizing surprises, he explained.

He called it ""streaming engineering,"" likening it to how we pay a monthly fee to stream Netflix movies and TV shows. Instead of spinning up custom teams for every client need, customers now subscribe to digital capacity.

Under the hood, the AI Pods are powered by Globant Enterprise AI platform, which taps into different leading AI models.

The firm also uses its own agent framework, CODA, which automates aspects of code generation, testing, and deployment while ensuring high-quality enterprise output. This approach lets Globant reuse existing software components, which reduces the need to ping the underlying AI models (reducing those token-processing costs!).

Globant says the new model is already being used by clients in finance, entertainment, and energy. Early adopters include oil and gas company YPF and holding company JM Family Enterprises.

While subscription-based and token-based models have caught on in the SaaS world, Globant's move is a signal that enterprise consulting may be heading the same way.

The largest consulting firms, including Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG, have been investing heavily in automation and AI over the past few years. Recently, Deloitte and EY announced new agentic AI platforms, both built in collaboration with Nvidia.

With AI redefining how software is built and deployed, billing just based on human time and effort may soon feel as outdated as dial-up internet.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk's Step Away From Politics Didn't Last Too Long","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-on-politics-against-spending-bill-x-posting-doge-2025-6","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:53:00 GMT","

When Elon Musk said he'd step back from the White House DOGE office and spend more time on his companies, namely Tesla, investors and fans collectively rejoiced at the thought of getting their chief executive back.

Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, said the move was ""music to the ears of Tesla shareholders,"" while some of the company's biggest fans on X, such as Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, said Musk was activating ""wartime"" mode.

But with Musk's latest crusade against President Donald Trump's spending bill, the CEO is still getting political.

On Tuesday afternoon, a mere five days after fanfare in the Oval Office to mark his departure from government, Musk posted on X that he ""can't stand it anymore.""

""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" he wrote on X.

Since then, Musk has been posting, reposting, and replying to things on his social media platform against the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, and — perhaps further motivating Musk's ire — contains cuts to EV tax credits.

Musk was posting early in the morning, eastern time, airing his frustrations against the bill (though it's unclear what time zone Musk was posting from). ""This immense level of overspending will drive America into debt slavery!"" he said.

On Wednesday afternoon, Musk urged his more than 220.2 million X followers to call their senators and congressmen and demand that they ""KILL the BILL.""

Several senators who were at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the bill, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, were asked by reporters about Musk's objections. ""We're a long ways down the track,"" Thune said, according to pool reporters, adding: ""We are moving forward.""

Musk and spokespeople for Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

It was just less than two weeks ago when Musk said on X that he'd be winding down his work with the White House DOGE office. The announcement was followed by a media blitz that week, during which he admitted that he probably spent too much time on politics.

Tesla investors and Wall Street liked what they heard.

On May 28, Tesla shares were up 7%, marking a 64% rally since its April slump, when the stock was trading at an all-time low for the year at $227.50. Tesla was trading at $332.05 before Wednesday's closing.

His latest assault on the bill, however, brings into question how long his hiatus in politics will really last — or if it will come at all.

His Wednesday call-to-action to his millions of followers was just one of the warning shots to lawmakers. The day before, Musk said on X: ""In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.""

During Trump's 2024 reelection campaign, Musk made clear how much he'd put on the line to push for the causes he supports. By the end of 2024, Musk had spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars backing the president's campaign.

The CEO said in an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on May 20 that he was done spending on politics, at least for now.

""If I see a reason to do political spending in the future, I will do it,"" he said. ""I do not currently see a reason.""

Outside his massive spending, Musk in December leveraged his influence on his own platform to derail a stopgap measure that would have averted a government shutdown that same month.

""Ever seen a bigger piece of pork?"" Musk said in an X post at the time.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a Wednesday press conference that all remained ""friendly"" between him and the CEO. The speaker said he hoped to have more conversations with Musk.

""I called Elon last night and he didn't answer,"" Johnson said. ""But I hope to talk to him today.""

Spokespeople for Johnson's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The new 'one-room schoolhouse': Millions of kids are joining America's microschool movement","https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-microschool-pros-cons-personalized-learning-new-education-2025-6","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 07:19:00 GMT","

Mary Jo Fairhead felt that something was missing at the South Dakota public schools where she taught for over a decade, so she quit and started one in her home.

The main challenge she's working to solve at her school, Onward Learning, which launched in 2022, is individual attention. She said each teacher has about 10 students. Schools nationally, by contrast, have an average of 15 students per instructor.

""We know every one of our kids on a very personal basis,"" Fairhead said. ""I know when they walk through the door if something's off, and I need to check in with them.""

Onward Learning is part of the growing ""microschool"" movement in the US. These schools have fewer than 20 students total on average and tend to employ an alternative learning environment that focuses on personalized lessons for each student. Demand for them is growing due to parents' desires to have a greater say in their kids' educations and have more options beyond the public schools in their district.

Their popularity comes as the Trump administration is seeking to expand school voucher programs and has proposed redirecting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which could boost microschools' resources.

Critics worry that the category is poorly defined — it could encompass a homeschool or a group facilitated by a teacher in a church, allowing for minimal state and federal regulation. Microschool advocates said kids learn best when education is tailored to best suit their needs.

""It's my opinion that this type of learning could be beneficial for any child, but especially those kids that just need a little more space, either space to learn, space to run, and just a little less pressure,"" Fairhead said. ""If you're the type of parent who wants a very structured day, lots of testing, and all of that, then my type of school is probably not the right fit.""

Given the lack of definition, it's difficult to predict the number of students enrolled in a microschool at any given time. The RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research organization, said in a March report that ""the best currently available estimate"" for the number of kids enrolled in a microschool full-time is between 1 million and 2 million, with ""many more"" enrolled part-time. Some microschools partner with religious institutions for funding and other resources.

Fairhead said that her school enrolled 12 kids in its first year, and she just finished the third school year with 37 students from kindergarten through 8th grade and a ""pretty long"" waitlist. The days are typically structured with a few hours of learning core subjects in the morning, like science and math, and the rest of the day is focused on ""experiential learning,"" like art, music, and outdoor activities.

She also incorporates Lakota language — the indigenous language of the reservation near the school — into the students' curriculum.

""If a child's struggling and they need something more personalized, we find it for them,"" Fairhead said. ""Or if they're excelling and they need something that's going to challenge them more, we find that for them.""

Interest in microschools started to grow during the pandemic as families looked for ways to keep students together while schools were closed, Paige Shoemaker DeMio, a senior analyst for K-12 education policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told BI. She called it ""a new version of a one-room schoolhouse.""

The National Microschooling Center — a nonprofit that works to advance the microschool movement — released an analysis of the sector in May. Using data from interviews and online questionnaires with 800 microschools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the analysis said that 74% of microschools have annual tuition and fees at or below $10,000. It also said that 41% of microschools rely on state-provided school choice funds to operate.

Fairhead said that she partners with the local tribe for funding. She also received a $200,000 grant as a semifinalist of the Yass Prize, founded by billionaire Jeff Yass to award high-impact education initiatives.

Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, told BI that the majority of microschool founders and teachers also have certified teaching experience.

""Microschool leaders come from a background as experienced educators themselves who are excited at the opportunity for professional growth in no longer being bound by the requirements of the rigidities of a public school system,"" Soifer said.

Soifer added that the goal of microschools is not to replace the public school system. Rather, it's to give families another option where their kids can be in a much smaller setting, and parents can be more clued into what their child is doing on a day-to-day basis.

""We all have friends who are working in the public schools, making important progress on improving them, and more power to them for having the patience to do that,"" Soifer said, adding that he spent years doing the same. ""But there are families that can't wait 20 years, 25 years for the public schools to make the improvements that are going to be able to help our kids who are in school right now.""

Regulations for microschools vary by state. An analysis by the National Microschooling Center found that over half of microschools follow their state's homeschooling requirements, while the rest either follow their state's nonpublic school guidelines or operate in a state with a defined microschool statute.

West Virginia, for example, codified the legal definition of a microschool in 2022, which says that one or more teachers can create a school that charges tuition and is an alternative to public, private, and homeschool enrollment. Georgia codified the legal definition of a learning pod one year prior, which could include a microschool structure.

Having those legal definitions allows regulators to ensure microschools are meeting the necessary requirements, Shoemaker DeMio said — and the lack of definitions from other states raises concerns on how to best hold those schools accountable. Lack of accountability could give rise to misuse of funds and inability to track whether kids are effectively learning the curriculum, she said.

""If we have a way that we can categorize certain schools as microschools, then we're able to actually break down the data and we're able to better understand who these students are serving and what quality of education they're receiving or how they're achieving,"" she said.

Some microschools have been investigated for accusations of misusing funds. Arizona's attorney general launched an investigation in 2021 into a microschool company, accusing it of collecting charter school funding from the state without actually providing any curriculum. In West Virginia, the state's treasurer included a microschool in an investigation following complaints from parents that their tuition was not being used to teach their children.

Fairhead said that she doesn't think more regulations are necessary and that they could diminish teachers' passion. She said that parents hold her accountable: ""They ask questions. They want to know what we're teaching and what our kids are learning. And I prefer them to be my accountability over somebody who doesn't know my kids, doesn't know our area, and doesn't know me.""

Shoemaker DeMio said that absent clear guidelines, data on microschools and student outcomes will remain minimal.

""If we can get specific regulations and guidance at the state level, that would be really helpful. It can provide us with data so that we could better track the schools,"" she said. ""But at the same time, it would also be helpful for people interested in starting microschools if they have a better understanding, if they have better guidance from the state on how to go about this.""

War in Ukraine:

US President Donald Trump and Friedrich Merz, Germany's chancellor outside the White House in Washington, DC, on June .

US President Donald Trump said it might be necessary to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a little while” before brokering a peace deal and suggested he might be willing to implement fresh sanctions on both countries if he determined the conflict wasn't going to end.

“Sometimes you let them fight for a little while,” Trump said during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday. “You see it in hockey, you see it in sports, the referees let them go for a couple of seconds, let them go for a little while before you pull them apart.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The US trade deficit narrowed in April by the most on record on the largest-ever plunge in imports, illustrating an abrupt end to the massive front-loading of goods by some companies ahead of higher tariffs.

The gap in goods and services trade shrank 55.5% from the prior month, to $61.6 billion, the smallest since 2023 and more than completely reversing the sharp widening that occurred in the first quarter, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a $66 billion deficit.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The US should use fears about its missile-defense system to press for a code of conduct in orbit.

Rules needed. 

Photographer: Gregg Newton/AFP/Getty Images

It's hardly surprising that some of the loudest objections to the Pentagon's proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield have come from Russia and China, who warn the system will spur a new nuclear arms race. Instead of minimizing such concerns, the US should leverage them to forge rules that will make space safer for everyone.

Talks about establishing norms of behavior in space have been stalled for years at the United Nations, as Russia and China have pushed instead for a legally binding treaty banning the deployment of weapons in orbit. Golden Dome helps explain why. Traditionally, space-based missile defense has been considered destabilizing because it encourages adversaries to build up their arsenals in response, and because a truly successful shield could encourage the US to launch a nuclear first strike, confident it could deflect any counterattack.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Anglo American Plc is about to begin a formal sales process for De Beers, after receiving indications of interest from potential buyers that include two former chief executives of the iconic diamond miner. 

An exit from De Beers represents the final step in a sweeping restructuring plan outlined by Anglo CEO Duncan Wanblad last year as the company fended off a takeover approach from BHP Group. Anglo has already agreed to sell its coal and nickel mines and unbundled its platinum business this week. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The alliance between President Donald Trump and mega-billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk dramatically fractured Thursday over the president's major tax bill 

Trump said Musk has been condemning the bill, which is pending in the Senate, because the Tesla CEO is ""upset"" about the elimination of EV credits in the package, and the president nixing his pick to run NASA.

""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

Musk quickly fired back at Trump in a post on his social media site X.

""Whatever,"" wrote Musk. ""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful.""

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election,"" Musk soon after tweeted. 

""Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" added Musk, who was the biggest financial backer of Trump's 2024 campaign, spending more than $250 million on that effort.

""Such ingratitude,"" he wrote.

Trump's dismissal of Musk's criticisms came after days of the billionaire condemning what Trump calls his ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" over concerns it will blow out federal deficits.

Musk on Tuesday called the bill, which is being considered by the Senate, a ""disgusting abomination.""

Musk last week left his temporary government post overseeing DOGE, the Trump administration's effort to slash federal spending and employee headcounts.

Last weekend, soon after Musk was lauded by Trump for his government service in an Oval Office event, the president said he was withdrawing Musk's preferred nominee, tech billionaire Jared Issacman, to run the space agency NASA.

""You know, I've always liked Elon,"" said Trump on Thursday. ""I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill, because the bill is incredible.""

""Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles,"" Trump said. ""And you know, they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy.""

""Elon knew this from the beginning,"" Trump said, referring to the elimination of the tax credits in the bill for electric vehicles. ""He knew it ... a long time ago.""

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it.""

""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair,"" Trump said.

The president also said, referring to Isaacman,  ""I'm sure [Musk] respected him, but to run NASA ... I didn't think it was appropriate.""

""You happen to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,"" Trump said of Isaacman. "" And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges. And one of the privileges we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important.""

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke Thursday and agreed that officials from the U.S. and China will meet soon for more talks to resolve an ongoing trade war.

Trump said he had a ""very good"" call with Xi for about 90 minutes, which focused ""almost entirely"" on trade.

The call ""resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries,"" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

He said that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in the renewed trade talks.

Trade officials from the countries last met in May in Geneva, where they agreed to temporarily lower retaliatory tariffs on imports from each other's countries.

But the Trump administration has accused Beijing of slow-walking a pledge made in Geneva to approve the export of additional critical minerals, known as rare earths, to the United States.

Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China's embassy in the U.S. said earlier Thursday that Trump had requested the call with Xi.

Trump has reportedly been eager to speak with Xi, as already-strained trade relations between the two countries frayed further in the past week.

After Thursday's call, Trump wrote, ""There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products."" He did not explain what that meant.

China has expressed deep frustration with a recent decision to impose new restrictions on Chinese student visas. It has also accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade progress by issuing an industry warning against using Chinese semiconductors.

The Trump administration has also imposed additional export restrictions on chips. The White House claims the actions are required to protect national security, but Beijing views them as punitive.

Stocks seesawed Thursday morning on news of the call, which was first reported by Chinese state media.

The call ""resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries,"" Trump wrote.

He also noted that he and Xi did not discuss any matters related to Russia, Ukraine or Iran.

The U.S. president added that Xi invited him and first lady Melania Trump to visit China, ""and I reciprocated.""

The impasse between the two economic superpowers — whose trade relationship totaled nearly $600 billion in 2024 — is weighing on Trump's broader tariff regime, which is already having a real-world impact.

Thursday's conversation was only the second time this year that the two leaders have held a one-on-one call. Trump and Xi previously spoke on Jan. 17, before the U.S. president's inauguration.

Ahead of the latest call, Trump praised Xi in a social media post that also betrayed his frustration.

""I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!"" Trump wrote early Wednesday morning.

China has been a prime target of Trump's efforts to wield steep, unilateral tariffs for the stated goal of recalibrating America's trade relationships with the rest of the world.

Trump had ratcheted blanket tariffs on Chinese imports up to 145% in April, even as he temporarily lowered duties on most other countries to 10%. Beijing hiked tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in retaliation.

The tariffs effectively led to a trade embargo. But that logjam appeared to shift in mid-May, after the talks in Geneva that both sides described as successful and productive.

Having overcome fears of the India-Pakistan conflict, Indian markets might lose its temporary status as a ""safe haven"" market if the U.S. and China come to a deal.

Those worries and a concoction of other factors — inflation, earnings disappointments — have led to lackluster performance for equities so far this year. The Nifty 50 is up 4.7% so far this year, and investors are likely to have welcomed the sideways move by the benchmark in May with a sigh of relief, in fact.

But the tide may be about to turn as Wall Street analysts and investors turn bullish.

The Indian market is currently one of the most expensive globally, trading at over 20% premiums to its 20-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which limits the potential for significant Nifty benchmark upside, according to analysts at CLSA.

""After the recent rally, the Indian market has again inched up to become nearly the most expensive market in the world,"" said CLSA's Vikash Kumar Jain in a note to clients.

Goldman Sachs strategists echoed that point, saying the MSCI India index ""does not look favourable"" even when adjusting for a stronger growth potential.

Wonks over at Morgan Stanley took a similar view of the stock market's recent performance.

""Since September 2024, the market has digested an unprecedented amount of bad news – excessive valuations in [small and mid-cap] and a sharp correction in the broad market pointing to a slowdown in macro growth and earnings, US tariff-related volatility and a major terrorist attack along with India's response with the large-cap indexes about 5% from all-time highs and almost negligible changes in implied volumes,"" said the Wall Street bank's Ridham Desai.

Norma analyst Saion Mukherjee also noted that most companies beat expectations for the latest quarter, but only because the expectations had been lowered significantly.

Yet, every single one of those market participants has turned bullish over the past couple of weeks.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the Nifty 50 to 26,200. Nomura similarly sees the index at 26,140.

Even long-time cautious bears such as Bernstein's Venugopal Garre, who has been right in cautioning investors over rich valuations in the small and mid-cap sectors (SMID), are now rethinking their outlook.

""They've been in a bubble zone for a while — a point we've never hesitated stating,"" said Garre. ""The reality is this: the SMID bubbles have let go of a lot of froth and are broadly valued in line with recent history. Not cheap, and not exorbitant.""

And it's not just strategists, analysts and advisors turning around. Money managers are also echoing the same sentiment.

""A lot of people look at India and have said, 'Gosh, the valuations are enormous,'"" said Andrew Dalrymple, chief investment officer at Aubrey Capital Management. ""If you took that view, you'd never buy an Indian equity. You would have missed an enormous opportunity in the last five years.""

Aubrey Global Emerging Markets Strategy, which manages more than $500 million in assets, has 35% of its fund allocated to India, its largest allocation.

""We try to reconcile valuation of the price earnings-to-growth ratio, and say when we look at an Indian company, it might nominally have that high P/E but we then say this is justified by price-to-growth ratio, which we try to keep at less than 1.5 times,"" Dalrymple added. ""And that way, we find we have been able to exploit some extremely successful, very, very profitable investment opportunities over the years.""

Dalrymple's sentiment is also reflected in the data. Foreign institutional investors have been net buyers of Indian equities over the past two months. Yet, it's off a low base, suggesting a significant upside in an ideal scenario.

Morgan Stanley's Desai noted that ""foreign portfolios positioning is the weakest since we have had the data in 2000, and there are early signs that their view on India is shifting.""

Amid all the sudden bullishness, however, many investors have learned a thing or two over the past year and are approaching with caution.

""This is likely to be a stock pickers' market, in contrast to one driven by top-down or macro factors since the Covid pandemic,"" Desai said in a note to clients on June 2.

Financials, often viewed as a leveraged bet on the future of a nation, appear to be a favorite among many.

In the large-cap space, Axis Bank was a top pick for Nomura and Goldman Sachs, with ICICI Bank seen favorably by Morgan Stanley, CLSA and JP Morgan.

India's economy expands more than expected. Gross domestic product in the quarter ended March grew 7.4%. That figure's much higher than the 6.7% expected by a Reuters poll of economists and the fastest rate of quarterly expansion for fiscal year 2025, according to government data released Friday. For the full fiscal year, India's economy expanded by 6.5%, in line with the government's February estimate.

U.S. authorities are reportedly investigating Adani's companies. Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn are looking into whether Gautam Adani's companies have been importing liquefied petroleum gas from Iran into India, according to the Wall Street Journal. A spokesperson for the Adani group ""categorially denies"" the allegations.

Reserve Bank of India expected to cut rates two more times. That's according to Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley, who said that the RBI should be comfortable with two more rate cuts in the current economic climate because India's ""growth conditions will still be reasonable"" and inflation is likely to remain below 4%.

Air travel by Indian nationals could cause the aviation industry to skyrocket. India is the third-largest air travel market in the world, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told CNBC's Monica Pitrelli at the World Air Transport Summit over the weekend. ""So if Indians start traveling... at the intensity of China, it's going to absolutely explode in volume internationally,"" Wilson said.

The Nifty 50 has stayed absolutely flat, so far this week. The index has risen 4.7% this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield moved lower by 3 basis points compared to last week.

On CNBC TV this week, Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economics research at Standard Chartered Bank, said that India's fiscal fourth-quarter economic expansion was ""much higher than anyone of us expected"" because of growth in net indirect taxes. However, that number can ""keep on fluctuating"" and eventually fade, so India's gross domestic product will likely return to the trend of 6.5%. The bank's full-year forecast for India's financial year 2026 is 6.6%.

Meanwhile, APEC President of Marriott International Rajeev Menon said that India is ""one of the most strategic markets in the world"" for the hotel chain. Menon pointed out that occupancy growth is driven by secondary and tertiary cities as much as demand from bigger cities like New Delhi and Bangalore, which suggests that the India's rising middle class is a revenue opportunity for businesses.

India's central bank will announce its interest rate decision Friday, when it is expected to lower rates by 25 basis points to 5.75%, according to LSEG data. The country will also be releasing data on its consumer inflation rate for May next Thursday.

Meanwhile, Ganga Bath Fittings, a manufacturer of bathroom accessories, lists Wednesday.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, with much to discuss at a time of trade disputes and ongoing war in Europe.

During both of his presidential terms, Trump has triggered tensions between long-standing allies U.S. and the European Union.

""The tone is as rough as it has not been in a long time,"" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in a speech on German-U.S. relations earlier this week.

White House officials have not always found friendly words for Berlin in recent months, and vice versa.

But there have been some signs of rapprochement, with the country's leaders now reportedly being on a first name basis after several phone calls. Building on this will be a top priority for Merz in D.C.

""Top of the agenda for the German Chancellor will be to strike the right chord with Trump,"" Jörn Fleck, senior director of the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told CNBC.

Merz's conservative views on immigration, his links to U.S. businesses — the chancellor is a former BlackRock executive — ""and a profile as an old-school outsider who was underestimated but won an election by pledging to restore his country's economy and security,"" could work in his favor, Fleck explained.

Export-reliant Germany counts the U.S. as its biggest trading partner, leaving it vulnerable in the face of Trump's trade agenda.

Penny Naas, who leads on the German Marshall Fund's allied strategic competitiveness work, told CNBC that this is especially true for sector-specific tariffs, for example targeting autos and steel.

They ""hit industries at the core of the German economy,"" she said.

""Merz will want to see if there is any room for negotiation on these tariffs,"" such as the U.S. and EU cutting all industrial duties to zero, Naas added.

Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs, which have also been imposed on the European Union, are also set to be on Merz's agenda, Franziska Palmas, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC.

""He is likely to stress his support for free trade and a EU-US trade deal. He may point to the EU's proposal of a zero-for-zero tariff deal as an ideal outcome,"" she said.

Negotiations between the EU and U.S. have so far been tough, but European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Tuesday signaled talks were ""advancing in the right direction.""

The Russia-Ukraine war will also almost certainly be discussed, especially after Trump's Wednesday phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

European leaders have pushed Trump to apply pressure on Putin, and Merz is expected to follow suit, the Atlantic Council's Fleck said.

Palmas meanwhile said Merz would likely ""reiterate Germany's strong support for Ukraine and the need for European countries to be involved in peace negotiations.""

U.S. support for Kyiv has been uncertain, along with Trump's focus on expediting peace-making between Russia and Ukraine — raising concerns in Europe.

Topics like U.S. support for European troops on the ground, enforcing sanctions and sharing information may therefore come up, Fleck added.

Another critical topic will be the NATO military alliance in which both Germany and the U.S. participate and specifically members' defense contributions. Trump has long been pushing for these expenditures to rise to 5% of each country's gross domestic product, meeting some resistance.

Fleck noted that ""Merz will want to make sure Germany is no longer seen as a laggard on defense spending and capabilities.""

Given Germany's recent fiscal reforms that allow for higher defense costs and its support for Trump's 5% NATO spending target, the German chancellor should have ""a positive story to tell"" on this front.

Capital Economics' Palmas added that Merz may even use the occasion to announce a specific defense spending target.

NBA teams notched $1.62 billion in sponsorship revenue this season — an increase of 8% since last year, and 91% from $850 million five years ago, according to third-party data firm SponsorUnited.

While the volume of deals was up just 2.5% since last year, the partnerships got bigger and more strategic, per the NBA Marketing Partnerships Report 2024-2025 from SponsorUnited, which tracks global sports and entertainment sponsorships.

That haul is still shy, however, of the NFL, which had nearly $2.5 billion in team sponsorship revenue, a 6% increase from the prior season, according to SponsorUnited.

A key part of the NBA's revenue rise is the proliferation of sponsor patches on team jerseys, said Bob Lynch, founder and CEO of the data firm.

The number of jersey patch deals — commonplace in international soccer and increasingly popular in the NBA since their introduction in 2017 — more than doubled year over year last season. There were six first-time NBA jersey partners, contributing more than $80 million in new spending this year, according to the report. The deals typically run three years on average, Lynch said.

""It was sort of this mad dash to bring in these deals, which generate a lot of buzz and a lot of revenue,"" said Lynch. ""These partnerships can be a quarter of a billion dollars of incremental revenue that was generated just from 11 deals that were sold. So it just shows the continued viability and interest in the NBA just on these jersey patches alone.""

The 2024 opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome has also helped to drive up overall sponsorship revenue.

""Anytime these leagues have a big stadium that opens or an expansion team, it just adds so much revenue to the league,"" said Lynch.

""Between jersey patches and the Clippers' stadium, it was like the equivalent of bringing in three new teams to the league that generated revenue,"" he said.

There were 450 brands that entered NBA sponsorships for the first time this season. The most growth came from brands in the construction, alcohol and technology sectors, according to SponsorUnited.

Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase rank as the top-spending brands in the league, according to the report. Chase is the arena sponsor for the Golden State Warriors, while Rakuten has a patch on the team's jersey.

The sponsorship increase comes on the heels of the league's $77 billion media rights deal, in which games will be offered across Disney's platforms like ESPN, Comcast's NBC broadcast and Peacock, and Amazon's Prime Video beginning next season. The latest media rights deal shows a heavy emphasis on streaming and a broader expansion on broadcast TV.

Individual star players have beckoned some of the biggest endorsement deals, which didn't contribute to the team sponsorship total, but often serve as a gateway for brands to eventually strike deals with teams, said Lynch.

""What we're seeing is that players are almost becoming teams themselves in the number of sponsorship deals they have,"" said Lynch.

Initially, star players and their massive social media followings were considered a threat to overall league and team sponsorship revenue. Instead, they've provided a boost, said Lynch.

""It's created a larger ecosystem for brands to enter into the NBA space, sort of dip their toe in the water,"" he said.

Athletes often sign endorsement deals that can last just a few months, as opposed to team sponsorships that are longer term. The exception is generational players, like Steph Curry and LeBron James, who have the leverage for long-term deals.

This season the Philadelphia 76ers' Jared McCain signed 30 endorsement deals, the most by a player in a single season in NBA history, according to SponsorUnited.

Other top NBA athletes who led in endorsement deals include three New York Knicks players — Karl-Anthony Towns, Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson — who powered the team to the Eastern Conference finals this season.

The Golden State Warriors' Curry was also among the top-endorsed NBA players. Curry saw his business career trajectory change when he inked a deal with Under Armour in 2013, which was worth about $4 million per year, CNBC recently reported. In 2023 Curry extended the deal and received 8.8 million Under Armour shares, valued at $75 million at the time.

As a whole, the Warriors ranked alongside the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers as part of a handful of U.S. teams tracking toward $200 million in annual sponsorship deals.

BERLIN — It was an impressive enough sporting feat when Serena Williams won a record 23rd Grand Slam singles title at the 2017 Australian Open, beating her sister Venus in the final. Soon after came a revelation: she had been pregnant at the time.

""I don't know how I did that, honestly,"" Williams said at an event Wednesday, selecting the moment as the most important of her tennis career. 

It's been quite the career — after winning her first Grand Slam at the U.S. Open in 1999, Williams went on to become the only player to have achieved the ""Golden Slam"" — winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open and getting an Olympic gold medal — in both singles and doubles tennis.

""I don't know what I was doing then, I was nine weeks pregnant ... I do remember not being able to run for a long time,"" Williams said at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin.

""I didn't tell anyone. I mean, Venus knew, and I still feel really bad about that, because a deep part of me feels like because we played each other in the final, I'm like, she must have known, and she must have felt some sort of deep heaviness to go even further and go all out. But she was only one of two people that knew.""

Early pregnancy symptoms can be intense as the body undergoes a huge transformation, with a surge in hormones often leading to fatigue, breathlessness and nausea.

""I remember saying, I have to do a lot of aces, I have to do a lot of winners,"" Williams continued, referring to a point scored directly from a serve. ""I can only play, like, four balls and I'm done.""

""I remember one time playing a long point against one player, and I couldn't breathe. And I'm like, How does she not see that I'm not able to breathe right now, and so I just intentionally lost the next point just to kind of try and get my energy back. But then I was like: Why am I playing this far pregnant? This is nuts.""

Williams, who has two daughters with investor and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, stepped back from professional tennis in 2022 to focus on her family. 

Sports stars such as cyclist Laura Kenny have spoken in recent years about the challenges of balancing an intense and physically demanding career with a desire to get pregnant, while tennis player Naomi Osaka has criticized public commentary that one must be sacrificed for the other.

Williams now runs venture capital fund Serena Ventures, which has 40 portfolio companies.

She told the packed audience of private equity professionals that the qualities that made her obsessed with winning in sports translated to a single-minded focus as an investor.

""I do remember at one point, walking on the court at Wimbledon, and my partner at the time called me about a deal that we were trying to close,"" she recalled.

""I was on Court One that day, and it's a really long walk. And I remember talking to her on the phone, and in the conversation, she's like ... How's your day going? I'm like: Well, I'm walking on the court right now. And she's just like: Are you kidding me? You have to get off the phone. I'm like, okay, it's fine. It's a long walk. I've done it before. So that's how intense, how intentional I am,"" Williams said.

She noted that she looks for founders who are obsessive about being the best at what they do and changing the lives of people they want to impact.

Her earliest investment was in the American football team Miami Dolphins in 2009, when she was the world's top-ranked female player.

""We got so many bad articles about why we shouldn't be doing this. We need to just focus on tennis, and we need to not think about this,"" she said of the reaction from the media and sporting world at the time.

""Now as an athlete, we're at the point where if you're only doing basketball or if you're only doing football, if you're only doing tennis, it's like, well, what else are you doing? So we gave people that platform to be like, it's okay. You can also be an entrepreneur, and you can do sport. You don't have to just stay in one lane, you know, and just do one thing.""

Use of low-cost e-commerce giants Temu and Shein has slowed significantly in the key U.S. market amid President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the de minimis loophole, new data shows.

Temu's U.S. daily active users (DAUs) dropped 52% in May versus March, before Trump's tariffs were announced, while those at rival Shein were down 25%, according to data shared with CNBC by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

DAUs is a measure of the number of people who visit or interact with a platform every 24 hours. Monthly active users (MAUs), a measure of user engagement over a 30-day period, was also down at Temu (30%) and Shein (12%) in May versus March.

The declines were also reflected in both platforms' Apple App Store rankings. Temu averaged a rank of 132 in May 2025, down from an average top 3 ranking a year ago, while Shein averaged a rank of 60 last month versus a top 10 ranking the year prior, the data showed.

Neither Temu nor Shein immediately responded to CNBC's request for comment.

The user drop off comes as both Temu and Shein have pulled back on U.S. advertising spend over recent months since the Trump administration's tariff announcements.

Trump in April announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, including the end of the ""de minimis"" tariff exemption on May 2, which allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.

In May, Temu's U.S. ad spend fell 95% year-on-year while Shein's was down 70%.

""Temu and Shein's decline in US ad spend was also noticeable in April, as spend decreased by 40% and 65% YoY, respectively,"" Seema Shah, vice president of research and insights at Sensor Tower, said in emailed comments to CNBC.

Both Temu and Shein also altered their logistics models in the wake of tariffs, shifting away from a drop shipping model, which allowed them to send items directly from Chinese suppliers to U.S. consumers, and instead, particularly in Temu's case, building up a network of U.S. warehouses.

Rui Ma, founder and analyst at Tech Buzz China, said such moves were also likely to have impacted the companies' ad spend strategy and customer acquisition patterns.

""All these additional costs and regulatory hurdles are clearly hurting Chinese platforms' U.S. growth prospects,"" she wrote in emailed comments. 

Tech Buzz China research from March showed that a 50% tariff would be the point at which Temu would lose most of its price advantages and find it difficult to operate. The tariff on former de minimis imports currently stands at 54%, having been lowered from 120% amid a 90-day tariff truce between the U.S. and China.

Last week, Temu's parent company PDD Holdings reported first-quarter earnings below estimates and pointed to tariffs as a significant pressure on sellers.

Temu's popularity has nevertheless picked up outside the U.S., with non-U.S. users rising to account for 90% of the platform's 405 million global MAUs in the second quarter, according to HSBC.

Writing in a note last week, HSBC analysts said that was ""supported by growth in Europe, Latin America, and South America."" They added that the swiftest of that growth occurred in ""less affluent markets.""

""Many (Chinese platforms) are now actively redirecting their efforts toward other markets such as Europe,"" Ma said.

In this article

LONDON — British money transfer firm Wise on Thursday said that it plans to move its primary listing location to the U.S., dealing a fresh blow to the London stock exchange.

Wise said in its full-year earnings statement that it will move to a dual listing, with its main listing hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London.

""This would allow Wise's shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the LSE,"" Wise said in its earnings announcement.

Shares of Wise ended the day up 7.1%, after rising by nearly 11% earlier on Thursday.

Wise debuted on London's stock market in 2021 in a direct listing that valued the company at £8 billion ($10.84 billion) at the time. It is now valued at £11.07 billion, according to LSEG data.

The listing was viewed as a symbolic win for the U.K., as then British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government was looking to encourage more global tech companies to choose London as their IPO destination.

Since then, London has been mired in doubts over whether it can play host to major tech listings. The city is often criticized for lacking the depth of liquidity and industry expertise from investment analysts to accommodate such transactions.

Doubts over London's stock market haven't been limited to tech, though. On Wednesday, Glencore-backed metals investor Cobalt Holdings announced it was scrapping plans to go public in London. The IPO was expected to be the largest listing in the U.K. capital since early 2024.

Citigroup said Thursday it plans to cut around 3,500 technology positions in China, in the latest move by a major U.S. bank aimed at streamlining global operations and reduce costs.

The reduction of staff at the China Citi Solution Centers in Shanghai and Dalian is expected to be completed by the start of the fourth quarter this year, Citi said in a statement.

The jobs affected are mostly in the information technology services unit, providing software technology development, testing and maintenance and operational services for Citi's global business.

The company said some of the roles will be moved to Citi's technology centers elsewhere, without specifying the numbers of jobs or specific locations.

The layoffs in China come as Citi continues to work through a broader plan announced January last year, to reduce 10% of its workforce, or about 20,000 employees globally. It has moved to streamline operation and downsize office in the U.S., Indonesia, the Philippines and Poland, the statement said.

""China has always been an important part of Citi's global network and business development. We will continue to firmly serve corporate and institutional clients in China and serve their cross-border banking needs,"" Marc Luet, president of Citi Japan North Asia and Australia said in the statement.

Led by CEO Jane Fraser, Citi has undertaken a sweeping reorganization aimed at improving profitability and restoring investor confidence after years of lagging behind major U.S. banking peers.

Citi is not alone in restructuring operations. A slew of major global banks are under fresh pressure to trim costs against the backdrop of deteriorating global economic outlook as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies spark concerns over declining trade activity.

Foreign banks, including Citi, may continue scaling back business in China as the country's soft growth prospects have reduced banking business opportunities, said Meng Shen, director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co.

Beijing's tightened regulatory oversight for the financial services industry will likely create additional uncertainty for Western banks, Shen said. 

Citi's Luet, however, reaffirmed plans to establish wholly-owned securities and futures companies in China.

Hong Kong-based Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC, reportedly said last month it was restructuring business in a move that would lead to job losses for about 1% of its ""core staff."" The job reductions were part of a cost-cutting drive, led by HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery, that aims to cut expenses by $1.8 billion by the end of 2026.

Hong Kong and mainland China-focused banks have seen rising bad loans over the last few years due to their relatively high exposure to China's troubled property sector.

Several Wall Street banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America have also begun the annual process of terminating underperforming employees. Bank of America has reportedly eliminated 150 banker positions in its investment banking unit this year.

Some multinational businesses are mulling to scale back reliance on the China market, as they navigate the fallout from Beijing's tensions with Washington, a sluggish domestic demand and intensifying competition from local companies.

A business survey from the American Chamber of Commerce in China showed the share of U.S. companies in China considering to relocate manufacturing or sourcing out of China hit a record high, at the outset of Trump's second term.

Escalating trade tensions have also dented confidence among European businesses with operation in China, according to a flash survey released Wednesday by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, highlighting ""especially gloomy"" expectations around heightened competition and profitability.

Local media reported last month that L'Oréal was planning to lay off up to half of its travel retail workforce in China as the French cosmetic giant continues to face sluggish sales.

German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz also plans to cut up to 15% of its sales and finance staff in China, Reuters reported, in a move that will affect about 2,000 people working in its research and development units.

The German luxury carmaker, however, still plans to spend heavily in China in the coming years to better compete with local electric-vehicle peers that dominate the market.

Automotive industry groups are increasingly worried about a rare earth shortage.

Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down due to China's recent export controls, according to Europe's auto supplier association CLEPA, with the group warning of more outages as inventories deplete.

Germany's car industry and auto executives have also sounded the alarm, saying the highly globalized sector is acutely vulnerable to further supply chain disruption.

China's Ministry of Commerce in early April imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive, defense and energy sectors. The curbs came as part of a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's products.

Some of the affected rare earth elements are vital components to the production of both combustion engines and electric vehicles.

CLEPA said Wednesday that while hundreds of export license applications have been submitted to the Chinese authorities since early April, only around 25% appear to have been approved.

""With a deeply intertwined global supply chain, China's export restrictions are already shutting down production in Europe's supplier sector,"" CLEPA Secretary General Benjamin Krieger said in a statement.

For its part, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the country's main car industry lobby, warned that Beijing's export restrictions could soon cause output to grind to a halt.

""The Chinese export restrictions on rare earths are a serious challenge for the security of supply, and not just in the automotive supply chains. Although some licences have now been granted, this is currently not enough to ensure smooth production,"" VDA President Hildegard Müller told CNBC via email.

""A further problem arises from the slow customs clearance of exports for which a valid export licence has been granted. If the situation does not change quickly, production delays and even production stoppages can no longer be ruled out,"" she added.

Müller reiterated the VDA's call for German and European Union lawmakers ""to raise this issue emphatically with the Chinese side so that a solution to the situation can be found quickly.""

Demand for rare earths and critical minerals is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

China, meanwhile, is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, accounting for roughly 60% of the world's production of rare earth minerals and materials. U.S. officials have previously warned that this poses a strategic challenge amid the pivot to more sustainable energy sources.

Germany's BMW reportedly said Wednesday that some of its supplier network had been affected by China's export curbs, while major domestic peers Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz Group both said they were not experiencing any shortages.

""As a matter of principle, Mercedes-Benz has a strategy for all critical raw materials that are purchased directly and indirectly that secures demand in the long term and mitigates supply risks in the long term - knowing full well that raw material deposits are limited in some regions,"" a Mercedes-Benz Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

The carmaker added that it was also working on concepts to ""significantly reduce"" the amount of rare earth metals per vehicle unit. ""In the future, Mercedes-Benz wants to use new material compositions to dispense with heavy rare earth metals such as dysprosium in our electric drives,"" they said.

A Volkswagen spokesperson told CNBC that the supply of auto parts containing rare earths was stable.

""Our suppliers are continuously working with their subcontractors to obtain the necessary export licenses. We have received indications that a limited number of these licenses have been granted,"" they said.

A spokesperson for BMW did not respond to a request for comment.

It's not just European carmakers reckoning with a rare earth shortage.

Japan's Nissan said it was also exploring ways to minimize the impact of China's export controls by working with Japan's government and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.

""It's something that is happening as we speak — and it is true that it will have some impact on the automotive industry,"" Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa told CNBC on Wednesday.

""We need to continue finding alternatives for the future, keeping flexibility and keeping our options open,"" he added.

Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor suspended production of its Swift car due to China's rare earth curbs, Reuters reported Thursday, citing two unnamed sources. A Suzuki Motor spokesperson was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan made a pitch to World Wrestling Entertainment legend Paul ""Triple H"" Levesque to bring the wrestling promotion's biggest event, Wrestlemania, to the U.K. capital.

""I'd love for WrestleMania to come to London,"" Khan told CNBC's Tania Bryer. ""Triple H if you're watching, we want WrestleMania to come to London.""

Speculation has been rife about London as a destination since 2023 when wrestling legend John Cena made a surprise appearance at a show in the city and gave backing to the idea of bringing WrestleMania to the British capital.

If the event, dubbed the ""Super Bowl of Wrestling,"" were to come to the U.K.'s capital city, it would be the first time the event is hosted outside of North America.

Levesque, whose ring name is Triple H, is now chief content officer of the WWE. Khan held talks with Levesque in July last year, adding to the speculation. He then made a further pitch for London during the CNBC interview.

""If WrestleMania came to London, my message to the team there is that we wouldn't just have a great weekend, we'd have a festival, of you know, legends in WrestleMania coming to London, current stars, but also future stars as a well,"" Khan said.

""It will open a completely new market for them as well.""

WrestleMania 41, the biggest show in the WWE calendar, was held in Las Vegas this year.  The two-day event takes place over a weekend with shows such as ""Smackdown"" and ""Raw"" usually taking place around the time of the main event.

Khan described London as the ""sporting capital of the world,"" touting events such as the tennis at Wimbledon and even American football matches as evidence of its sporting achievements.

WWE, which is owned by TKO Group, has looked to expand the appeal and audience of the wrestling brand. WWE's Monday night weekly show ""Raw"" began streaming on Netflix this year.

Khan said London could provide WWE the chance to expand further.

""I think the potential has not been reached in terms of WrestleMania. We are the sporting capital in my view, of the world. And if WrestleMania wants to expand, the obvious place to come is London,"" Khan said.

Based on payrolls processing firm ADP's jobs report and the U.S. Federal Reserve ""Beige Book,"" the United States economy appears to be slowing. The number of private sector jobs created in May rose by a mere 37,000, almost three times lower than the Dow Jones forecast. And the Fed report noted that ""economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report"" released April 23.

The ADP report, however, isn't always aligned with the Labor Department's jobs report, which will be released Friday. For example, the former stated that private companies added 107,000 jobs in January 2024, but the latter posted a 353,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls for the same period.

Meanwhile, the Fed's ""Beige Book"" report is based on ""reports from Bank and Branch directors"" and ""interviews and online questionnaires."" Hence, while it provides a useful snapshot of economic sentiment, it is a ""qualitative"" report, as the Fed acknowledges, that might not capture economic data.

According to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed at which an object is traveling depends on the position of an observer. Wednesday's reports can give an insight into the economy, but they could also be skewed by the vantage point of the observers.

Dow snaps consecutive gainsU.S. stocks were mixed Wednesday. The S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.32%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.22%, ending a four-day winning streak. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.47% at 1:30 p.m. in Singapore as Asian technology stocks such as Meituan, Alibaba and Kuaishou Technology extended gains for a second session.

Slackening labor market in the U.S.Trump called on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to ""LOWER THE RATE"" after payrolls processing firm ADP reported the lowest level of private sector jobs creation in years. Payrolls increased just 37,000 for May, below the downwardly revised 60,000 in April and the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000. It was the lowest monthly job total from the ADP count since March 2023.

Fed's 'Beige Book' reports slowing U.S. economyThe U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks as hiring has slowed and consumers and businesses worried about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday. In its periodic ""Beige Book"" summary of conditions, the central bank noted that ""economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report"" released April 23.

Circle prices its IPO higher than expectedCircle Internet Group, the issuer of USD Coin, one of the world's biggest stablecoins, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share late Wednesday stateside. That's above the expected range of $27 to $28 and gives the company a total market value of $6.8 billion. New York-based Circle, its founder and some original shareholders will raise $1.05 billion in the offering of 34 million shares. 

White House imposes travel banThe Trump administration signed a proclamation Wednesday suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Citing national security interests, the proclamation states that the identified countries lack sufficient vetting and screening processes, which could increase the risk of terrorism threats to America.

[PRO] Financial sector stocks slowingThe financial sector, seen as a potential winner of the Trump administration, is starting to cool. While the group is still outperforming the S&P year to date, the gap has been closing in recent weeks, wrote Wolfe Research analyst Rob Ginsberg, who highlighted one aspect of the sector that is the ""most concerning.""

Auto industry sounds the alarm as China's rare earth curbs start to bite

Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down because of China's recent export controls, according to Europe's auto supplier association CLEPA, which warned of more outages as inventories deplete.

Oops, something went wrong

Trump Media and Technology (DJT) took a key step toward launching a publicly traded crypto investment product Thursday morning.

The newly formed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF business trust filed its S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register the new exchange-traded fund licensing Trump Media's social media brand. The ETF will trade on the NYSE Arca.

Thursday's filing is a significant step for Trump Media's move into the cryptocurrency space.

The media company, of which President Trump is a majority stakeholder, announced in January it was expanding into financial services and would offer investment products through a newly created fintech platform, Truth.Fi.

Last week, Trump Media said it will spend $2.32 billion to create a bitcoin treasury, issuing equity to fund the initiative. The move follows the trend of companies across various sectors adding bitcoin to their balance sheets to try to replicate the success of crypto advocate Michael Saylor's company Strategy.

The Trump administration has ushered in a friendlier stance toward cryptocurrency than that of Trump's predecessor, President Biden.

Trump announced the creation of a national strategic bitcoin reserve earlier this year. The president appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to a newly created White House role of crypto czar, and his pick for SEC chair is well-known crypto lawyer Paul Atkins. Under Trump's administration, the Atkins-led SEC dropped investigations into Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and other crypto firms as Trump looks to reverse the Biden-era clampdown on fraud in the sector.

The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up nearly 50% over the past year and rose as high as over $109,000 in January. But the price also plummeted below $80,000 in April as Trump's trade war roiled the stock market before it recovered again.

Trump Media stock fell 2% Thursday morning and is down 54% over the past year.

The new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital — a New Jersey-based affiliate of asset manager Yorkville Advisors — and will track the price of the cryptocurrency. Crypto.com is both the custodian and liquidity provider for the ETF, meaning it safeguards as well as buys and sells the cryptocurrency.

Truth Social, Crypto.com, and Yorkville America Digital first announced a partnership to launch a series of exchange-traded funds in March.

Earlier this week, NYSE Group submitted regulatory paperwork to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

A CoinFlip.tech cryptocurrency ATM in San Francisco.

CoinFlip, an operator of a global network Bitcoin ATMs, is in the early stages of weighing a sale as dealmaking in the cryptocurrency space heats up, people familiar with the matter said.

The Chicago-based company is working with a financial adviser to seek a buyer, according to the people. CoinFlip is considering seeking at least $1 billion in the sale, though it's unclear if it will be able to achieve that valuation, the people said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Bitcoin BTC$103,460.78 has taken deeper root in corporate treasuries, with 116 public companies now holding a combined 809,100 BTC, worth around $85 billion based on current prices, at the end of May.

That's a dramatic rise from 312,200 BTC held a year ago in corporate treasuries, according to Binance Research's latest report. Nearly 100,000 BTC has been added since early April alone.

The surge appears driven by a mix of rising prices and structural tailwinds. Donald Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his 2024 presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. a global hub for the asset class and create a “crypto capital of the planet.”

Since Trump took office he has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits against major crypto firms..

Binance's report shows that bitcoin treasury accumulation grew in November, when Trump won the election.

Adding to that, new fair-value accounting rules introduced by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) this year allow companies to recognize gains on BTC holdings, removing a longstanding deterrent.

Newer entrants including GameStop (GME) and PSG have recently started accumulating BTC as a well, yet Strategy still holds the lion's share of BTC in corporate treasuries, with over 70% of holdings.

Some companies are also tiptoeing into other assets. SharpLink holds $425 million in ETH, while DeFi Development and Classover are betting on solana SOL$149.72. China-based firm Webus recently filed for a $300 million XRP$2.18 strategic reserve.

Still, these altcoin holdings remain relatively small and are often tied to firms trying to rebrand as token-forward entities, Binance noted.

Binance's report also flagged the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), which have climbed more than 260% from $8.6 billion to $23 billion this year.

The Ethereum Foundation has published a new treasury policy that aims to reshape how its reserves are held and invested, seeking to rewrite the playbook in a way better suited to the on-chain world it helped create.

The new set of treasury policies marks two key moves from the non-profit organization that stewards development for the Ethereum ecosystem. 

It aims to reduce annual spending from 15% of assets to just 5% by 2030 and will also seek to utilize its treasury for DeFi protocols.

Those prospects are projected to ""earn acceptable returns on treasury assets"" while staying ""consistent with Ethereum's underlying principles,"" Hsiao-Wei Wang, co-executive director at the foundation, wrote Wednesday.

The new policies formalize a lower spending trajectory and a rule-based approach for converting the foundation's Ethereum reserves into cash.

It plans to achieve this by committing to reduced annual operating expenses and creating a predictable ""glide path and baseline"" toward spending, Wang explained.

The foundation ""expects to remain a long-term steward, but envisions its scope gradually narrowing,"" Wang claimed.

The rule-based conversion, meanwhile, works by automatically selling Ethereum (ETH) only when cash reserves fall below the 2.5-year expense buffer (approximately 37.5% of the treasury), Wang wrote.

For every quarter, the Ethereum Foundation will sell a portion of its Ethereum reserves based on the amount of cash required, converting the Ethereum to fiat through exchanges or on-chain swaps.

The target cash reserve, calculated as annual operating spend, multiplied by the desired runway, ""directly informs the size and the cadence of ETH sales,"" Wang noted.

Decrypt approached the Ethereum Foundation to learn more.

In the note, the foundation introduced ""Defipunk,"" a new term that describes how “cypherpunk” values can be applied to DeFi (decentralized finance) and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

The term is derived from and borrows core ideas in the Cypherpunk Manifesto, written by American programmer and mathematician Eric Hughes in 1993.

In the manifesto, Hughes argues that privacy is essential for a free and open society. To keep it, individuals need to build practical defenses through cryptography and code, rather than relying on the authority of governments or corporations.

The foundation has established criteria for projects it seeks to support, aligning with the vision.

""For privacy to be widespread, it must be part of a social contract,"" Hughes wrote.

The Ethereum Foundation echoes this, with Wang noting that privacy has ""inherent network effects,” and yet has received ""very little attention so far.""

“Strong, early institutional support” from entities such as the Ethereum Foundation could be “uniquely valuable in flipping the equilibrium” for privacy in the decentralized finance sector, Wang wrote.

 Ethereum OG Ryan Berckmans explains Ethereum's new strategy and what it could mean for ETH's future price action. 

Ether (ETH) is back in the spotlight, surging nearly 50% in the past month and outpacing most other major crypto assets. But what's really fueling this dramatic comeback? And is it sustainable?

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Ethereum OG and investor Ryan Berckmans lifts the curtain on a pivotal shift inside the Ethereum ecosystem.

For years, Ethereum's strategy revolved around a rollup-centric roadmap, focusing on layer-2 scaling while largely sidelining the base layer. Insiders are now talking about a “moment of reckoning,” one that has given way to a rebalanced strategy between layer-1 and layer-2 growth.

“It really wasn't until earlier this year when the price action got so unbelievably poor [...] that seriously wealthy and seriously influential Ethereum folks close to the heart of the community — Vitalik [Buterin, Ethereum co-founder] included — looked at this moment and said, ‘Oh my God, we never thought it could get this bad,'” Berckmans said.

This reality check sparked a strategic reset, already showing signs of renewed cohesion, narrative strength, and clear leadership from Ethereum's core figures.

Looking ahead, Berckmans sees a massive opportunity on the horizon. With Ethereum increasingly positioned as the foundation for future global onchain economies, he says the value of ETH could skyrocket.

“In the years to come, onchain economies are going to get 1000x bigger than they are today [...] and that's really going to drive Ether at 20K, 50K, 80K in the coming years,” he said.

What missteps triggered this change, and could ETH really reach those bold price targets? Get the full story in our exclusive interview, now live on Cointelegraph's YouTube channel. Don't forget to like and subscribe to stay ahead of the curve in the crypto space.

Key takeaways:

ETH futures show weak bullish sentiment despite strong ETF inflows.

More upside appears limited due to weak network activity and competitors like Solana.

Ethereum's decreasing TVL contrasts rising fees

Ether ETHUSD has struggled to reclaim the $2,700 mark despite an 8% gain between June 2 and June 4. Although the price gained 48% between May 5 and June 5, further upside appears limited due to some weak network activity and rising competition. 

Total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured by total value locked (TVL), fell to 25.1 million ETH on June 5, marking a 17% decline from the previous month. Ethereum still leads in total deposits, but Solana's TVL rose 2% during the same 30-day span, reaching 65.8 million SOL (SOL). This suggests that Ethereum's edge over rivals is gradually eroding.

Key contributors to Ethereum's TVL decline include Sky (formerly MakerDAO), which dropped 48% to 2.1 million ETH, and Curve Finance, down 24% to 1.1 million ETH. 

However, this overlooks the fact that average network fees on Ethereum climbed 150% month-over-month. This fee increase amplifies the protocol's burn mechanism, reducing ETH's inflationary pressure.

DEX activity rises, but Solana beats Ethereum by volume

One driver behind the higher fees is the surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Uniswap has handled more than $2.6 billion in daily volume so far in June, compared to $1.65 billion in early May. 

Although this trend supports Ether's price, rival networks like BNB Chain and Solana have expanded their share of DEX activity. Currently, Ethereum ranks third in this segment.

BNB Chain led in DEX volume growth, though this advantage is less significant due to the network's extremely low fees. Lower costs make it easier to artificially inflate activity, making comparisons with Solana and Ethereum somewhat misleading. 

Even after adjusting for this distortion, however, Solana's DEX volume has surpassed Ethereum's. This shift raises questions about whether ETH still maintains a competitive edge. 

Notably, top-performing decentralized applications like Hyperliquid and Pump are choosing to launch their own blockchains instead of building on Ethereum layer-2 solutions or using alternatives such as Solana.

ETH futures show a lack of bullish conviction

Futures markets for Ether offer insight into professional traders' sentiment. In balanced conditions, monthly ETH contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium to reflect the extended settlement period.

As of June 5, the Ether futures premium dropped to 5%, down from 6% a week earlier. This signals a slight reduction in leveraged long positions, though the premium remains within a neutral range. More importantly, the last time ETH futures traded above a 10% premium was in late January, suggesting a persistent lack of bullish conviction.

On the positive side, institutional interest in ETH has grown, reinforcing support near the $2,500 level.

Thus, concluding that institutional demand for Ether is waning would be inaccurate. Between May 22 and June 4, US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $700 million in net inflows. Notably, there hasn't been a single day of net outflows in that three-week period, reinforcing the strength of the $2,500 support level.

Thus, while demand for ETH remains, particularly from institutions, other metrics suggest that the bulls will probably be unable to break $3,000 in the near term.

The broader cryptocurrency market mirrored the bearish close in Bitcoin (BTC) on Wednesday, with the majority of the top 100 altcoins closing below their opening prices. Among the minority, SPX6900 (SPX), DeXe Protocol (DEXE), and PancakeSwap (CAKE) record mild gains as Coinbase adds CAKE to the asset roadmap, increasing the listing chances, and DEXE announces a writer's guild program to incentivize its promotion. 

Bitcoin reveals a vulnerable price action with increasing downside risk as a triangle pattern unfolds. On the 4-hour timeframe, the lows on May 12, May 31, and June 2 compose a support trendline, while the lower high trend in Bitcoin after its reversal from its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 shapes a declining trendline.

The converging trendlines assemble a triangle pattern while Bitcoin draws near the support floor and the triangle's apex. A potential 4-hour closing below Wednesday's low at $104,179 will result in a fallout from the pattern. Investors could witness BTC retest the $103,182 low marked on Saturday, with the next support level at $101,860. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46 fluctuates near the halfway line a couple of days after the bounce back from the oversold boundary. The indicator shows significant room for growth but an indecisive trend in motion.

Conversely, an upside reversal closing above the trendline (Wednesday's high at $106,000) could move BTC to $108,797. 

SPX trades at $1.15, recording a growth of over 1.50% at press time on Thursday. Following the 4.30% rise on Wednesday, the meme coin, neglecting the broader market movement, registered a near 28% rise from its weekly low of $0.90 on Saturday. 

The 78.6% Fibonacci level at $1.28 acts as the immediate resistance, drawn between 2025's highest daily closing price at $1.55 on January 6 and the lowest at $0.29 on March 11.

The RSI indicator at 68 indicates a struggle to enter the overbought zone, as it forms lower highs near the boundary line, resulting in bearish divergence with the rising SPX trend. This warns of an early reversal before reaching the most immediate resistance level as trend momentum declines.

On the flip side, a downside move in SPX could test the 50% retracement at $0.92. 

DEXE records a 10% recovery on Wednesday, following a 32% crash on Monday, which resulted in a massive bearish candle on the daily chart. At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $9.70, taking a breather with over 1.50% pullback in the day. 

The failed trendline breakout in DEXE took a downside reversal from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $14.02. Further up, the RSI indicator drops to the oversold zone and hovers near the boundary line with the short-term recovery. 

Thus, the short-term recovery in DEXE fails to change the bearish narrative influenced by the recent crash and warns of a steeper decline to the next support level at $7.33.

On the upside, a potential uptrend could retest the broken support floor at $12.15.

CAKE is up over 3% in the last 24 hours at press time amid the Coinbase announcement of adding PancakeSwap to the asset roadmap after Ethena this week. While the trading date is yet to be confirmed, heightened sentiments are likely to fuel the uptrend if the market stabilizes. 



At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $2.46 with an over 1.50% jump in the day. The price action shows an upside turnaround from the weekly low at $2.21 on Saturday from a long-standing support trendline (formed by connecting the lows on March 11, April 6, and May 4). An upside continuation could challenge the $2.82 resistance level that has resulted in four bearish turnarounds so far in 2025.

On the flip side, a crucial support for the altcoin remains the 200-day EMA at $2.20, moving close to the support trendline.

Sui extends losses, targeting areas below the $3.00 support after a 26% plunge from recent highs. The steady DeFi TVL at $1.75 billion suggests that investor confidence in the ecosystem remains intact despite the recent price decline.

Bitcoin pulls back under $105,000 as the cryptocurrency market generally consolidates. Bullish sentiment takes a step back amid fading retail demand in the past weeks.

Dogecoin price hovers above a crucial support level as technical indicators signal an increasing bearish momentum. Shiba Inu risks dropping under the $0.00001266 support floor, warning of a potential near double-digit fall. 

Bitcoin edges lower to near $104,600 at the time of writing on Thursday, while Ethereum and Ripple's experience a decline in bullish momentum. BTC and XRP approach a crossroads at crucial support levels, while Ethereum is in consolidation, risking a bearish release of momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is stabilizing around $106,000 on Friday, following three consecutive days of correction that have resulted in a near 3% decline so far this week. The correction in BTC prices was further supported by the profit-taking activity of its holders, which has reached a three-month high.

Bitcoin and other altcoins continued their downward trend on Thursday as the recent bullish momentum faded.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Some of the top laggards were altcoins like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), Jupiter (JUP), and Ethena (ENA).

Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said:

“After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.”

Ryan added that the ongoing geopolitical developments like trade tensions from the US had contributed to market uncertainty and triggered a risk-off sentiment. He added that:

“While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. Investor sentiment is being recalibrated in response to these developments.”

Historically, Bitcoin tends to pull back after reaching a key resistance level, often triggering a broader correction across altcoins. For example, BTC hit a record high of $108,335 in December before retreating to $88,987 in January. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month.

Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound. On the daily chart, BTC is gradually forming a bullish flag pattern — characterized by a steep vertical rally (the flagpole) followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel (the flag). This setup is typically viewed as a continuation pattern.

Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the recent pullback forming the handle section. The cup features a depth of approximately 30%, or 34,000 points.

Using standard technical analysis, the target for a cup-and-handle breakout is calculated by adding the cup's depth to its upper boundary. In this case, adding $38,000 to the top of the pattern yields a projected target of $146,000.

""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” Satoshi Nakamoto's 2009 white paper outlining the concept of a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment system alternative to the traditional financial system, was hardly an overnight success.

Yes, while the document gave way to Bitcoin's launch later that year, it wasn't until 2010 that Bitcoin was first used for a real life transaction. However, in the years that followed, Bitcoin's usage as a payment method, as well as use cases for crypto and blockchain technology, grew exponentially. 

In a recent interview, Binance CEO Richard Teng reflected on how much crypto has evolved, noting that “Fifteen years ago, crypto was about buying a pizza. Today, it's about building robust payment systems, stablecoins, and real-life use cases that change lives.”

The evolution of crypto is far from over, as developers and other innovators continue to expand and enhance the blockchain infrastructure. Adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies also continues to grow as well.

Initially, Bitcoin's user base skewed toward the tech savvy, particularly among the tech savvy whose political philosophy matched up well with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.

However, as the 2010s progressed, crypto's user base began to steadily widen. The reasons for this are many fold. For one, access, availability, and education about cryptocurrencies increased significantly during this time frame. The rise of user-friendly crypto exchanges like Binance played a major role with this factor.

The community of active cryptocurrency users also expanded demographically during this time. Largely, due to crypto's strengths as an alternative to traditional banking services, particularly in countries where access to traditional banking remains limited.

Yet even as blockchain economy participants grew from just a handful at the onset, to hundreds of millions of users worldwide by 2020, by-and-large mainstream financial institutions and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines, due to the space's underdeveloped regulatory framework. It wasn't until starting last year, when regulatory clarity in markets like the U.S. and Europe, started to emerge. Once this happened, crypto made a full leap into the financial mainstream.

Crypto usage has come a long way from the famed pizza order that first demonstrated its real-world utility. Today, scores of large and small businesses worldwide accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Some countries, most notably El Salvador, have even officially made Bitcoin legal tender. As usability increases so has the value of Bitcoin at each Pizza Day.

Demand for the availability of crypto-based payment options among consumers continues to rise as well. With this, the number of retailers accepting crypto as a payment method is expected to increase dramatically going forward.

According to a recent survey from a major U.S.-based bank, while just under 15% of retailers accept crypto as a payment method, 75% of retailers noted that they plan to begin accepting either stablecoin and cryptocurrency payments within the next two years.

As individuals continue to adopt crypto- based payment methods for the first time, more and more people are discovering their everyday utility.

Based on a recent survey of Binance users, it's clear that using crypto for payments is far from a complex and cumbersome process. Take, for example, the experience of Sergio, a Mexican Binance user who detailed his experience using crypto for the first time to pay a restaurant bill. As Sergio noted, his usage of BNB as a payment method allowed him to see how “simple and practical” crypto can be as a payment method.

Dubai-based Codi reported a similar experience, when he used crypto to pay for a restaurant order while on vacation in Turkey. According to Codi, not only was his payment via stablecoin USDT “incredibly convenient;” the exchange rate using this method was more favorable than what his local bank offered.

In the case of Vietnamese crypto user Andy, we can see that not only are crypto-based payments anything but complicated, they can be a useful solution in a jam. If not for his crypto account, Andy wouldn't have been able to make an urgent cross-border payment.

As awareness of this “simple and practical” alternative continues to grow, the transformation from niche novelty to everyday utility will continue.

Programmable contract on blockchain

getty

While the spotlight in Web3 remains fixed on ETFs, token listings, and stablecoin frameworks, a quieter but equally consequential evolution is taking shape at the edge of global commerce. In the last six months alone, the Bank for International Settlements expanded its cross-border wholesale CBDC pilot, Project mBridge, to include over 26 observing members. Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore extended Project Guardian, testing tokenized trade finance and digital asset settlement with banks including JPMorgan, DBS, and Standard Chartered. Hong Kong Monetary Authority also launched Project Ensemble to develop innovative financial market infrastructure enabling seamless interbank settlement of tokenised money, initially focusing on tokenised deposits to support the growth of Hong Kong's tokenisation market.

On the protocol side, DeFi-native projects like Centrifuge are tokenizing invoices and short-term credit, while firms like Enclave Markets are developing encrypted execution environments for confidential trading. These aren't isolated experiments - they're signs of a maturing thesis: that programmable finance can redefine the foundations of international trade.

Today's trade infrastructure is a patchwork of legal fictions and trust intermediaries - letters of credit, bills of lading, third-party guarantees - many of which exist solely to simulate trust. Each one adds friction, cost, and settlement lag. Blockchain-based systems flip that dynamic by anchoring records on cryptographically secure, shared ledgers.

This is more than just a technical upgrade. As David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, puts it: “When counterparties from different jurisdictions can rely on cryptographically secured records rather than opaque intermediaries, the trust barrier that typically adds friction and cost to international trade diminishes significantly.” He adds that, “At Enclave, we use secure enclave technology to enable privacy-preserving verification. This means counterparties can validate critical deal terms or performance metrics without exposing sensitive business data. It's a foundational shift - you get transparency and confidentiality at the same time, something legacy systems just aren't built for.”

Where platforms like the now-defunct TradeLens stumbled due to governance limitations, decentralized or privacy-preserving infrastructure offers an alternative. Enclave, for instance, uses secure enclave hardware to enable private yet verifiable trades - part of a broader movement that includes confidential computing platforms and zero-knowledge middleware.

Beyond data transparency, programmable finance introduces automatic enforceability. Smart contracts don't just log terms - they execute them. When conditions are met (e.g., delivery confirmed via oracle or IoT sensor), payment flows instantly. If conditions fail, penalties or reversions execute without legal intervention.

This mechanism is already live in parts of the DeFi world. MakerDAO and Centrifuge have deployed real-world asset vaults tied to tokenized invoices and short-term credit. As reported, Maker's RWA vaults now account for a significant share of its fee income.

Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare, frames it this way: “Banks shift from paperwork gatekeepers to liquidity nodes, and insurers underwrite only risks the code can't cover.” He continues: “In our real estate tokenization work, we've shown how anchoring legal agreements - like mortgage registration or loan collateralization - on-chain creates enforceable economic rights that are provable in real time. This reduces the need for buffer escrows and limits disputes. When you apply this to cargo or trade finance, it's easy to imagine similar benefits.” His company recently completed one of the first legally notarized tokenized real estate deals tied to a national land registry - a model that could extend to warehousing, shipping hubs, and other trade-linked assets.

The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has also launched the MENA region's first government-backed tokenized real estate platform, Prypco Mint, which enables fractional ownership of Dubai properties by minting real estate title deed tokens. This is supported by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), marking the first time a government real estate authority in the Middle East has implemented a public blockchain-based tokenization of property title deeds, pioneering a more accessible, transparent, and efficient real estate market.

Perhaps the most profound shift is this: trade agreements, once enshrined in legalese and negotiated by diplomats, are now being expressed as code.

Project mBridge envisions programmable cross-border CBDC rails. MAS' Project Guardian is piloting asset tokenization and real-time DvP with institutional players. And emerging trade finance platforms are layering compliance, risk, and audit rules into smart contracts rather than spreadsheets.

This isn't hypothetical. “We're already seeing smart contracts do things that used to take banks days or weeks to handle,” says Nicolas Vaiman, CEO of Bubblemaps. “Instant escrow, peer-to-peer lending, collateral management. The technology simply offers more. And we're just scratching the surface - as more data sources and real-time proofs come online, I think blockchain-based finance will become the default operating system for trade, not an optional enhancement.”

The results: fewer intermediaries, faster time to cash, and real-time visibility across jurisdictions.

For decades, the global trade system relied on institutional credibility: the issuing bank, the national regulator, the trusted auditor. But programmable finance rewires that system to depend on logic, not legacy.

To be clear, this transition is still in its early innings. Regulatory coordination, technical standards, and enterprise integration remain uphill challenges. But the pieces are aligning: on-chain attestation, tokenized RWAs, fiat-backed stablecoins, and decentralized identity protocols are rapidly evolving into an interoperable trust stack.

The result isn't just digitized trade. It's a new form of enforceable, exportable trust—written in code, and verified on-chain.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

...

The year was 2020. During an unprecedented time, the sports card market saw an unexpected rise. As the hobby adapted to a changing world, NFTs began to thrive. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain that verify ownership and authenticity—essentially, a way to prove that a digital item is truly one-of-a-kind. Between January and July 2020, five digital sports cards sold for $36,000 or more. The highest? A Kobe Bryant 1/1 Logoman NFT. Coming in second? A Zion Williamson 1/1 Logoman RPA—oof.

Unlike traditional digital files, NFTs can't be duplicated in a meaningful way—even if someone takes a screenshot, they don't own the underlying asset. At the time, the concept was still new to many, often met with skepticism and confusion. Questions like, “If I screenshot your NFT, doesn't that make it mine?” were common.

But as the world began returning to normal, the hype seemed to fade. While not disappearing entirely, sports card NFTs quickly became more of an afterthought than the next big thing.

Fast forward to March 2025, and the sports card NFT market seems to have a pulse—one that's gone largely unnoticed by most. Panini, a major player in the trading card world, now runs a blockchain-based NFT marketplace featuring exclusive digital pack drops. Collectors can buy, rip, and resell cards instantly on the platform.

Each week, Panini highlights the top five sales—and the numbers might surprise you. Topping the list this week? A LeBron James Gold Prizm /10 that sold for a staggering $27,750. In fact, three of the top five NFT sales were LeBron cards, totaling nearly $40,000 combined. The other two? A Victor Wembanyama Gold Kaboom /10 that went for $6,000 and a Jayden Daniels Gold Kaboom /10 that sold for $3,500.

Just this morning, Panini launched its 2024 Obsidian Football digital packs—and they sold out within minutes. The rapid sellout has sparked debate once again: is this just another hype-driven fad, or is the digital card space here to stay?

These Obsidian packs are loaded with sought-after case hits like Kabooms, Colorblasts, Stained Glass, Downtowns, and more. Many of these rare pulls have already started hitting the NFT marketplace. A Caleb Williams Green Horizontal Kaboom 1/1 recently sold for $3,500, while a Jayden Daniels Blue Obsidian Rookie /25 went for $175, and a Brock Bowers Kaboom /25 changed hands for just $60.

As the dust settles, it'll be interesting to see how these exclusive digital cards are valued over time. The bigger question looms: is this surge in digital pack demand a healthy evolution of the hobby—or just another flash-in-the-pan get-rich-quick scheme?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Jeff Davis: from color as theory to generative art with NFTs","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/06/05/jeff-davis-from-color-as-theory-to-generative-art-with-nfts/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:46:16 GMT","

From traditional painting to NFTs, the American artist Jeff Davis has built a path that combines mathematical rigor, code, and color. An evolution that has made him a key figure in the world of cryptoart.

Summary

Jeff Davis's journey has deep academic roots. After studying at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, he came into contact with the theories of Josef Albers, particularly through the famous Interaction of Color. This analytical approach to color, based on relative perception and systemic composition, has had a lasting impact on his art.

Davis delved into various color systems — such as Munsell and Ostwald — and began experimenting with the use of color intervals, meaning homogeneous visual transitions between two shades. Color, for him, was never decoration, but the supporting structure of the work.

In his first artistic phase, Davis worked on forms inspired by architecture: linear structures that evoke doors, windows, and walls. These elements did not have a representative function but served as geometric spaces within which to explore color.

The approach was extremely precise: the works were designed digitally, but then created by hand, with adhesive tape and acrylic paint. Each color gradation was studied to achieve harmonies and contrasts consistent with the theoretical schemes studied at an academic level.

With the advancement of printing technology in the early 2000s, Davis began producing his works directly as digital prints. This transition marked a turning point: the computer was no longer just a design tool, but the main expressive medium.

Using graphic software, he could calculate with extreme precision the chromatic intervals and create complex harmonies, such as those between complementary colors or the two-dimensional scales, with transitions on the X and Y axes. Each work was the result of rational planning, where nothing was left to chance.

In 2009, Davis decided to explore a new dimension: that of generative art. 

Begin to study Processing, a visual programming language, and to write algorithms to generate one's own works. The goal is clear: introduce chance as an active part of the creative process, delegating some formal choices to the code.

This paradigm shift frees it from the constraints of representation and architecture. The works become pure algorithmic abstraction, built on rules, variables, and parameters. The color transforms from an aesthetic object to a dynamic system, calculable and modifiable in real time.

The real leap comes in 2019, when Jeff Davis discovers NFTs. Thanks to platforms like Art Blocks, the artist can finally combine his generative practice with a native digital form, which allows for the production of unique works at the moment of minting, directly from code.

NFTs represent for Davis the ideal framework for his art: they eliminate the limits of printing, physical space, and reproduction. Each collection can generate hundreds or thousands of variations, each unique but consistent with a well-defined aesthetic logic.

Davis also begins working with Bright Moments, a project that brings NFT art to physical galleries around the world. On these occasions, the artist introduces a new variable into his work: time. Thus, Culmination is born, a generative work in which the colors not only arrange themselves in space but slowly change over time, rotating along the color wheel.

It is the first time that Davis introduces animation into his work. The piece continuously transforms, creating fluid and immersive visual experiences, in which the viewer does not simply observe a painting, but witnesses an evolving process.

Jeff Davis is an artist who has managed to combine science and creativity, transforming color theory into a computational language. His journey, from manual painting to generative NFTs, represents a coherent and visionary evolution.

In the landscape of blockchain art, Davis is a reference figure for those who consider technology not just a means, but a new grammar of art. His research on color, form, and time paves the way for a future in which the algorithm is artist and the work is process.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Best Solana Presales to Buy as Pump.fun Launches ICO","https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/06/05/best-solana-presales-to-buy-as-pump-fun-launches-ico/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:53:39 GMT","

Pump.fun is reportedly launching a token sale aiming to raise $1 billion, although the timing has yet to be revealed.

The move has sent shockwaves through the Solana community and shone a light on the proven ICO launch method, which Pump.fun is expected to employ. As this Pump.fun saga unfolds, what are the best Solana presales to buy?

Pump.fun, the meme coin factory which has birthed over 11 million tokens and generated $600 million in revenue since 2024, is set to launch its own official cryptocurrency.

Insider sources told Blockworks that the project aims to raise $1 billion via a token offering, with a $4 billion token valuation.

The token will be sold to both public and private investors, and there are also expectations of an airdrop to Pump.fun users. The response to the news has been mixed.

For example, analyst Greeny believes that the lead-up to the $PUMP launch could see a slowdown in meme coin price growth, with the ICO absorbing a large portion of the market's liquidity.

However, he says that the post-launch environment will see meme coin prices rally and “favor longs.”

Hot take: most $SOL memecoins will struggle leading into $PUMP fun launch. Favour shorts.Pre sale liquidity will easy flow here as speculation. Post launch, I think we see liquidity be injected back into better memecoins. Favour longs.

While Greeny's outlook on the $PUMP launch is neutral to slightly positive, others have much higher hopes.

Founder of Decypher Podcast Jack Neiwold argues that, provided the $PUMP launch includes an airdrop, its $4 billion valuation is “very fair” considering its impressive revenue accrual.

As long as $PUMP also airdrops (Polymarket seems to think it will) alongside the token sale I think everyone will be happy$4b is very fair for a growth business that leads its category and does nearly $1b in revenue / year Trick is now generating wealth for the community

Meanwhile, crypcrypto7 presumes that the Pump.fun airdrop could amount to 10% of the total supply. Based on the $4 billion valuation, he calculates that this will return $400 million to Pump.fun users, which he suggests could help meme coin prices explode.

So if pumpfun airdrop 10% of supply at 4bi valuationThey gonna give trenches $400MAlmost everything people tell they extracted Bullish $PUMP and trenches.

But the $PUMP launch isn't just a liquidity injection for the meme coin sector; it's a market-shaking event that will shine the spotlight on the Solana ecosystem once again. That could create a massive window of opportunity for other Solana presales to benefit.

But which ones could perform best?

Solaxy is building the first-ever Solana layer 2 blockchain. Solana sometimes faces congestion issues due to the substantial levels of demand it faces. 31% of non-vote transactions have failed in the past 24 hours due to congestion, per Dune Analytics data.

This isn't just an inconvenience; it can be costly. For example, a stop loss order failing to execute could cause a futures trade to continue falling below the planned exit price, leading to devastating losses.

Solana is capable of 6,500 transactions per second (TPS), but Solaxy will process 10,000 TPS, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable than Solana.

The project has raised $44 million to date, making it the largest-ever Solana presale. Indeed, if Pump.fun raises $1 billion, Solaxy will be the second-largest presale.

But what's interesting is that Solaxy also has its own meme coin launchpad called Igniter Protocol. This makes it a direct Pump.fun competitor, except with its own blockchain.

If Pump.fun is worth $4 billion, we could certainly see $SOLX rally far beyond its current valuation, considering its advantages. Visit Solaxy.

Snorter is building a multi-chain Telegram trading bot. It'll start on the Solana blockchain but also launch on Ethereum, Base, BSC, and Polygon.

Trading bots are a core part of any sophisticated meme coin trading strategy. But their utility goes well beyond sniping newly-graduated Pump.fun launches.

Snorter offers one of the most comprehensive feature lineups among all Telegram bots. In addition to automated token sniping, it boasts copy trading, honeypot and rugpull detection, dynamic stop losses, MEV-resistant swaps, and more.

It offers 0.85% fees, which is lower than Bonk Bonk, Maestro, Trojan, and Banana Gun.

Holding $SNORT provides benefits like governance rights, lower fees, and staking rewards. Currently, staking offers a 735% APY, but this will decrease as the staking pool grows.

The Snorter presale has raised $430K so far, leaving plenty of room for growth. Visit Snorter presale.

Seek Protocol is a new gaming token on the Solana blockchain that integrates augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR).

Its website leads with “transform your surroundings into a playground of crypto airdrops, NFTs, AI companions, and immersive AR experiences.”

The project's core focus is its AR app, which is similar to Pokémon Go. Users can explore the real world, and they'll rack up crypto rewards as they advance. There are interactive quests, hidden treasures, and airdrops. It'll launch in autumn around the same time as the Solana Seeker phone.

Seek Protocol also features a tool called SeekAI, which enables users to integrate AI agents to automate tasks, enhance learning, and drive creativity.

With a use case that blends cryptocurrency rewards with AI and AR/VR technology, it's easy to see why Seek Protocol is one of the most promising Solana presales.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Trump's crypto ventures may be his most dangerous moneymaking scheme","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/trump-crypto-ventures-moneymaking-scheme","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:09:00 GMT","

The US president is leveraging his position for personal gain by exploiting an industry known for lack of transparency and fraud

Throughout his business career, Donald Trump sought new ways to leverage his name to make easy money. He ran an airline, a university and a winery. Thanks to The Apprentice show that made him a reality TV star, the US president slapped his name on real estate projects around the world built by other companies – along with Trump-branded steaks, vodka, deodorant and bottled water. Many of these businesses ultimately failed, but Trump rarely invested his own funds and he still walked away with hefty licensing fees.

Today, as the most powerful person in the world, Trump has found perhaps the easiest way to profit off his name: cryptocurrency. Days before his inauguration for a second term on 20 January, Trump's family business launched a meme coin, called $TRUMP, which is a type of digital currency often connected to an online joke or mascot. It has no inherent value beyond speculation. The coin quickly soared in value up to $75 per token, but it crashed days later. No matter the ultimate price, Trump and his family rake in millions of dollars in fees as the coin is traded by speculators hoping to turn a quick profit, or those trying to curry favor with him.

It's difficult to keep up with all the ways that Trump is corrupting the US presidency and using it for personal profit, but his crypto ventures are among the most dangerous because they potentially allow him and his family to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign investors and governments that would normally have a harder time funneling money to a US politician. Thanks to the meme coin and other deals, the Trump family's wealth increased by nearly $3bn in the last six months. Trump has proven himself the most successful president – at monetizing the presidency.

While he is exempt from conflict of interest laws that ban federal employees from profiting off their positions, every US president since the 1970s had voluntarily abided by these rules – until Trump. Previous occupants of the White House either sold their financial holdings or set them aside in blind trusts. But in his first term, Trump refused to divest from his business empire, which is mostly centered around the Trump Organization and is still managed by his sons.

Since Trump's first term, his family business has also evolved beyond a real estate conglomerate that licenses the Trump name to hotels, luxury towers and golf courses around the world, earning millions of dollars in branding and management fees without investing its own funds in most projects. The business now includes a portfolio of social media and crypto ventures, providing Trump with new ways to profit from being in office. And Trump is more emboldened to ignore norms set by past presidents, thanks to a compliant Congress led by Republicans and a US supreme court ruling last year which gave Trump “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president.

Trump's foray into cryptocurrency underscores the ways he can leverage the presidency for personal gain by exploiting his sense of impunity and an industry that is notorious for fraud and a lack of transparency. After the value of his meme coin collapsed, Trump's crypto venture announced in April that the 220 largest buyers of the token would be invited to a private gala dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club, while the top 25 buyers would get access to a VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour. Once that contest was underway, the $TRUMP coin got a new round of media attention and its value jumped by more than 50%. The more people bought the token, the more Trump and his family profited from crypto transactions that are usually shrouded in anonymity. Since the meme coin's launch in January, Trump-affiliated businesses received $312m from crypto sales and $43m in other fees, according to a Washington Post analysis of trading data.

Of course, US presidents for decades have used private dinners and gatherings to grant special access to wealthy donors and raise funds for their political parties or their own campaigns. But campaign contributions carry legal restrictions on how they can be spent, and US donors can't remain anonymous and must disclose all of their donations to political candidates. The sweepstakes dinner organized by Trump's crypto business was not a fundraiser or campaign event – it was a gathering arranged to directly enrich him and his family.

Beyond the inherent conflict of Trump doing business within an industry that he has immense power to regulate as president, Trump also opened himself up to foreign influence as his meme coins became a vehicle for foreign actors to funnel money to his family. While Trump's crypto business has refused to release a list of those invited to last month's dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, media organizations compiled lists of attendees that included foreign citizens who would normally be forbidden from donating funds to US politicians. (The Washington Post found that nearly half of the top 220 Trump meme coin holders purchased their coins from crypto exchanges that reject US-based customers, meaning they are likely foreign buyers. And 19 of the top 25 buyers, who were invited to a VIP reception with Trump before the dinner on 22 May, and a “special tour” the next day, had bought coins from similar exchanges.)

The best-known foreign investor who attended Trump's dinner was Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire who founded the crypto platform Tron and had spent more than $20m on the president's meme coins, earning him the distinction of being the contest's top buyer. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Joe Biden's administration, charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. But a few weeks after Trump took office, the SEC asked a federal court to pause its lawsuit.

What could be behind the SEC's change of heart about pursuing charges against Sun under the second Trump administration? Sun is one of the top investors in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture launched by Trump's family in September. After Trump won the November election, Sun bought $75m in World Liberty tokens, and he was named an adviser to the company.

World Liberty is at the heart of another foreign entanglement – and potential conflict of interest – for Trump and the crypto industry. On 1 May, the president's son Eric and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy), announced that an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi would invest $2bn using a stablecoin – a form of digital currency – offered by World Liberty. That transaction could eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the president and his family.

Years before he got into the business, Trump had dismissed cryptocurrencies as “a scam” which have values that are “based on thin air”. But Trump changed his tune dramatically when he met with the highest-paying customers of his personal meme coin at last month's dinner. “The past administration made your lives miserable,” Trump told his guests, referring to a Biden administration crackdown on crypto companies. And then the president promised to do things differently: “There is a lot of sense in crypto. A lot of common sense in crypto.”

Already, the Trump administration has been pushing to deregulate the industry and in April instructed the justice department to disband a unit that focused on investigating crypto-related fraud. Last year, a federal judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the now bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, to 25 years in prison for perpetuating one of the largest financial frauds in modern history, and bilking his customers out of billions of dollars.

Once Trump dismantles regulation and law enforcement of the industry, he has promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”. And the president will continue to enrich himself and his family along the way.

While the major parties in the U.S. Congress agree on very little these days, there's one issue that's getting traction: stablecoins. Politicians on both sides of the aisle want to accelerate the development of stablecoins to support the U.S. dollar's reign as the world's reserve currency.

Unlike speculative assets that fluctuate in value, stablecoins are designed to always be worth $1, hence the name. Stablecoins have the potential to fix problems in the U.S. payments system, but the debate about their use is only happening in the context of cryptocurrency policy and alleged conflicts of interest within the family of President Donald Trump. Major crypto boosters, with the support of the Trump administration, are making a full court press to change U.S. law to create national charters to issue stablecoins.

Unlike speculative assets that fluctuate in value, stablecoins are designed to always be worth $1, hence the name. Stablecoins have the potential to fix problems in the U.S. payments system, but the debate about their use is only happening in the context of cryptocurrency policy and alleged conflicts of interest within the family of President Donald Trump. Major crypto boosters, with the support of the Trump administration, are making a full court press to change U.S. law to create national charters to issue stablecoins.

If stablecoins scale to a multitrillion-dollar market—as these boosters hope for—then this could widen the trade deficit, harm small enterprises, hand more power to Big Tech conglomerates, and reduce leverage for the United States and its allies when it comes to global security.

Discussion of stablecoins is often lumped in with crypto markets, where they are most frequently used today. But they have a range of uses in both the brick-and-mortar and digital economies. They could help to create a new set of faster payment rails, making transactions more instantaneous.

Retailers are already looking to sidestep the steep fees charged by monopolistic networks by embracing new ways to pay. Digital dollars could complement “pay-by-bank” tools and other innovations. And if stablecoins prove to be a cheaper and faster way to move funds, then they could help the greenback maintain its dominance.

Stablecoins aren't issued by the U.S. Treasury or the Federal Reserve, though a stablecoin issuer—such as a Big Tech firm or a retail giant—could tender digital money in exchange for real money. Pending legislation, however, would allow these digital dollars to sit outside of the banking system, and that's where some of the problems kick in.

When we put money in a bank, that bank doesn't keep it in a vault. The bank lends the money to businesses, homebuyers, farmers, and others. Those depositors have confidence that they can access their cash, since banks can pledge loans on their books to get cash from the Federal Reserve at any time. If the bank fails, federal deposit insurance kicks in, and depositors get their money back as long as the amount falls within the legal limits (which are, by the way, overdue for an increase ).

The so-called GENIUS Act for stablecoins won't make issuers pay for deposit insurance. It would create a totally different scheme. Unlike banks, issuer wouldn't make traditional loans with the funds that they collect. Instead, they would back the stablecoin with liquid assets such as Treasury securities, offshore dollars, and money market fund assets.

A major stablecoin issuer today has roughly $120 billion in exposure to Treasurys. These purchases of U.S. government debt appear to be part of the Trump administration's push for stablecoins. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes that stablecoins could attract $2 trillion of new demand for U.S. government debt securities, which could finance deficit spending. But where will the trillions of dollars in new demand for Treasurys come from?

Some of these trillions will come from overseas. With the majority of global trade denominated in U.S. dollars, trading partners could certainly increase the volume of payments made via stablecoin. But if this truly generates new demand from foreign investors, then this would bid up the value of the dollar—which seems to be the opposite of what the administration wants. After all, a stronger dollar would make U.S.-made goods less competitive to export, resulting in even bigger trade deficits.

Much of this demand would probably come from within the United States as well. But that still poses problems. American households and businesses would move cash out of banks and into digital dollars issued by firms that aren't banks. If the deposit outflow from banks is substantial, then this would make it tougher for the domestic businesses that rely on bank loans.

While large corporations have an array of options to borrow, local and regional businesses—and farms—largely borrow from banks. With fewer deposits to transform into loans, that would push up the cost of credit for these businesses. (Many of these businesses are the same ones scrambling to access cash to stock up on inventory before tariffs fully kick in.)

Of course, all of this would be a boon for the United States' Big Tech giants, which have long been jealous of their Chinese counterparts' foothold in digital payments and have been pushing to issue digital currency in the United States. Chinese companies WeChat Pay and Alipay have a window into a massive share of retail purchases in the Chinese economy.

Google and Apple, meanwhile, have already penetrated much of the U.S. digital payments market. The Justice Department is currently battling Apple in court over allegations of anticompetitive abuses regarding its Apple Pay service. But issuing their own currency would allow the tech companies to control their money directly, giving them further power to steer business to partners and advertisers and even allow them to dynamically price a product based on user surveillance data.

There are other consequences, too. If Congress weakens requirements for nonbank firms dealing in stablecoins to detect terrorism financing and money laundering, that weakens global security. After the invasion of Ukraine, Washington and its allies deployed a series of sanctions, but if these sanctions become less effective, then the United States' alliances will lose leverage and make Washington more likely to deploy noneconomic weapons.

For consumers, it's even trickier. Trump administration officials are also pushing to stimulate demand for longer-term Treasury notes and bonds. But unlike short-term Treasury debt, if these longer-term Treasurys decline in value, then that could spark a panic or run—as we saw with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023.

Without deposit insurance, consumers may need to battle through bankruptcy proceedings to get any of their money back. Or more likely, because it may be difficult to distinguish between their insured bank balances and their uninsured digital dollars, the Federal Reserve could pull the trigger on yet another bailout—a routine occurrence when it comes to money market funds, another deposit-like account that exists outside the insured banking system.

In 2019, Facebook proposed the creation of a new global currency, Libra, to operate on its platforms and with its partners. Libra was scrapped, but something like it may soon emerge. At the time, Trump tweeted that if Facebook or other companies wanted to do this, they should get a bank charter and follow banking laws. Maybe he had the right answer all along.

Rather than having digital dollars issued by massive technology conglomerates and retail chains, it's wiser to develop stablecoins through banks. This would mitigate the risks of panics and unexpected devaluation while ensuring that funds can be lent out for home construction, small business expansion, and other uses. Of course, banks that are already too big to fail shouldn't get even bigger, but small and midsize banks could grow their deposits by embracing new forms of payments such as stablecoins.

While it's tempting to think that the issuance of dollar-denominated stablecoins is a niche policy matter regarding crypto, it isn't. The consequences for the trading and financial system, the global sanctions regime, the role of Big Tech, and the dollar's power as a reserve currency can't be overlooked.

 Donald Trump's crypto agenda claims to champion financial freedom, but in reality, it consolidates power among political elites and wealthy investors, sidelining everyday users. 

Opinion by: Elias Vilochkin, chief product officer of ChangeNOW

Bitcoin optimism is naturally running high. US President Donald Trump's trade agreement with the UK has provided a jolt of confidence in global markets, and Bitcoin (BTC), as the ultimate borderless asset, is reaping the benefits.

Unfolding behind the Trump administration's aggressive push to deregulate the crypto industry, however, is a consolidation of power that favors the few while ignoring the many.

Cryptocurrency was designed for the everyday person — those who had had enough of opaque financial systems that prioritize profit over the interest of the people. Bitcoin emerged from the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis as a radical experiment in financial sovereignty, not an exercise in empowering hedge funds and political elites. 

That's exactly what's happening. Trump's administration has taken steps to rapidly deregulate the industry behind a crypto-friendly agenda. His family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, is a clear example. With direct ties to Trump's sons, WLF launched its own stablecoin and digital tokens just as the administration began loosening oversight. At the same time, the Department of Justice disbanded its national cryptocurrency enforcement team, scrapping investigations that once targeted money laundering and fraud.

Watchdogs and critics are raising alarms about conflicts of interest. Trump's public enthusiasm for digital currencies is a business strategy. His administration's aggressive deregulation benefits WLF and others like it, insulating them from scrutiny while they expand their financial reach.

What's worse is the politicization of crypto itself. Coins linked to political figures, like Trump, are flooding the market. The rally around these so-called “politico-coins” concerns loyalty and influence. There's growing concern that political actors leverage crypto to build new forms of centralized influence.

Trump's administration has painted itself as the great liberator of blockchain, but the final result looks more like capitalism, with the promise of financial empowerment being overshadowed by speculative gains. World Liberty Financial, flush with new capital, charges ahead while everyday investors are left navigating a landscape designed to keep them at a disadvantage. Everyone is receiving the message that financial freedom is for sale — but only if you're in the right circle.

This isn't the financial revolution crypto promised. It's a rerun of the same old game: The powerful get richer, the regulators turn a blind eye, and the rest of us are left holding the bag. 

It's time for the unbanked, the underrepresented and those who have been failed by traditional finance to get their voice heard. We must strip away the political branding and return to the core mission of providing real financial access to those most in need.

That means showing people how crypto can help them in their daily lives instead of only talking about it conceptually as an investment. It looks like sending money home to family without losing 20% to remittance fees or saving in stable digital dollars when your local currency is crashing. 

Trump's take on crypto talks a big game about freedom, but underneath it, you'll find the same old power structures at play. If crypto is ever going to live up to its potential, the community has to get back to what it set out to do in the first place: Break the mold, not reinforce it.

The parents of the man allegedly held captive and tortured by crypto bros in Manhattan got regular updates saying he was OK, The Post has learned.

Italian national Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, was allegedly held from May 6 to 23 in a luxury apartment on Prince Street for by John Woeltz and William Duplessie, who stand charged with tying up Carturan and torturing him for his digital wallet containing an estimated $28m in digital currency, according to cops.

However, sources in Italy say through the apparent kidnap “Michael's phone and his parents exchanged messages on WhatsApp,” although sources pointed out it was possible the alleged kidnappers had been sending the messages so as not to raise the alarm.

Carturan's reclusive parents, Maurizio and Lidia, only learned of the kidnap on May 25 when a family friend, Pietro Zucchetti, informed them, according to sources.

However, the family were seemingly on high alert and had recently hired private security, according to a source, who also said they had put their $1m home in Rivoli, near Turin, up for sale.

New York prosecutors have also said they believe the lives of Carturan's family in Italy had been threatened during the kidnapping period.

Maurizio confirmed to Italian newspaper La Repubblica he had recieved texts he assumed were from his son through the ‘kidnap' period.  

A neighbor told The Post Carturan has recently started travelling around the world a lot, although they said they had no idea what line of business he was in.

Carturan had previously worked on Zucchetti's farm, and he described him as a “curious young man, not one to seek out trouble.”

Videos which show Carturan seemingly partaking in parties at the house and talking about drugs were published this week by TMZ, although in some videos he appears to be restrained to a wheelchair or led by a leash around his neck. Reports also say he was monitored with an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he didn't leave the house.

No missing person report was filed by Carturan's family, who were shocked when they found out what had happened to him and immediately went to ground. They declined approaches for comment from The Post.

Carturan's father Maurizio – an author who has written 10 books about alchemy and spirituality – deleted all of his social media accounts and closed the family's shop selling herbal remedies.

The parents then traveled to New York, where they met with the Italian Consul General in New York. His deputy took them to see Carturan at the local District Attorney's Office, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Post.

The Italian Consul General said it is working with US authorities in the case and assisting them in matters of the Carturan family.

Carturan escaped from the alleged ordeal on May 23 and flagged down a nearby traffic cop. He was taken to hospital, where he was treated for injuries sustained from allegedly being pistol-whipped, dangled from the top of a staircase, urinated on and having his arms and legs cut with a chainsaw. Woeltz was arrested the same day, Duplessie a few days later.

Woeltz, dubbed the Crypto King of Kentucky, is said to have a private jet and live a high octane party lifestyle alongside Duplessie.

They are both held in custody on charges including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault and weapons possession.

At Duplessie's arraignment last week his lawyer claimed the criminal case will “begin to unravel” as more details come out.

“The facts here are hotly disputed, his involvement is hotly disputed,” attorney Sanford Talkin told the judge during the hearing.

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he's ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine's most fraught ideas.

In a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an “embryo editing” effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.

“I think the time is right for the defining company in the US to be built in this area,” Armstrong posted. 

The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 birth of the world's first genetically edited children in China—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.

According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos.

That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. Earlier methods, on the other hand, actually cut the double helix, damaging it and causing whole genes to disappear. “We know much better now what to do,” says Egli. “It doesn't mean the work is all done, but it's a very different game now—entirely different.”  

Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. While it's legal to study embryos in the lab, actually producing a gene-edited baby is flatly illegal in most countries.  

In the US, the CRISPR baby ban operates via a law that forbids the Food and Drug Administration from considering, or even acknowledging, any application it gets to attempt a gene-edited baby. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique—or perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it.

In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby's genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos.  

Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn't fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli's and one at the Oregon Health & Science University.

The creator of CRISPR babies is flirting again with infamy, this time through a mysterious alliance with an Internet-savvy entrepreneur.

Those efforts have operated on a shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. Researchers at those centers said they support the idea of a well-financed company that could advance the technology. “We would honestly welcome that,” says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health & Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 

“More research is needed, and that takes people and money,” she says, adding that she doesn't mind if it comes from “tech bros.”

Editing embryos can, in theory, be used to correct genetic errors likely to cause serious childhood conditions. But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary.

Instead, it's easy to conclude that the bigger market for the technology would be to intervene in embryos in ways that could make humans resistant to common conditions, such as heart disease or Alzheimer's. But that is more controversial because it's a type of enhancement, and the changes would also be passed through the generations.

Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded a 10-year moratorium on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and “introduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.”

They said the ability to “program” desired traits or eliminate bad ones risked a new form of “eugenics,” one that would have the effect of “potentially altering the course of evolution.”

Armstrong did not reply to an email from MIT Technology Review seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by Forbes.

The billionaire is already part of a wave of tech entrepreneurs who've made a splash in science and biology by laying down outsize investments, sometimes in far-out ideas. Armstrong previously cofounded New Limit, which Bloomberg calls a “life extension venture” and which this year raised a further $130 million to explore methods to reprogram old cells into an embryonic-like state.

He started that company with Blake Byers, an investor who has said a significant portion of global GDP should be spent on “immortality” research, including biotech approaches and ways of uploading human minds to computers.

Then, starting late last year, Armstrong began publicly telegraphing his interest in exploring a new venture, this time connected to assisted reproduction. In December, he announced on X that he and Byers were ready to meet with entrepreneurs working on “artificial wombs,” “embryo editing,” and “next-gen IVF.”

The post invited people to apply to attend an off-the-record dinner—a kind of forbidden-technologies soiree. Applicants had to fill in a Google form answering a few questions, including “What is something awesome you've built?”

CRISPR will get easier and easier to administer. What does that mean for the future of our species?

Among those who attended the dinner was a postdoctoral fellow from Egli's lab, Stepan Jerabek, who has been testing base-editing in embryos. Another attendee, Lucas Harrington, is a gene-editing scientist who trained at the University of California, Berkeley under Jennifer Doudna, a winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for development of CRISPR gene editing. Harrington says a venture group he helps run, called SciFounders, is also considering starting an embryo-editing company.

“We share an interest in there being a company to empirically evaluate whether embryo editing can be done safely, and are actively exploring incubating a company to undertake this,” Harrington said in an email. “We believe there need to be legitimate scientists and clinicians working to safely evaluate this technology.”

Because of how rapidly gene editing is advancing, Harrington has also criticized bans and moratoria on the technology. These can't stop it from being applied but, he says, can drive it into “the shadows,” where it might be used less safely. According to Harrington, “several biohacker groups have quietly raised small amounts of capital” to pursue the technology.

By contrast, Armstrong's public declaration on X represents a more transparent approach. “It seems pretty serious now. They want to put something together,” says Egli, who hopes the Coinbase CEO might fund some research at his lab. “I think it's very good he posted publicly, because you can feel the temperature, see what reaction you get, and you stimulate the public conversation.”

The first reports that researchers were testing CRISPR on human embryos in the lab emerged from China in 2015, causing shock waves as it became clear how easy, in theory, it was to change human heredity. Two years later, in 2017, a report from Oregon claimed successful correction of a dangerous DNA mutation present in lab embryos made from patients' egg and sperm cells.

But that breakthrough was not what it seemed. More careful testing by Egli and others showed that CRISPR technology actually can cause havoc in a cell, often deleting large chunks of chromosomes. That's in addition to mosaicism, in which edits occur differently in different cells. What looked at first like precise DNA editing was in fact a dangerous process causing unseen damage.

While the public debate turned on the ethics of CRISPR babies—especially after three edited children were born in China—researchers were discussing basic scientific problems and how to solve them.

Since then, both US labs, as well as some in China, have switched to base editing. That method causes fewer unexpected effects and, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change.

Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it's done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change.

“You fix the text before you print the book,” says Egli. “It seems like a no-brainer.”

Still, gene editing isn't quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong's company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out.

“You would have to optimize something to a point where it is perfect, to where it's a breeze,” says Egli. “This is the kind of work that companies do."" 

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

Montana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA.

                    Magic Eden used an image of Trump holding up his fist that Trump himself has used to promote his $TRUMP crypto on January 18 [File]

As U.S. President Donald Trump leans more heavily into the crypto sector, his name is being used to promote several crypto projects that have nothing to do with his own ventures, prompting confusion among users and making them more vulnerable to being scammed.

Trump's son Eric Trump on Wednesday (June 4, 2025) used his X account to call out a project that was not affiliated with the official World Liberty Financial crypto project that Trump had previously endorsed.

The project in question, Magic Eden, was using images of Trump and the $TRUMP crypto ticker in order to rally up hype around an upcoming crypto wallet that it claimed was “official.” 

Magic Eden used an image of Trump holding up his fist that Trump himself has used to promote his $TRUMP crypto on January 18, which led to user confusion.

Trump's son stated, “This project is not authorized by @Trump. @MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.”

Many X users in the comments expressed their confusion as they tried to differentiate between the $TRUMP crypto endorsed by the president and the version that Eric Trump had cautioned against. Others were not clear as to the links between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto project working on a stablecoin, and the $TRUMP meme token.

Magic Eden is a trading platform with more than 800,000 followers on X. The account bio noted that its posts were “not intended for US or UK audiences.”

Trump's promotion of crypto, and especially his own meme token, has made him the subject of criticism and concern as legal experts point out potential conflicts of interest. However, the U.S. crypto community has largely welcomed Trump's stance, hoping that his return to the White House will signal looser crypto regulations for businesses.

U.S. President Donald Trump's social media company, Truth Social, is wasting no time in trying to launch a spot bitcoin BTC$103,430.12 exchange-traded fund (ETF).



Crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, who is sponsoring the fund, filed an S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, just two days after filing a 19b-4 document.



Typically, issuers upload the S-1, a document used to register an offering of asset-backed securities, first. The listing exchange then files a 19b-4 — necessary to propose a rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO), after. But NYSE Arca, an arm of the New York Stock Exchange, uploaded documents before Truth Social filed its own paperwork.



While the reasons are unclear, the 19-b4 filing ties the SEC to a strict deadline of 240 days to approve or reject the filing, while the agency doesn't have to adhere to a deadline when an S-1 is filed.



If approved and listed, Trump's bitcoin ETF would trade under the name Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with its assets being custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, which also serves as the custodian for Crypto.com's assets.

The fund would join a long list of already existing spot bitcoin ETFs, including from issuers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and more. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with nearly $70 billion in assets since launch.

El Salvador and the United States are looking to ramp up their crypto partnership.

Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House's Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday.

“The aspiring Bitcoin Superpower came to meet with the OG Bitcoin Country to discuss areas of mutual interest and possible collaboration relating to bitcoin, stablecoins and digital assets,” Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador's Bitcoin Office, told CoinDesk.

“Over the coming months, I believe we will see some extraordinary things happen for both partners as a result of this meeting,” she added, without elaborating further.

Hines is an important player in Washington when it comes to crypto policy, working alongside David Sacks, who chairs the crypto council and took on the role of AI and crypto czar.

The two countries have gotten closer since U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Bukele was welcomed by Trump at the White House in April, where they discussed security agreements. El Salvador has agreed to take custody of some of the illegal immigrants deported by the U.S. in the country's maximum security mega-prison, CECOT, built in 2022 as part of the government's crackdown on violent gangs.

El Salvador's crypto regulation agency, the National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), has also already met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of establishing a cross-border regulatory sandbox. The idea, according to CNAD President Juan Carlos Reyes, is for the U.S. to take advantage of El Salvador's experience in regulating digital assets to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for its own framework.

Crypto traders holding XRP XRP$2.18 and dogecoin DOGE$0.18083 can now tap into yield-generating decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities on Base, the layer-2 blockchain from digital assets exchange Coinbase (COIN).

On Wednesday, the Nasdaq-listed exchange said the wrapped versions of the two tokens, called cbXRP and cbDOGE, were live on Base. These wrapped tokens are backed 1:1 by native coins, meaning that for all cbXRP and cbDOGE in circulation, there is an equivalent amount of XRP or dogecoin held in a secure custody solution by Coinbase.

Wrapped tokens represent the original assets in environments where they are otherwise unavailable, offering compatibility with Base's protocol and DeFi applications. This facilitates interoperability, allowing for the seamless transfer of coins within the ecosystem while allowing holders to tap into DeFi and generate additional returns on top of their spot market holdings.

The wrapped version of XRP has achieved a market cap of over $5 million within the first 24 hours, according to data source BaseScan. Wrapped DOGE's market cap is fast nearing the $2 million mark.

XRP is a payments-focused cryptocurrency used by Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions and has a market cap of $128.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Dogecoin, with a market value of $28.2 billion, is the world's leading meme token by market value, CoinDesk data show. 

Coinbase debuted a wrapped version of bitcoin BTC$103,430.12, the largest cryptocurrency, on Base in September last year. That has reached a market cap of over $4.7 billion.

 A Bitcoin miner secured a $330,000 block reward despite network difficulty surging to a record 126.98 trillion. 

A solo Bitcoin miner successfully mined block 899,826, earning a reward worth $330,386, a rare feat amid record-high network difficulty.

According to mempool.space data, the block was confirmed at 3:48 am UTC on June 5 and included 3,680 transactions. The miner, operating under the Solo CK pool, collected a subsidy of 3.125 Bitcoin (BTC) plus an additional 0.026 BTC in fees.

The average fee per transaction in block 899,826 was around $0.29, with a median fee rate of around 2 satoshis per virtual byte (sat/vB), suggesting relatively light network congestion at the time.

In a June 5 post on X, Con Kolivas, a software engineer and administrator of the solo mining pool ckpool, said the miner who won the Bitcoin block recently ramped up their hashrate to 259 petahashes per second (PH/s), which is unusually large.

Based on the fact that only one worker (mining device identity) was connected, he said this was almost certainly a rented hashrate — likely from a cloud or marketplace service — temporarily pointed at the pool to try to win a block.

He said the account had been mining on CKPool, but normally it had a much lower hashrate. Therefore, the big hashrate was probably a short-term rental used to “take a shot” at scoring a block reward.

On June 1, Bitcoin's mining difficulty hit a new all-time high of 126.98 trillion, according to data from Blockchain.com. The surge in difficulty reflects rising competition among miners and increasing network security. 

The mining difficulty is adjusted every 2,016 blocks and is driven by the network hashrate, which measures the total computational power dedicated to securing the network. 

With current difficulty levels, the chances of an individual miner successfully solving a block are minuscule. As Bitcoin's difficulty continues to increase, such solo wins will likely become even rarer, adding further intrigue when they occur.

The recent solo block win came amid an increase in similar mining successes this year.

On March 10, a solo Bitcoin miner using a small, low-cost mining rig earned 3.15 BTC (worth $263,000 at the time) for solving block 887,212 via the solo.ckpool pool, becoming the 297th solo miner to achieve this feat.

Likewise, on Feb. 10, a solo Bitcoin miner successfully mined block 883,181, earning a reward of 3.15 BTC (including fees), worth over $300,000 at the time. The block included 3,071 transactions, according to data from Mempool.space.

 Crypto policy developments may result in a Bitcoin cycle top of over $150,000, according to the head of US at Foresight Ventures. 

Improving regulatory clarity in the United States may push Bitcoin past $150,000 during the current market cycle, according to Alice Li, investment partner and head of US at crypto venture capital firm Foresight Ventures.

Speaking during Cointelegraph's Chain Reaction X Spaces show on June 3, Li said the crypto market's 2025 rally had been driven mainly by shifting US policy.

“One of the strongest drivers is definitely the policy change,” she said, referencing US President Donald Trump's Bitcoin reserve approval and stablecoin policy developments as the main catalysts for Bitcoin (BTC) price upside in 2025.

“Stablecoin will be one of the strongest places that I would invest long term,” she added, citing regulatory progress in the US.

Li's comments come as the industry is awaiting a full Senate vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which aims to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

The passing of the legislation may inspire other major jurisdictions to follow suit. The GENIUS Act is a “good start,” said Li, adding:

Hong Kong has already proposed a bill similar to the GENIUS Act, said Li, referring to the Stablecoin Bill passed by Hong Kong's Legislative Council on May 21, enabling major financial institutions to apply with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers, as the bill is expected to pass before the end of 2025.

More crypto regulatory developments may lay the foundation for a Bitcoin cycle top of over $150,000, said Li. “I'm a strong believer in Bitcoin and the crypto market. So I think Bitcoin could go to at least $150,000 in this cycle.”

The year's first interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve may significantly bolster Bitcoin's price momentum, she added.

Markets are currently pricing in a 95% chance that the Fed will keep interest rates steady during the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on June 18, according to the latest estimates of the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, crypto VC deals hit their lowest monthly count of just 62 investment rounds in May, resulting in $909 million raised for the industry. Some analysts have pointed to macro-specific and “seasonal” liquidity patterns behind the pre-summer slump.

 US authorities seized 145 domains and crypto linked to BidenCash, a dark web market accused of selling millions of stolen credit cards. 

US authorities seized 145 domains and an undisclosed amount of cryptocurrency tied to BidenCash, a dark web marketplace accused of trafficking millions of stolen credit cards and personal data.

The action, announced on June 5 by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, followed a court-authorized operation targeting the platform's infrastructure and financial flows. The seized domains are now redirected to a law enforcement-controlled server.

BidenCash, launched in March 2022, had grown to over 117,000 users and facilitated the sale of more than 15 million stolen payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information. The platform generated over $17 million in revenue during its operation, according to US officials.

The dark web marketplace also sold compromised login credentials for unauthorized computer access. Between October 2022 and February 2023, it released 3.3 million stolen credit card records for free, a tactic used to promote its services among cybercriminals and attract new users.

The US also secured court authorization to seize cryptocurrency funds linked to BidenCash's illegal activities, though officials did not disclose the amount of crypto recovered.

The case was led by the US Secret Service's Frankfurt Resident Office, the agency's Cyber Investigative Section, and the FBI's Albuquerque Field Office. The investigation is part of a broader US effort to target crypto-enabled criminal networks operating on the dark web.

BidenCash's seizure adds to a growing list of enforcement actions. In May, Operation RapTor dismantled multiple dark web drug trafficking platforms, resulting in 270 arrests across 10 countries and the seizure of $200 million in assets, including large amounts of cryptocurrency.

In March, US authorities sanctioned the operator of now-defunct online darknet marketplace Nemesis, which was used to facilitate the sale of drugs, false identification documents, professional hacking resources and a variety of other illicit services for cybercriminals.

The sanctioned property included 44 Bitcoin (BTC) addresses and five Monero (XMR) addresses, which, between July 2022 and March 2024, received more than $850,000. 

In 2024, darknet marketplaces generated over $1.7 billion in revenue, a slight increase from the previous year, according to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs' 2025 Crypto Crime Report.

The report noted that Russian-language darknet markets continued to dominate the ecosystem, mainly due to Russian authorities' “low risk of enforcement action.”

In Deciding to Launch a Nuclear Strike, Humans Are Shockingly Suggestible

Surveys show that how nuclear strike options are presented strongly influences the decision a president may make

No one has launched a nuclear weapon in war since 1945, when U.S. president Harry S. Truman bombed Japan. Support for that decision—the only use of atomic arms in a conflict—has decreased over time. But new research investigating the attitudes of Americans suggests that, in the right scenario, plenty of people would support another atomic assault.

Most U.S. residents have no sway over such a cataclysmic decision. But the psychological factors that tweak our brains are the same ones at play in the minds of presidents and the people who are in charge of those megadeath decisions.

By gaining insight into the minds of the population, these studies illuminate the factors that might affect a leader's choice to conduct a nuclear strike—and ways to make that choice less likely.

The lineage of the new work traces back to a study, published in 2017, by Scott Sagan of Stanford University and Benjamin Valentino of Dartmouth College. The researchers presented study participants with hypothetical scenarios: Would they use a nuclear weapon in a war against Iran to save 20,000 American troops, even if doing so killed either 100,000 or two million Iranians?

With smaller casualties, around 56 percent of people would approve an air strike; with larger casualties, around 48 percent would. In both casualty cases, around 59 percent of people would support a president's decision to strike. When split demographically, Republicans, people older than age 60 and those in favor of the death penalty for murder were significantly more likely to give nuclear launch a go.

Disturbed by the results, scientist Paul Slovic of the firm Decision Research and his colleagues decided to replicate and extend that paper. In an initial study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in 2020, they posed the same experimental setup: To save 20,000 American troops, would participants support bombing either 100,000 or two million civilians? But in the answers to that question, they wanted to dig more into the demographics and domestic beliefs of the respondents.

They interpreted the fact that death-penalty proponents were more likely to support nuclear war as potential evidence of a personality trait: punitiveness, or a desire to penalize those who threatened them in some way. In other words, punitiveness equates to “punishing people who you felt deserved it,” Slovic explains.

Slovic and his co-authors wanted to investigate how approval for other punitive domestic policies lined up with nuclear support. Ultimately, they clocked people's views on abortion, guns, immigration and the death penalty.

They found a linear correlation: the more someone supported policies to restrict abortion, oppose gun control, deport immigrants and employ the death penalty, the more likely they were to support a nuclear strike.

Now, in research by Slovic, Daniel Post—a permanent military professor fellow at the U.S. Naval War College, and a former nuclear strike adviser at the U.S. Strategic Command—, and three other collaborators, the researchers have increased both the number of survey participants and the variables; the study is currently being reviewed at an academic journal. For instance, they altered the number of American troops who would be saved by a nuclear strike to see how low that human quantity could go and still merit nuclear war in the minds of the respondents. Very low numbers of American casualties, it turned out, felt like an existential threat worthy of existential response. “We found that fairly low numbers would still receive fairly high numbers of support for the nuclear option,” Post says.

When the team took American troop numbers out entirely—stating only that a war had been going on for a while and that it had both public opposition and political tensions—some people still supported using a nuclear weapon to end the conflict. Still, as the number of Ajmerican troops spared by a nuclear launch went up, so did support for it.

Approval of punitive domestic policies still correlated linearly with nuclear-strike support. And in every condition, Republicans were again more likely to go nuclear.

That's relevant to our world because a president's political party may indicate how likely their authorization of a nuclear attack would be. “I think everybody would agree you want the best decision made possible,” Post says, “not the [one that is] most beneficial to your political party, because that's not relevant in the nuclear setting. It's so bad and so big, right? It's not good for anybody.”

Surprisingly, in a finding that also arose in Sagan and Valentino's original study, women generally were more likely to approve of nuclear use than men.

In comments taken as part of the survey in Slovic and Post's new study, women said they felt more protective of the troops—another factor at play beyond desire for violent punishment. “When the troop loss got higher, even low-punishing women went for the nuclear bomb more than low-punishing men,” Slovic says.

But regardless of gender or party or punishing tendency, people's responses to the new survey changed a lot depending on how the researchers presented the options. In the initial experiment, the choices were to save a given number of American troops by killing either 100,000 or two million Iranians. When the scientists instead gave survey takers three options—don't strike, use a nuclear weapon to kill 100,000 civilians or use one to kill two million civilians—more people chose the 100,000 option: it looked less bad than the one in the millions.

People who chose not to strike when only given two possibilities often changed their choice, picking the “better bomb” when that was available. “You increase the chances of breaking the nuclear threshold, nuclear use, deterrence failure, etc., just by listing different options,” Post says. “Just by making one look better than another one.”

This result is a well-known phenomenon in psychology called the decoy effect, which is often used in marketing. When you go to the movie theater, a small popcorn may be $4, a medium may cost $7.50, and a large may cost $8. The medium exists mostly to make you think the large is a good deal (it's not). “In the retail market, the consequences are trivial,” Post says. “It's which razor people are buying or which TV they bought. But in the nuclear-decision context, the consequences are absolutely not trivial.”

And though presidents occupy a position of authority, they still have the same suggestible human brain as those of us without authority who are buying razors and TVs and popcorn because of subtle manipulation. “There's a mind involved in this,” Post says.

Sharon Weiner, a political scientist at American University, has done related mind-reading nuclear research and has collaborated with Slovic on other projects. She is an advocate for taking these particulars of the human brain into account in nuclear decision-making because humans are never more human than when something hard is happening. “You forget all the things you tell yourself you're going to remember during a crisis,” she says. And a nuclear crisis is, one would imagine, one of the world's most stressful.

Like Slovic and Post, Weiner has been considering how a president's nuclear decisions will be influenced by how their advisers present the options. In particular, she wondered whether explicitly telling the president they could choose not to launch might affect the outcome.

The president can always choose the no-go option, but strategic and military advisers might not explicitly point that out. And in the heat of a world-altering moment, the leader might forget, she says. “All the literature about behavioral psychology says they may not think of it,” Weiner says. “And so we thought, Let's test this. Let's see: If we give people an option that says, ‘Don't launch,' does it change the ratio of people who launch?”

It turns out the answer is yes: in a survey experiment that Weiner presented as part of an event with Slovic and Rose McDermott, who collaborated with Slovic and Post on their new paper, more people choose not to launch when they were directly told that option was available than when they were only given different nuclear death outcomes. “A portion of the people who pick the lowest casualties, they're the ones who then defect and pick ‘no launch' when they have that option,” Weiner says. “What this tells me is: If that's the option they wanted, they didn't have the presence of mind during the crisis to say, ‘Wait a minute. I'm not taking any of the three things you presented to me. I want a fourth thing.'”

In a real nuclear crisis, Weiner concludes, whatever nuclear options the president's advisers give at that secret and tense meeting, “there must be an option presented with equal visual and audio support to not launch.”

“There's no harm in offering that option and requiring that it be there,” she adds.

Together this recent research indicates that what insiders call the “nuclear taboo”—the idea that an international norm exists against using nuclear weapons and that this is why they haven't blown up in conflict in 80 years—is not as strong as we think. Apparently, many people require little provocation to approve of a hypothetical strike. Given that, just because humans haven't launched nuclear weapons in 80 years doesn't mean there's a magical stigmatic force preventing them from doing so. “If you're relying on a nuclear taboo to not use nuclear weapons, you need to rethink,” Weiner says.

The decision to break that taboo, the research suggests, is also mercurial—disturbingly like more mundane choices. “One of the takeaways is how unstable the response is and [how it depends on] factors that should not play a role in the decision,” Slovic says. Gender, political party, punitive disposition, the presentation of choices—""All of this bounces people around,” he continues.

And depending on how that bounce lands, it's something the world might not bounce back from.

Mathematicians Solve Multidimensional Fruit-Slicing Dilemma

A 40-year-old conjecture on shapes' cross sections is finally proven

By Max Springer edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

In 1986 Belgian mathematician Jean Bourgain posed a seemingly simple question that continued to puzzle researchers for decades. No matter how you deform a convex shape—consider shaping a ball of clay into a watermelon, a football or a long noodle—will you always be able to slice a cross section bigger than a certain size? A paper by Bo'az Klartag of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and Joseph Lehec of the University of Poitiers in France, posted to the preprint site arXiv.org, has finally provided a definitive answer: yes.

Bourgain's slicing problem asks whether every convex shape in n dimensions has a “slice” such that the cross section is bigger than some fixed value. For three-dimensional objects, this is like asking whether an avocado of a given size, no matter the exact shape, can always be split into two halves with each side revealing at least some sizable slice. Bourgain, a titan of mathematics, is said to have spent more time on this problem than any other; although it may seem deceptively easy to resolve in the physical world's two or three dimensions, it quickly balloons in difficulty when we consider four or five. This added complexity makes determining anything in n-dimensional space seem impossible. “If you believe in this so-called curse of dimensionality, you might just give up,” Klartag says. Fortunately, he adds, he and Lehec “belong to a different school of thought.”

The pair's breakthrough builds on recent progress by mathematician Qingyang Guan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who approached the problem with a technique based on physics rather than geometry. Specifically, Guan showed that modeling how heat diffuses out of a convex shape can reveal hidden geometric structures. Researchers could calculate filling any convex shape with warm gas and carefully observe the heat's dissipation according to physical laws. Guan's key insight—a precise limit on how rapidly the rate of dissipation changes during this heating process—proved to be just what Klartag and Lehec needed. “Guan's bound tied together all the other key facts” known for the problem, says mathematician Beatrice-Helen Vritsiou of the University of Alberta.

The result let Klartag and Lehec resolve the problem in only a few days. Klartag notes that “it was lucky because we knew [Guan's result] was exactly one of the things we needed” to connect several seemingly disparate approaches to the puzzle. With this final piece in place, the geometry of convex bodies in high dimensions is now a little less mysterious—although, as always in mathematics, each new slice reveals more questions to explore.

Researchers are learning more about how the fungus coexists with the morning glory, and their findings are a real trip.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 1963, Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered what gave morning glories psychoactive properties, the lysergic acid amides that would later lead him to (accidentally) create LSD. 

Hofmann already knew about a mind-altering hallucinogen in morning glories that had been used in Mesoamerican religious rituals since ancient times. Seeing these chemicals in a plant was unexpected, since they are usually associated with fungi. The morning glory fungus eluded him. Finding it would prove to be a trip.

Morning glories (Convolvulaceae) are known for having symbiotic relationships with fungi that produce ergot alkaloids. These are the mycotoxins from which some hallucinogens, along with powerful medications for conditions such as dementia and migraines are derived. Many of the fungi that produce these substances belong to the family Clavicipitaceae. 

While many species of morning glories have been found to contain ergot alkaloids, their fungal symbionts have not always been observed easily. Clavicipitaceae are often detected through DNA or their disappearance when a plant is treated with fungicide. 

Researchers Corinne Hazel and Daniel Panaccione of West Virginia University knew of evidence for a psychotropic fungus in morning glories. The seed-borne fungus is a Clavicipitaceous genus known as Periglandula, and lives in symbiosis with the morning glory species Ipomoea tricolor, but had never been described further.  

“The presence of ergot alkaloids in I. tricolor was associated with [genetic] sequences of an undescribed fungus of the family Clavicipitaceae,” Hazel and Panaccione said in a study recently published in Mycologia. “Further evidence of a fungal symbiont of I. tricolor included suppression of ergot alkaloid synthesis through treatment with [a] fungicide.”

The researchers sought to isolate the fungus and sequence its genome so they could finally describe it. Plant tissues were magnified up to 200 times to search for visible signs of mycelium. Hyphae are the filaments in mycelium which branch out and connect networks of mushrooms underground and make up that dreaded white fuzz seen on moldy bread. Some of morning glory tissues were stained so the mycelium would be easier to identify, and other tissues were given nutrients to promote fungal growth. 

Because Clavicipitaceae live in seeds, DNA from was also extracted from morning glory seed coats. Hazel knew she was onto something when she spotted white fuzz growing insides of sed coats and suspected fungi.

When scientists sequenced the genome of the fungus was sequenced, they found a previously undescribed species of Periglandula. Hazel named it Periglandula clandestina because of how it hides itself within the morning glory plant, which separates it from the other known Periglandula species that grow on the outside of the plant and are not as secretive. Ergot alkaloids were found throughout the plants. They are even present in the roots, where there was no evidence of P. clandestina DNA. 

The most common alkaloid found in the plants was lysergic acid alpha-hydroxyethylamide (LAH). This alkaloid is one of the lysergic acid amides Hofman identified in his studies. LSD aside, the discovery of the fungus it is synthesized from could open opportunities for significant pharmaceutical discoveries in the future.

“Because P. clandestina produces exceptionally high quantities of ergot alkaloids, the genes in its ergot alkaloid biosynthesis pathway may be a resource for engineering model organisms to overproduce pharmaceutically relevant ergot alkaloids,” said Hazel and Panaccione.

The discovery that flowered from a suspicion about fuzz on a seed coat is almost as accidental as the discovery of a substance that will forever be associated with the undulating rainbows of ‘60s psychedelia, the Beatles' iconic “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” and even cult pop culture icons like Futurama's Hypnotoad.  

Even Hoffman himself is quoted as saying, “I did not choose LSD. LSD found and called me.”

Metrics details

mRNA localization to specific subcellular regions is common in mammalian cells but poorly understood in terms of its physiological roles. This study demonstrates the functional importance of Net1 mRNA, which we find prominently localized at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) in stratified squamous epithelia. Net1 mRNA accumulates at DEJ protrusion-like structures that interact with the basement membrane and connect to a mechanosensitive network of microfibrils. Disrupting Net1 mRNA localization in mouse epithelium alters DEJ morphology and keratinocyte-matrix connections, affecting tissue homeostasis. mRNA localization dictates the cortical accumulation of the Net1 protein and its function as a RhoA GTPase exchange factor (GEF). Altered RhoA activity is in turn sufficient to alter the ultrastructure of the DEJ. This study provides a high-resolution in vivo view of mRNA targeting in a physiological context. It further demonstrates how the subcellular localization of a single mRNA can significantly influence mammalian epithelial tissue organization, thus revealing an unappreciated level of post-transcriptional regulation that controls tissue physiology.

mRNA localization has emerged as a prevalent level of post-transcriptional regulation not only in model systems but also in higher organisms. Indeed, in diverse mammalian cell types, a large fraction of the transcriptome is targeted to specific subcellular destinations and adopts distinct distribution patterns1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Nevertheless, whether the localization of individual mRNAs is important for mammalian physiology remains poorly characterized, especially in tissues outside the nervous system9,10.

A well-studied localization pathway targets mRNAs to peripheral protrusions of mammalian mesenchymal cells through active kinesin-dependent trafficking on microtubules1,11,12,13. Localization to protrusions of mRNAs, such as NET1 and RAB13, plays an important role in mesenchymal migration in cultured cell systems14,15,16,17. Mechanistically, even though proteins like NET1 and RAB13 do not remain concentrated close to their translation site, the location of their mRNAs influences the eventual destination and function of the encoded proteins by specifying where in cytoplasm the protein is translated. Protein synthesis within a particular local micro-environment promotes specific co-translational interactions of the nascent proteins thus guiding binding partner selection and eventual protein function14,16,18. In the case of NET1, localization of NET1 mRNA at protrusions promotes NET1 protein association with a membrane-bound scaffold16. Plasma membrane-associated NET1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase RhoA, a central regulator of the cytoskeleton19,20. In contrast, perinuclear NET1 mRNA promotes nascent NET1 binding to importins leading to its nuclear sequestration. In this way, the location of the NET1 mRNA modulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of NET1 protein and consequently influences cytoskeletal dynamics and complex cellular processes like mesenchymal cell migration in vitro16. Protrusion-localized mRNAs, including NET1, have also been observed at the basal surface of in vitro cultured epithelial cells as well as in intestinal enterocytes in vivo2,3,8. However, the functional significance of this epithelial basal localization is unknown.

Here, we examine the functional role of protrusion mRNA localization in mouse epithelial physiology. We find that, strikingly, protrusion-localized mRNAs are targeted to poorly characterized protrusion-like structures formed by basal keratinocytes in mammalian stratified epithelial tissue. These formations at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) are connected to mechanosensitive microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. Using specific, sequence-blocking anti-sense oligos to prevent Net1 mRNA localization to the DEJ, we show that Net1 mRNA location is necessary for maintaining DEJ architecture and epithelial homeostasis through the RhoA pathway. This study connects mRNA localization to unexplored aspects of epithelial physiology and highlights this prevalent level of post-transcriptional regulation as an important contributor to tissue function in higher organisms.

To probe the function of protrusion-localized mRNAs in epithelia in vivo, we first surveyed the subcellular localization of several protrusion-localized mRNAs12,21 (i.e., Net1, Cyb5r3, Palld, Kif1c, Pkp4) across various mouse epithelial tissues that are architecturally distinct. These tissues included monolayered tubular epithelial structures (intestine and kidney) as well as stratified squamous epithelia (tongue and skin) (Fig. 1a). Robust signals were detected with transcript-specific probes, but not with a negative control probe against a bacterial mRNA (DapB) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). To allow spatial quantitative assessments, RNA detection was accompanied by staining with a combination of wheat germ agglutin (WGA) and β-catenin to delineate overall tissue architecture and cell borders (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). To permit comparison across tissues, we focused in each case on the basal layer of cells in contact with the extracellular basement membrane (BM). The BM was demarcated by WGA providing a comparable basal boundary between BM-associated cells in different tissues (Fig. 1a, b; BM marked by a yellow dashed line). We manually segmented the BM-associated cell layer (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a, b; segmented basal cell layer marked by a red dashed line) and RNA signal was quantified along the apico-basal axis (Fig. 1d), providing a measure of subcellular mRNA distribution within a layer of similarly polarized cells. We define the RNA amount in the bottom 30% of this layer as the ‘basal mRNA fraction' (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Interestingly, most of the tested mRNAs accumulate in the basal part of the BM-attached cell layer in all tissues tested, whereas a non-targeted control transcript, Gapdh mRNA, was comparatively diffuse (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2c). There was also evident variability in basal mRNA targeting both among tissues and between protrusion-localized mRNAs, suggesting transcript- and tissue-specific differences in the magnitude of mRNA localization. Nevertheless, mRNAs like Net1 and Cyb5r3 emerged as consistently basally localized mRNAs in all tissues tested.

To explore the relevance of these candidates to tissue physiology, we surveyed published RNA-seq and tissue RNA imaging datasets. Interestingly, Net1 is specifically enriched in basal keratinocytes of the skin and tongue; Net1 is also nearly 4-times as abundant as the 5 next most highly expressed Rho-family GEFs (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e)22,23,24. Furthermore, Net1 expression is 9-times higher in keratinocytes than dermal fibroblasts of the skin pointing to a potential important function in the epidermal compartment (Supplementary Fig. 2d)22. In addition, we characterized the in vivo NET1 mRNA distribution in stratified epithelial tissues of other species by examining primate tongue and human skin biopsies. Importantly, we again found in these cases that NET1 mRNA is significantly enriched near the basal cell membrane of BM-attached keratinocytes suggesting that basal NET1 mRNA localization is evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 1a, e). We thus focused on the mouse Net1 mRNA for further molecular and functional characterization utilizing the stratified tongue epithelium as an amenable experimental system.

The stratified squamous epithelium of the tongue consists of epithelial cells at different proliferation and differentiation states. Basal keratinocytes attached to the BM can enter the cell cycle and upregulate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) during S/G2/M-phases25. To see whether Net1 mRNA localization differs between quiescent and proliferating basal cells, we measured basal Net1 accumulation in PCNAHi and PCNALo cells (Fig. 1f). Net1 distribution was not significantly different between cell proliferation states, based on this cell division marker (Fig. 1g). Basal Krt5+ cells can additionally transition to the suprabasal layer while upregulating differentiation markers like keratin 13 (Krt13) in the mouse tongue. As a result, such Krt13+ cells eventually lose contact with the BM. Quantification of total Net1 mRNA amount (by RNA-FISH) in segmented epithelial layers showed that Net1 mRNA amount is highest in the BM-attached basal layer and downregulated in suprabasal differentiated keratinocytes (Supplementary Fig. 2e). Interestingly, we could detect cells that appear to be in the process of delaminating, since they exhibit basally-oriented Krt13 cellular extensions intercalating between Krt5+ cells (Fig. 1h). Such cells exhibited accumulation of Net1 mRNA at the tips of these extensions, albeit infrequently (Fig. 1h inset). We interpret this to suggest that Net1 mRNA localization close to the basal plasma membrane is transiently maintained in delaminating keratinocytes concomitantly with an overall Net1 downregulation during differentiation. Overall, these data suggest that both Net1 mRNA expression and subcellular localization is notably elevated in BM-contacting keratinocytes, regardless of their proliferation state. We therefore focused our attention on characterizing Net1 mRNA and its function in basal keratinocytes.

Basal cells of the tongue reside at the interface between the oral epithelium and the underlying connective tissue. This interface in stratified epithelia has been primarily studied in the skin and referred to as the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). We will be using the same terminology here, given the parallels between oral and skin tissue26. The DEJ includes the basal plasma membrane and specialized adhesions called hemidesmosomes, which connect the epithelium to the BM and the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) through fibrillar anchoring complexes27,28. The DEJ has important roles in maintaining the epithelium both by acting as a reservoir for signaling molecules and by providing structural support29,30.

We performed high-resolution confocal imaging of the DEJ, because of the pronounced basal accumulation of the Net1 mRNA. We specifically visualized the basal cell membrane through staining with integrin a6 (Itga6), a core hemidesmosome component. Strikingly, high-resolution imaging revealed a high degree of topographical variability of the basal membrane which consisted of numerous micron- or submicron-wide protrusion-like structures that interdigitated with the BM (Fig. 2a; full serial optical slices of these structures can be viewed in Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). These topographically variable regions are morphologically consistent with similar structures observed in older literature31,32. However, the associated components or potential function of these protrusion-like structures has been largely unexplored33. Notably, the Net1 mRNA localized within, and quite frequently at the tips of these structures (Fig. 2a; yellow arrowheads). Despite their smaller size, these keratinocyte structures appear morphologically similar to the in vitro cultured mesenchymal cell protrusions, where Net1 and other protrusion-localized mRNAs have been previously studied14,15,16. These data thus raise the intriguing possibility that these poorly characterized keratinocyte structures reflect in vivo equivalents of in vitro protrusion-like structures and are analogously associated with localized mRNAs, including Net1.

Bottom panels: zoomed in regions, indicated by yellow boxes, highlighting fibers connecting with the basal keratinocyte cell membrane.

DEJ components, basement membrane (BM), and hemidesmosomes (HD), are indicated. Ribosomes are evident as electron dense particles. Yellow boxed areas are enlarged in the right panels to indicate strings of ribosomes, likely corresponding to actively translating polysomes.

Protrusion-like basal membrane structures can also be visualized upon staining with WGA (Fig. 2b; serial optical slices can be viewed in Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Aside from visualizing the interdigitations this staining also revealed a complex fiber network that spans the dermis and appears to connect with the protrusion-like structures at the DEJ (Fig. 2b; note that this image presents a projection of multiple optical slices to allow better visualization of the fiber network). To determine whether these structures are specific to oral epithelium we visualized the DEJ in sections of mouse tail skin (Supplementary Fig. 3). Staining for Itga6 revealed similar protrusion-like structures of the basal plasma membrane with local accumulation of the Net1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Additionally, these areas were connected to WGA-positive dermal fibers (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Therefore, accumulation of Net1 mRNA at basal keratinocyte protrusions that connect to a dermal fiber network is broadly observed in stratified epithelia.

To determine what these WGA-positive fibers correspond to, we surveyed various components of the DEJ and the dermal ECM. Co-detection with WGA indicated that these fibers are not enriched for hemidesmosome (Col17a1), basement membrane (laminin), or anchoring fibril (Col7) DEJ components (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Because these fibers form an extensive network below the DEJ, we hypothesized that they are part of the dermal ECM. However, detection of collagen I (Col1a1), the primary dermal ECM component, showed that these fibers are not enriched for Col1a1 except at regions proximal to the DEJ (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We discovered, though, that these fibers are strongly positive for fibrillin 2 (Fbn2), a major component of the microfibrils that are part of the elastic fiber network which allows transmission of mechanical forces across the dermis (Fig. 2c)34,35,36,37,38. Given the fact that stratified squamous epithelium is regularly mechanically deformed and that the microfibrils are essential in resisting this deformation, it is tempting to speculate that keratinocyte protrusions are sites of high mechanical stress. Pertinent to this, targeting of protrusion-localized mRNAs in in vitro cultures is coordinated with cellular mechanical state and influenced by ECM properties in various settings12,17. Therefore, the DEJ could reflect a physiological setting where the mechanoresponsive localization of mRNAs is particularly relevant.

To assess whether the basal protrusion-like structures could be sites of mRNA translation we sought to determine whether ribosomes are present in these areas. For this, we visualized mouse tongue epithelium using transmission electron microscopy. We could observe within basal keratinocyte protrusions numerous ribosomes as electron dense particles with an average diameter of 24.31+/−3.97 nm (Fig. 2d, left panels). In some instances, clusters or strings of ribosomes were evident, likely corresponding to actively translating polysomes (Fig. 2d, right panels). As a complementary approach, we immunostained mouse tongue epithelium for ribosomal proteins of the small (Rps27) and large (Rpl23a) ribosomal subunits followed by Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Proximity of Rps27 and Rpl23a signals within a radius of 100 nm or less would indicate a physical distance consistent with the presence of the two proteins in the context of a translating 80S ribosome. Indeed, STED imaging revealed several instances of putative 80S complexes near the basal plasma membrane in keratinocyte protrusion-like structures (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The presence of ribosomes thus suggests that basal keratinocyte protrusions can support local mRNA translation.

To broadly address the functional role of Net1 mRNA localization in epithelial physiology, and protrusion-like structures specifically, we employed sequence blocking phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos (PMOs). PMOs antisense to GA-rich regions of human protrusion-localized mRNAs have been shown to specifically prevent the localization of the targeted mRNA by blocking the formation of a transport-competent complex between the mRNA and the KIF1C kinesin15,16,39. To determine whether we can extend the use of this approach to mice, we designed PMOs that target the analogous GA-rich regions in the mouse Net1 3′UTR and tested them in in vitro cultured mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts by visualizing Net1 mRNA using transcript-specific probes (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). PMOs were either targeted to Net1 GA-rich regions (PMOs #992 and #1016) or another downstream area (PMO #1620), or to an unrelated sequence (control PMO) (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Indeed, GA-targeting PMOs, but not other sequences, significantly prevented the localization of the Net1 mRNA to the periphery of 3T3s without affecting another protrusion-localized mRNA, Cyb5r3 (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g). Importantly, and consistent with prior reports in human cells, the effect on Net1 mRNA localization was not accompanied by any detectable change in the amount of Net1 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5h)16. We also measured the enrichment of various mRNAs within isolated 3T3 protrusions and observed that Net1 PMO delivery affected solely the enrichment of the Net1 mRNA while all other detected transcripts were unaffected (Supplementary Fig. 5i). We further validated that Net1 PMOs #992 and #1016 can similarly disrupt Net1 mRNA localization in an immortalized keratinocyte cell line in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), again without affecting Net1 mRNA levels or the amount of Net1 protein produced (Supplementary Fig. 6c–e). These data confirm the broad conservation of the mRNA trafficking mechanisms to protrusions, and the applicability of PMO delivery as a specific tool to modify mRNA distributions in diverse cell types.

To assess the physiological importance of Net1 mRNA localization in vivo we intradermally injected the two Net1 localization altering PMOs or two control PMOs (one targeting GFP and one corresponding to a scrambled Net1 #992 sequence) into mouse tongues. PMOs were administered every 2 days over 6 days (Fig. 3a). We confirmed, by small RNA in situ hybridization, that PMOs reached and were taken up by the cells in the epithelium (Fig. 3b). Significantly, when we measured Net1 mRNA distribution in injected tissues, there was a substantial reduction in the accumulation of Net1 mRNA in the basal fraction of BM-attached epithelial cells upon administration of the GA-rich region targeting PMOs (Fig. 3c, d). Therefore, PMOs can prevent the subcellular accumulation of the endogenous Net1 mRNA in epithelial tissues in vivo.

Further phenotypic analysis revealed prominent defects in epithelial architecture detected by H&E staining (Fig. 3e). Specifically, the epithelium of Net1 PMO-treated tongue epithelia was thinner in comparison to control treated tissues (Fig. 3f). Such changes in epithelial architecture can be brought about by defects in cellular differentiation40,41. Visualization of canonical markers of the basal and spinous compartment, Krt5 and Krt13, respectively, revealed that Net1 PMO-treated tongue contained significantly more Krt5/Krt13+ double positive cells in the basal layer (Fig. 3g–i). This suggests either spontaneous differentiation of Krt5+ cells or alternatively a defect in cell detachment from the basement membrane.

Given the fact that Net1 mRNA localizes to protrusion-like structures at the DEJ, we investigated whether altering Net1 localization from the basal surface affects DEJ organization. Indeed, Net1 PMO-treated epithelium exhibited drastic flattening of protrusion-like structures formed by basal keratinocytes (Fig. 3j; serial optical slices can be viewed in Supplementary Movie 3). We quantified this change by measuring topographical variation of the basal plasma membrane using optical slices of Itga6-stained tissues and deriving a ‘DEJ variation' metric, a value that reflects the degree to which basal keratinocytes exhibit protrusion-like structures (see Supplementary Fig. 7 and “Methods” for details). Using this metric, DEJ variation was halved in Net1 PMO-treated epithelia (Fig. 3k). As shown above, basal protrusions appear to be connected to Fbn2+ fibers. We thus asked whether altering Net1 localization has broader effects on the microfibrils near the DEJ. Consistent with this, the volume of Fbn2+ fibers was significantly reduced in regions proximal to the DEJ (Fig. 3l, m). This result could reflect ECM remodeling near the epithelium but may also be due to decreased antibody-epitope accessibility on individual fibers due to altered mechanical strain, which can lead to changes in fibrillin domain folding42. Regardless, it is notable that dysregulation of the DEJ during aging or in genetic diseases, including ones caused by mutations in fibrillins, has strong negative implications on epidermal physiology33,34,38,43. Altogether, these results demonstrate that altering the basal localization of a single mRNA, Net1, is sufficient to drastically influence keratinocyte physiology and tissue homeostasis, potentially by altering interactions of the basal epithelium with the DEJ.

To understand the mechanism through which altering Net1 mRNA localization affects keratinocyte physiology, we considered that Net1 mRNA location might affect the activity of the encoded Net1 protein as a RhoA GEF. Net1 is quite unique among RhoA regulators in that it is controlled by nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking44,45. While RhoA activation largely occurs at the plasma membrane, Net1 can be imported and sequestered in the nucleus, providing an “off-switch” for Net1-dependent RhoA activation16,19. Net1 mRNA location controls Net1 nuclear import versus cytoplasmic retention by a partner-selection mechanism in mesenchymal cells in vitro. Specifically, translation of Net1 from protrusion-localized mRNA favors its interaction with a plasma membrane scaffold and promotes RhoA activation by Net116. To determine whether this mRNA location-dependent regulation operates in the tongue epithelium in vivo, we looked at the subcellular distribution of the Net1 protein. We first validated the specificity of the Net1 antibody, by immunofluorescence staining of immortalized keratinocytes upon Net1 knock down with two different siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). We then observed Net1 protein distribution in tongue sections. Net1 protein signal was primarily detected in the layer of BM-attached keratinocytes (Fig. 4a), consistent with the basal cell specific expression pattern of Net1 mRNA, mentioned above (Supplementary Fig. 2e). This further supports the specificity of Net1 protein detection. We note that while Net1 protein is primarily nuclear and less cytoplasmic in cultured keratinocytes, in in vivo tissue Net1 is primarily cytoplasmic and specifically accumulating in the cell cortex (compare Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 8a). While the basis for this differential regulation is still unclear, this has been also observed in other studies19,46,47. Additionally, Net1 is observed throughout the keratinocyte cortex and does not accumulate solely at the basal plasma membrane (Fig. 4a). This observation is consistent with in vitro results showing that Net1 protein diffuses away from the site of translation and can be either retained broadly in the cytoplasm or imported into the nucleus depending on the location of its synthesis16. To quantify changes in Net1 protein distribution we measured its cortical/non-cortical intensity (Fig. 4a–c). Net1 PMO-treated epithelium showed a reduced cortical Net1 accumulation (Fig. 4d), indicating that Net1 mRNA location also controls Net1 protein distribution in vivo.

A reduction in cortical Net1 amount would be predicted to result in reduced activation of the RhoA GTPase. Given that it is technically difficult to directly measure RhoA activity in tissues, we examined the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (pMLC), a major downstream RhoA target48. pMLC levels were visualized using a phospho-specific antibody under conditions that allow specific detection (Supplementary Fig. 9). Quantification of pMLC levels in Net1 PMO-injected tongue epithelium revealed that altering Net1 mRNA localization reduced pMLC in both basal keratinocytes and more broadly across the entire epithelium (Fig. 4e, f). Therefore, preventing the basal localization of the Net1 mRNA leads to altered Net1 protein distribution and a reduction in RhoA-pMLC signaling. Given that this pathway is well known to control cytoskeletal tension and cell attachment, it is likely that it reflects the mechanism linking Net1 mRNA targeting to DEJ structure and epithelial organization.

To test this idea, we tried to independently address whether changes in RhoA signaling within basal keratinocytes control their interaction with the DEJ. For this, we used a genetic system for cell-type specific RhoA activation49,50. Krt14-rtTA mice were crossed with a genetic knock-in of a constitutively active RhoA GEF, ArhGEF11 (ArhGEF11CA), under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 5a), to achieve RhoA activation specifically in basal keratinocytes. Doxycycline injection led to basal keratinocyte-specific overexpression of ArhGEF11CA in mouse tongue, visualized by an HA-tag, as early as 10hrs post-injection (Fig. 5b). ArhGEF11CA-expressing cells exhibited increased cortical pMLC and filamentous actin (phalloidin staining) indicative of RhoA-induced cytoskeletal tension (Fig. 5b).

We examined tongue tissue architecture in these mice, comparing them to mice with the ArhGEF11CA cassette that were not crossed with Krt14-rtTA mice (WT/ArhGEF11CA). We focused our quantitative analysis on DEJ regions where all of the basal keratinocytes express the HA-tagged ArhGEF11CA. Remarkably, this short-term induction of RhoA signaling was sufficient to significantly increase the prominence of keratinocyte protrusion-like structures indicated by an increase in DEJ topographical variation (Fig. 5c, d). Concomitantly, DEJ proximal Fbn2+ fibers became more prominent and displayed a higher overall volume in regions proximal to the epithelium (Fig. 5e, f). Given the short induction time we favor the idea that increased fibrillin detection reflects, at least partly, increased epitope accessibility through tension-induced unfolding, rather than solely an increase in their absolute amount.

A unique feature observed upon ArhGEF11CA expression was the occasional appearance of Itga6 strands co-localizing with Fbn2+ fibers far below the overall level of the basal plasma membrane (Fig. 5g). The fact that these do not appear under normal conditions suggests that they are formed upon the supraphysiologic tension induced under our experimental setting. We envision that fibrillin resistance to keratinocytes' tensile forces eventually leads to fiber retraction away from the epithelium. In this scenario the residual tension in fibrillin fibers pulls portions of the plasma membrane below the ordinary DEJ (Fig. 5g). The tight colocalization of Itga6 with fibrillin suggests the existence of stable mechanical coupling between the keratinocyte plasma membrane and microfibrils. These data provide orthogonal evidence that changes in RhoA activity, and cytoskeletal tension, is sufficient to alter keratinocyte connections with the DEJ. Therefore, the RhoA pathway is the likely mediator of the ultrastructural changes at the DEJ in response to altering Net1 mRNA localization. Overall, the evidence presented here reveals mRNA localization as an unappreciated level of post-transcriptional regulation that controls the mechanical coupling of the epithelium with the underlying connective tissue, which broadly affects tissue physiology.

Post-transcriptional mRNA regulation has well known roles both in normal physiology as well as in disease, exemplified for instance by miRNA-mediated regulation during development51, or the therapeutic modulation of splicing patterns52. Targeting of mRNAs to specific subcellular domains has emerged as another widespread level of post-transcriptional mRNA control with the potential to spatially coordinate protein-protein interactions at a subcellular level and control protein function4,7,16. Nevertheless, the contribution of mRNA localization to mammalian physiology has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the subcellular localization of an individual mRNA, Net1, is an important regulator of epithelial tissue homeostasis. This observation underscores the importance of this post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in epithelial tissue physiology where ~15–30% of the transcriptome is differentially polarized2,3 and sensitive to physiological stimuli2.

Notably, we show that the basally localized Net1 mRNA is associated with protrusion-like structures of keratinocytes that contact a mechanosensitive network of dermal microfibrils. We speculate that these underappreciated structures at the DEJ may be mechanical connections necessary for long range force transmission between the epidermis and dermis. Targeting of the Net1 mRNA at these DEJ structures is necessary for their formation and its loss results in remodeling of the dermal ECM. Our evidence further suggests that these effects are mediated through basal cell autonomous activation of RhoA. Indeed, Net1-mediated activation of RhoA is necessary for collagen I remodeling in breast tissue53 as well as basement membrane breakdown during embryonic development46. The findings presented here indicate that such RhoA-regulated cell-ECM interactions are mediated at least partly by localized translation of the Net1 mRNA. Interestingly, Net1 mRNA localization is itself mechanosensitive, being affected by the properties of the ECM12,17, implying the existence of feedback regulation that maintains an RNA-dependent mechanical homeostasis of the DEJ. This maintenance of homeostasis extends to keratinocyte function, including differentiation, which is regulated by cell-autonomous and tissue-wide variation in mechanical state40,41.

Alterations in DEJ components, including breakdown of the microfibrillar network and a morphological attenuation of keratinocyte protrusions, occurs during aging33,43. Additionally, mutations that affect the BM or fibrillins have deleterious effects on epidermal homeostasis and have been implicated in a number of genetic diseases and malignancies30,38,54. These include mutations that cause delamination of the epidermis and increased propensity for tumor development55,56. We speculate that changes in basal localization of Net1, and likely other protrusion mRNAs, might contribute to this disease- and aging-associated mechanical uncoupling of the epidermis. Given that Net1 is widely expressed and consistently localized in a variety of tissues it is possible that its unique regulatory mechanism is utilized for maintenance of epithelium-ECM connections in additional tissues. Further understanding of the dynamic control and functional contributions of such events occurring at tissue interfaces will provide exciting new directions and context for studying RNA transport and local regulation in mammalian physiology.

All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Duke University (Durham, NC; Protocol #: A255-23-12). All mice (4–12 weeks) were housed in sterile filter-capped cages, fed and watered ad libitum, in a 12:12 light-dark cycle animal facility maintained at 72 °F ± 3 °F with an ambient humidity of 50% ± 15%.

For injections, custom octaguanidine dendrimer conjugated PMOs (Vivo-Morpholino, GeneTools) that target EGFP or Net1 mRNA were synthesized (Supplementary Table 1). PMOs (5 nmol/inj) and fluorescently labelled dextran (2.5 μg/inj.; Molecular probes; D1976) were mixed in isotonic sterile saline. 10 µL of the solution was subcutaneously injected in the ventral portion of the tongues of anesthetized male and female C57BL/6/NCr mice (Charles River; age 10–12 weeks). Anesthesia was performed by brief exposure to 3% isoflurane followed by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. The tongues were injected with PMOs every two days for a total of three injections. Mice were sacrificed for tissue collection 6 days after the initial injection.

Mice overexpressing ArhGEF11CA-HA in Krt14+ keratinocytes were generated using previously described transgenic mouse models50,57,58. Briefly, mice with the TRE-Arhgef11-HA transgene50 were crossed with FVB-Tg(KRT14-rtTA) (Jackson Laboratory Strain #: 008099)57,58. 4-week-old TRE-Arhgef11/Krt14-rtTA mice (4 males and 2 females) were IP-injected with 25 mg/kg doxycycline (Sigma) 10 h before sacrifice and tissue collection. Transgene expression was validated using an HA-tag specific antibody (Roche; 11867423001).

Tissue was collected from male and female euthanized mice (age 4–12 weeks) washed gently in PBS then flash frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Fisher Healthcare; 4585). Tissue embedded OCT blocks were cut 8–10 um thick on a Leica cryostat microtome CM1860. Tissues were collected on positively charged slides (Rankin; 20290 W) then stored at −80 °C. The gross tissue morphology of each tissue was visualized by H&E staining (abcam; ab245880).

Mouse keratinocytes were isolated from tail skin of male mixed background mice (FVB/N and C57) by physical separation of the epidermis and dermis from the hypodermis. Tail skin was sterilized with 10% v/v betadine/iodine in PBS. Excised tissue was digested overnight at 4 °C using 2 U/mL of dispase II (StemCell; 07913) diluted in 0.25% trypsin without EDTA (Gibco; 15050065). After digestion the tissue was minced and mixed with media and antibiotics. Keratinocytes were then isolated from the digest by sequential straining using 100 μm and 40 μm cell strainers. Cells were cultured for one passage using EpiLife medium with 60 μM calcium (Gibco, Waltham, MA, MEPI500CA), supplemented with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement (HKGS, Life Technologies, S0015), mouse EGF (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 2028EG200), and Y-27632 compound (10 μM, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom, 12-541-0). Keratinocytes were then immortalized by infecting with lentiviruses expressing SV40 Large T Antigen (Addgene Plasmid #170255). Cells were selected with Hygromycin (200 μg/mL) for two days and then cells were passed for two passages in EpiLife and described supplements. Then cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich Inc) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich Inc), antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich Inc), mouse EGF (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 2028EG200), and Y-27632 compound (10 μM, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, United Kingdom, 12-541-0), for at least two passages before experiments. Lentiviruses were produced by transfecting Lenti-X 293 T cells with pMD2.VSVG (Addgene plasmid #12259) and psPAX2 (Addgene plasmid #12260). Lenti-X 293 T cells were obtained from Takara Bio and cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich).

Fresh frozen sections or cultured cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma; F8775) for 15–30 min at RT washed 3 × 2 min in PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X-100 for 5–20 min. Sections were washed in PBST and blocked for 1 h in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2% goat serum (GS) in PBS. Antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight (Supplementary Table 2). Samples were washed 3 × 2min in PBST and incubated with fluorophore conjugated secondary antibodies corresponding to the host species (Supplementary Table 2; 1:500 in blocking buffer). Samples were washed with PBST 3 × 2 min then counterstained with a fluorophore conjugated variation of wheat germ agglutin (Invitrogen; W11261; 10 ug/mL), phalloidin (Invitrogen; A12379), and/or DAPI. Tissue samples were mounted using #1.5 coverglass (Fisher; 12544D) with either prolong glass or diamond mounting medium (Invitrogen; P36980 or P36962) and allowed to set overnight at room temperature.

Phosphorylated-myosin light chain 2 (Thr18/Ser19) was detected in tissue samples using a modified immunofluorescence protocol. Briefly samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 3 h at RT, washed 3 × 5 min in TBS then treated with 1% SDS diluted in TBS for 20 min at RT with regular agitation. Samples were washed thoroughly in 3 × 5 min in TBST (0.1% Tween-20). Samples were blocked in 3%BSA and 2% GS in TBS for 1 h. pMLC specific rabbit mAb (Cell signaling; 95777) was diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Staining was completed as described above with TBS instead of PBS.

Specificity of the pMLC antibody was validated by pre-treating tissues with 4000 U λ phosphatase (NEB; P0753S) diluted in 1 × NEBuffer for protein phosphatases and 1 mM MnCl2 overnight at 30 °C. Samples were washed thoroughly in TBST before proceeding with the staining protocol described above.

NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblast cells (ATCC, cat# CRL-1658) were grown in Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco; 11995-065) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Cytiva; SH30087.04), sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; 15140122). Immortalized mouse keratinocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum,10 ng/mL mouse EGF, and 10 μM Y27632. Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and passaged with either 0.05% (3T3) or 0.25% (keratinocytes) trypsin with EDTA (Gibco; 25300054 or 25200056). Cells used in this study have tested negative for mycoplasma.

For PMO delivery, cells were grown to 70% confluence in 12 well plates then transfected with the indicated PMOs at a concentration of 15 μM in basal media. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments cells were cultured to 50–70% confluency in 6 or 12 well plates then transitioned to antibiotic free media. Cells where transfected with the indicated siRNA (Qiagen; final concentration 40 nM; Supplementary Table 1) which were pre-complexed with Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen; 13778075) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were assayed for protein expression 48 h after transfection.

Fixed samples were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E inverted microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal scanner unit and operated using NIS-Elements software (5.21.03, Build 1489). Images were acquired using 20× (Plan Apo 20×; NA = 0.75; WD = 1000 μm), 40× (Plan Fluor 40; Oil; NA = 1.30; WD = 240 μm), 60× (Apo 60× λS DIC N2; Oil; NA = 1.40; WD = 140 μm), or 100× (Apo TIRF DIC N2; Oil; NA = 1.49; WD = 120 μm) objectives and a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion BT Gen III back-illuminated sCMOS cameras. Images were denoised and deconvolved using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm in the NIS-Elements analysis software (5.21.03, Build 1489).

Whole sample brightfield images of H&E-stained samples were taken using a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 (Zeiss) equipped with a Hamamatsu OrcaFlash 4.0 camera using 10× and 20× objectives. Images were acquired using the Carl Zeiss Zen 2.3 software and analyzed using the HALO image analysis platform (Indica Labs).

For Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, images were recorded by STEDYCON (Abberior Instruments) assembled on Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope (Nikon Inc.) and 100×, NA 1.45 Plan Apo objective. Avalanche photodetectors (650–700 nm; 575–625 nm; 505–545 nm; DAPI detection) were used to detect the signals. Browser-based control software (Abberior Instruments) was used to generate STED images. Excitation lasers for STAR RED and STAR ORANGE were run with ~10% laser power and depleted with the STED laser at 97.88% and 100%, respectively. Signals were detected within a 7 ns gate, using a pinhole size 32–64 μm and a pixel size of 10 nm.

Mouse tongue tissue was fixed in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH7.4, CB) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich; G5882) and 0.5% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 15686) for 2 h at room temperature and rinsed two times for 10 min in CB. Samples were postfixed in CB containing 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 19100) in for 1 h, rinsed two times for 10 min in CB, and incubated in CB containing 0.5% of tannic acid (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 21700) for 30 min. After rinsing once in cold acetate buffer (0.1 N) for 10 min, the samples were pre-stained with in acetate buffer with 1% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 22400) for 1 h, rinsed twice in acetate buffer for 10 min each, dehydrated in graded ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, 100%) and propylene oxide, and embedded in EMbed-812 resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 13940). Ultrathin (70 ~ 80 nm) serial sections were sectioned, placed on the formvar-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences; FF2010-Cu-25), and stained with 1% uranyl acetate (in 50% ethanol) and Reynold's lead citrate. Imaging was performed using a FEI Tecnai T12, operating at 80 kV.

To calculate the ‘basal mRNA fraction', maximum projections of ~1 μm thick optical sections of stained tissue were used. The BM-attached cell layer was manually segmented using WGA and β-catenin staining to guide segmentation. A custom script (MATLAB Mathworks; R2021b-R2023b) was used to separate the segmented layer into 10 evenly divided bins from the basal to apical side of a layer, and to measure mRNA fluorescent intensity in each bin after a uniform background subtraction. The fraction of mRNA intensity in each bin was then calculated per layer and used to measure relative fraction of basal mRNA (bottom 30% of a segmented layer). Analysis script is provided as a supplementary file (Supplementary Code 1).

Net1 protein distribution was calculated on a per cell basis by manually segmenting basal keratinocytes in the mouse tongue using the FIJI(2.16.0/1.54 g) image analysis platform59. Segmentation was performed on individual optical slices taken with a 100× objective described above. Cortical Net1 protein mean intensity was measured in the peripheral 15% of the cell then normalized to the most central 65% of the segmented cell. Analysis script is provided as a supplementary file (Supplementary Code 2).

To measure the complex protrusion-like structures at the DEJ we used a metric that reflects DEJ topographical variation (the process is schematically shown in Supplementary Fig. 7). Briefly, using FIJI(2.16.0/1.54 g), a segmented line ROI (120 pixels wide (7.8 μm)) was drawn so that it is centered on the basal cell membrane visualized through Itga6 staining. Itga6 fluorescent intensity was automatically thresholded and skeletonized. The coordinates of the basal cell membrane were estimated for each x-position using the skeletonized image. The x- and y- coordinates from these measurements were then used to create a 2D plot profile from which the absolute distance between the basal cell membrane and the center of the segmentation line was measured for each x-coordinate. Distances were summed and normalized to the number of x-positions measured to yield a single DEJ variation metric. This derived ‘DEJ variation' metric is analogous to ‘Average roughness (Ra)', a common measurement of surface texture60. Analysis script is provided as a supplementary file (Supplementary Code 3).

Fibrillin 2+ fiber volume was measured using 4 μm thick optical stacks acquired from epidermis proximal dermal areas (~50 μm2) using a 100× objective. Imaris (Bitplane; v9.9.0) was used to generate Fbn2+ fiber volumes by thresholding Fbn2 fluorescence intensity equally between samples within a given experiment. Morphological filters were then equally applied across conditions to remove small spherical volumes that were not consistent with fiber segments. The cumulative fiber volume was then measured from all extracellular Fbn2+ fiber volumes in each image.

FISH images of in vitro cultured cells were analyzed using a previously published MATLAB script61. Briefly, the peripheral distribution index (PDI) of individual RNAs was measured by calculating the difference between the geometric centroid of a cell and the intensity weighted centroid of an RNA. This value is then normalized to a hypothetical uniformly distributed RNA. This ratio represents the relative peripheral distribution of an RNA in the context of a cell's geometry. RNAs are considered peripheral if PDI values are greater than 1, homogenous if equal to 1, and perinuclear if less than 1.

Detection of RNA in tissues sections was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent kit v2 (ACD; 323100). Tissues were first pre-processed as follows: fresh frozen tissues were fixed for 45 min in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma) diluted in PBS at room temperature. Samples were washed 3 × 2 min in PBS then sequentially dehydrated in EtOH (50, 70, 100%) and rehydrated in hydrogen peroxide (ACD). Samples were washed twice in distilled water then PBST (0.1% Tween-20). If proteins were co-detected, then antibodies were diluted in Co-Detection Antibody Diluent (ACD; 323160). Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C after the hydrogen peroxide step. Samples were washed 3 × 2 min in PBST. Then the antibodies were fixed for 30 min using 4% formaldehyde then washed 3 × 2 min in PBST. Protease IV (ACD) was applied for 30 min at RT washed 3× in deionized water. Primary RNA probes (Supplementary Table 3) were applied, and the detection protocol was completed according to manufacturer's instructions. Tissues were then counterstained with AF488 conjugated wheat germ agglutin, fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies, and DAPI.

PMOs were detected using the RNAscope Plus smRNA-RNA HD detection kit (ACD; 322780) according to the protocol described above and the manufacturer's instructions. PMO detection probes were used at 1:1000 of the manufacturer's recommended concentration.

For RNA detection in NIH/3T3 cells or mouse keratinocytes, cells were plated on Collagen IV-coated (10 μg/mL; Sigma; C5533) #1.5 glass coverslips for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed for 20 min at RT in 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS; 15710) then processed using the ViewRNA ISH Cell assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific; QVC0001) according to the manufacturer's instructions and probes for individual mRNAs (Supplementary Table 3). Cell mask and DAPI were used as counterstain to detect the cell periphery and nucleus. Samples were mounted in prolong gold.

Bulk RNA was isolated from in vitro cultured cells using either Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 10296010) or RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen; 74134). 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad; 1768891) and used for droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). PCR reactions were prepared with cDNA, gene specific primers, and ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad; 186-4034). Droplets were generated from this reaction using the Automated Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad; 186-4101), PCR was then performed on a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad; 185-1197), and droplet reading was performed on QX-200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad; 186-4003). Results were quantified using the QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad).

Protrusion and cell bodies were isolated from serum-starved NIH/3T3 cells plated on transwell inserts with 3.0 μm porous polycarabonate membrane (Corning) as previously described12. Extracts were isolated using Trizol LS. Isolated RNAs were then quantified using the nanoString nCounter analysis platform and a custom-made codeset, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For western blotting the following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-NET1(1:1000; Bethyl; A303-138A) and mouse anti-α-tubulin (1:2000; Sigma; T6199). Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies from Li-Cor were used at 1:10,000. Membranes were scanned using an Odyssey fluorescent scanner (Li-Cor) and bands were quantified using ImageStudioLite (Li-Cor).

De-identified human samples were collected from normal tissue following Mohs surgery for skin cancer removal. Frozen skin samples were collected and frozen in OCT before sectioning and confirmed to be normal by H&E staining. Under National Institutes of Health protocols, the use of biospecimens from de-identified discarded human tissue does not meet the regulatory criteria for human subject research and therefore institutional review board review or informed consent are waived.

Non-human primate tissues were obtained from the National Institute on Aging's (NIA) Nonhuman Primate Tissue Bank. Fresh frozen tongue biopsies were obtained from 14 to 24 year-old female and male Papio Anubis (Olive Baboons) in the process of necropsy.

Where relevant, data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Individual measurements are shown with differing colors corresponding to individual experiments or animals. Source data are included in the supplement. For statistical comparisons parametric tests were used to evaluate significant differences in normal distributed, homoscedastic datasets. Where either of these assumptions were not true, we instead performed non-parametric tests suitable for the data distribution. Specific statistical tests for each experiment are described in the figure captions. Animal experiments were performed in both male and female mice, but no sex-specific effects were detected so only the aggregated data are shown. In cases where representative images are shown (Figs. 1a, b and h, 2a–d, 3b, 4a, 5b, 5g) similar results were observed in multiple ROIs from samples from at least 3 mice.

Metrics details

Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalized to characterize irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relation between the entropy change of a system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in the relative entropies of the environment. Here, we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to a massless Klein–Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalized entropy production for various system–environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.

Information theory and thermodynamics constitute foundational pillars of modern technology and underpin our understanding of computers and heat engines, respectively. Although these disciplines may seem distinct, they are intricately connected. This connection is encapsulated in Landauer's principle, first articulated in 19611. Landauer understood that erasing a bit of information in a computer is not for free but is, instead, accompanied by a minimal energy cost dissipated to the environment. Subsequently, various experimental studies2,3,4 have confirmed this lower bound on energy dissipation for near-reversible bit erasure. Logical operations thus imply irreversibility, which poses a fundamental theoretical limitation on the design of any small-scale energy-efficient information-processing technologies5.

However, by extending beyond the case of bit erasure, recent influential work6 has generalized the link between information theory and thermodynamics. Using a quantum statistical mechanics framework, that work reinterprets Landauer's principle as a means of relating the entropy change of a system to the energy dissipated to its environment in general out-of-equilibrium processes, not just erasure. This relation can be quantified by a measure of process irreversibility7. Such a broader formulation of Landauer's principle not only deepens its physical importance but also makes this extension particularly relevant for quantum many-body systems, where contributions to irreversibility remain an area of active research, notably for phenomena such as equilibration and thermalization8,9,10,11.

In this work, we employ Landauer's principle to experimentally characterize the irreversibility of an out-of-equilibrium process in the quantum many-body regime by tracking the time evolution of quantum information-theoretic measures. We present a crisp information-inspired interpretation of the correlations present in states of quantum many-body systems in terms of entropic expressions.

Concretely, we consider a system–environment composite initially in the state ϱSE(0) and evolving under a global unitary time evolution U to the state ϱSE(t) = UϱSE(0)U†. The reduced state of the system S (environment E) is ϱS(E)(t) = TrE(S)[ϱSE(t)], where TrE(S) is the partial trace over the environment (system).

First, let us assume that there are no initial correlations between the system and environment and that the environment is in a thermal state \({\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}=\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}/{{\rm{Tr}}}[\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}]\) at inverse temperature βE with respect to its Hamiltonian HE. In this case, the entropy production Σ(t), which is a measure of irreversibility6,7,12, can be decomposed as

Here, the quantum relative entropy

quantifies the deviation of the environment from its initial thermal state. The quantum mutual information

measures the system–environment correlations, where

denotes the von Neumann entropy of a state ϱ.

Now we move on to a more general scenario in which the system and the environment are initially correlated, and the state of the environment deviates from thermal equilibrium. We thereby introduce the generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0), where the initial correlations and deviations from thermal equilibrium are accounted for by a resource cost \(\varSigma (0)={I}_{{{\rm{SE}}}}(0)+D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0) \|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\) (ref. 13), with βE being the effective inverse temperature14,15. Landauer's principle can then be expressed13 as an equality:

which relates the entropy change of the system ΔS ≔ S(ϱS(t)) − S(ϱS(0)) to the energy dissipated to the environment ΔEE: = Tr[(ϱE(t) − ϱE(0))HE]. In this general formulation, depending on the initial state, ΔΣ is not necessarily non-negative16,17. Alternatively, ΔΣ also decomposes into the change of quantum mutual information ΔI = ISE(t) − ISE(0), which expresses how much the system–environment correlations change along the out-of-equilibrium process, as well as the term \(\Delta D=D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(t)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})-D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\), which quantifies how much both the initial state and the final state of the environment are different from the reference equilibrium thermal state. We provide a more thorough motivation for the generalized entropy production ΔΣ in Methods.

Expressed in this form, Landauer's principle serves as a means of tracking changes in information-theoretic quantities, which compose generalized entropy production ΔΣ in two different ways with a single equation. Herein lies the power at the heart of thermodynamics: just as knowing the precise microscopic degrees of freedom, such as the position and momentum of each particle in a classical gas, is not useful for drawing meaningful conclusions about its dynamics, knowing the density matrix of a quantum many-body system is, similarly, not descriptive. In traditional thermodynamics, the relevant quantities that effectively characterize the dynamics are macroscopic variables like changes in pressure or volume. Similarly, for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system, analysing the information-theoretic quantities in Landauer's principle allows a simple characterization of its irreversibility.

So far, no systematic experimental pursuit has probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime. Here, we address this gap by measuring the time evolution of the different terms in equation (5) in a (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field simulator of tunnelling-coupled ultracold Bose gases. This experimental platform has proven to be a suitable test bed for simulating one-dimensional quantum field theories. Previous studies using this set-up have examined the area law of quantum mutual information in thermal equilibrium18 and the propagation of second-19 or higher-order correlations20.

In this experiment, two parallel ultracold clouds of 87Rb atoms (Fig. 1a) were confined in highly anisotropic magnetic traps produced by an atom chip21. The clouds were confined in the axial direction (z) by a parabolic trap superimposed with an optical dipole potential to produce hard walls. In the radial directions (x, y), they were confined by a double-well trap with an adjustable barrier between, created by radio-frequency dressing22. The single-particle tunnelling rate can be modified by the amplitude of a radio-frequency field created by two parallel wires on the atom chip.

a, The experimental system consists of two tunnelling-coupled ultracold 87Rb gases, with a single-particle tunnelling rate J, initially prepared in an initial state described by a global thermal state of the massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. By ramping up a barrier between the condensates, a global mass quench is performed, and the condensates evolve independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for t ≥ 0. b, The atomic clouds are released, and they interfere as they expand. For each experimental realization, we obtained the integrated two-dimensional atomic density with absorption imaging, from which the relative phase profiles were obtained. An example of a fitted phase profile is given for a slice z=z0. c, Using the measured phase–phase correlations, we dynamically reconstructed the covariance matrix for both quadratures. By successively shifting the observation window, we fitted the covariance matrix Γ(t) for different times t. The covariance matrices for the system S and environment E were defined accordingly and used to calculate information-theoretic quantities.

The bosonic quantum field operator for each condensate can be written using the phase–density representation as \({\psi }_{n}(z)=\sqrt{{\rho }_{n}(z)}\operatorname{e}^{\mathrm{i}{\theta }_{n}(z)}\), where θn and ρn denote the phase and density of the respective condensate indexed by n = 1 or 2. In the following, we focus on the operators φ(z) = θ1(z) − θ2(z) and δρ(z) = [ρ1(z) − ρ2(z)]/2, which represent the relative phase and relative density, respectively. These relative degrees of freedom satisfy a similar commutation relation as the original phase and density operators of each condensate, given by [ϕ(z), δρ(z')] = iδ(z − z'). For strong tunnelling-coupling between the two clouds, the relative degrees of freedom are described by a massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian:

which models low-energy phononic excitations and is an approximation to an interacting sine-Gordon Hamiltonian23 (see equation (11) and below for further details). In equation (6), ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the atomic mass, g1D is the effective one-dimensional atomic interaction strength, L = 49 μm is the axial length of the condensates, n1D ≈ 70 μm−1 is the average linear density and J ≈ 2π × 0.8 Hz is the tunnelling rate introduced before. Note that a mass term appears only due to the tunnelling-coupling between the pair of condensates. A single condensate can simulate only a massless Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid model24,25 (HKG with J = 0).

In our experiments, we prepared the Bose–Einstein condensates in a global thermal state HKG with finite tunnelling-coupling (J > 0). Because we wanted to measure the out-of-equilibrium evolution of information-theoretic quantities, we drove the system out of equilibrium by rapidly quenching J to zero (Fig. 1a). We did so by ramping up the barrier between the condensates within approximately 2 ms. This change corresponds to a global mass quench of the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. The condensates then evolved independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for times t up to 65 ms.

At each time step t, we turned off all the traps and let the atoms fall freely for 15.6 ms. The clouds then expanded and interfered, resulting in absorption pictures like the one shown in Fig. 1b, which allowed us to measure the spatially resolved relative phase φ(z) between them. Because the detection process is destructive, the measurements were repeated to gather statistics. In our current experimental set-up, the relative density fluctuations δρ were not directly measurable, which prompted the development of a dynamical tomographic reconstruction technique18,26 to access all the elements of the covariance matrix:

Here, the elements are defined as [Γϕϕ(t)]m,n = 〈ϕ(zm, t)ϕ(zn, t)〉, [Γρρ(t)]m,n = 〈δρ(zm,t)δρ(zn, t)〉 and [Γϕρ(t)]m,n = [Γρϕ(t)]m,nT = 〈(1/2){ϕ(zm, t), δρ(zn, t)}〉, all on a discrete grid with N pixels (m, n ∈ {1, …, N}), which were determined by the resolution constraints of our imaging system, which, thus, introduced an ultraviolet cutoff.

The phase–phase correlations for different evolution times after the quench were measured directly from the extracted relative phase profiles. Assuming that the short-time dynamics after the quench are governed by the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, then as time progressed, the initial eigenmodes of the relative density transformed into the phase quadrature, and the phase quadrature transformed into the relative density. This transformation allowed us to extract information about these eigenmodes by fitting the initial second-order correlation functions for phase–density and density–density with the observed evolution of the phase–phase correlations in momentum space.

The schematics in Fig. 1c illustrate our dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme. We followed the technique in ref. 18 for various input intervals with varying starting points. By scanning the starting points of these input intervals throughout the trapping times, we reconstructed the full covariance matrix at every time t, as depicted in Fig. 1. The interval length (32.5 ms, which is close to L/c ≈ 27 ms, where c is the speed of sound) was selected as it was sufficiently long for the slowest eigenmode to acquire enough dynamical phase for a stable reconstruction, yet short enough to prevent mode interactions from affecting the reconstruction. A detailed overview of this reconstruction process is provided in Methods.

The quadratic form of the pre- and post-quench Hamiltonians allowed us to work within the framework of Gaussian quantum information theory27,28. In this framework, the covariance matrix Γ captured all the accessible information about the state of the composite system during the dynamics, from which we extracted all the information-theoretic quantities of interest in equation (5). As has been demonstrated in various experiments23,29,30,31,32, the quadratic approximation of the Hamiltonian accurately captures the dynamics for the timescales considered. Even if the true dynamics deviates from the Gaussian regime and violates the massless Klein–Gordon theory, a Gaussian extremality argument presented in Supplementary Information Section 4 justifies the Gaussian tomography scheme and provides bounds on the information-theoretic quantities. Thus, based on our dynamical tomographic reconstruction of the covariance matrices, Landauer's principle can also be meaningfully experimentally investigated for interacting models.

Having experimentally reconstructed the post-quench time evolution of the covariance matrices, we partitioned the one-dimensional field of length L into two distinct subregions and split the covariance matrix accordingly (Fig. 1c). Because the quantum field was isolated from its surroundings, one subregion served as the system S with length LS, while the other subregion functioned as the environment E with length LE = L − LS. We probed Landauer's principle (equation (5)) for various system–environment bipartitions by characterizing the generalized entropy production ΔΣ. To do so, we computed the individual contributions βEΔEE, ΔS, ΔI and ΔD.

The results are presented in Fig. 2 as a function of time for different subregion size ratios and in Fig. 3 as a function of subregion size for different times. The timescales are shown in units of ct/L, where \(c=\sqrt{{g}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}{n}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}/m}\approx 1.8\,\upmu\mbox{m}\,\mbox{ms}^{-1}\) is the speed of sound. Overall, a very good fit of the data (circles) was obtained compared to the theoretical calculations (shaded areas), which used the lowest N = 7 modes, considering the imaging resolution of the experiment. The low-lying modes already capture the dynamics of the continuum theory very well. The error bars representing the 68% confidence intervals were obtained from bootstrapping33 with 999 samples and consider the uncertainty in the tunnelling rate and the estimated initial global temperature. The effective inverse temperature of the environment βE with respect to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian was computed using quantum field-theoretic simulations by constructing a global thermal state of the pre-quench massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with the initial global temperature estimated from the experimental data.

a,b, Quantities of Landauer's principle are shown as a function of time for subregion size ratios LS/L = 0.14 (a) and LS/L = 0.43 (b). The legend on the top applies to both panels. For each quantity, the experimental averages are represented by circles with error bars marking the 68% confidence intervals (equivalent to the standard error of the mean) obtained from bootstrapping with 999 samples. The shaded areas show the 68% confidence interval for the theoretical predictions, considering the uncertainty in the estimated temperature and tunnelling rate obtained from bootstrapping with 999 samples. The experimental data agree with the quantum field theory simulation results using Neumann boundary conditions and considering the finite imaging resolution.

First, we examine the decomposition of the generalized entropy production ΔΣ into βEΔEE and ΔS. The term associated with the energy dissipated to the environment, βEΔEE, revealed that a small amount of energy flowed into (or out of) the environment for small (or large) systems around ct/LS = 1. However, this term contributed only minimally to the irreversible post-quench dynamics of the quantum field. By contrast, the entropy change of the system, ΔS, dominated the dynamics and showed a clear linear increase up to ct/LS = 1, followed by more pronounced growth. Notably, in Fig. 2, we present only ΔΣ defined by this first decomposition. However, we also found good agreement with the second decomposition (Supplementary Fig. 2), thus providing evidence that the assumptions underlying Landauer's principle were well satisfied in our experiment.

In comparison to the first, the second decomposition involving ΔI and ΔD shed a slightly different focus on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The largest contribution to ΔΣ, the change in quantum mutual information, ΔI, exhibited similar behaviour to ΔS but with a higher magnitude. This increased magnitude was accounted for by the additional entropy change in the environment. However, ΔI competed with the term proportional to the change of the environment, ΔD, which accounted for both the entropic and energetic changes to the environment. This made ΔD a particularly interesting quantity for characterizing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the environment experimentally. In our case, ΔD decreased, otherwise mirroring the behaviour of ΔS, due to the small energetic contribution.

To interpret the results, we needed to consider the effects of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quantum field, as shown for the quantum field-theoretic simulations in Fig. 4. These boundary conditions can be contrasted with the curved backgrounds that gave rise to the effective boundary conditions discussed in refs. 19,34. The experimental system exhibited Neumann boundary conditions (∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0) due to the vanishing particle current at the edges. Plots contrasting the scaling with subregion size are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.

a,b, Time evolution of the quantities involved in Landauer's principle shown for Neumann boundary conditions (as relevant in the experiment) (a) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (b), using quantum field-theoretic simulations. We interpreted the post-quench dynamics of the global mass quench using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture, as discussed in the text. c,d, Energy density for Neumann boundary conditions (c) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (d). The energetic dynamics can be explained by the difference in the energy density of the initial state at the edges compared to that in the bulk. e, The linear increase in correlations for ct/LS < 1, followed by a plateau, and a linear decrease for ct/LE > 1, can be explained by the linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The effect of the zero mode, present for Neumann boundary conditions, was not captured by the quasiparticle picture for ct/LS > 1. BC, boundary conditions.

However, we first consider simulations with Dirichlet boundary conditions (φ(z)∣z=0,L = 0), which are simpler to understand. Here, the well-established semi-classical quasiparticle picture35 offers a clear and intuitive model for the post-quench dynamics of global mass quenches36,37. The propagation of short-range initial correlations is depicted as occurring through ballistically moving quasiparticles. Following the homogeneous global quench, the initial massive Klein–Gordon thermal state becomes a non-equilibrium state with excess energy relative to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution. This initial state acts as a source of quasiparticle pairs emitted globally from every point across the length of the composite system. Each pair in the bulk consists of two quasiparticles correlated with each other and moving in opposite directions at the same speed. For our set of parameters, due to the finite initial correlation length, there exists a small, localized region where quasiparticles are correlated.

In this quasiparticle picture, the change of quantum mutual information ΔI between the system and environment is proportional to the number of pairs of quasiparticles that are shared between the two different subregions. The spread of correlations of short-range interacting models is described by a linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The increase in correlations is, thus, proportional to the section of the light cone, or in other words, it is proportional to the distance between the quasiparticles of the pair emitted at the system–environment boundary (Fig. 4e). If the system is smaller than the environment, once the first quasiparticle of this boundary pair reaches the edge of the system at ct/LS = 1 and is reflected, the section of the system–environment boundary pair light cone remains constant. The behaviour of ΔI transitions to a plateau value. From a system perspective, the composite system appears to have locally equilibrated to a generalized Gibbs ensemble steady state30,38,39. For finite-size composite systems, the plateau eventually ends again at ct/LE = 1 when the other quasiparticle of the boundary pair reaches the edge. The distance between the two quasiparticles decreases until they meet again at ct/L = 1, which explains the phenomenon of recurrences32,40 (with respect to the correlation functions).

On the other hand, ΔI behaves differently for Neumann boundary conditions. Neumann boundary conditions introduce a zero mode, whose variance does not evolve harmonically like the other momentum modes but quadratically (phase diffusion41,42). The global fluctuations of the zero mode contribute to entropic quantities43, and as they increase with time after a quench, they eventually dominate the contribution of other modes. Because the quasiparticle picture cannot capture this zero-mode feature, its predictions for ct/LS > 1, when a plateau value should be reached, need to be modified under the present Neumann boundary conditions. The above features of the dynamics also apply to the change of system entropy ΔS. In addition, the zero mode restricts the validity of the tomography scheme to ct/L < 1.

The energetic contribution βEΔEE can also be explained using the quasiparticle picture. Initially, βEΔEE remains constant because quasiparticles travelling between the system and the environment carry the same amount of energy, resulting in zero net energy flux. However, a finite-size energy flow becomes apparent when quasiparticles from the edge of the system cross the system–environment boundary. The translational invariance of the homogeneous quench is broken due to the higher energy density at the edges of the composite system for Neumann boundary conditions (the reverse is true for Dirichlet boundary conditions, as the energy density is lower at the edges). This edge region has a size of the order of the initial correlation length. The resulting behaviour of the change of the environment ΔD reflects both the entropic and energetic fluxes.

In this study, we experimentally probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime following a global mass quench in an ultracold atom-based quantum field simulator. By reconstructing the dynamics of the state of the composite system, we examined the information-theoretic quantities related by Landauer's principle, which we interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our approach underscores the general utility of Landauer's principle for characterizing the irreversibility of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems. The way we expressed correlations in terms of entropic quantities with an information-theoretic meaning can be viewed as a vehicle to capture many-body correlations not in equilibrium. The Gaussian extremality argument may offer a pathway to extend our methodology to capture features of out-of-equilibrium processes in interacting models, despite the challenges posed by non-Gaussian effects. A recent alternative approach to studying interacting systems calculates classical entropies of marginal distributions instead of quantum entropies44,45, thereby avoiding the need for tomography. Looking forward, progress has already been made towards investigating a local quench involving two Bose–Einstein condensates at different temperatures being joined together46. This protocol represents a crucial primitive towards developing a quantum field thermal machine47, potentially allowing for Landauer erasure as a mechanism to reduce the entropy of a subregion in the quantum many-body regime, hence functioning as an effective cooling mechanism. Our current work demonstrates the potential of ultracold one-dimensional gases as test beds for quantum thermodynamics in the many-body regime, where complexity, quantum effects and finite size play a crucial role.

Consider a system S and an environment E with a bipartite Hilbert space \({{\mathcal{H}}}={{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{S}}}}\otimes {{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\). For an initial product state \({\varrho }_{{{\rm{SE}}}}={\varrho }_{{{\rm{S}}}}\otimes {\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}\), where the environment is in a thermal state \({\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}=\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}/{{\rm{Tr}}}[\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}]\), the entropy production under global unitary dynamics is given by7

Because it is expressed as a quantum relative entropy, Σ is non-negative due to Klein's inequality48, which is a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. More generally, as in our work, we start with a resourceful initial state that includes both initial correlations ISE(0) and athermality of the environment \(D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\). Although defining temperature for a non-equilibrium state is ambiguous, we determined the effective inverse temperature of the environment βE by demanding that the energy of the environment is equal to that of a Gibbs state, such that \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\equiv {{\rm{Tr}}}[{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\) (ref. 49). This choice also minimized the athermality term. Thus, we defined the resource cost of the initial state as13

Although there is no unique consensus on entropy production for initial non-equilibrium environment states50 and initial correlations51,52, we define Landauer's principle (equation (5)) in terms of generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0) as

This can be derived as in ref. 6. One caveat is that ΔΣ may not necessarily be non-negative, which is a necessary criterion for a strictly valid definition of entropy production. However, this makes sense, as ΔΣ may be considered to be a finite-difference version of the entropy production rate \(\Delta \varSigma =\varSigma (t)-\varSigma (0)=\int_{0}^{t}\,\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }\,({\mathrm{d}\varSigma ({t}^{{\prime} })}/{\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }})\), which also can be negative16,17. Thus, ΔΣ intuitively measures the ‘extra' irreversibility associated with the protocol, excluding the initial resources.

The experimental set-up consisted of a pair of tunnelling-coupled one-dimensional 87Rb quasicondensates, following a protocol implemented previously18. The magnetic fields required to trap the gas in a double-well potential were generated by an atom chip21, which achieved transverse trapping frequencies of ω⊥/2π = 1.4 kHz. After preparing a thermal equilibrium state at a temperature of 49 nK, all traps were turned off. Absorption imaging of the atoms was performed during a free-fall time of 15.6 ms and was used to measure the two-dimensional atomic density distributions. This procedure enabled us to detect the relative phase between the condensates across the length of the quasicondensate using matter interferometry (Fig. 1b). Owing to the destructive nature of the detection process, many repetitions of the experiment were necessary to accumulate numerous phase correlation images throughout the time evolution, thereby also ensuring statistically accurate expectation values.

As discussed in previous works18,23, two tunnelling-coupled quasicondensates can be used as a quantum field simulator of the one-dimensional sine-Gordon model. The relative degrees of freedom of two conjugate variables, the relative phase (φ) and relative density fluctuations (δρ), in the regime of low-energy collective excitations can be described by the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian:

In our experiment, the length of the composite system was set to L = 49 μm, and the mean density n1D = 70 μm−1. The coupling strength between the particles was chosen as g1D = 8.594 × 10−39 kg m3 s−2, and we had an atomic mass m = 1.433 × 10−25 kg. The initial single-particle tunnelling rate was J = 2π × 0.76 Hz. Under these parameters, the experimental system was sufficiently cold and strongly coupled, ensuring that the phase coherence length,

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T temperature, exceeds the healing length of the relative phase,

Hence, the cosine term in equation (11) can be expanded to second order, thus reducing the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian to the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian:

The post-quench evolution is then described by the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with J = 0.

The tomography scheme for reconstructing the initial thermal covariance matrix is detailed in refs. 18,26. Here, we extend this method to dynamically reconstruct the state over time. We provide a brief overview below. Given Neumann boundary conditions, ∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0, then in a box-like potential with length L and average linear atomic density n1D, the relative phase φ(z) and relative density fluctuations δρ(z) can be expanded in Fourier space in terms of the eigenfunctions, fkφ and fkρ, for each mode k:

The post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian (equation (14)) is diagonalized as (indices omitted for brevity from now on)

with u := 2g1D/(ℏL) and

The interaction strength g1D is given by

where as = 5.2 nm is the three-dimensional scattering length. Consequently, the time evolution of modes (k > 0) in Fourier space is

with a non-harmonic time evolution of the zero mode:

As mentioned in the main text and shown in Fig. 1, the covariance matrices can be dynamically tomographically reconstructed by measuring the relative phase profiles using matter interferometry at various times. Subsequently, the relative phase correlations were computed as \({\varPhi }_{m,n}^{2}(t)=\langle (\varphi ({z}_{m},t)-\varphi ({z}_{0},t))(\varphi ({z}_{n},t)-\varphi ({z}_{0},t))\rangle\) with z0 as a reference position. We then expanded this in Fourier space (equation (15)) and expanded the time-evolved operators to express the measured phase correlation function in terms of the covariance matrix elements before the time evolution:

where

Inserting the time evolution equations, we see that the covariance matrix Γ(t) can be obtained by fitting the elements Γφφ;k,l(t), Γρρ;k,l(t) and Γφρ;k,l(t) using the phase-space correlations:

By gathering statistics, we employed the same method as in ref. 18 and simply shifted the window of observation.

We obtained the covariance matrix in momentum space for the first N modes that give physical (positive) occupation numbers. The imaging system was accounted for by a Gaussian point spread function with a standard deviation of 3 μm to estimate the initial state. In this way, we also confirmed the global initial thermal state and extracted a pre-quench temperature. We used discrete cosine eigenfunctions to convert the momentum space correlators to real-space correlators, from which we computed the quantities of interest.

In this section, we delineate how the quantities in Landauer's principle, as expressed in equation (5), were computed using the full covariance matrix Γ in real space defined on a grid of N pixels. First, the von Neumann entropy S(Γ) was computed using the symplectic eigenvalues λn of the covariance matrix Γ (ref. 27). These eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of iΩΓ, where

is the standard kernel of the symplectic form capturing the canonical commutation relations. The von Neumann entropy S(Γ) of a Gaussian state is given by

Given two full covariance matrices corresponding to different times, we partitioned them into system and environment subspace covariance matrices (Fig. 1c), which allowed us to compute the entropy change of the system ΔS and the mutual information ΔI.

Next, we illustrate how we calculated the energy of the environment with respect to the post-quench Hamiltonian. To obtain the correct environment Hamiltonian, we needed to proceed with care. The field corresponding to the environment was discretely defined with NE = N(LE/L) pixels. A naive approach would discretize the continuous Hamiltonian defined over the length of the environment, but this nearest-neighbour phase-coupling Hamiltonian would yield a nonlinear dispersion relation that inadequately describes the physics of the environment for the continuum model used in the experiment. Instead, we started from the environment Hamiltonian of the continuous theory, diagonalized it to obtain a momentum decomposition of infinitely many modes and then truncated the Hamiltonian53 of the environment to a form with a linear dispersion relation while retaining only NE modes:

with uE := 2g1D/(ℏLE) and

Converting back to real-space operators, we derived an effective resolution scale-dependent Hamiltonian:

where

encodes the long-range coupling of the effective Hamiltonian. Here, Δz ≔ L/N is the pixel size and NS(E) is the number of pixels for the system (environment).

The energy of the environment can then be calculated27 as \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]={{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varGamma }^{{{\rm{E}}}}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\), where \({\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\) is a matrix expression given by \({H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}={X}^\mathrm{T}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}X\), with \(X={(\varphi ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\varphi ({z}_{N-1}),\updelta \rho ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\updelta \rho ({z}_{N-1}))}^\mathrm{T}\). Thus, to calculate the energetic contribution βEΔEE, we needed to obtain the inverse temperature of the environment. As indicated in the previous section and detailed in ref. 18, we obtained the inverse temperature of the composite system with respect to the pre-quench Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian experimentally. Subsequently, we constructed the thermal state corresponding to this temperature in the continuum limit simulation. We obtained the inverse temperature of the environment βE for different subregion sizes by demanding that the energy of the environment matches that of a Gibbs state. We then interpolated the profile for each pixel. Note that the post-quench temperature is slightly higher than the temperature measured with respect to the pre-quench Hamiltonian and that βE > 0 is nearly homogeneous across different subregion sizes.

To calculate the energy of a Gibbs state for the environment in the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, we began with the partition function \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})={Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}){Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) (ref. 43), where \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) is the zero-mode partition function and \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) is the harmonic-oscillator partition function. Because of the compactified nature of the field, the zero-mode partition function can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi-theta function. Given our experimental parameters, we approximated it as

The harmonic-oscillator partition function is

The energy is then \({E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})=-{\partial }_{{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}[\log {Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})]={E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})+{E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\), where the zero-mode contribution to the energy is

which approximates to 1/(2βE) for our experimental parameters. The contribution of the harmonic oscillator to the energy is

Consequently, we expressed the quantum relative entropy of the environment state ϱE with respect to a Gibbs state at inverse temperature βE as

and we obtained ΔD accordingly.

Metrics details

Developing a direct carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and methanation method is one of the most important challenges to achieving carbon neutrality. However, converting CO2 into methane (CH4) kinetically requires the activation of stable CO2 at high temperatures (300–500 °C), while the CO2-to-CH4 conversion thermodynamically favours low temperatures. Here we report an efficient mechanochemical CO2 capture and conversion under mild conditions (65 °C). Using commercial zirconium oxide (ZrO2) and nickel catalysts, the mechanochemical CO2 capture capacity was 75-fold higher than the conventional thermochemical process. The mechanochemical CO2 conversion reached a nearly quantitative CO2 conversion (99.2%) with CH4 selectivity (98.8%). We determined that repeatedly induced abundant oxygen vacancies on ZrO2 by dynamic mechanical actions are responsible for efficient CO2 capture and, thus, subsequently spontaneous methanation.

Metrics details

Cortical function, including sensory processing, is surprisingly resilient to neuron loss during aging and neurodegeneration. In this Article, we used the mouse auditory cortex to investigate how homeostatic mechanisms protect the representational map of sounds after neuron loss. We combined two-photon calcium imaging with targeted microablation of 30–40 sound-responsive neurons in layer 2/3. Microablation led to a temporary disturbance of the representational map, but it recovered in the following days. Recovery was primarily driven by neurons that were initially unresponsive to sounds but gained responsiveness and strengthened the network's correlation structure. By contrast, selective microablation of inhibitory neurons caused prolonged disturbance, characterized by destabilized sound responses. Our results link individual neuron tuning and plasticity to the stability of the population-level representational map, highlighting homeostatic mechanisms that safeguard sensory processing in the neocortex.

Sensory information is represented in the cortex in the form of a representational map, where the relational properties of sensory stimuli are encoded in the distances between activity patterns1. The representational map provides a general framework for describing neuronal population activity along sensory–motor transformations2. In sensory areas, the map's structure primarily encodes perceptual relatedness of stimuli. Experimentally, the map structure can be measured by comparing population responses to different stimuli and has been used to assess neuronal function in various sensory domains3,4, including auditory perception5,6.

After its formation during development, the stability of a representational map is continuously challenged during adulthood. At the level of sensory-evoked activity, a continuous reformatting of tuning properties of individual neurons has been described as representational drift7,8,9. Moreover, a continuous drop in and drop out of individual neurons from the population response has been demonstrated in various brain regions4,6,7,10,11,12. A possible mechanism for these functional changes in tuning may lie in the substantial plastic changes in the synaptic structure of neocortical circuits that can be observed under environmentally and behaviorally stable conditions13,14,15.

Beyond changes in synaptic connections, which represent network edges, the loss of neurons (the network's nodes) also challenges the stability of representational maps. Notably, continuous neuronal loss occurs with aging16, and this process accelerates in neurodegenerative diseases. Surprisingly, however, cognitive functions remain remarkably robust during healthy aging and even in advanced prodromal neurodegenerative stages, until a tipping point is reached17,18.

What mechanisms enable cortical networks to remain robust despite these challenges? One possibility is that specific activity patterns rely on a connectivity architecture, allowing them to tolerate substantial network changes without disrupting activity patterns19,20. However, targeted manipulations of a small number of neurons have been shown to notably impact activity21,22 and behavior23,24. This suggests that neuronal activity patterns may not be inherently robust but are instead stabilized by dynamic feedback mechanisms.

In the body, key physiological parameters like blood pressure and body temperature face various short- and long-term disturbances but are maintained within a functional range through homeostatic regulation25. Similarly, homeostasis has been observed in neural systems26, including firing rate homeostasis in individual neurons27 and homeostasis of neuronal network28,29 or pacemaker patterns in the crayfish gastropyloric ganglion30. However, the extent to which homeostatic mechanisms influence and stabilize population dynamics in cortical circuits remains less well understood28.

Here, we investigated the robustness of a representational map following the experimental removal of functionally selected neurons. We found that although the map was initially impaired, it recovered within a few days. Examining single-neuron tuning changes, we found evidence that cortical circuits actively engage various mechanisms to facilitate homeostatic compensation for this loss.

To track the long-term dynamics of sound representations in the mouse auditory cortex, we co-injected two adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to express GCaMP6m as a neuronal activity marker and H2B::mCherry to label nuclei for precise image registration6 (Fig. 1a,b and Methods). Intrinsic signal imaging identified the tonotopic structure for guiding two-photon imaging (Extended Data Fig. 1a). For calcium imaging experiments in awake, head-fixed, passively listening mice, we used a stimulus set of brief (50- to 70-ms) sounds6 consisting of 19 sinusoidal pure tones (PTs) and 15 complex sounds (CSs) characterized by temporally modulated power in multiple frequency bands delivered free field using a calibrated speaker at a 70-dB sound pressure level (34 stimuli in total, 10 repetitions each, presented in a pseudorandom order; Fig. 1c). Mice were habituated to head fixation and pre-exposed to stimuli for at least 1 week (refs. 6,31). In a given mouse, we imaged neuronal activity in six to eight vertically aligned fields of view (FOVs) within layer 2/3, mainly in the primary auditory cortex (Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). Among the ~140–180 neurons per FOV, a small fraction (~10–14%) showed diverse tuning, whereas most remained unresponsive (Fig. 1c). Neuronal populations were tracked across six time points at 2-day intervals and a final session after 4 days (9,451 neurons, 59 FOVs, 9 mice; Extended Data Fig. 1d).

Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with a false discovery rate (FDR) correction (*P < 0.05). See Supplementary Table 1 for details.

Source data

Consistent with previous reports6,32, we observed substantial changes in neuronal responsiveness and tuning over time. Although tuning curves of neurons responsive to any of the 34 stimuli on day 5 tiled the full stimulus set, their responses at earlier and later time points showed a progressively increasing redistribution (Fig. 1d). To quantify tuning changes, we calculated Pearson correlations between tuning curves obtained from individual neurons at different time points by splitting the trials into halves and averaging the responses. For day 5, all trials were used, whereas for other intervals, one half came from day 5 and the other half came from the different imaging days. Tuning correlations showed a gradual, symmetric decline with increasing time intervals (Fig. 1e; data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) across days).

Despite tuning volatility in individual neurons, population-level stability was maintained, consistent with previous reports4,6,10,11. The number of significantly responsive neurons remained comparable across days, with sorted response profiles showing high similarity (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1e). Pearson correlations of tuning curves constructed from split halves of trials within each day were stable, indicating consistent response reliability across trials (Fig. 1g). Similarly, decoding accuracy for pairs of sound stimuli remained stable across imaging sessions when trained and tested on single-trial activity patterns obtained on the same day. However, decoder performance gradually declined when tested using activity patterns recorded at increasing intervals from the training day (Extended Data Fig. 1f).

We next assessed sound representation at the population level using a method analogous to representational similarity analysis1. In each FOV, we created single-trial population response vectors by averaging calcium signal amplitudes within a 400-ms window after sound presentation. A similarity matrix was constructed by calculating the average Pearson correlation of all pairwise combinations of response vectors, with diagonal elements representing same-stimulus pairs and nondiagonal elements representing different-stimulus pairs5,6. To obtain a global measure, we averaged similarity matrices across FOVs for each day (Fig. 1h). This grand-averaged matrix reflects perceptual similarity in mice, predicting generalization in behavioral tasks, and serves as an estimate of the internal representational map of sound relationships5,6 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Therefore, the similarity matrix provides a useful estimate of the internal representational map reflecting behaviorally relevant relational information of sounds. Throughout the experiment, similarity matrices remained highly consistent (Fig. 1h). The average correlation of diagonal and nondiagonal elements stayed comparable to the first 5 days, with only a slight gradual decline (Fig. 1i).

Together, these observations showed that the global structure of the representational map is stably maintained despite a substantial drift in single-neuron tuning and a progressive decorrelation of population response vectors for a given stimulus over days, suggesting that plasticity mechanisms constantly preserve higher-order statistics of the population responses.

To investigate network mechanisms supporting the dynamic maintenance of the representational map, we examined the effects of permanently removing individual neurons. We considered three possible outcomes: (1) a lasting impairment of the map with no compensation, (2) gradual mitigation driven by baseline tuning volatility (passive compensation) or (3) recovery through specific homeostatic processes (active homeostasis).

Toward this end, we used targeted laser microablation21,33 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b), yielding a highly specific and permanent removal of individual, functionally characterized neurons (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 3c–k and Methods).

Top: sorted sound-evoked amplitudes in a FOV before ablation. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, four to eight highly responsive neurons per FOV (six to eight vertically aligned FOVs in layer 2/3 per mouse) were targeted (see Methods). In the nonresponsive microablation cohort, a similar number of nonresponsive neurons were targeted. The control cohort had no ablation on day 6.

Source data

To select neurons for microablation, we analyzed sound-evoked response amplitudes across neurons in each FOV during baseline (days 3 and 5) before microablation on day 6 (Fig. 2c and Methods). We devised two mouse cohorts, one for targeting sound-responsive neurons (ten mice) and one for targeting nonresponsive neurons (ten mice; Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). In each cohort, four to eight neurons per FOV were ablated that were broadly distributed within layer 2/3 (Extended Data Fig. 4e). On average, we ablated 34.1 ± 2.8 neurons per mouse in the sound-responsive cohort and 35.3 ± 2.4 in the non-sound-responsive cohort, ~3% of imaged neurons. This number of individually microablated neurons reflects the maximum achievable in a single session using our procedure.

For the analyses assessing microablation effects on the spared network, we excluded ablated neurons from analysis at all time points. Additionally, we excluded a similar number of neurons with similarly high or low sound-evoked responses to allow comparability across cohorts (‘high-category' and ‘low-category' neurons; Fig. 2c). In both experimental cohorts, neuron numbers and response distributions were comparable across FOVs before microablation (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). We analyzed 10,078 neurons (69 FOVs, ten mice) in the sound-responsive ablation cohort, 10,604 neurons (73 FOVs, ten mice) in the non-sound-responsive ablation cohort and 8,878 neurons (59 FOVs, nine mice) in the control cohort after exclusion of high- and low-category neurons, enabling an unbiased comparison of the effects of microablation on the spared network (Extended Data Fig. 4c–l).

To evaluate the representational map's sensitivity to neuron loss, we constructed averaged similarity matrices for each time point. During baseline, the map remained stable in both the sound-responsive and non-sound-responsive ablation cohorts, similar to the control cohort (Fig. 2d–g and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Notably, after microablating sound-responsive neurons, the similarity matrix showed reduced contrast, with lower correlation values, but gradually recovered to baseline levels (Fig. 2d). This was reflected in the baseline-normalized average correlation along the diagonal, indicating stable population response reliability (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5b). Nondiagonal correlations, representing response similarities between different stimuli, also showed a general recovery, except for day 15 where the correlation did not fully recover but reached a level comparable to that of the control cohort (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5b–g).

By contrast, in the cohort of mice in which non-sound-responsive neurons were mircoablated, the structure of the representational map was largely stable throughout the experiment (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5c–g).

In summary, our analyses revealed that selectively removing 30–40 highly sound-responsive neurons temporarily disrupted the representational map in the spared layer 2/3 neurons. However, the map's structure recovered to baseline levels within 3 days of microablation.

The representational map emerges from the collective statistics of the tuning properties of individual neurons2,34. To explore the link between neuronal activity and representational geometry, we analyzed changes in the responses of individual neurons. A transient drop in the diagonal entries of similarity matrices constructed from single-trial population response vectors suggested a reduced reliability of sound-evoked responses after microablation. Measuring response reliability in individual neurons using tuning curve correlations from subsampled trials (see Methods), we observed a temporary decrease in the sound-responsive ablation cohort, whereas stability was maintained in the other cohorts (Fig. 3a).

a, Baseline-normalized response reliability across trials of all single neurons, averaged per day (orange, sound-responsive ablation; blue, non-sound-responsive ablation; green, control). Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (top asterisks; *P < 0.05) and permutation test across groups (bottom asterisk) on day 7 (sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.034). b, Baseline-normalized correlations averaged across nondiagonal elements in the similarity matrix constructed from trial-averaged population vectors. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test (sound-responsive cohort on day 7: P = 7.90 × 10⁻4; *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001) and permutation test (bottom asterisks; *P < 0.01). c, Fraction of sound-responsive neurons across imaging days. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA across days (P ≥ 0.20 for all the cohorts). d, Baseline-normalized best response amplitude per day. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (top asterisks; sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.98, 4.5 × 10−3, 1.8 × 10−5 and 3.7 × 10−7 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001) and permutation test (bottom asterisks; *P < 0.01). e, Normalized tuning curve of responsive neurons. Stimulus responses were sorted, normalized and averaged across neurons within one of four categories according to their best response amplitude. Top: color-coded amplitude changes on day 7 from baseline. Bottom: normalized tuning curves for neurons with the largest best response category over days (left, sound-responsive ablation; middle, non-sound-responsive ablation; right, control). f, Change in normalized response amplitude at the 15th largest stimulus index across days. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (top; sound-responsive cohort: P = 1.9 × 10⁻3, 0.049, 0.026 and 5.7 × 10⁻5 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001) and permutation test (bottom; *P < 0.05). g, Average baseline-normalized nondiagonal correlations from similarity matrices constructed from population vectors shuffled across FOVs. Shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval. Data were analyzed by permutation test (P < 6.0 × 10⁻3 for all postablation days). Comparisons were made between sound-responsive and control and non-sound-responsive and control cohorts (bottom; *P < 0.01). h, Change in the fraction of highly correlated (>0.7) neuron pairs after baseline subtraction, categorized by best response amplitudes (averaged over the two neurons; sound-responsive ablation: data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, P = 2.8 × 10⁻3 (days), P = 2.6 × 10⁻5 (amplitude bins); non-sound-responsive ablation and control: P > 0.08). i, Change in fraction of high-correlation neuron pairs in the highest response category (h). Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.29, 0.017, 1.7 × 10⁻3 and 1.1 × 10⁻4 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001) and permutation test (bottom; *P < 0.05). Note that the maximal change corresponds to a threefold increase to baseline. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice (except for g and h); n = 10 (sound-responsive ablation), n = 10 (non-sound-responsive ablation) and n = 9 (control). See Supplementary Table 1 for detailed statistics. Yellow vertical lines indicate ablation on day 6.

To isolate the effects of reduced response reliability from other factors contributing to the temporary disturbance in similarity matrices, we first averaged population vectors across trials for each stimulus and then constructed similarity matrices using Pearson correlations (Extended Data Fig. 5h–j). In this case diagonal elements were equal to 1 and remained unaffected by construction. Nondiagonal correlations showed a significant drop on day 7, followed by recovery, although day 15 correlations remained slightly below baseline but matched the control cohort (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5h–j). This suggests that, beyond response reliability, changes in neuronal tuning also contribute to representational map remodeling.

To identify what changes in tuning of individual neurons may be involved, we next investigated several major single-neuron response properties. When categorizing neurons in sound-responsive or non-sound-responsive categories, based on a significant response to at least one stimulus (Methods), we did not observe a significant change in the overall fraction of sound-responsive neurons (Fig. 3c).

The average response amplitude elicited by the stimulus giving rise to the maximal response (best response amplitude) increased in the cohort where sound-responsive neurons were microablated (Fig. 3d). Notably, this effect emerged only days later, suggesting that it contributed to the recovery of the representational map rather than its initial disturbance (Fig. 3d).

Given that broader or narrower tuning in individual neurons can increase or decrease the correlation between two population responses to different stimuli, we examined changes in tuning width in responsive neurons. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, but not the others, tuning width decreased the day after microablation, especially in neurons with large response amplitudes (Fig. 3e,f). Artificially narrowing baseline tuning curves to a similar degree reproduced the reduction in nondiagonal correlations in similarity matrices (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Thus, reduced tuning width, along with decreased response reliability, likely contributed to the transient disturbance of the representational map. However, as tuning remained narrow in later days, additional single-neuron changes may underlie the map's recovery.

To assess whether changes in second-order response statistics contribute to recovery, we shuffled data from a given day by permuting neurons across FOVs and mice, preserving single-neuron properties while disrupting local tuning correlations. Constructed similarity matrices from shuffled, trial-averaged data showed a general decline in normalized correlations across all cohorts (Fig. 3g). In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, correlations were lower on day 7, aligning with previous findings. However, unlike the original data, no recovery was observed in shuffled data after microablation (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 5l–n). This suggests that second-order correlations in local response patterns may play a role in representational map recovery.

As a simple readout of local second-order response statistics, we quantified the fraction of responsive neuron pairs in the spared network with high signal correlations (>0.7) per day. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, this fraction increased over time, particularly among neurons with large best response amplitudes (Fig. 3h, left), while remaining unchanged in the other cohorts (Fig. 3h, right). Compared to the control cohort, the delayed increase was specific to the sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 3i), suggesting that tuning in the spared network became more locally homogeneous.

In summary, our analysis suggests that the transient drop in response reliability and tuning width primarily disrupts the representational map, whereas the delayed increase in local signal correlations helps to restore it. Responses to PTs and CSs in spared layer 2/3 neurons were similarly affected by microablation (Extended Data Fig. 6).

The previous analyses focused on single-neuron responses per imaging day, without considering their history of sound-evoked responses in earlier sessions. However, our initial analyses (Fig. 1) showed that, under basal conditions, individual neurons continuously change their responsiveness over days. We next examined how targeted neuron loss affects this drift by quantifying the overlap of neurons showing significant sound responses on two subsequent imaging days. After ablating sound-responsive neurons, the stability of sound responsiveness significantly decreased and remained low throughout the experiment. By contrast, responsiveness in other cohorts remained at baseline levels (Fig. 4a), indicating that microablation induces a longer-lasting increase in the drift rate of sound responsiveness.

a, Response stability quantified as the fraction of neurons classified as sound responsive on two consecutive imaging days. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA across days (right asterisk; *P < 0.01) and two-sided t-test between baseline change and change from days 5 to 7 (bottom asterisk; *P < 0.01). b, Top: schematic illustrating the categorization of neurons based on responsiveness on day 5 before microablation. One group (left) included neurons responsive on day 5, tracking their responses on all other days regardless of continued responsiveness. The other group (right) included neurons unresponsive on day 5 but classified responsive on other days. Bottom: normalized best response amplitude across cohorts. Left: data were analyzed by t-test (day 3 versus day 7, sound-responsive cohort: P = 4.54 × 10⁻4; ***P < 0.001; group comparison on day 7, one-sided t-test, FDR correction, *P < 0.05). Right: data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA across days (right asterisk; *P < 0.01). c, Change in tuning width for neurons responsive on day 5 (left) and for neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on another day (right), measured as normalized response amplitudes of the 15th stimulus in the sorted tuning curve (same as Fig. 3f). Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test (sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.011, 0.25, 0.011 and 1.0 × 10−3 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15; *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001) and permutation test across groups (bottom asterisks; *P < 0.05). d, Change in the fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation, both responsive on day 5. Color maps show the difference in fraction normalized to baseline for four categories of neuron pairs sorted by their mean best response amplitude (left: sound responsive; middle: non-sound responsive; right: control). For the sound-responsive cohort, data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (P = 9.5 × 10−5 across days, P = 0.0010 across amplitude bins) and t-test (days 9–15, P = 8.7 × 10−6). For the non-sound-responsive and control cohorts, P > 0.37, except the control cohort (P = 0.039 across days). e, Change in fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation in the largest best response category (d). Data were analyzed by permutation test (sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.010, 0.035, 0.13 and 0.21 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively); *P < 0.05. f,g, Same as d and e but for pairs of neurons categorized as unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on the other day (sound-responsive cohort: two-way ANOVA (f; left: P = 0.012 across days, P = 0.028 across amplitude bins) and t-test (days 9–15, P = 0.034); non-sound-responsive and control cohorts: (f; middle and right) P > 0.22, except non-sound-responsive (P = 0.044 across amplitude bins); permutation test (g; sound-responsive cohort: P = 0.91, 0.21, 0.040 and 0.010 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively); *P < 0.05). h,i, Same as d and e but for mixed pairs (one responsive on day 5 and one categorized as unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on the other day). Note the strong increase in pairs with high signal correlation that were categorized as unresponsive on day 5 (sound-responsive cohort: two-way ANOVA (h; left: P = 0.89 across days, P = 0.038 across amplitude bins); non-sound-responsive and control cohorts: (h; middle and right) P > 0.059; permutation test (i; all postablation days: P > 0.11 for all cohorts)). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice (except for d, f and h); n = 10 (sound-responsive ablation), n = 10 (non-sound-responsive ablation) and n = 9 (control). Yellow vertical lines indicate the time point of ablation procedure. See Supplementary Table 1 for detailed statistics.

We next tested how microablation-induced changes in response properties relate to the history of responsiveness of individual neurons. We considered two categories of neurons: neurons displaying significant sound responses on day 5 before the microablation and neurons with no significant sound responses on day 5 but that were responsive on another imaging day.

We re-examined the increase in best response amplitudes after ablating sound-responsive neurons. In previously responsive neurons of the first category, best response amplitudes on day 7 were significantly lower in the sound-responsive ablation cohort and less reduced in the non-sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 4b). However, in neurons that remained responsive after microablation, amplitudes stayed comparable to baseline (Extended Data Fig. 7a), suggesting that the overall reduction was mainly due to a fraction of neurons losing all responsiveness.

In neurons of the second category that were nonresponsive on day 5 but showed responses on other days before or after microablation32 (Extended Data Fig. 7b), best response amplitudes increased substantially but with a delay after ablating sound-responsive neurons (Fig. 4b). This indicated that the overall increase in best response amplitudes (Fig. 3d) is mainly driven by neurons that gained responsiveness after microablation.

We examined the spatial spread of microablation-induced effects on best response amplitude (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f). In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, where changes were observed, these effects were mainly confined to neurons within ~200 μm of the ablated neurons.

Reanalyzing the narrowing of tuning width (Fig. 3f), we found a more pronounced effect in neurons that were responsive before microablation in the sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 4c, left). By contrast, tuning width remained stable in the other cohorts. Neurons that were unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on other days showed a smaller reduction in tuning width across all cohorts (Fig. 4c, right, and Extended Data Fig. 7g), suggesting that the narrowing primarily stems from neurons that were responsive before microablation.

We revisited the increase in neuron pairs with high signal correlations (Fig. 3h,i) by again categorizing neurons by their responsiveness before microablation. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, neuron pairs that were both responsive before microablation showed a slight decrease in high signal correlations, with no change in other cohorts (Fig. 4d,e). However, pairs of neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on other days showed a marked increase in high correlations 3–9 days after sound-responsive ablation, particularly in pairs with the largest best responses, whereas no change occurred in other cohorts (Fig. 4f,g). Pairs where one neuron was responsive and the other was unresponsive before microablation showed no overall change (Fig. 4h,i). A subset, namely pairs between neurons that maintained responsiveness and previously unresponsive neurons, exhibited a strong increase in high correlations after sound-responsive ablation, absent in other cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 7h,i).

Together, our analysis of the increase in highly correlated neuron pairs, considering their response history, revealed that neurons gaining responsiveness after microablation play a disproportionately large role.

Until now, we examined how microablation affects general neuronal response features, including reliability, responsiveness, amplitude and tuning width. Next, we investigated its impact on specific neuronal tuning in reference to the preablation population response represented by high-category neurons on day 5 (high-category neurons, Fig. 2c and Methods).

For each mouse, we calculated pairwise signal correlations between all spared neurons on a given day, regardless of their responsiveness, and the high-category neurons from day 5. This produced a distribution with a mode near 0, as most neurons were not sound responsive (Extended Data Fig. 7j). We then grouped neurons based on whether they were responsive on day 5 or became responsive on another day. The pairwise correlations in both groups were skewed toward higher signal correlations, reflecting a regional tuning bias. Finally, we binned the signal correlation distributions and normalized to baseline (days 1 and 3).

In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, we found that fewer neurons that were responsive before ablation retained tuning similar to the ablated high-category neurons, whereas a larger fraction of newly responsive neurons after ablation showed similar tuning (Fig. 5a,d and Extended Data Fig. 7k). The non-sound-responsive ablation cohort showed a weaker effect (Fig. 5b,d). In the control cohort, consistent with an ongoing, basal reformatting of tuning properties, we observed a decline in high signal correlation pairs for previously responsive neurons and a slight increase for newly responsive neurons (Fig. 5c,d).

a, Tuning shifts in the sound-responsive ablation cohort. Left: scheme of signal correlation analysis with reference to the tuning of highly responsive neurons (high category) on day 5 before microablation (red, responsive neurons; dark red outline, high-category neurons on day 5; blue, unresponsive neurons; black, ablated neurons). Note, signal correlations of spared neurons for a given day were calculated using the tuning of high-category neurons on day 5 (empty circle with dark red outline). Right: color map showing the baseline-subtracted fraction of neurons within each bin of signal correlations for spared neurons responsive on day 5 (top) and neurons not responsive on day 5 but responsive on the other day (bottom). Bar plots next to the color map are fractions of neurons for given signal correlation bins averaged across baseline days (days 1 and 3) in each split group (data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. across mice). b, Same as a but for the non-sound-responsive cohort. c, Same as a but for the control cohort. d, Baseline-normalized change in fraction of spared neurons with high signal correlation (>0.6) toward high-category neurons (data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. across mice). Top: spared neurons responsive on day 5; data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA over days (asterisk on the right; *P < 0.01; see Supplementary Table 1) and two-sided t-test with FDR correction (two-colored asterisks on top; *P < 0.05) between each two of the three experimental cohorts on postablation days. Bottom: spared neurons unresponsive on day 5 but that gained responsiveness on a given day. Data were analyzed by one-sided t-test with an FDR correction (two-colored asterisks on top) between each combination of the three experimental cohorts on postablation days (*P < 0.05) and by one-sided t-test with FDR correction (asterisk at bottom) between baseline days (days 1 and 3) and late postablation days (days 9, 11 and 15) for a given cohort (*P < 0.05); n = 10 mice for sound-responsive ablation, n = 10 mice for non-sound-responsive ablation, and n = 9 mice for control. Yellow vertical lines indicate the time point of ablation procedure.

These analyses suggest that neurons responsive before microablation lose signal correlations to the preablation tuning of high-category neurons, likely due to increased responsiveness loss. By contrast, newly responsive neurons are more likely to develop high signal correlations with the preablation tuning of high-category neurons.

The balance of activities in excitatory and inhibitory neurons is known to adjust during neuronal network reorganization27,35,36. To assess this in our experiments, we co-injected an AAV vector labeling inhibitory neurons (AAV-mDlx-NLS::tagBFP) alongside AAVs for GCaMP6m and H2B::mCherry in a subset of mice (n = 5 sound-responsive ablation, n = 5 non-sound-responsive ablation, n = 7 control; Fig. 6a). This resulted in ~10% of mCherry-labeled nuclei also expressing blue fluorescent protein (tagBFP). Control experiments in mice expressing GAD67–green fluorescent protein (GAD67–GFP) confirmed highly specific tagBFP expression in GFP+ neurons (Extended Data Fig. 8a,b).

Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (postablation excitatory neurons: P > 0.30 for all cohorts; inhibitory neurons in the sound-responsive cohort: *P < 0.05). e, Same as Fig. 3d but normalized best response amplitude of responsive excitatory (left) and inhibitory (right) neurons. Data were analyzed by one-sided t-test with an FDR correction (sound-responsive cohort for days 7, 9, 11 and 15: excitatory neurons, P = 0.45, 0.045, 1.7 × 10−3 and 3.0 × 10−4; inhibitory neurons, P = 0.053, 0.043, 0.078 and 0.17; top asterisks: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001) and permutation test comparing ablation cohorts to the control cohort (bottom asterisks; *P < 0.05). f, Same as Fig. 4a but normalized fraction of neurons responsive on two consecutive days for excitatory (left) and inhibitory (right) neurons across cohorts. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test comparing overlap during baseline (days 1 → 3 and 3 → 5) versus postablation (days 5 → 7, 7 → 9, 9 → 11 and 11 → 15; *P < 0.05) and by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction for group comparisons in the postablation period (right side, two-colored asterisks; *P < 0.01). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice for b–f; sound-responsive ablation (n = 5), non-sound-responsive ablation (n = 5) and control (n = 7), except for permutation tests. Vertical yellow lines indicate the time point of ablation procedure. See Supplementary Table 1 for detailed statistics.

As seen in previous studies37,38, inhibitory neurons had moderately broader tuning than excitatory neurons during baseline (Fig. 6b and Extended Data Fig. 8c). We then examined whether microablation affected excitatory and inhibitory neurons differently. Similar to Fig. 3a, excitatory neurons showed reduced response reliability across trials after sound-responsive neuron ablation, recovering in later days (Fig. 6c, left). Inhibitory neurons also exhibited reduced reliability, but the effect was delayed and more pronounced (Fig. 6c, right). This suggests that microablation transiently disrupts response reliability in both neuron types, with a stronger impact on inhibitory neurons.

The fraction of sound-responsive neurons was similar between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, with inhibitory neurons showing a slightly higher fraction during baseline (Fig. 6d). Microablation had little effect on the fraction of neurons contributing to the population response, except for a reduction in inhibitory neurons on day 11 (Fig. 6d).

We next examined how microablation affected best response amplitudes in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, excitatory neurons showed an increase, whereas inhibitory neurons exhibited a transient decrease until day 9, normalizing by day 15 (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 8d). In the non-sound-responsive ablation cohort, inhibitory neurons showed a similar decrease with later recovery, whereas excitatory neurons remained largely unchanged. No significant changes were observed in the control cohort. Analyzing total sound-evoked activity in both neuron types by calculating the product of the fraction of responsive neurons and the average best response amplitude (Methods), we found a temporary shift toward excitatory neurons in both ablation cohorts, which returned to baseline by day 15 (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Calcium transient decay times remained stable, suggesting changes in neuronal activity rather than altered calcium-binding protein expression (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g).

Revisiting microablation-induced changes in tuning width, signal correlations and best response amplitudes (Extended Data Fig. 8h–k), we found no significant differences between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, likely due to the smaller sample size of inhibitory neurons, reducing analysis sensitivity.

We examined the stability of excitatory and inhibitory neuron responsiveness, quantifying again the overlap of sound-responsive neurons on consecutive days. Following microablation of sound-responsive neurons, stability decreased in both cell types, with a more pronounced reduction in inhibitory neurons (Fig. 6f).

Together, our analysis revealed similar microablation-induced effects on response reliability, responsiveness and tuning width in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting a general degree of co-tuning. However, network reorganization after microablation led to a shift in sound-evoked responses toward excitatory neurons.

Interneurons are crucial for cortical network stability and plasticity35,36,39. To assess the impact of selectively removing inhibitory neurons, we conducted an experiment again identifying these cells using the mDlx-driven blue fluorescent reporter (n = 6 mice; Fig. 7a). Unlike previous cohorts, where mostly excitatory neurons were ablated, we focused on sound-responsive inhibitory neurons. Due to their lower density (~10% of the local population; Extended Data Fig. 8a), we also ablated some nonresponsive inhibitory neurons to match the number removed in other cohorts (Fig. 7b, Extended Data Fig. 4a–e and Methods).

Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test of normalized average correlation between baseline days and days after ablation with an FDR correction (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.001) and by one-way ANOVA of normalized average correlation across days in diagonal elements (P = 3.3 × 10−3) and nondiagonal elements (P = 0.068; see Supplementary Table 1). Yellow vertical lines indicate the time point of ablation procedure. For comparison, the analogous effect of sound-responsive ablation of all neurons (mostly excitatory) is depicted in Fig. 2.

Source data

Removing inhibitory neurons disrupted the representational map, similar to the sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 7c). However, while recovery occurred within 3 days in the latter, it was notably delayed in the inhibitory neuron ablation cohort (Fig. 7c,d and Extended Data Fig. 9a–c).

Next, we analyzed the single-neuron response properties associated with the removal of inhibitory neurons. Removing inhibitory neurons led to a sustained reduction in response reliability, unlike the transient drop seen in the sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 8a). However, tuning properties remained largely unchanged, as indicated by stable nondiagonal correlations in the similarity matrix constructed from trial-averaged population responses (Fig. 8b). Thus, inhibitory neuron ablation primarily affects response reliability rather than tuning properties.

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (P = 0.027), two-sided t-test between baseline and postablation days with an FDR correction (top asterisks; *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01) and permutation test for group comparisons (bottom asterisks; *P < 0.05). b, Baseline-normalized correlations averaged across nondiagonals in the similarity matrix constructed from trial-averaged population vectors.

Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (P = 0.47), two-sided t-test (P > 0.13 for all postablation days) and permutation test (P > 0.13 for all postablation days). e, Change in normalized response amplitudes from baseline at the 15th largest stimulus index in the tuning curve (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (P = 0.34, 0.043, 0.17 and 0.34 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15; *P < 0.05) and permutation test (P > 0.085 for all postablation days). f, Change in fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation in the largest best response category (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test with an FDR correction (P = 0.079, 0.017, 0.10 and 0.15 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15; *P < 0.05) and permutation test (P > 0.17 for all postablation days). g, Response stability as the fraction of neurons categorized as sound responsive on two consecutive days. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test: baseline (1 → 3, 3 → 5) versus postablation (5 → 7), P = 0.026; inhibitory neuron ablation versus control during 7 → 9 and 9 → 11, P = 0.048. *P < 0.05. h, Tuning shifts in the inhibitory ablation cohort relative to preablation population tuning. Left: same scheme as Fig. 5 but inhibitory neurons were ablated (black). Right: color map of baseline-subtracted fractions of spared neurons within each bin of signal correlations with day 5 high-category neurons (top: day 5 responsive spared neurons; bottom: spared neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on other days). The bar plots next to the color map are baseline-averaged fractions of spared neurons in each split group (see Fig. 5). i, Baseline-subtracted change in fraction of spared neurons with high signal correlation (>0.6) toward high-category neurons in inhibitory neuron ablation and control cohorts. Top: day 5 responsive spared neurons. Bottom: spared neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on other days. Data were analyzed by two-sided t-test: ablation versus control (top: P = 0.025, 6.1 × 10⁻3, 5.3 × 10⁻3, 2.8 × 10⁻3 and 0.018 for days 5, 7, 9, 11 and 15; bottom: P = 0.35, 0.028, 0.072 and 0.24 for days 7, 9, 11 and 15, respectively). Top asterisks, *P < 0.05. Bottom, data were analyzed by t-test between baseline and days 9–15 (bottom asterisk; *P < 0.05). Control cohort data were replotted for comparison; refer to Figs. 3a–f, 4g and 5h–i. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice; inhibitory neuron ablation n = 6 and control n = 9, except for permutation tests. See Supplementary Table 1 for full statistics.

Consistently, repeating our analyses in the inhibitory neuron ablation cohort revealed no tuning property changes comparable to the sound-responsive ablation cohort (Fig. 8c–f (fraction of responsive neurons, best response amplitudes, width of tuning and fraction of pairs of neurons with high signal correlations, respectively) and Extended Data Fig. 9d–f). However, microablation of inhibitory neurons led to a reduced overlap of responsive neurons across days, indicating an increased drift in responsiveness (Fig. 8g).

We next again analyzed signal correlations of spared neurons on a given day to those neurons central in forming the population response before microablation, that is, the high-category neurons. Responsive neurons on day 5 showed a marked drop in high signal correlations (Fig. 8h,i, top), whereas neurons gaining responsiveness had an increased likelihood of high signal correlations (Fig. 8h,i, bottom).

Together, we observed that the targeted ablation of different neuron classes from the network caused specific changes in single-neuron properties at multiple timescales that underlie a transient impairment of the representational map, but also its subsequent recovery.

We used the representational map, formed by the population responses to a set of auditory stimuli, as a readout of auditory cortical function1,2. Despite stable environmental and behavioral conditions, individual neurons exhibited substantial volatility in their tuning properties, consistent with previous findings in the auditory cortex6,32 and other brain regions4,7,10,11,12. Notably, the relative distances between stimuli in the neuronal coding space remained unchanged, preserving the overall structure of the representational map4,40,41,42. Because the total responsiveness summed over all neurons remained stable, these changes likely reflect rotational shifts in the representation's geometry34.

To examine the impact of neuron loss on network function, we selectively removed 30–40 sound-responsive neurons. We found that this manipulation was sufficient to transiently disrupt the correlational structure of the population responses underlying the representational map. Linking this global change in sensory representation to properties of individual neurons2,34, we delineated the contributors to the disruption as well as the homeostatic recovery of the map. The removal of excitatory neurons reduced response reliability and led to long-lasting tuning narrowing, but recovery occurred within 3 days, driven by newly responsive neurons with highly correlated tuning (Extended Data Fig. 10a). By contrast, inhibitory neuron removal caused a more prolonged disturbance, primarily linked to a sustained decline in response reliability, delaying recovery beyond 5 days (Extended Data Fig. 10b)43,44.

In recent years, the role of interneurons in shaping sensory responses has been explored through acute optogenetic manipulation of specific subclasses45,46,47. However, direct comparisons to our study are challenging, as we used the mDlx enhancer to broadly label interneurons for microablation and assessed effects only after ~24 h (ref. 48). Notably, studies on genetic mouse models with developmental interneuron loss, similar to our findings, did not show general disinhibition but rather mildly narrowed tuning and decreased excitatory responses49,50.

Analyzing signal correlations between spared neurons and neurons that strongly contributed to the population response (high-category neurons) before microablation revealed contrasting effects in preablation responsive neurons and those gaining responsiveness. In particular, the removal of highly responsive neurons or the removal of inhibitory neurons led to a reduction of preablation responsive neurons with high signal correlations, likely due to increased rates of losing responsiveness to sounds. Meanwhile, neurons gaining responsiveness were more likely to develop tuning similar to high-category neurons before ablation.

These observations suggest two possible processes. First, the loss of signal correlation in preablation responsive neurons may indicate destabilization, as their tuning relies on recurrent interactions within the subset. The loss of members may disrupt this network similar to reports in the somatosensory cortex after touch neuron ablation21. Second, the increase in signal correlations in neurons gaining responsiveness may reflect the latent potential of some unresponsive neurons to adopt tuning similar to highly responsive neurons. These neurons might be suppressed by inhibitory circuits and only become sound responsive when this inhibition is lifted. The slow recovery of the representational map over several days suggests that this disinhibition involves slower plasticity mechanisms beyond acute alterations in synaptic inputs.

The high sensitivity of the similarity matrix to the removal of a small number of neurons suggests that the apparent stability of the representational map under basal conditions does not stem from a redundant or intrinsically stable network. Instead, it relies on plasticity mechanisms continuously maintaining functionality29,51,52,53,54. Although these mechanisms effectively manage ongoing tuning changes under normal conditions, they can be temporarily challenged by the rapid loss of specific neurons. Similar selective changes in circuit function and behavior due to subtle neuronal manipulations have been observed in various contexts21,22,23,24,33.

As outlined above, theoretically, three major scenarios were conceivable regarding the long-term dynamics of the map after its disruption: (1) an irreversible impairment due to the permanent loss of neurons (no compensation), (2) gradual mitigation through ongoing tuning volatility (passive compensation) or (3) engagement of homeostatic processes to restore the map (active homeostasis). Our findings, showing map recovery alongside specific changes in single-neuron properties, are inconsistent with scenarios 1 and 2. Instead, the delayed increase in signal correlations (Fig. 3h) and the shift in excitatory/inhibitory response amplitudes (Fig. 6e) align with scenario 3. Similar changes in inhibition have been observed in other scenarios when cortical circuits adapt to activity silencing or sensory perturbations36,55,56,57,58. However, because tuning changes from day to day occurred at similar rates after excitatory and inhibitory neuron ablation but were associated with different recovery times, their exact role in homeostatic recovery remains unclear.

Within the homeostasis framework, the dynamic network reorganization following neuron removal suggests that the correlational structure of the representational map may itself be a controlled variable being returned to its set point30. Here, single-cell changes act as the effectors shaping the representational map. The finding that the ablation of selected neurons, a permanent challenge to the representational map, induces changes in the effectors that outlast the map's recovery is expected, as they typically do not operate in parallel with the controlled variable59. Considering much longer periods after the ablation beyond our observation period, however, ongoing neuronal tuning changes would likely restore single-cell properties to baseline. Future investigations of homeostatic mechanisms preserving higher-order brain functions will be of interest28, as classic homeostatic models based on firing rate fail to explain regulation across network scales60,61. Furthermore, the nature of a putative control center eventually computing a deviation from the set point to activate effectors is still elusive.

We propose that the ability to compensate for the loss of microablated neurons by the selective recruitment of previously unresponsive neurons at the microcircuit level may also serve as a mechanism by which brain function may be upheld for extended periods of neuronal loss during aging and prodromal stages of neurodegenerative disease17,18.

All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the German Laboratory Animal Law guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Landesuntersuchungsamt Rheinland Pfalz (approval 23 177-07/G 17-1-051).

Experimental subjects were male 4- to 6-week-old C57BL/6JRj mice obtained from Janvier Laboratories. A male and a female mouse from the transgenic strain expressing GAD67–GFP were obtained from a breeding in-house. Before surgical procedures, mice were kept in groups of four and housed in 530 cm2 cages on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 55 ± 10%) with unlimited access to dry food and water. Experiments were performed during the light period.

For the rAAV genome encoding GCaMP6m62 under the human SYN1 promoter and the rAAV encoding H2B–mCherry, two plasmids were generated as described before6. To elaborate the plasmid containing a gene encoding tagBFP, preceded by three nuclear localization signals under the mDlx enhancer sequence (pAAV-mDlx-NLS-tagBFP), we started from the commercially available plasmid AAV-mDlx-NLS-mRuby2 (Addgene plasmid 99130) and a plasmid for tagBFP in our lab stock (TRE-NLS-tagBFP, which is modified from Addgene plasmid 92202). The NLS-tagBFP sequence was PCR amplified from plasmid pAAV-TRE-NLS-tagBFP. The resulting PCR product was digested with the respective enzymes and purified. From AAV-mDlx-NLS-mRuby2, NLS-mRuby2 was excised with the restriction enzyme, and the NLS-BFP sequence was ligated into the cut and purified. The integrity of the final plasmid pAAV-mDlx-NLS-tagBFP was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All plasmids described above were packaged into AAV8 capsid as previously described63. Constructs used in this study are available upon request from the authors.

We followed the procedures as previously described in detail6. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (maintained at 1.2–1.5%) and mounted on a stereotaxic device. Injections were performed perpendicular to the surface of the skull. The virus solution consisted of a mixture of two different rAAVs (rAAV8-hSyn-GCaMP6m-WPRE-hGHpolyA; titer: 1.35 × 1011 viral genomes (vg) per ml; rAAV8-hSyn-H2B–mCherry-hGHpolyA; titer: 2 × 1013 vg per ml) in PBS. For another subset of experiments, rAAV8-mDlx-NLS-tagBFP-WPRE-hGHpolyA (titer: 2.16 × 1011 vg per ml) was additionally mixed with the foregoing rAAVs. In total, 175 nl of the virus mixture loaded into a glass pipette was injected in five locations (20 nl min–1, total volume of 875 nl) along the anterior–posterior axis with coordinates 4.4, −2.3/−2.6/−2.9/−3.2/−3.5, 2.5 (in mm, lateral, caudal, and ventral to bregma) to cover the right auditory cortex. Several days after the injection, mice were again anesthetized using isoflurane (maintained at 1.2–1.5%) and mounted on a stereotaxic device with a custom-made v-shaped head holder. After the parietal and temporal bones were exposed, the skull above the auditory cortex (2 × 3 mm) was gently drilled, and the bone was carefully lifted. The craniotomy was covered with a small cover glass fixed with dental cement. To position the window plane perpendicular to the objective under the microscope, a custom-made titanium head post was mounted on the frontal bone and embedded with dental cement. After the surgical procedure, animals were single housed and recovered for at least 1 week before further handling.

We habituated mice to handling at the two-photon microscope. Mice were fixated under the objective in a custom-made acrylic glass tube using a custom-made head post. The mouse head was laterally tilted such that the surface of the auditory cortex aligned with the horizontal plane. Habituation was repeated for at least 7 days, the duration of which increased from around 10 min on the first day to around 2 h on the last day, comparable to the duration of two-photon imaging in 1 day. Habituation ended when mice were accommodated to the head fixation apparatus. Because the sound stimulus set for longitudinal two-photon imaging was presented dozens of times each day, animals repeatedly experienced all sound stimuli before data acquisition.

We identified the functional organization of auditory fields to set the location of calcium imaging within the fields via intrinsic signal imaging. We followed a previously reported protocol32. Mesoscopic optical imaging was conducted using a CCD camera (Vosskuehler, CCD1200QD; frame rate of 25 Hz) with macroscope objectives. Intrinsic signals were recorded at 400 μm below the brain surface from near-infrared (780 nm) LEDs under isoflurane anesthesia (concentration of 1.0–1.2%), while presenting 18 PT pips (80-ms-long individual pips with 20-ms smooth gaps; 1.8 s of the total stimulus duration) with different tone frequencies (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 kHz) and white noise bursts in 30 randomized trials. The sound intensity was set at a sound pressure level of 70 dB. The change in light reflectance between pre- and poststimulus images was computed and averaged across trials.

All sounds were delivered free field by a ribbon loudspeaker a distance of 25 cm from the mouse head in a soundproof booth. The stimulus set consisted of 34 sound stimuli (19 PT pips (50 ms; 2–45 kHz separated by a quarter octave) and 15 CSs (70 ms)) separated by a 1-s interval, as described in the previous study6. The CSs were generated from arbitrary samples of music pieces or animal calls replayed at fourfold speed. In a subset of mice across all experimental cohorts, a set of nine conspecific vocalizations (<80 ms) was presented during habituation and during imaging but was not included for further analyses in this study. All stimulus onsets and offsets were smoothened by a cosine ramp function with a duration of 10 ms, respectively. The stimulus set was presented with ten repetitions per stimulus in a pseudorandom order for each FOV at a sound pressure level of 70 dB.

The imaging configuration and procedure have been described in detail previously6. Two-photon calcium imaging was performed with a commercial microscope (Ultima IV, Bruker Corporation) with a ×20/0.95-NA objective (XLUMPlan Fl, Olympus) and a tunable pulsed laser (Chameleon Ultra, Coherent) in a soundproof chamber. Both GCaMP6m and mCherry were coexcited at a wavelength of 940 nm and separated by emission using a filter cube (U-MSWG2, Olympus). tagBFP was excited at 810 nm and separated by another filter cube (U-MWIB3, Olympus). Time series imaging was performed using an FOV of 367 × 367 μm (pixel size: 256 × 128) at a frame rate of 5 Hz. In a daily session, imaging was performed not only with presentation of the sound set but also without any sound presentation to record spontaneous neuronal activities for 144 s in a given FOV. In the longitudinal imaging experiments, six to eight FOVs were sequentially imaged per mouse along the layer 2/3 column from deeper to shallower depths (a depth of ~110–325 μm from the cortical surface). FOVs with reliable sound responses were repeatedly imaged at a 2-day interval, except for the last imaging day (4-day interval between the sixth and seventh time points). Imaging days were counted according to the first day of longitudinal data acquisition in both laser ablation and control experiments. Z-stack images of the layer 2/3 column were also acquired at different time points (before starting the experiment, just before and after microablation and after finishing the imaging experiment).

Targeted neurons were identified from a full-frame scan. We switched to point scan mode with a dwelling time of 8 μs, and scan position was set at the center of the nuclei of the neurons. Microablation was performed with a wavelength of 760 nm and femtosecond laser pulses (140 fs) delivered through a ×20/0.95-NA objective to mice that were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (0.8–1.3%). The laser power was set between 100 and 220 mW according to the quality of fluorescence signal in the target neuron. We applied the pulsed laser and immediately terminated on the detection of the abrupt elevation of calcium fluorescence. Otherwise, we kept the laser application for up to 30 s. If we observed clear elevation of Ca2+ signal within 1 min after laser exposure, we determined the procedure effective. We took an iterative approach for ablation to increase the success rate and prevent off-target damage to the surrounding region at the same time (Extended Data Fig. 3a). If we did not observe such a calcium elevation, we repeated the procedure with a slight increase in laser power at most three times. If the targeted neuron still did not show any observable increase of calcium fluorescence, we waited ~20–30 min and again applied the laser once more. When the last application did not induce an elevated calcium signal, we categorized the neuron as procedure ineffective. As longer exposure times tended to produce off-target effects33, whenever we observed abnormal calcium increases or strong bleaching in the surrounding region (~50 μm in radius) during the iteration, we halted the laser application and categorized the neuron as procedure ineffective. If accumulated laser ablation caused massive damage to the surrounding regions (~>100 μm in radius) of the target neurons, we terminated the experiment and categorized it as a failure. Given that prolonged application of laser light increased the chance of nonspecific photodamage in the tissue and our procedure involved individual targeting and manual ablation of each neuron, typically taking several minutes, in practice, a maximum number of 30–40 neurons per mouse could be microablated in a single session.

We conducted in vivo and ex vivo experiments to evaluate the microablation protocol. To keep tracking neurons across days in vivo, we took a single image of each FOV with a size of 367 × 367 μm (pixel size: 512 × 512) for each imaging session. We evaluated the effect of microablation by taking z-stack images of the layer 2/3 column, including the targeted neurons, and compared images of the nucleus and somatic fluorescence between the time points just before and after microablation, after 2 and 4 days, and quantified the loss of nuclear and calcium signal in target neurons as well as in the neurons included in a cubic volume of 60 × 60 × 60 μm around the targeted neurons to quantify off-target effects. The criterion for successful ablation of target neurons was (1) a complete loss of nuclear fluorescence and abnormality (complete loss or excessive filling) of calcium somatic fluorescence or (2) a partial loss of nuclear signal with excessively filled calcium fluorescence in the soma. On the other hand, we classified a neuron as noneffectively ablated when the loss of nuclear fluorescence was unclear or when the loss was partially observed but with intact calcium somatic fluorescence.

After 4 days of in vivo z-stack imaging, mice were anesthetized, the cranial windows were carefully removed, and Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich, E2129-10G) was injected at the corners of the imaged region on the cortical surface so that the blue dye served as a landmark of the imaged region after tissue extraction. Mice were perfused with a PBS/heparin solution and subsequently with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution following standard procedures. To keep the z-stack imaged volume intact as much as possible, the bulk brain section over 600 μm thickness was cut roughly parallel to the two-photon imaging plane on a vibratome (VT-1000, Leica Biosystems). To enable confocal imaging of the bulk section, the section was cleared using the CUBIC protocol64, washed with PBS and incubated in a DAPI solution (10 μg ml–1) for 24 h. Images were then acquired on a confocal microscope (DMi6000B CS TCS SP5, Leica) using a ×20/0.7-NA dry objective (HCX PL APO CS) with a frame size of 553.6 × 553.6 μm (pixel size: 1,024 × 1,024) as a z stack with a resolution of 0.5 μm. The region for confocal imaging was estimated by the blue dye landmarks. By slightly scaling and rotating roll, pitch and yaw of the post hoc three-dimensional confocal image, the in vivo-imaged population and microablated neurons were identified in the post hoc image data.

rAAV8-mDlx-NLS-tagBFP was injected into mice expressing GAD67–GFP. Three weeks after injection, the mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/medetomidine (2.5 mg /0.02 mg per 25 g body weight), perfused with 10 ml PBS/heparin and switched to 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution using the standard protocol. Brains were extracted and sliced on a Vibratome (VT-1000) to generate 100-μm coronal sections, and sections were mounted on cover slips. Confocal images were acquired (DMi6000B CS TCS SP5) using a ×20 dry objective (HCX PL APO CS). From the images, colocalization of GFP and tagBFP signal was evaluated by custom-written MATLAB scripts.

Before applying an individual neuron tracking algorithm, global x–y image displacement induced by movement was corrected by a cross-correlation-based method65. Regions of interest (ROIs) were semiautomatically selected by a custom-made MATLAB program, which were manually corrected later by a human expert and described by a set of several hundred points marking the centers of neuronal nuclei. To track individual ROIs across days, we followed a procedure described in previous studies6,66. Generally, two-dimensional affine transformation was optimally applied to register ROIs in each frame of the time series from the same FOV across several days. Optimization of the transformation was achieved using a Nelder–Mead–Simplex algorithm with a MATLAB function (fminsearch) and by iterating it in two different spatial scales, which first covered the entire frame and second focused on the four equally split image segments to adjust local movements during two-photon scanning. Last, to adjust to further local distortion, individual ROIs were allowed to move up to 2 pixels (2.87 μm) and find a better match with the image.

To include only neurons in the analysis that had a reliably present nuclear signal in the H2B:mCherry channel, we applied four quality criteria described in our previous study6: nearest neighbor distance, normalized soma signal intensity, soma signal-to-noise ratio and objective function value, which were applied on a frame-by-frame basis so that a neuron was either reliably present or excluded at each time point. To correct fluctuating background fluorescence from somatic calcium signal, the out-of-focus neuropil signal was calculated as the average fluorescence value of an area surrounding each individual ROI and was subtracted from the time series after multiplication with a contamination ratio as described previously67,68. We calculated a contamination ratio independently for each imaging plane in each experiment67. To calculate ΔF/F, the baseline F0 value used to compute ΔF/F0 was defined as a moving rank order filter, the 30th percentile of the 200 surrounding frames (100 before and 100 after). To estimate the neuronal firing rate, this ΔF/F0 value was then deconvolved using the conventional algorithm69.

To classify single neurons as sound responsive or not, all ten trials from a given stimulus were compared in a signed-rank test against ten prestimulus spontaneous activities. A neuron was classified as significantly responsive if the P value was below 0.05 after a Benjamini–Hochberg (or FDR) correction for multiple comparisons against number of stimuli (34) for at least 1 stimulus6. The amplitude of sound-evoked calcium transients was calculated by subtracting the average prestimulus baseline ΔF/F value (two frames corresponding to –200 to 0 ms) from the average poststimulus peak ΔF/F value (two frames corresponding to 200–400 ms) of all trials67. We defined best response amplitude as the average response amplitude across trials elicited by the stimulus giving rise to the significant maximal response among the 34 stimuli.

We included FOVs in our analysis that satisfied the following criteria: (1) FOVs needed to contain at least 100 ROIs (that is, neurons) that fulfilled the quality criteria described above, and (2) FOVs needed to contain more than ten significantly sound-responsive neurons during baseline days.

During the two baseline days before microablation (days 3 and 5), we identified sound-responsive neurons, which showed significant sound-evoked responses for at least one stimulus in each FOV. For each sound-responsive neuron, we calculated the average amplitude across all the stimulus conditions that elicited significant responses. We derived the amplitude distribution of responsive neurons sorted in descending order for each day (days 3 and 5). We then created a single distribution after merging and sorting the two days' distributions based on their amplitudes. In case the identity of a neuron was duplicated because the neuron was responsive on both days, the higher-rank neuron was selected to have unique neuron identities across the merged distribution. Thus, we prepared the sorted sound-responsive distribution merged for days 3 and 5 in each FOV or ‘the distribution of candidate responsive neurons'. On the day of microablation, we targeted neurons from the top of the distribution of candidate responsive neurons.

We identified non-sound-responsive neurons for days 3 and 5, respectively, which did not show a significant response to any of the sounds in each FOV, and derived the amplitude distributions of these neurons sorted by absolute amplitude in ascending order. We selected the neurons responsive on neither of the days, which was equal to the neurons existing in both distributions. We calculated the average rankings of the neurons from both the distributions and again sorted the neurons based on the average ranking in ascending order to prepare ‘the distribution of candidate nonresponsive neurons'. On the day of microablation, we targeted neurons from the highest rank (that is, smallest absolute amplitude) of candidate unresponsive neurons.

For the inhibitory neuron ablation cohort, we included sound-responsive inhibitory interneurons based on the same criteria for the sound-responsive ablation. To achieve comparable numbers of neurons to be microablated in the other cohorts in the ablation experiment, we also included interneurons with nonsignificant but large transient amplitudes after sound presentation (apparent sound-responsive neurons), in case the number of sound-responsive neurons did not reach the prerequisite number for each FOV. These apparent sound-responsive neurons were also sorted based on their amplitude averaged across days 3 and 5. We then selected neurons from the highest amplitudes. Practically, in the microablation experiment in sound-responsive, nonresponsive or inhibitory responsive neurons, we had to avoid neurons for microablation when the neurons showed unclear nuclear fluorescence due to optical occlusion by blood vessels, weak expression or out-of-focus position. Ultimately, we were able to target four to eight neurons for microablation in each FOV. Because the targeted neurons in these three experimental cohorts were determined based on either sound responsiveness and/or cell type, the spatial distribution of these neurons was generally random in each FOV.

In the control cohort, on the day when the animals would have undergone microablation in ablation experiments, mice (n = 7) were set in the microscope chamber under comparable levels of isoflurane anesthesia (~3 h) without any additional laser application except for monitoring calcium and nuclear fluorescence for ~30–50 min (sham procedure). Two other mice were set in the microscope chamber but only for short anesthetic exposure (from 30 min to 1 h) to acquire a few z-stack images of the FOVs. Our offline analysis confirmed that the control mice exposed to long isoflurane anesthesia on day 6 and the other control mice with short isoflurane exposure on day 6 did not show any distinct difference in average best response amplitude across neurons on day 7 (baseline-normalized amplitude for long anesthetic exposure: 1.072 ± 0.086; for short anesthetic exposure: 1.063 ± 0.047; two-sided t-test, P = 0.96) nor fraction of responsiveness on day 7 (baseline-normalized fraction for long anesthetic exposure: 0.915 ± 0.057; short anesthetic exposure: 1.114 ± 0.088; two-sided t-test, P = 0.085).

Targeted neurons include all the neurons to which we applied the laser for ablation. For any microablation experiment, a small proportion of the targeted neurons showed an unclear effect of ablation, based on the criteria we described above. Because some unclearly ablated neurons also demonstrated abnormal calcium signals, such as lower frequency of calcium transients than before or seizure-like bursting behavior, we excluded all the targeted neurons and nearby neurons from further analysis. Following a previous study21, we excluded targeted neurons (regardless of whether microablation was successful or not), as well as neurons within a sphere centered on ablated neurons having a radius of 15 μm from any analysis.

In addition, to make a fair comparison between different ablation experiments, we digitally filtered out highly sound-responsive neurons and/or non-sound-responsive neurons from spared populations as a ‘filtered condition' for further analysis. To mimic response properties and the number of ablated nonresponsive neurons in the nonresponsive ablation cohort, we defined five nonresponsive neurons with minimum absolute amplitudes per FOV in the sound-responsive ablation cohort, which we would have ablated in the nonresponsive ablation experiment (we call these nonresponsive neurons, which were supposed to be physically or digitally excluded, ‘low-category neurons'). Conversely, to mimic response properties and numbers of ablated sound-responsive neurons in the sound-responsive ablation cohort, we defined five responsive neurons with the highest amplitudes per FOV in the nonresponsive ablation cohort (we call these responsive neurons ‘high-category neurons'). We then digitally excluded low-category neurons from the spared population in the sound-responsive ablation cohort, high-category neurons in the nonresponsive ablation cohort and both low- and high-category neurons in the control cohort, respectively. For the inhibitory neuron ablation cohort, high-category neurons were defined as five responsive neurons with the highest amplitudes excluding the microablated sound-responsive inhibitory neurons in each FOV. We verified that the numbers of ablated sound-responsive neurons and other high-category neurons were comparable between cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 4e) and that the number of ablated nonresponsive neurons and other low-category neurons were also comparable (Extended Data Fig. 4f). We also confirmed that the best response amplitudes of high-category neurons showed no significant difference between cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 4h), the response amplitude of low-category neurons was not significantly different (Extended Data Fig. 4i), and the numbers of spared neurons in the filtered condition were comparable between the different ablation cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 4j).

For a given sound-responsive neuron, the trials were pseudorandomly split into two sets each containing half of the trials. Response amplitudes along the 34 stimuli, that is, tuning curve, were averaged across each half of the trials. Pearson correlation coefficients of the averaged responses were calculated between the first and second half set of trials. This procedure was repeated ten times, and we averaged these correlation values as single-neuron tuning correlations for each day. To evaluate the correlations to day 5, instead of calculating Pearson correlation coefficients of the averaged responses of half trials on the same day, we calculated correlations between the averaged response of half trials on day 5 and the averaged response of half trials on the other day. We used the same measure for all individual neurons to quantify the reproducibility of stimulus responses between different subsets of trials as single-neuron response reliability across trials70,71 (Figs. 3a, 5c and 6e).

For a given day and FOV, Pearson correlation coefficients of single-trial sound-evoked response vectors were calculated for all pairwise combinations of response vectors from the same sound and across pairs of sounds5. A similarity matrix was then constructed where each element in the matrix corresponded to averaged correlation coefficients for each combination of stimuli, excluding pairs with the same trials. Note that for each diagonal element, trial-averaged correlation to the same stimulus corresponds to the trial-to-trial reliability of population responses to each stimulus. The representational map was generated by averaging all the similarity matrices across all the FOVs in each cohort of mice for each day. A dimension-reduced representational map was also formed by applying classical multidimensional scaling (MDS), where a similarity matrix was mapped onto two-dimensional (first and second) MDS space. Each data point in the space represents the relative distance of the correlation profile in the similarity matrix corresponding to 1 of the 34 standard stimuli.

A support vector machine with a linear kernel was trained to discriminate each pair of stimuli from the 34 stimuli as a binary classifier using a built-in function in MATLAB (fitcecoc). Whether training and testing were done on the same day or done on different days, cross-validation was performed by fivefold cross-validation. Training and testing the classifier were conducted for a population in each FOV. Decoding performance was defined as the percentage of correctly classified trials, which was averaged across FOVs per mouse and averaged across mice for each experimental cohort.

Because various single-neuron response properties are considered to be dependent on the response amplitude or the best response amplitude for each neuron, we categorized sound-responsive neurons into four categories according to their best response amplitudes on a given day (0–15%, 15–25%, 25–55% and 55–1,000% in ΔF/F, respectively). Because the best response amplitude is largely log-normally distributed, the largest best amplitude category covers the extensive range in ΔF/F so that, in each category, roughly the same number of neurons are included for each experimental cohort (mean ± s.d., 25 ± 6.5%, 25 ± 7.4% and 25 ± 6.7% of neurons for each bin in the sound-responsive cohort, non-sound-responsive cohort and control cohort, respectively).

For a given responsive neuron, the trial-averaged response amplitude across the 34 stimuli, that is, tuning curve, was sorted by descending order (from the largest amplitude for the 1st stimulus to the smallest amplitude for the 34th stimulus) and normalized by the largest amplitude. After categorizing individual neurons into bins according to their best response amplitudes described above, the sorted and normalized tuning curves were averaged for each bin and for each day (Fig. 3e). The tuning width was estimated as the average normalized amplitude at the 15th stimulus on a given day (Fig. 3f).

We simulated how the change in tuning width could affect the similarity matrix to prove to what extent the disturbance of the similarity matrix on day 7 could be derived from the reduction of tuning width. The tuning curves of neurons in each best amplitude bin during baseline days were scaled by multiplying experimentally observed normalized amplitudes across sorted stimuli for each bin of the best amplitude. We again constructed the similarity matrix from neurons with artificially scaled tuning curves and compared the nondiagonal correlation between the simulated similarity matrix and the experimentally observed similarity matrix on day 7.

To quantify similarity in tuning between neurons, we calculated signal correlation, that is, Pearson correlation of the trial-averaged tuning curves, between responsive neurons for each FOV on a given day. The distribution of signal correlation was again categorized into the best response amplitude bins described above according to the average best amplitude of a given neuron pair. For each best amplitude bin, we quantified the fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation beyond 0.7 out of all responsive neuron pairs on a given day.

Local population responses are largely dominated by a subset of responsive neurons with a high level of responsiveness. To investigate the impact of microablation on the tuning dynamics of spared neurons with respect to those high-category neurons serving as a reference of the preablation local population response, we calculated pairwise signal correlations between the tuning of high-category neurons and the spared neurons responsive on a given day. In the sound-responsive ablation cohort, high-category neurons were the actual target of microablation, whereas in the other cohorts, nonresponsive, inhibitory or no neurons were ablated. After the distribution of signal correlations was categorized into bins according to the correlation values (from –0.6 to 1.0 with a 0.2 bin size), we split the signal correlation distribution based on the responsiveness of spared neurons on the day before microablation: neurons responsive on day 5 and neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on another day. We then calculated the fraction of each day 5 responsive or nonresponsive neurons, respectively, in each signal correlation bin. To characterize the microablation-induced change of the signal correlation after ablation, we normalized the fraction of neurons responsive on day 5 or neurons unresponsive on day 5 by subtracting the baseline fraction of these sets of neurons, respectively, which were averaged across days 1 and 3 for each signal correlation bin.

To investigate the balance of network-level activities between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we calculated the product of the fraction of responsive neurons and the average best response amplitude in each mouse (Extended Data Fig. 8e) as a general estimate of the total amount of excitatory response and inhibitory response, that is, ‘total responses' in the local network. The balance was quantified as the ratio of (total response in excitatory neurons) / (total response in excitatory neurons + total response in inhibitory neurons).

Data collection and analyses were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical tests were applied to determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications21. Data were excluded based on several criteria described above, such as ROI inclusion, FOV inclusion and the microablation protocol. Preliminary image analyses were performed using ImageJ/Fiji (ImageJ 1.53t, Java 1.8.0_172, 64 bit). All statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB (versions R2016b and R2022a, MathWorks). In all cases, except for Extended Data Fig. 7c–f, we treated not neurons but mice as independent observations. Sample sizes were largely comparable between conditions (number of mice between the different cohorts). Most statistical comparisons were performed using a two-sided t-test, comparing means within individual mice for two different conditions, such as baseline days and a postablation day, after FDR correction for multiple comparisons to assess changes following microablation in each experimental cohort. For comparisons between different experimental cohorts on a given day or over a set of days, a two-sided t-test was applied after FDR correction. When classifying individual neurons for sound-evoked responsiveness, because poststimulus activities across trials were highly non-normally distributed, a signed-rank test was performed after Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons against the number of stimuli. For the same reason, to compare the normalized correlation coefficient in the representational maps across the experimental cohorts (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 9), we used nonparametric pairwise multiple comparisons, Dunn's test for the different pairs of cumulative distributions of the normalized correlation coefficients and a Mann–Whitney U-test after FDR correction to compare medians between the cohorts for each tested day. For comparisons across the experimental cohorts in the other analyses from Figs. 3–8, in general, we performed permutation tests on a given day after microablation by shuffling samples 200 times across the three cohorts and estimating P values for the experimentally observed data for each cohort. Regarding the change in similarity matrix constructed after shuffling neurons across FOVs (Fig. 3g), first, we applied a permutation test on a given day by shuffling neurons across the three experimental cohorts, randomly selecting the same number of neurons as that in the cohort to be compared and constructing the similarity matrix from the selected neurons. We repeated the procedure 500 times and estimated the distribution of the nondiagonal correlation from the cohort-permuted neurons by the 95% confidence interval (2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of the data as the bottom and top bounds, respectively). We then compared the nondiagonal correlation of the similarity matrices from population vectors shuffled across FOVs in each experimental cohort to the two-sided confidence interval from the corresponding cohort. Second, we further tested the change in normalized correlation in the sound-responsive cohort (or non-sound-responsive cohort) from the control cohort after ablation. We applied the same permutation procedure but with only two experimental cohorts for comparison (sound-responsive cohort and control or non-sound-responsive cohort and control). For the validation experiment of interneuron labeling (Extended Data Fig. 8b), multiple slices or cells measured from the same animal were treated as technical replicates.

a. Example image of intrinsic signals on top of brain surface during burst of pure-tone (2–64 kHz) presentation. Intrinsic signals were recorded to functionally identify auditory fields, within which regions for two-photon calcium imaging were subsequently set. In this example, a region for two-photon imaging was selected as a black square. Scale bar: 500 μm. Intrinsic imaging was repeated 35 times, which corresponds to the total number of mice used for all the 4 experimental cohorts. b. Schematics of sequential imaging across layer 2/3 column in the auditory cortex. 6–8 FOVs were imaged per mouse with average z distance of 24.2 μm (± 5.04 standard deviation). c. Pie charts show the number of two-photon imaging FOVs in each auditory region (A1: primary auditory cortex; AAF: anterior auditory field; A2: secondary auditory cortex) across mice in each experimental cohort, respectively. Note that although our dataset contains recordings from all of the three major areas, there is a clear bias to A1 in all the main experimental cohorts. The fraction of the imaged auditory regions was comparable across the cohorts. d. In vivo two-photon images of H2B::mCherry signal of an example FOV on all the seven imaging days. The distinct labeling in the red channel allows high-fidelity tracking of individual neurons using a signal that is independent of neuronal activity. Scale bar: 100 µm. e. Fraction of responsive neurons across days in control cohort without filtering high and low category neurons (n = 9, mean ± s.e.m. across mice). f. Linear pairwise discriminability calculated by support vector machine averaged across all possible sound pairs and FOVs (n = 9, mean ± s.e.m.) plotted across days. The classifier was trained with data from either given (dark green), first (green), or last (light green) imaging day.

a. Grand averaged representational similarity matrix and corresponding dimension-reduced classical Multidimensional scaling (cMDS) display constructed from the dataset acquired in the current study during baseline (n = 29 mice, 3 imaging days). b. Schematic of a go/no-go sound discrimination paradigm from a previous study12, in which the same set of sound stimuli was used as in the current study. In well-trained mice, licking behavior was measured in response to reinforced S+ and S- stimuli. In addition, spontaneous behavioral categorization of non-reinforced off-target stimuli was used as an estimate of perceptual similarity of a given off-target in relation to the pair of target stimuli. c. Schematic of the application of the neurometric similarity matrix to estimate perceptual distances. The length of each side in the triangle of off-target, and reinforced stimuli S1 and S2 is determined by the correlation coefficients. The estimated relative representational similarity of the off-target stimulus to S1 or S2 is defined as the internal dividing point in the line connecting S1 and S2, orthogonally mapped from the off-target point. d. Solid black line: Behaviorally evaluated perceptual similarity as the go probability of off-target sounds in go no-go behavioral task (mean ± s.d. across mice, n = 12; the data replotted from Bathellier et al., 2012). Blue dots: Prediction of perceptual similarity from the representational similarity matrix in a with the metric in b. r and p indicates Pearson correlation and its p-value between the behavioral go probability and the prediction from the similarity matrix. SSE indicates Sum of squared errors of the similarity matrix-based prediction from the behavioral go probability. e. Stimulus generalization to conditioned and non-conditioned sound stimuli from another previously published study13, in which the same set of 34 sound stimuli as in the current study was used. One of the stimuli was used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) in a classical auditory-cued fear conditioning paradigm and was paired with a foot shock (US). Four days after conditioning, a generalization test was performed by presenting the CS and the three nonCS sounds (I, II, and III), without foot shock. The conditioned mice exhibited freezing behavior to CS, nonCS-I nonCS-II, but not to nonCS-III. f. Dimension-reduced display of the representational map obtained in the current study shown in a. Dot diameters depict a measure of neuronal plasticity (increased likelihood of a given sound stimulus to activate the same neuron assembly as the CS) obtained in the previous study13. Note, that the proximity between nonCS stimuli and the CS in the representational map allows us to predict the degree of plasticity in sound responses in the auditory cortex as well as the level of behaviorally measured stimulus generalization.

a. Protocol for microablation. See also Methods for further details. b. Example trace of Calcium fluorescence during laser exposure on a target neuron when doing point scanning. Ca2+ fluorescence was monitored while exposing the laser, and the time-lapse imaging continued for a couple of seconds to a few tens of seconds until we observed abrupt elevation of the signal. In this example, an abrupt increase of fluorescence intensity was observed around 21 sec from the onset of laser exposure. c-d. Examples of targeted neurons imaged in vivo over the time course of up to 4 days. In c, the targeted neuron showed a permanently elevated fluorescence signal one hour after the microablation procedure. After 4 days, both the nucleus fluorescence and the calcium fluorescence were undetectable. In another example targeted neuron in d, after 4 days of the microablation procedure, filled calcium fluorescence remained while the nucleus fluorescence was almost eliminated. When target neurons are successfully microablated, in most cases both signals disappeared (c, 89.4 %), in rare cases nucleus signal was lost with filled Ca2+ fluorescence (d, 10.6 %). Scale bar: 20 μm. e-h. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the procedure by re-identifying individual targeted neurons in fixed brain sections counter stained by 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Four days after the microablation procedure, neurons which lost the H2B::mCherry signal exhibited an absent DAPI signal (e) or an abnormally fragmented DAPI morphology (f-h). Scale bar: 20 μm. i. Distribution of collaterally damaged off-target neurons surrounding targeted neurons along xy-axis and z-axis. The red dot indicates the aligned positions of the targeted neurons (n = 111). The gray dots are off-target damaged neurons considering a cubic volume of 60 × 60 × 60 μm surrounding the targeted neuron. The majority of neurons suffering collateral damage fall within a 15 μm radius (dashed line) from the targeted neurons (64.3%), which corresponds to the radius that was applied by default to filter out neurons for further image analysis (see Methods). No statistical difference was observed in distributions between xy-distance and absolute z-difference (two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.27). j. Summary bar plots of the number of co-damaged off-targeted neurons out of 111 ablation experiments targeting a single neuron. k. Summary bar plots of nucleus fluorescence signals and post-hoc DAPI signals in targeted neurons categorized based on in vivo images 4 days after the microablation procedure.

a. Summary schematic indicating the average fraction of neurons with their categorization of responsiveness and different cell types. For a subset of mice in each experimental cohort (5/10, 5/10, 7/9 mice in sound responsive cohort, non-sound responsive cohort, control cohort, respectively), we also labeled inhibitory cortical neurons by co-injecting an AAV vector encoding the mDlx enhancer system (AAV-mDlx-NLS-tagBFP) with the AAV vectors expressing GCaMP6m and H2B::mCherry (see also Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 8). Therefore, we were able to identify the excitatory and inhibitory types of microablated and spared neurons. Small rectangles indicate the fraction of microablated neurons for each experimental cohort. The length of horizontal side refers to the fraction of microablated neurons out of all qualified neurons per FOV. The fraction along the vertical side refers to the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the microablated neurons. The categorization of responsiveness is also given for an additional experimental cohort in which inhibitory neurons were microablated (see also Fig. 6). Orange: sound responsive ablation; Blue: non-sound responsive ablation; Pink: inhibitory neuron ablation. The fraction along the horizontal side in the pink rectangle refers to the ratio of significantly responsive and unresponsive neurons in microablated inhibitory neurons per FOV. b. Summary table of number of mice, number of FOV, number of neurons and number of averaged microablated neurons per FOV acquired for each experimental cohort. For sound responsive ablation and non-sound responsive ablation, 41.5 ± 1.75 neurons and 40.3 ± 2.40 neurons were targeted per mouse on average, meaning that 81.9 ± 5.5% and 87.5 ± 2.4% were successfully ablated out of the total number of target neurons respectively, based on the criteria described in Methods. c. Cumulative distribution of number of neurons per FOV across all the 7 imaging time points for each experimental cohort. Neurons were included in this analysis after assessing imaging quality (Methods) and removal of high and low category neurons (Fig. 2c, Methods). Two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between experimental cohorts with FDR correction: p > 0.36. d. Cumulative distribution of fraction of responsive neurons averaged over the three baseline imaging sessions for each FOV. Two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for fraction of responsive neurons with FDR correction, all pairwise combination of the experimental cohorts among sound responsive ablation, non-sound responsive ablation, control and inhibitory neuron ablation: p > 0.62. e. Spatial distribution of microablated neurons for each experimental cohort. Top: distribution along depth from dura. Bottom: Distribution of number of microablated neurons per FOV. f. Box plots of number of microablated neurons per mouse across experimental cohorts. One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.63. g. Number of high category neurons per mouse, which means number of microablated neurons for sound responsive ablation and number of corresponding neurons for the other cohorts. One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.65. h.

One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.95. i. Response amplitude of microablated neurons averaged during baseline days (3 and 5). The amplitude of non-sound responsive neurons was defined as the average amplitude across stimuli for each neuron. Two-sided t-test with FDR correction between each two of the three experimental cohorts (Sound responsive ablation vs. Non-responsive ablation: p = 2.68 × 10−9; Sound responsive ablation vs. Inhibitory neuron ablation: 2.99 × 10−5; Non-responsive ablation vs. Inhibitory neuron ablation: 3.90 × 10−9). *** p < 0.001. j. Best response amplitude of high category neurons during baseline days. One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.73. k. Response amplitude of low category neurons during baseline days. The amplitude of non-sound responsive neurons was defined as the average amplitude across stimuli for each neuron. One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.14. l. Number of spared neurons per FOV considered for analysis. One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.86. n = 10 mice for sound responsive ablation, n = 10 mice for non-sound responsive ablation, n = 6 mice for inhibitory neuron ablation for f-l, n = 9 mice for control for g,h,j-l. For box plots in f-l, the middle line, the bottom and top edges of the box indicate median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the whiskers are the most extreme data points across mice. See Supplementary Table 2. for detailed statistics.

a. Normalized correlations averaged across diagonal elements (dark green) and non-diagonal elements (light green) in the similarity matrices analogous to Fig. 1i (mean ± s.e.m. across mice, n = 9), however, applying the same filter to remove high and low category neurons (Methods) as in the analyses for the other experimental cohorts. Two-sided t-test between baseline days vs. days after ablation with FDR correction, in average of diagonal elements (Average of diagonal elements: p = 0.93, 0.93, 0.53, 0.084 for day 7, 9, 11, 15). * p < 0.01. b-d. To illustrate observed variability in the data obtained from individual mice, the thick lines show average (as in in Fig. 2e, g) and thin lines show individual normalized correlation of population vectors in diagonal part (left) and in non-diagonal part (right) from individual mice as independent samples, respectively, for sound responsive ablation cohort (b), non-sound responsive cohort (c) and control cohort (d). e. Cumulative distribution of baseline normalized correlation coefficient along diagonal elements (left) and along non-diagonal elements (right) on day 5 in the representational map for each experimental cohort (n = 69, 73, and 59 FOVs for sound responsive, non-sound responsive and control cohorts, respectively). To make sure that the distributions of normalized correlation in the representational map during baseline were comparable between the experimental cohorts, difference in these cumulative distributions was tested by Dunn's test: Qcritical = 2.39, all Q values between groups for both diagonal and non-diagonal components in the similarity matrices, Q < Qcritical. Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test between groups with FDR correction for both the diagonal and the non-diagonal components, all p values, p > 0.5. f. Cumulative distribution of baseline normalized correlation coefficient on day 7 in the representational map. Difference in these cumulative distributions between the experimental cohorts was again tested by Dunn's test as well as Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test. The cumulative distribution in sound responsive ablation cohort significantly relatively shifted to lower correlation than the other cohorts: For diagonal components, Qcritical = 2.39; Sound responsive ablation vs. Control: Q = 2.93; Sound responsive ablation vs. Non-responsive ablation: Q < Qcritical; Non-responsive ablation vs. Control: Q < Qcritical; Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test with FDR correction between groups (Two-color asterisks, * p < 0.05; see Supplementary Table 2.); Sound responsive ablation vs. Non-responsive ablation: p = 0.077; Non-responsive ablation vs. Control: p = 0.20; For non-diagonal components, Sound responsive ablation vs. Control: Q = 3.44; Sound responsive ablation vs. Non-responsive ablation: Q = 2.57; Non-responsive ablation vs. Control: Q < Qcritical; Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test with FDR correction between groups (* p < 0.05). g. Cumulative distribution of baseline normalized correlation coefficient during day 9–11 in the map. Dunn's test: Qcritical = 2.39, all Q values between groups for both diagonal and non-diagonal components in the similarity matrices, Q < Qcritical. Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test between groups with FDR correction for both the diagonal and the non-diagonal components, all p values, p > 0.08. h-j. Similarity matrices from trial-averaged population response vectors across days in sound responsive ablation condition, non-sound responsive ablation condition and control, respectively. k. Simulated non-diagonal correlation of similarity matrix by experimentally derived downscaled tuning curve in individual neurons. Two-sided t-test between baseline correlation vs. simulated correlation after downscaling (mean ± s.e.m. across mice; Sound responsive cohort: p = 8.3 × 10−3; Non-sound responsive cohort: p = 0.19; Control: p = 0.27). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01; Two-sided t-test between simulated correlation after downscaling vs. correlation on day 7 (* p < 0.05). n = 10 mice for sound responsive ablation, n = 10 mice for non-sound responsive ablation, n = 9 mice for control. l-n. Similarity matrices across days from population response vectors after shuffling neurons across FOVs for each experimental cohort. See Supplementary Table 2. for detailed statistics.

To assess how far pure tone and complex sound responses in the spared network may be differentially affected by the removal of sound responsive neurons, we run analogous analyses as shown in the corresponding main figures, however, split the data into the two categories of stimulus responses. It should be noted that this reduced the size of the dataset, introducing increased variability. Nevertheless, we observed largely similar effects for both categories of stimuli. a. Analogous to Fig. 2e, baseline-normalized Pearson correlations of population vectors averaged across diagonal elements (left) and non-diagonal elements (right), split into pure tones (blue) and complex sounds (red), for sound responsive ablation cohort. Two-way ANOVA, p ≥ 0.18 both between PT and CS stimuli and across days for both diagonal elements and non-diagonal elements;. Two-sided t-test between PT and CS stimuli with FDR correction across post-ablation days, p > 0.57 for both diagonal and non-diagonal elements. b. Analogous to Fig. 3a, normalized response reliability across trials for PT and CS stimuli. Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.91 between PT and CS tunings (See Supplementary Table 2.). Two-sided t-test of reliability between PT response vs. CS response with FDR correction across post ablation days (day 7, 9, 11, 15): p > 0.50. c. Analogous to Fig. 3c, fraction of responsiveness for PT and CS stimuli. Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.24 between PT and CS stimuli; p = 0.092 across days. Two-sided t-test of response fraction between PT response vs. CS response with FDR correction across post ablation days: p > 0.92. d. Analogous to Fig. 3d, maximum response amplitude for PT and CS stimuli in sound responsive neurons. Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.054 between PT and CS tunings; p = 4.69 × 10−8 across days. Two-sided t-test of maximum amplitude between PT response vs. CS response with FDR correction across post ablation days: p > 0.42. e. Analogous to Fig. 3e, normalized tuning curves for pure tones (left) and complex sounds (right) overlaid across days. Two-sided t-test with FDR correction between PT tuning vs CS tuning at 15th stimulus index on post-ablation days: p > 0.27. f. Stability of single-trial responses between PT and CS stimuli analyzed analogous to a previous study43. Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.45 between PT and CS tunings; p = 2.13 × 10−12 across days. Two-sided t-test of single-trial stability between PT and CS stimuli, on each day: p > 0.32. Data presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice. n = 10 mice for sound responsive ablation for both types of sounds (pure tones, blue and complex sounds, red) for all panels.

a. Best response amplitude of neurons responsive on both day 5 and day 5±i normalized by the average best response during early baseline days (1 and 3). One-way ANOVA test (mean ± s.e.m. across mice), p > 0.26 for all the three experimental cohorts. b. Exemplary sound-evoked Ca2+ transients of neurons which responded to sounds on day 5 and reduced the amplitudes in these responses in following days after ablation in sound responsive ablation (top left), non-sound responsive ablation (middle left), and control (bottom left), respectively. Right: Exemplary sound-evoked Ca2+ transients of neurons unresponsive on day 5, but becoming responsive in the following days after ablation. c. Assessing the three-dimensional spatial extent of the microablation-induced effect on normalized best response amplitudes in the spared neurons. In the control cohort, the high category neurons with strong sound-evoked responses that were excluded from the further analysis were considered as reference (see Methods). Spared neurons were split into neurons responsive on day 5 (Left) and neurons gaining responsiveness (Right). In a given mouse, the three-dimensional distance of a spared neuron to each of the 30–40 microablated neurons (or high category neurons in the control cohort) was calculated, that is contributed multiple distance measurements associated with the same effect on the best response amplitude. All distance combinations were categorized into distance bins ranging between 15 and 350 μm. For each distance bin, the corresponding best response amplitude in each neuron was normalized to the average baseline amplitude for each mouse, the normalized best response was averaged across neurons. Data presented as mean ± s.e.m. across neurons (the detail n numbers of neurons in each split group across days for different experimental cohorts were described in Supplementary Table 3.). In the control cohort, normalized best responses of neurons responsive on day 5 gradually decreased over days with generally constant amplitude across distance, but exhibited modest reduction of normalized amplitude on later (day 11 and 15) days (Two-sided t-test between short and long distance, day 1 to day 15: see detail statistics below). Normalized best responses of newly responsive neurons remained rather flat across distance and did not show any systematic change during and after baseline days (Two-sided t-test between short and long distance). d-f. Same as c, but from microablated neurons for sound responsive ablation, for non-responsive ablation, and for inhibitory neuron ablation, respectively. In sound responsive ablation, normalized best responses of neurons responsive on day 5 decreased over days, but with constant amplitude across distance (Two-way ANOVA across distance bins or across days; *** p < 0.001; see Supplementary Table 2.). On the other hand, normalized best responses of newly responsive neurons strongly increased the amplitudes later days (Two-way ANOVA across distance bins or across days; *** p < 0.001). Three days after microablation, the normalized amplitude with nearby distance exhibited larger amplitude than the amplitude distant from ablated neurons (Two-sided t-test between short (< 100 μm) and long distance (250–350 μm), p = 0.49, 0.42, 1.0 × 10−4, 1.0 × 10−5, 2.0 × 10−4, 0.12 for day 1,3,7,9,11,15). For non-sound responsive ablation, normalized best responses of neurons responsive on day 5 decreased over days and the reduction was more prominent at shorter distance from ablated neurons (Two-way ANOVA across distance bins or across days; *** p < 0.001; Two-sided t-test between short and long distance, see details below). On the other hand, normalized best responses of newly responsive neurons did not change over distance, but showed slight increase in amplitude later days after ablation (Two-way ANOVA across distance bins or across days; *** p < 0.001). The normalized amplitude on day 7 was suppressed at shorter distance, but conversely increased later days (Two-sided t-test between short and long distance: see details below). g. Same as Fig. 3e bottom, but normalized tuning curves of day 5 responsive neurons (top) and of neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on the other day (bottom), for sound responsive cohort (left), non-sound responsive cohort (middle) and control cohort (right), respectively (mean ± s.e.m. across mice). h. Same as Fig. 4c, but the colormaps displaying the change in the fraction of high-signal-correlation neuron pairs, one of which was from neurons responsive on both day 5 and any other day, and the other of which was from neurons unresponsive on day 5 but responsive on any other day. i. Change in the fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation from baseline at the largest response amplitude bin in the corresponding colormaps in i. Two-sided t-test between baseline days and days after ablation with FDR correction (mean ± s.e.m. across mice; Sound responsive cohort: p = 0.24, 0.067, 0.015, 0.018 for day 7, 9, 11, 15). * p < 0.05. Permutation test for group comparison: p > 0.05 from day 7–11 for all the three cohorts, but p < 0.05 on day 15 for sound responsive cohort. j. Schematic of the procedure to analyze the change in pairwise signal correlations shown in Fig. 5. First, the distributions of all pairwise signal correlations between high category neurons and spared neurons are calculated on a given day (Nall). Note, each spared neuron contributes 30–40 pairwise correlations and vast majority of the spared neurons is categorized as non-responsive on a given day. Thus, the distribution is largely centered around 0 and highly stable over days, as can be seen with small bin sizes (lines, red axis on the left; One-way ANOVA test of cumulative distribution of signal correlation > 0.6 over days; p = 0.82) and coarser bin sizes used for later analysis steps (grey bars, black axis on the right). The inset shows the tail of high pairwise correlations. Second, from this distribution only the neuron pairs between high category neurons and the neurons responsive on day 5 (Nd5, orange histogram) and the neuron pairs between high category neurons and the neurons not responsive on day 5, but responsive on another day (Ngain, blue histogram) are considered and their fraction in the respective bins is calculated (bar stacks on the bottom right shown for day 3). Note, as expected, the pairwise signal correlations for responsive spared neurons are enriched for high signal correlation values. k. Bar stacks of fraction of neuron pairs for all the signal correlation bins over days in sound responsive cohort in Fig. 5a. On day 5, by construction there is no contribution of Ngain neuron pairs. Note, the fractions of Ngain (blue) and Nd5 (orange) neuron pairs shift after microablation towards Ngain neuron pairs. The color maps in Fig. 5 show these changes in fraction over time after normalization to baseline days 1 and 3 by subtraction of the average fraction, as shown in the two leftmost bar stacks. The bars on the left side of the color maps in Fig. 5 show this average baseline value for the respective bins. Data presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice for a, g, h-i (n = 10 mice for sound responsive ablation, n = 10 mice for non-sound responsive ablation, n = 9 mice for control).

a. Representative example of colocalization between mDlx enhancer-driven tagBFP expression and Gad67. Scale: 100 μm. b. Quantification of colocalization. n = 7 cortical slices from two mice. The middle line, the bottom and top edges of the box plots indicate median, 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the whiskers are the most extreme data points. The fraction of interneurons labeled with the blue fluorescent protein marker out of the entire quality qualified neurons was around 10% for each cohort (10.5 ± 0.5% (mean ± s.e.m. across mice) in sound responsive ablation, 9.8 ± 0.6% in non-sound responsive ablation, and 7.8 ± 0.4% in control, respectively), in line with previous works with auditory cortex in mature adult mice82. When we revisited the profile of cell types in microablated neurons, nearly all the ablated neurons were excitatory neurons (92.3 ± 2.0% for sound-responsive ablated neurons, 98.4 ± 0.9% for non-sound responsive ablated neurons), the fraction of which is higher than the average fraction of excitatory neurons in the population. c.

Two-sided t-test with FDR adjusted p-values between experimental cohorts on post-ablation days, * p < 0.05.; the normalized ratio of best amplitudes on day 15, 1.09 ± 0.088 for sound responsive ablation, 1.10 ± 0.11 for non-sound responsive ablation. f. Traces of detected calcium transients of an inhibitory neuron over days. We verified that the changes of response amplitude in inhibitory neurons after microablation (Fig. 5e) were not due to another feature like Ca2+ kinetics in somas of inhibitory neurons characterized by the decay time constant83. g. Decay time constant of calcium transients of all identified interneurons over days across mice (n = 5 for sound responsive ablation cohort). One-way ANOVA test, p = 0.82. h. Same as Fig. 3f, but change of tuning width by using normalized response amplitudes at 15th largest stimulus index in the tuning curve over days for excitatory (left) and inhibitory (right) neurons. Two-sided t-test of Δnormalized amplitude for excitatory neurons (left) and for inhibitory neurons (right) between baseline days vs. days after ablation with FDR correction for each experimental cohort (* p < 0.05). i. Change in fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation and with large response amplitude from baseline among excitatory-excitatory neurons (left), inhibitory-inhibitory neurons (middle), and excitatory-inhibitory neurons (right). Two-sided t-test of Δfraction of excitatory-excitatory neuron pairs with FDR correction in sound responsive cohort on post-ablation days (Sound responsive cohort: p = 0.15, 0.051, 0.11, 0.0034 for day 7, 9, 11, 15). Asterisks on top: † p < 0.055, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. Permutation test for group comparison (asterisk at bottom; * p < 0.05). For inhibitory-inhibitory neuron pairs, sound responsive cohort: p > 0.15 for all post-ablation days; non-sound responsive cohort: p > 0.28 for all post-ablation days; control: p > 0.16 for all post-ablation days. For excitatory-inhibitory neuron pairs, sound responsive cohort: p > 0.25 for all post-ablation days; non-sound responsive cohort: p > 0.30 for all post-ablation days; control: p > 0.26 for all post-ablation days. j. Baseline-normalized best response amplitude of neurons responsive on day 5 in excitatory (left) and inhibitory (right) neurons for the three experimental cohorts. When splitting excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on the responsiveness on day 5, as observed in Fig. 4b, the normalized best response amplitude of neurons responsive on day 5 significantly decreased on day 7 for both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the sound responsive ablation cohort, but not in the other cohorts (One-way ANOVA across days for excitatory neurons (left) and for inhibitory neurons (right) in each experimental cohort (asterisks at the right side; ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001); Two-sided paired t-test of the normalized best amplitude of excitatory neurons (left: Sound responsive ablation, p = 0.023) and inhibitory neurons (right: Sound responsive ablation, p = 0.049) between day 3 vs. day 7 for each experimental cohort. Asterisks on top; * p < 0.05. k. Same as j, but for newly responsive neurons. For the neurons unresponsive on day 5 but being responsive on the other day, the normalized best response amplitude of excitatory neurons exhibited a delayed but substantial increase after microablation in the sound responsive ablation (One-way ANOVA across days, Sound responsive ablation: F(5, 24) = 7.97, p = 1.5 × 10−4; asterisk at the right side, * p < 0.01) like Fig. 4b right, but inhibitory neurons did not (p = 0.43). For the non-responsive ablation and the control cohorts, both the excitatory and inhibitory neurons did not change the normalized best response amplitude over days (p ≥ 0.24). Group comparison revealed that the normalized amplitude of the newly responsive excitatory neurons in sound responsive ablation was significantly larger than those in non-responsive ablation and in control late after microablation (Two-sided t-test with FDR correction on a given post ablation day between each two of the three cohorts; two-colored asterisks on top; * p < 0.05). Data presented as mean ± s.e.m. across mice for e, g-k. n = 5 mice for sound responsive ablation cohort, n = 5 mice for non-sound responsive ablation cohort, n = 7 for control for e, h-k. See Supplementary Table 2. for detailed statistics.

a. Cumulative distribution of baseline normalized correlation coefficient on day 5 in the representational map for each experimental cohort (n = 42 and 59 FOVs for inhibitory neuron ablation and control cohorts, respectively). In inhibitory neuron ablation experiment, 91.7 ± 1.5% was successfully ablated out of the targeted neurons, based on the criteria we already described in Methods. Same as Extended Data Fig. 5a, to compare the effect of ablation between inhibitory neuron ablation and sound responsive ablation cohorts on the day after microabtaion, difference in these cumulative distributions was tested by Dunn's test as well as two-sided Mann-Whitney U test with FDR correction. These cumulative distributions on day 5 were not statistically different by definition between the groups (Dunn's test for all group combinations in both diagonal and non-diagonal elements, Q < Qcritical; two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, adjusted p values > 0.5). b. Same as a, but the cumulative distributions of normalized correlation on day 7. Especially for diagonal elements, the distributions in both sound responsive ablation and inhibitory neuron ablation cohort shifted toward lower correlation than control (Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, adjusted p-values between experimental cohorts; two-colored asterisks, Diagonal elements: Sound responsive ablation vs. control: p = 0.016; Inhibitory vs. control: p = 0.020; Sound responsive ablation vs. inhibitory: p = 0.51; * p < 0.05; Dunn's test, sound responsive ablation vs. control, Q = 3.00 (> Qcritical); inhibitory neuron ablation vs. control, Q < Qcritical). For non-diagonal elements, the distributions in sound responsive ablation cohort was lower than that in control (Two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, with adjusted p values between experimental cohorts; two-colored asterisks, * p < 0.05; Dunn's test, sound responsive ablation vs. control, Q = 3.48 (> Qcritical); Q < Qcritical for the other group comparison). c. Same as a, but during day 9–11. On the other hand, late after microablation (day 9–11), while the distribution in sound responsive ablation went back to baseline level, the distribution in inhibitory neuron ablation, especially the diagonal elements maintained lower correlation than the other cohorts (Dunn's test, inhibitory neuron ablation vs control, Q = 2.44 (> Qcritical); sound responsive ablation vs. inhibitory neuron ablation, Q = 2.43 (> Qcritical); two-sided Mann-Whitney U test, adjusted p-values between experimental cohorts, p ≥ 0.056). d. Same as Fig. 3e, but normalized tuning curve of responsive neurons in inhibitory neuron ablation. Left: the colormap of the baseline normalized tuning curve on day 7 according to the best response amplitude bins. Right: normalized tuning curves overlaid across days (mean ± s.e.m. across mice). Two-sided t-test of average of normalized amplitudes across the stimulus with 2nd largest amplitude to the last stimulus between baseline days vs. day 7: p = 0.20. e. Same as Fig. 3g, but normalized non-diagonal correlations in the similarity matrix constructed from the population vectors shuffled across FOVs (Methods) in inhibitory neuron ablation (mean ± s.e.m. across mice). Two-sided t-test of normalized correlation during all post-ablation days between inhibitory neuron ablation and control. p = 0.33. f. Same as Fig. 3h, but the colormap of the change in fraction of responsive neuron pairs with high signal correlation from baseline according to the best response amplitude in inhibitory neuron ablation cohort (n = 6 mice). Two-way ANOVA, p = 0.062 across days; p = 0.0022 across amplitude bins. n = 6 mice for inhibitory neuron ablation cohort for d-f. See Supplementary Table 2. for detailed statistics.

a. Schematics in ablation of sound responsive neurons. After microablation of sound responsive neurons, the representational map undergoes temporal disturbance and recovery in 3–5 subsequent days. Here the representational map is depicted as the colored dots corresponding to different sound identities in representational space from population activities (top row). Longer distance between dots in this space indicates lower correlation that is, dissimilar relationship of population activities between the sounds. Response reliability across trials in individual neurons is reduced on the day after ablation shown as the example tuning curve with a shaded gray band (the 2nd row). The broader band indicates a larger variability in responses across trials. The width of tuning curve in the individual neurons is reduced on the day after ablation and remains narrowed over several days (the 3rd row). The narrowing of the width is more pronounced in baseline responsive neurons (the 3rd row, light blue curve). The average best response amplitude for the baseline responsive neurons keeps reduced after microablation (the 3rd row, light blue curve), while the best amplitude for the newly responsive neurons, which are unresponsive on the day before ablation but become responsive on any other day, increased a few days after microablation (the 3rd row, purple curve). The rate of response turnover, where some responsive neurons lose their responsiveness and other unresponsive neurons gain their responsiveness, is accelerated after microablation. The more neurons in the baseline responsive network (rounded squares in the 4th row, light blue dotted circle) lose their responsiveness, the more neurons outside the baseline network gain responsiveness. The fraction of neuron pairs with high signal correlation, that is, highly similar tunings increase later days after microablation (the number of red edges in the population inside the rounded squares in the 4th row). The increase of fraction is specifically driven by the newly responsive neurons, which are located outside of the baseline responsive network. Similarity in tuning between the microablated neurons and the spared neurons increased later days after microablation, especially between the microablated neurons and the newly responsive neurons (bottom, shown as the thickness of red edges between these neurons). b. Same as a, but in ablation of inhibitory neurons. Different from microablation of sound responsive neurons, microablation of inhibitory neurons induces long-lasting disturbance of the representational map, which is depicted as the more widely distributed color dots in representational space (top row). The single-neuron response reliability across trials maintains a lower level than the baseline level (the 2nd row) with the broader shaded gray band. Since the reduction of similarity matrix is mostly due to the destabilization of response across trials, the tuning width (the 3rd row), best response amplitude (the 3rd row) and tuning similarity between neurons (rounded squares in the 4th row) do not change after microablation. Interestingly, the tuning similarity between the microablated neurons (bottom, dotted circle) and the newly responsive neurons increases also for inhibitory neuron ablation.

“People are sick of the rules of society,” Lavvynder says over the phone from their home in Salt Lake City on a recent Monday afternoon. “Monogamy has become the default. Straight cisgender patriarchy is the default. A lot of us want to do things our own way—not have a government or religion tell us what to do.”

I had asked Lavvynder, 30, who is trans nonbinary and practices polyamory, why they think “relationship anarchy”—an egalitarian philosophy and approach to dating—is getting more popular among young people. According to a new study conducted by the dating app Feeld and sex educator Ruby Rare, author of The Non-Monogamy Playbook, relationship anarchy is on the rise among millennials and Gen Z as a remedy to the loneliness epidemic.

Relationship anarchy (RA) is a relationship philosophy built around clear values: it is anti-hierarchal and anti-capitalist, prioritizes mutual care, and is all about cultivating relationships based on consent. The term, according to Feeld, was coined in 2006 by Swedish writer and activist Andie Nordgren, who said in her manifesto that relationship anarchy “questions the idea that love is a limited resource that can only be real if restricted to a couple.” Though the lifestyle has quietly emerged as a prevailing relationship framework among communes in San Francisco and across Europe in the past decade, it is again finding a wider audience in our current era of romantic upheaval, where young people are staying single for longer and polyamory has become far more common.

According to the Feeld study, one in five people practice it unknowingly, and 36 percent of 25- to 36-year-olds have adopted the lifestyle, compared to 15 percent of boomers.

Lavvynder was in a vulnerable but curious space, separated from their partner of two years, when they stumbled on a friend's Instagram story about relationship anarchy in 2023. The software project manager had no previous experience with it but felt drawn to its possibilities.

“I also familiarized myself with the Relationship Anarchy Smorgasbord,” a worksheet that helps people set terms for how to define an anarchist relationship unique to their circumstance,” Lavvynder says. “It's about asking, ‘What are the things that we want to be involved in this relationship and what are we gonna agree is part of this relationship? Are we interested in being creative partners? Are we interested in being sexual partners?'”

Since then they have fully embraced the lifestyle.

We can all agree: Dating sucks and has only gotten harder. Forty-seven percent of US adults say dating is more difficult today than it was a decade ago. That has led to a growing interest in alternative lifestyles. According to the Journal of Sex and Martial Therapy, one in five people surveyed in the US and Canada have had experience with non-monogamy. Nontraditional relationships are especially popular among millennials and Gen Z; over 70 percent say they are open to less-conventional approaches to partnership, including polyamory and open relationships, according to a study by R29 Intelligence.

For relationship anarchists, there is no pecking order among their connections—partners, friends, neighbors, colleagues—are all regarded the same. They treat all their relationships equally, be they romantic or platonic, and believe each relationship possesses “similar or identical potential for emotional, physical, or mental intimacy, love, and satisfaction,” Rare noted in the study. No one person is given preference over the other.

It may seem like relationship anarchy mirrors polyamory, but there are fundamental distinctions. Some poly people apply hierarchies to their relationships—“veto power,” as Lavvynder calls it. Relationship anarchists, who can be poly, do not put romantic partners above anyone. “We're not making rules about other people's relationships. We're just focusing on the connection that we have with that other person.”

One misconception about relationship anarchists is that they have perfected relationship dynamics, but that couldn't be further from the truth, Lavvynder adds.

“A lot of people will tell me, ‘oh, I wish I could be polyamorous or a relationship anarchist, but I just get too jealous.' And it's like, well, I get jealous too. I'm not void of that emotion. I also experience jealousy. If my partner is talking to somebody new, I feel threatened by that. But the way to deal with that is not to make some rule about how your partner is engaging with other people. It's to figure out what you need to do for yourself,” they say. “It's really fucking hard, actually.”

It's all about shared values, not sexual exclusivity, says Sam, a 33-year-old music licensing administrator in Los Angeles who identifies as gender-fluid. Relationship anarchy pushed her to rethink how she defined connection. “Everyone is taught the rules at a young age: One person in your life is meant to be your everything,” she says, likening it to “a Disney fairy-tale romance.” And “any deviation from that is an offense beyond repair.” People, she says, would feel more fulfilled in their relationships “if they were able to prioritize others based on what they actually wanted versus what they believe is expected of them.”

Sam came to the realization following a breakup. She was “freshly out as a queer person,” new to non-monogamy, and in a relationship that encouraged the exploration of her sexual identity. She and her ex were   “swingers,” but Sam says she was “deeply uncomfortable and unfulfilled” by all the “casual and often unsatisfying” sexual experiences. When the relationship ended, she dove into the polyamory scene in Los Angeles, where she later learned about relationship anarchy.

José Esteban Muñoz, in Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity, has suggested that “queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present.” It comes as no surprise, then, that young people who identify as LGBTQIA+ and also practice ethical non-monogamy are finding that relationship anarchy is for them.

“We've pushed so many societal norms already, and we're in this place where it's like, well, how else can we push this even more?” Lavvynder says.

“It's a function of more and more people coming out as queer and being in queer relationships. They are realizing that there are alternatives to the norm of what love can be,” Jack says.

Jack is a 30-year-old physician who identifies as nonbinary. They discovered relationship anarchy during the pandemic. Freed from “a cycle of serial monogamy,” they say they were introduced to the lifestyle by their current partner, who they live with in Brooklyn, New York. “We all had so much time to sit and think and really self-examine. I had time to expose myself to these new ideas. For a lot of people you just don't know what else you can do—until you do. That was certainly the case for me.”

Jack and their partner have been together five years. Jack also has three other romantic partners—one in San Francisco, another in Asheville, North Carolina, and a person they just started seeing in Rhode Island because “apparently I hate dating people that actually live in the same city as myself.” Above all, Jack says, respect is prioritized in each relationship.

Lavvynder, Sam, and Jack requested their last names not be used due to privacy concerns.

Still, navigating relationships doesn't come easy. “It requires a deep level of self reflection, honesty, and communication that we are not taught and is not modeled to us in any traditional societal structures,” Sam says. “Your boundaries will differ from relationship to relationship.”

“It is difficult and something you have to be conscious of—at least I do,” Jack adds “I'm not that good at it yet.”

Forecasters within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predict this summer's hurricane season, which started June 1, will be “above average” in terms of activity. NOAA's temperature outlook, meanwhile, also forecasts hotter-than-usual temperatures across the whole US this summer.

But as climate change juices up severe storms and wildfires and makes heat waves even deadlier, cuts at all levels across the US federal government have thrown agencies tasked with preparing the country for disasters—and helping it recover—into chaos.

These cuts are already having real impacts for Americans. As of mid-May, amid intense staffing losses at NOAA, four of the National Weather Service's 122 stations around the country no longer had enough personnel to keep an overnight shift going, while several other stations were considering stopping 24/7 forecasting operations. Historically, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) workers have gone door-to-door offering services to citizens in disaster areas, but as WIRED reported last month, the agency is discontinuing this practice this year. FEMA workers have told WIRED that they don't feel the agency is ready for disaster season.

Being ready for a disaster has never been more important. WIRED spoke with experts to bring you a guide to how to prepare—and what to look out for.

Listen to local authorities

Regardless of what's unfolding at the federal level, local- and state-level emergency management departments or agencies are the ones who alert the public and lead the initial response before, during, and after a disaster. Many of these organizations offer text alert systems and post regular updates on social media. Local fire departments and police offices may also maintain social media pages or send out alerts in tandem with these agencies; law enforcement may also announce curfews or other rules during disasters. Follow any warnings from these agencies to shelter, evacuate, or take other actions to stay safe.

If you're not sure where to start in terms of seeking information, FEMA maintains a searchable database of disaster resources by state, which includes state and local emergency management agencies. Calling 211 can also help connect you with service providers in your area.

Local news organizations often amplify communications from emergency management officials. Local and state politicians—including governors' press offices—can also be a valuable source of information.

Know what you need to shelter in place—and what you need to quickly evacuate

The Red Cross recommends that people prepare a set of disaster supplies at home as well as a separate, smaller group of supplies in a bag to grab for a quick evacuation.

At home, the organization recommends having two weeks' worth of shelf-stable food in case of an emergency. For adequate hydration, the CDC recommends a gallon of water per day for each member of the household for three days. (Don't forget food and water for your pets, too.)

Take note of any medical needs in your household and try to keep a backup supply of medications on hand. Batteries, flashlights, a hand-crank or battery-powered radio, a first aid kit, and hygiene items should also make it into your home kit.

In your go bag, FEMA recommends packing three days' worth of food and water, physical maps of local areas, a change of clothing, and copies of important documents. According to a checklist from the agency, these should include birth certificates, medical information, copies of your rental contract or home lease and insurance policies, car titles and registration, and banking information, sealed in a waterproof container or bag. Consider adding items specific to your climate or geographic setting (sunscreen for desert conditions or extra layers in colder areas) as well as items specific to your household needs (pet medications, diapers for a baby, etc.).

Practice for emergencies

“Knowing your location first and what it could be at risk for is really going to help you prepare” for what could be coming, says Nicole Maul, a national spokesperson for the Red Cross. Ready.gov, a FEMA-affiliated resource, currently maintains a list of hazards with safety pointers for each, while FEMA's National Risk Index allows you to see which hazards your county is most exposed to.

Practicing emergency scenarios can mean anything from testing out a new hand-cranked radio, to mapping out different exit routes from your area in case main roads are impassable, to coordinating with friends and family about who to touch base with if something happens. Mariel Fonteyn, the director of US emergency response at the disaster-relief nonprofit Americares, recommends writing important phone numbers down on a piece of paper and preparing ahead of time for a scenario where communications might not work as usual.

“If networks are overwhelmed, phone calls won't go through, but text messages will eventually,” she says. “Depending on what happens with the network, text messages outside of the damaged area tend to go through better. If you have family or a friend who lives in a different state, sometimes everybody messaging to that person will be better than trying to message to each other within the damaged area—if your family's kind of spread all over when a disaster occurs, have everyone know that you all message Grandma to let her know everything is OK.”

In some cases, knowing how to safely handle emergency supplies and situations can be the difference between life or death. Fonteyn says that deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning are not uncommon following extended power outages, because of people improperly using generators they are unaccustomed to.

“If you have a generator, make sure that you fully know how to use it safely, and where to put it safely, so that it's not sending fumes into where you're staying,” she says. Never use them inside.

Be prepared for how the political climate may affect federal responses after disasters

After a disaster hits that's too big for a state to handle on its own, a governor can request a disaster declaration from the White House. This declaration enables FEMA to come to the affected area to coordinate recovery. The declaration also opens up a range of services for survivors, from federal money to help with grants to pay for temporary housing, legal assistance, repairs to homes, and relief from tax bills, as well as help for states to do everything from rebuilding infrastructure to restoring utilities like water and electricity.

These declarations, however, can fall prey to political winds. In 2020, it was widely reported that President Donald Trump's personal conflict with Governor Jay Inslee of Washington prevented him from issuing a federal disaster declaration for the state in the wake of devastating wildfires in eastern Washington. Even political allies are now finding it difficult to secure aid: The White House initially denied a disaster declaration request from Arkansas in April following tornadoes and storms this spring, with Trump changing his mind only after a phone call with Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

And with the agency seemingly in turmoil as it enters disaster season—including, as WIRED reported, canceling its strategic plan before it had another in place—it remains to be seen how effective its response will be for approved declarations. FEMA keeps an active list of approved presidential disaster declarations on its website, with links to federal resources for survivors and instructions on how to apply for aid.

Keep relying on weather forecasts—but find a trusted source to help interpret them

Cuts to NOAA are hitting hard at the National Weather Service, the bedrock of weather forecasting in the United States, which has lost 600 employees since the start of the year. The NWS was already short-staffed before the start of this year, says Alan Gerard, a former director at NOAA's National Severe Storms Lab who left the agency in March. Forcing other offices to stretch to cover monitoring for those with fewer staff, he says, raises the chances of “human error.”

“If we get into a situation where we have a number of hurricanes or tropical storms threatening the same area, and you have an office that's already depleted with staffing, you're basically increasing the burden on that office,” he says. (In early June, NOAA announced that it would hire back 100 Weather Service employees across the country—an effort Gerard says will take months of precious time during this hurricane season to actually implement.)

“It's not a situation where people need to be panicked that all of a sudden a Category 5 hurricane is just gonna appear and we're not gonna have had any inkling of it,” Gerard says. “It's more of a situation of, OK, we can't fly as many reconnaissance missions into these hurricanes as we ordinarily do.”

Gerard says people should still have confidence in NOAA's systems and its dedicated staff: “The National Hurricane Center should still be your primary source for hurricane information.” The NWS allows users to sign up for text message alerts. But finding a trusted local meteorologist or weather analyst can help people understand gaps in forecasting or unclear data, in case some forecasts are less comprehensive than they were in the past.

Understand your insurance and keep your documentation in order

Navigating insurance—especially home insurance—is a headache even in normal times, especially as insurance rates are skyrocketing across the country. Part of making sure that your home is properly insured ahead of a disaster is understanding what, exactly, that insurance covers—and what it doesn't.

Flood insurance, for instance, is sold separately from private home insurance, in a federal program run out of FEMA. Usually, only homeowners situated in specific flood zones are required to buy it, even though other regions can be vulnerable: Most people hit by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina last year did not have flood insurance. Land movement insurance—insuring against events like mudslides and earthquakes—is not included in most homeowner policies, while condo building insurance usually only covers damages to the exterior of the building, not inside your apartment.

Fonteyn recommends keeping photos of the interior of your home—including any expensive items—on your phone to use with your insurance provider or with FEMA's assistance programs. “A lot of times, insurance and FEMA are looking to restore things to pre-disaster condition,” she says. “You want to be able to prove the pre-disaster condition was good.”

Don't forget about the dangers of heat

A study published last year found that heat-related deaths have more than doubled in the US over the past 25 years. Yet extreme heat events have not traditionally been treated as federal disasters, meaning FEMA does not come in to help. During a heat wave, it's best to connect with local emergency management departments for guidance.

Both Ready.gov and the CDC currently maintain resource pages with tips on how to prepare for and stay safe during extreme heat events. The CDC resource, however, comes from the CDC's Climate and Health program, which was gutted as part of mass firings at the agency in April. (We've linked to the archived version in case this resource is removed.)

Think about your emotional needs—and keep community in mind

Fonteyn recommends including activities—knitting, card games, favorite books, toys for children—in go bags. The immediate aftermath of a disaster—especially if you have to stay in an emergency shelter or hotel—can be challenging mentally.

“The hurricane doesn't hit and then a month later everything is back to normal,” she says. “It takes a lot of time and requires a lot of patience. Ultimately, having these even basic comfort items can go such a long way in protecting your mental health after a disaster, so that you're able to better focus on all of the other needs that you have.”

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) maintains a free helpline for those experiencing mental health crises—although recent cuts at the agency have impacted the helpline's staff. The Red Cross also has a helpline specifically for those recovering from disasters needing emotional support.

Above all, experts say that the best disaster plans often start with preparing the community around you.

“Check in with your family, check in with your neighbors, because those'll be the folks who you'll want to stay connected with in the event of an emergency,” says Maul.

The Andersons are Christmas traditionalists. Dan says it's more his wife Paige than him, but secretly he also loves all the fuss.

So, there they were on the sofa in their pajamas in front of the twinkling Christmas tree before the sun had risen over a chilly morning in Buffalo, New York. Thirty-two-year-old Dan was proud and smug as he handed over his gift to Paige—a “fancy new Kindle Voyage.” She loved it. Then it was his turn, and he excitedly ripped into the wrapping paper watched over by his confused dogs—one of which was tellingly named after Dan's favorite computer-game character (Vivi from Final Fantasy). As the present revealed itself, the avid gamer saw the instantly recognizable and much-loved logo—it was a brand-new PlayStation 4. Straight away he unpacked it, rigged it up to the TV, and switched it on. The plan was to get it fired up and download LittleBigPlanet 3 to play for a few hours before meeting up with family.

Paige had been looking forward to it since she bought the new console. However, it wasn't to be. “We didn't even make it as far as starting to download the game, because it wouldn't let me log in to PlayStation Network,” Dan said. “Nothing was online at all, so we couldn't even try and download games.” Disappointedly they headed out for the day's events and couldn't try again until that evening, when they discovered that the network was still down. A $400 gift they couldn't play. Dan had to work the next day too, so he couldn't even try it then. He was gutted.

Five hundred and fifty miles north, in Toronto, 16-year-old Mustafa Aijaz was pumped. Christmas Day—particularly the evening—was the best game time of the year. It's always been a bit of a holiday within the holiday for serious players. The tradition revolves around a phenomenon called “Christmas Noobs.” At Christmas, so many new players receive new games and consoles that online games are flooded with a tidal wave of gamers who often fumble their way through the top games and act like cannon fodder for the waiting legions of seasoned veterans. Mustafa and his mates were skilled at Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. “We were all ready for a night of easy wins, quick XP [experience points] farming, and were looking forward to leveling up like crazy.” So, they waited like crocodiles anticipating herds of migrating buffalo to enter the river. But just as the bullets started flying they were all unceremoniously chucked out of their matches and knocked offline. “None of us could log back in, and party chat was down too, so we couldn't even talk to each other to figure out what was happening,” Mustafa said.

It was all over social media: A group of hackers called Lizard Squad were bragging about their massive DDoS attack on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network—the crucial services that linked tens of millions of gamers to the Microsoft and Sony servers. Mustafa had seen that the group had already carried out smaller-scale attacks and had for weeks been taunting and threatening a big attack. Apparently it was all linked to some silly and incomprehensible spat with a rival but minor hacking group. Mustafa was angry but also fascinated by the attack and the incredible reaction online. “The fallout was instantaneous. People were furious,” he said.

PlayStation Network at the time had about 110 million subscribers, and Xbox Live had roughly 48 million. Xbox was back to normal within 24 hours—on Boxing Day. But PlayStation struggled for longer. It didn't just affect existing subscribers. Before you can use any new games, consoles, or vouchers, you need to register them via the gaming company's servers. It was a catastrophe for the games industry, especially Sony, which had already been having a tough time after a different cyberattack the previous month.

Services were down around the world. Error messages in dozens of languages were being posted as screenshots on YouTube and Twitter. There was nothing anyone could do until the engineers at Sony and Microsoft figured it out or Lizard Squad stopped the attack.

Late in the evening on Boxing Day, BBC Radio 5 Live aired an interview with two members of the group. They showed zero remorse for the impact they'd had on people around the world. Twelve hours later I walked into the newsroom and was given the seemingly impossible task of “getting a Lizard” on the evening TV bulletin at Sky News.

It took hours of trawling Twitter and speaking to dozens of wannabes and fakes, but I eventually succeeded in finding contact details for a British man called Vinnie Omari. Incredibly, he lived a few miles from our newsroom in west London. He agreed to come to us for the interview and was pale, skinny, wore all black and talked fast. He was at pains to distance himself from the gang but left the studios promising that a Lizard Squad hacker called “Ryan” would be in touch. I had no idea at the time of course that this “Ryan” was Julius Kivimäki—an already infamous teenage hacker and delinquent from Finland. It was later that afternoon—at around 3 pm —that “Ryan” called through on Skype. Just in time for us to edit our conversation with him into our news piece.

The 17-year-old looked very young and pale and had a shaved head and soft features. In spite of everything, he was polite and seemed in no rush. But he was also utterly unremorseful and arrogant, struggling to stifle a smirk throughout the interview. When I started by asking him why he wanted to ruin Christmas for tens of millions of people, he gave me the same boilerplate answer about the boys doing it to amuse themselves and embarrass these tech mega corps. “These companies make tens of millions every month from just their subscriber fees, and they should have more than enough funding to be able to protect against these attacks.” We went back and forth for about 15 minutes without him giving any hint of regret or awareness for how many people had been affected by his stunt.

“I'd be worried if those people didn't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles at Christmas Eve and Christmas Day,” he said. “I mean, I can't really say I feel bad. I might have forced a couple of kids to spend their time with their families instead of playing games.”

The interview blew up online, with more than a million views on YouTube and thousands of comments on Twitter, where many four-letter words were hurled at the Lizards. PlayStation and Xbox also received a torrent of abuse. Later they would offer a five-day extension to players' subscription periods and 10 percent off as compensation. The resulting bill for the company must easily have been in the millions.

Kivimäki went on to speak to other reporters, sometimes calling himself Ryan Cleary (a reference to another hacker he had vague and likely acrimonious link to from a previous teen hacker gang called LulzSec). In one interview and debate on YouTube channel DramaAlert he is implored by Kim Dotcom to stop the silly hacker rivalries that were impacting so many innocent people. “Hackers used to be respected; they used to have a magic about them,” Kim said, accusing Lizard Squad of harming the image of hackers around the world with their actions. Kivimäki's response is fascinating: He laughed it off as old-fashioned thinking. “It's wrong to connect groups like Lizard Squad with, for example, L0pht from a couple of decades back,” he said. “There's really no connection with the hacking groups of today and the hacking groups of two decades ago. The meaning is totally different now.”

Although many security experts angrily railed against the media's portrayal of Lizard Squad as “sophisticated,” people grudgingly came to accept that the Christmas attack did have a big impact on cybersecurity and the gaming industry. There's little doubt that this was not the group's motive—despite their clumsy attempts to claim so in interviews. But it was a wake-up call. Security website SecurityAffairs wrote a “lessons learned” piece by dissecting my interview with Kivimäki. Many people considered Lizard Squad script kiddies, they wrote, adding, “This approach is totally wrong.”

The size of the attack unleashed on that day would be shrugged off by most modern sites, but DDoS attacks are still commonplace and are getting more powerful. Expensive protection services are now a must-have for any organization that needs to stay online.

The attacks also started something of a cybercrime trend. In 2024 Europol unveiled an international law enforcement operation to take DDoS services down in December: “The festive season has long been a peak period for hackers to carry out some of their most disruptive DDoS attacks, causing severe financial loss, reputational damage, and operational chaos for their victims,” the organization said in a statement.

At the time of Lizard Squad's attacks, the general public was stunned. Despite Lizard Squad being on the tail end of a wave of teenage hacking groups in the 2010s, there was little awareness of the power that could be wielded by these otherwise amateur attackers. There might have been a vague feeling in the zeitgeist that “hackers in hoodies in their bedrooms” were increasingly causing problems, but this attack was immediate, unmissable, and easy to understand. It was of course also easy to get angry about. Over the next couple of days I came back to the story with follow-ups about the fallout as other Lizard Squad members spoke to YouTubers about the so-called “drama.” But the big thing the newsroom kept asking me was, When would these kids be arrested?

Vinnie Omari was the first. On New Year's Eve he was raided by the South East Regional Organized Crime Unit, which collared him on suspicion of cyber fraud offenses committed in 2013 and 2014. It looked like the raid was for other alleged offenses involving PayPal fraud, but the search warrant, which later surfaced online, also referenced the Christmas DDoS attacks. “They took everything: Xbox One, phones, laptops, computer USBs, etc.,” Omari told reporter William Turton from the Daily Dot. He was later cleared of any involvement.

After Omari's arrest, other Lizards were taken out too. On January 16, 2015, police announced that they had arrested an 18-year-old in Southport, near Liverpool. They didn't give a name, but reporters at the Daily Mail identified him: “The ‘quiet' teenager, named locally as Jordan Lee-Bevan, was arrested during a raid at his semi-detached home in Southport, Merseyside, today, with officers seizing computers as he was taken away in a police car.”

In 2016 teenager Zachary Buchta from Maryland was also arrested for his role in Lizard Squad and another group called PoodleCorp. As a boy he had been warned in 2014 about his criminal path by police who had caught him carrying out minor cybercrime activity. But he was undeterred and even changed his Twitter profile at one stage to @fbiarelosers to taunt the cops.

At the same time that Buchta was arrested, Dutch police raided and arrested another 19-year-old. Bradley van Rooy, who used the names “Uchiha” or “UchihaLS,” was accused of conspiring with other members of Lizard Squad to operate websites that provided cyberattack-for-hire services, facilitating thousands of DDoS attacks and trafficking stolen payment card account information for thousands of victims.

Bradley was put on bail for two years and eventually given a two-year suspended sentence and 180 hours of community service. The vast majority of charges against him were dropped as they had taken place when he was a minor. He ended up being convicted of the DDoS-for-hire operation and handling stolen credit cards. I tracked him down, and he openly talked about that period of his life, which he had put behind him a long time ago. “I'm now 27, and I see the damage that I did and understand that there could have been a higher punishment,” he says. “But then I also see that I was just a kid, and I had a troubled time at school and just fell into the hacking life after meeting the wrong people when I was playing the game RuneScape.”

Bradley's journey and words track so perfectly to the experiences of almost every hacker I have met or interviewed. It's as though there is a universal constant, whereby a subset of gamers in every generation is pulled into cybercrime in exactly the same way. There are literally billions of gamers in the world, so these people represent only a tiny fraction. But it seems to be inevitable and cyclical as hacker groups rise and fall.

The differentiating and more important aspect, though, is how these boys and young men react when they cross the line and are caught.

So what of Julius Kivimäki, aka “Ryan,” aka “Ryan Cleary” and many other aliases including the by now infamous “Zeekill”?

Surely, after appearing on TV and radio admitting that he was part of the gang, he too would be rearrested sharpish? Officers did indeed visit Kivimäki to interview him, but they did not arrest him—contrary to reports in the international media. It's not clear why they took no further action, but perhaps when the teenager confidently said that police would find nothing on his computer he was right. “They'd have to let me go,” he had cockily asserted in our interview. If so, maybe his run-in with police years earlier had taught him to cover his tracks more effectively. Or maybe he hadn't taken as much of a leading role in the DDoS attacks as he had claimed.

For Finnish cybercrime cop Antti Kurittu, seeing Kivimäki on TV was especially galling. Antti had raided and arrested Kivimaki two years earlier for other cyberattacks carried out with a different teenage cyber gang called HTP. “I remember watching your Sky News interview and just thinking ‘wow, this guy is not even trying to cover up his crimes. He's just a different sort of person,'” Antti recalls.

It wasn't until July 2015 that Kivimäki received his first criminal conviction. He was found guilty of the rather preposterous total of 50,700 instances of aggravated computer break-ins—one for every computer enslaved into HTPs botnet. He was also convicted of other offenses including data breach, money laundering, and being in possession of, and using, stolen credit cards. For all of these offenses, he was handed a two-year suspended sentence. If he had been an adult he could have got years behind bars, but as a minor and first-time offender he served no time in prison. So Kivimäki, just a few weeks from his 18th birthday, remained free. He began calling himself the “Untouchable Hacker God” on Twitter.

A year after Kivimäki's sentencing, in a bizarre coincidence, Antti bumped into Kivimäki in Amsterdam. It was April 2016 and Antti was walking through the departures lounge of Schiphol Airport when he passed the by-then 18-year-old. Antti did a double take, gobsmacked to see him. It was so surreal that they both found it amusing and took a selfie. After a short chat, Antti asked Kivimäki if he was now “staying out of trouble.” Kivimäki replied, “Of course.” But when Antti asked him for a contact email address, he made one up with “@FBI.gov” at the end. They laughed and went their separate ways.

But, as Antti predicted, the Untouchable Hacker God would be back. Four years later he was. And this time he was linked to the cruelest cyberattack in history and had a new alias: ransom_man.

Every gaming keyboard manufacturer seems to be jumping on the Hall effect bandwagon, and why wouldn't they? The keyboard technology has been proven in both esports arenas and home office setups worldwide and offers countless advantages over standard mechanical keyboards, with no real performance compromises.

Hall effect keyboards have also arrived as countless other technologies enter the keyboard space: Everything from gasket-mounting to touchpads is now in mainstream keyboards. That also means I regularly see new products, mechanical and Hall effect, with features I've never even considered before. Case in point, the Asus ROG Falchion Ace HFX, a small keyboard with a large name and a lot of unusual features.

This $200 wired-only keyboard has Hall effect switches, an 8,000-Hz polling rate, multidevice connectivity with two USB-C ports, and a programmable touchpad on the back edge. Not to mention countless on-keyboard controls and a flipable lever to enable or disable the rapid trigger feature found on most Hall effect keyboards. While it does have some strange design decisions, it has a lot of really clever ones too.

The Falchion has one of the deepest typing sounds compared to other Hall effect keyboards. This is likely a combination of the keyboard's unique HFX magnetic switches, one of the few I've tested that aren't made by Gateron, and the sound dampening inside. It consists of multiple layers of foam, Poron, and silicone, and a sheet of small rubber domes.

The switches feel incredibly smooth, even when pressed slowly, with a consistent feel throughout the entire keypress. They use a polycarbonate top housing, a POM stem, and a POM bottom housing, contributing to the deeper typing sound and ensuring smoothness across the entire keystroke. Unlike most Hall effect switches, the HFX doesn't have a hole in the center, instead, it moves the magnet to the front, where the metal contact leaf would typically be on a mechanical switch. This makes the Falchion incompatible with standard Hall effect switches, but likely improves the sound profile as well: Open-bottom switches tend to have a more hollow typing sound, which can be heard on competitors.

The springs are weighted to 55 grams of total force, which is 5 grams lighter than the Gateron Nebula dual-rail switches used by Keychron, and 10 grams lighter than the standard Cherry MX Red. There aren't any other switches available for this keyboard, but because Hall effect switches are contactless, the existing switches can be removed without any desoldering or extensive disassembly.

I didn't find myself wanting to change the switches, though—they have a poppy and deep sound that's incredibly crisp, and they feel responsive and smooth, especially with rapid trigger enabled. My largest issue with the typing experience was the keycaps. They have a rough texture that, while grippy, felt noticeably coarse and unpleasant when typing. It comes down to preference, but I found them less enjoyable than smooth or lightly textured keycaps.

The stabilizers in this keyboard use an older, less-common design seen on a few Razer keyboards in the past, where the stems clip directly onto the internal wires. The stems can be pulled out from the top to apply additional lube without needing to disassemble the keyboard. From the factory, none of them rattled or clicked at all.

The typing experience can be adjusted in a few ways. The largest is the dust cover included with this keyboard; it's essentially a bigger version of the keyboard's existing case lined with a layer of rubber. The keyboard can be placed inside it, creating a deeper, more rounded-out typing sound. When not in the cover, the keyboard's typing angle can also be adjusted with flip-out feet. It sits flat at 3 degrees and can be adjusted to 6 or 9 degrees, all standard angles.

The Falchion has top-of-the-line specs, but it stands out in how these features are implemented. Directly above the standard keys, there's an RGB light bar with an indicator on each side. The left indicator is linked to the touchpad on the back edge of the keyboard and shows what it is currently set to adjust. The right indicator shows whether the rapid trigger is enabled. These indicators, and their respective settings, are adjusted using controls on the back of the keyboard. Windows key locking and Caps Lock are located on this LED bar, too.

The button on the back edge of the keyboard cycles the touchpad through multiple functions. These are controlled by swiping and/or double-tapping the touchbar, and they include media playback controls, RGB brightness adjustments, and—the most unique and useful setting—live adjustment of the switches' actuation point, which makes adjustments more streamlined and reduces the need for using software. When adjusting the actuation point, the center light bar will fill in to indicate the adjustment: If it's halfway full, the switches actuate at 2.0 millimeters; if it's full, they actuate at 4.0 mm, and so on.

The lever on the right side, which activates rapid trigger, swaps between on and off with a satisfying click. Rapid trigger is a feature that's become standard on most Hall effect keyboards today. It allows a switch to be pressed down a second time immediately after it's released to register a second keypress, instead of waiting until the key returns to a neutral position. This allows for faster, rapid key presses and generally makes the keyboard feel more responsive, ideal for fast-paced games. It works perfectly on this keyboard, but is only set to work on the WASD keys by default. I had to go into Asus' Armoury Crate software to enable rapid trigger across all the keys.

The software shocked me: Asus got it right in almost every way. Armoury Crate is simple, easy to use, and incredibly lightweight. Almost every setting includes a description or an information tool tip, and there are diagrams to demonstrate how to use specific settings.

An 8,000-Hz polling rate, while fantastic, is overkill for the average person. Unless you're playing at incredibly high levels with no room for error, a keyboard this fast won't make a tangible difference in your gameplay. Still, it's always nice to have something excessively capable (until you can't blame losing in a game on your keyboard).

Another detail that's probably overkill but nice to have is the dual USB-C ports on either side of this keyboard. You can connect a device on each side and use the switch in the center to swap between them. If you're one of the rare people with two PCs at a desk, or if you swap between a desktop and a laptop, this is a great feature and rare to find.

While this keyboard's switches, buttons, and touchpad all feel great, the build quality is pretty average. The Falchion uses a modified tray-mount assembly that, while effective, doesn't bring anything special to the table. Typically, there are multiple posts that the printed circuit board (PCB) and plate screw onto, resulting in a singular, rigid piece without any softness or bounce when typing.

On the Falchion, these posts instead extend through the PCB and sit below the plate without making contact. The screws on top flare out from the posts to hold the plate in place. The internal assembly sits on top of the case's sound insulation, which has multiple small rubber domes placed throughout. These domes can slightly compress when typed on, resulting in a bounciness similar to a gasket-mounted keyboard. The domes look nearly identical to Topre domes, albeit much smaller, and the stacked design feels reminiscent of Mode's stack mount and lattice block mount designs, which both have the keyboard's internal assembly sitting on top of a mounting material instead of being compressed by it.

All this to say, it's an improvement on a standard tray mount, but ultimately falls short of true gasket mounting. It has some bounce, which alleviates the “dead zones” that a tray mount has near the mounting posts, but doesn't do much more. That said, not needing extra space for gaskets in the case makes the keyboard super compact.

The case is incredibly thin, and while this makes the keyboard more lightweight and portable, it also means it can easily be flexed by hand and will be more susceptible to cracking or damage during transport. The case uses metal screws that go directly into plastic, which could cause stripping or thread damage if you take this keyboard apart a few times to modify it, and the LED bar and buttons on top make it a bit difficult to remove the PCB without having to bend the case or risk breaking any of the screw posts. The LED bar creates further issues with how it is connected to the main PCB, using a mix of small JST connectors and ribbon cables that range from slightly annoying to nearly impossible to reconnect after a full disassembly.

There is one part of this keyboard that I can't understand, though: The Falchion includes a dust cover that can also be used as a secondary case for the keyboard to sit in. It has an obvious purpose to repel dust, but I can't understand why something like this was seen as a worthy inclusion on this keyboard. More than anything else, it seems like an extra piece of plastic to take up space, sit inside the box, or end up lost or thrown away a few years from now.

The Asus ROG Falchion Ace HFX is a solid keyboard. It has several great features that improve quality of life massively over other Hall effect keyboards: The controls at the top are practical and convenient, and the touchpad is novel and functional, especially with how well it is integrated into the LED light bar. The largest limitation is customizability: With proprietary switches and a complicated internal design, the Falchion doesn't have the same modification potential as many of its competitors from Wooting, Keychron, or even SteelSeries.

I prefer seeing a company take big swings, even if it means some misses alongside some hits, rather than play it safe and create something boring. The Falchion Ace HFX is a big swing, bringing some great new ideas to the table while still being a solid keyboard underneath.

Social network X has changed its developer agreement to prevent third parties from using the platform's content to train large language models.

In an update on Wednesday, the company added a line under “Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions,” a subsection of restrictions on use: “You shall not and you shall not attempt to (or allow others to) […] use the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model,” it reads. 

This change comes after Elon Musk's AI company xAI acquired X in March — understandably, xAI wouldn't want to give its competitors free access to the social platform's data without a sale agreement.

In 2023, X changed its privacy policy to use public data on its site to train AI models. Last October, it made further changes to allow third parties to train their models. 

Reddit has also put in place safeguards against AI crawlers, and last month, The Browser Company added a similar clause to its AI-focused browser Dia's terms of use.

Collibra, a data governance platform based in Brussels, is the latest enterprise to acquire a data company in order to expand its offerings in the age of AI.

On Thursday, Collibra announced its acquisition of Raito, a data access startup founded in 2021. Raito, also located in Brussels, helps companies manage which employees and customers have access to internal data.

Collibra declined to comment on the terms of the deal. Raito previously raised $4 million in venture funding from investors, including Dawn Capital, Crane Venture Partners, and Collibra itself.

Collibra founder and CEO Felix Van de Maele told TechCrunch that while managing data access is not a new problem for enterprises, it is becoming a bigger headache for data teams as more departments seek access for AI agents and workflow automation.

“We heard from our customers and large organizations that managing data access at scale has become a really big problem,” Van de Maele said. “That's why the traditional approaches just don't scale anymore. They're too brittle. They're manual workflows, [based on] static policies.”

Van de Maele added that Collibra already has a similar product, Collibra Protect, that touches on these access controls but is primarily focused on keeping data private. Raito's tech will help Collibra bolster and automate that offering.

Raito isn't the only company focused on data access. Legacy enterprises like SailPoint and SecureAuth are just a few of the companies also offering data access tools. Van de Maele said buying Raito was the right choice for the company, as opposed to partnering with a legacy player, because Raito is cloud-native and built for the current AI moment.

That Raito was founded by former Collibra employees didn't hurt either.

“We also [were] looking for teams that want to continue to build, right? It's not the end for this,” Van de Maele said. “It is just really the beginning of this journey.”

This is just the latest acquisition of a data company aimed at addressing a data governance void as companies look to shore up their stack to adapt to AI innovation. Last week, Salesforce announced its intent to acquire Informatica for the same reason. Earlier in May, both Alation and ServiceNow made similar acquisitions.

Van de Maele added that advancements in AI have made people realize just how fragmented their data stacks have become, as many players had flooded the market over the last decade with single-point data solutions.

“That fragmentation of governance … has really become a big problem, and so that's why we were excited to kind of acquire Raito and really make it part of Collibra, our unified governance platform for data and AI,” Van de Maele said.

Collibra was founded in 2008 as an early player in the data governance sector. The company has since raised nearly $600 million in venture capital from firms including Index Ventures, Sequoia, and Tiger Global, among others. The company works with enterprises that include Heineken, Credit Suisse, and SAP.

When Monik Pamecha co-founded AI voice startup Toma in early 2024, he hadn't anticipated spending the summer months sweating in Bible Belt car dealerships. He and co-founder Anthony Krivonos were still focused on banking and healthcare customers when the dealers came knocking. 

“They just called us up and said ‘we are drowning in phone calls,'” Pamecha described that initial contact in an interview with TechCrunch. 

Seeing an opportunity to pivot into a far less-regulated space than banking or healthcare, Pamecha and Krivonos set up a test: They decided to have their voice agent call essentially every car dealership in the country multiple times. Over the span of a few weeks they found those calls were only picked up 45% of the time. 

The co-founders packed their bags. And like some sort of modern reinterpretation of the movie “Tommy Boy,” they set out to tour a dozen car dealerships in Oklahoma and Mississippi to get a better understanding of how these businesses work. They got their hands dirty both figuratively and literally; Pamecha said his wife was surprised by the grease stains on his clothes when he returned home. 

That commitment paid off. Not only did they win customers, they got the dealers' full charm offensive. The founders shared home-cooked meals — a sometimes awkward-but-funny affair given Pamecha's vegetarianism, he said — and were invited to tour the Corvette Museum. At least one dealer even asked the Toma founders to tag along to a shooting range.

Seema Amble, a partner at a16z who led the $17 million that Toma has raised to date, said the pair were “effectively living at these dealerships, going to these dealers' family barbecues, really understanding how they operate.”

“We invest in a lot of the next-generation of vertical AI companies, a lot of the best founders have just lived and breathed with these customers to understand what's going on under the hood,” she told TechCrunch. “No pun intended.” 

The insights from that trip helped Pamecha and Krivonos sharpen the Toma voice agent into a tool that is already in use at more than 100 dealerships around the country. The AI helps customers schedule service appointments, handle parts orders, answer sales questions, and more.

Along with a16z, Pamecha and Krivonos attracted investment from Y Combinator (they created Toma at YC in January 2024), the Scale Angels Fund, and auto industry influencer Yossi Levi, also known as the Car Dealership Guy.

Levi told TechCrunch that dealerships struggle with phone calls in part because it's hard to predict volume. 

“It ebbs and flows. Sometimes you're overwhelmed with demand. Other times there's not enough demand, and matching staffing and properly training that staff for a consistent experience is just not an easy thing to do,” Levi said. AI has “provided an opportunity for dealers to really standardize that process, and deliver a richer customer experience that is consistent.” 

Pamecha said Toma's onboarding process involves training on a dealers' customer calls for a week or two to give the AI some context. This is important because while dealerships broadly do the same things, there can be a lot of variance in the details. Some dealers might service more diesel engines, for example. Dealerships also run lots of custom promotions for both sales and service.  

After that initial burst of training, the Toma AI starts taking calls, handing off to human employees if and when it gets stumped. Those handoff calls get analyzed, too, in order to reinforce the AI model to better help that specific dealership. On the business side, Toma operates a subscription model. As the AI agents can handle more parts of a dealership's operations, those dealers will have to pay up for those extra capabilities.

The Series A “comes at a great time” for Toma, according to Pamecha. The startup only hired its first true sales employee within the last few weeks. Before that, it was still largely Pamecha and Krivonos hustling like they did across the country last summer. 

Without that trip, though, Pamecha said he's not sure Toma would have reached this point.

“It has been one of the best experiences of my life,” he said. “I feel like we've all become friends, and I think it all comes from a place of like, feeling their pain. I think they see that we feel the pain, too.”

Anthropic says it has released a new set of AI models tailored for U.S. national security customers.

The new models, a custom set of “Claude Gov” models, were “built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs,” writes Anthropic in the blog post. Compared to Anthropic's consumer- and enterprise-focused models, the new custom Claude Gov models were designed to be applied to government operations like strategic planning, operational support, and intelligence analysis.

“[These] models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments,” writes Anthropic in its post. “[They] underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models.”

Anthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. government customers as it looks for dependable new sources of revenue. In November, the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic's major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic's AI to defense customers.

Anthropic says its new custom Claude Gov models better handle classified material, “refuse less” when engaging with classified information, and have a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. The models also have “enhanced proficiency” in languages and dialects critical to national security operations, Anthropic says, as well as “improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.”

Anthropic isn't the only top AI lab going after defense contracts. 

OpenAI is seeking to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, and Meta recently revealed that it's making its Llama models available to defense partners. Google is refining a version of its Gemini AI capable of working within classified environments. Meanwhile, Cohere, which primarily builds AI products for businesses, is also collaborating with Palantir to deploy its AI models, TechCrunch exclusively reported early last December.

PalmPay, an African digital bank fintech, is in talks to raise between $50 million and $100 million in a Series B round, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. 

It's unclear what valuation it hopes to get, but its last round, in 2021, ranked it among the continent's most valuable startups, estimated just shy of unicorn status.

While PalmPay declined to comment on fundraising specifics, a spokesperson said the 6-year-old fintech is “in a strong financial position and exploring growth opportunities.”

The company, which has raised nearly $140 million across its seed and Series A rounds, is now profitable, according to people familiar with its finances.

The new capital, expected to include both equity and debt, will fuel PalmPay's expansion: deepening its footprint in Nigeria, scaling its newer business-focused offering, and rolling out both products in new markets across Africa and Asia.

Last month, PalmPay announced it had hit 15 million daily transactions, driven by its 35 million registered users. These transactions now add up to “tens of billions of dollars” annually in value, according to the company.

Revenue has also surged. PalmPay's revenue — $64 million in 2023, according to the Financial Times — has more than doubled since, people familiar with the company's financials say. 

Launched in 2019, PalmPay started out in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and a major fintech hub. At the time, over half of adults in the country were unbanked, and traditional banks catered mostly to salaried or formal-sector clients, often with requirements that excluded mass-market users.

PalmPay saw an opportunity to flip that model on its head: build a digital bank from scratch, but optimize it for the realities of Africa's informal economy. The company launched an app featuring instant onboarding, zero transfer fees, and a growing suite of services (including credit, savings, insurance, and bill payments), all tailored to the needs of underbanked consumers and small businesses.

Crucially, PalmPay didn't rely solely on digital acquisition. The fintech built a vast on-the-ground network of over 1 million small businesses and agent merchants, who now serve more than 10 million customers monthly through the PalmPay Business app and point-of-sale devices (for cash-in, cash-out services). 

Other major fintechs in the country, including OPay, Moniepoint, and Paga, have also adopted the hybrid model, combining digital apps with physical touchpoints.

PalmPay claims to process more transactions than any traditional bank in Nigeria, and 25% of its users report that it was their first-ever financial account. For credit products, offered in partnership with licensed lenders, that number jumps to 60% among borrowers, it claims.

Part of PalmPay's strong distribution and marketing advantage stems from its partnership with Transsion, the Chinese phone maker that dominates smartphone sales in Africa, with a market share of over 40% across its brands (Tecno and Infinix). 

Through the partnership, PalmPay pre-installs its app on select financed smartphones, helping drive user acquisition and engagement.

Having established itself as one of the most widely used fintech apps in the country, PalmPay is now preparing to replicate its model in new markets abroad. 

The neobanking platform has expanded to Tanzania and Bangladesh (its first foray outside Africa), where PalmPay is entering with device financing and consumer credit as wedges before layering in more services. (Other African digital banks, including FairMoney, MNT-Halan, and TymeBank, have expanded their financial services into Asia with varying degrees of success.)

The company also plans to introduce device financing in Nigeria, its spokesperson confirmed. 

While Transsion, which led PalmPay's seed round, remains a strategic partner, the company's spokesperson says the fintech is actively exploring collaborations with more original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 

GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund) and MediaTek, one of the world's largest mobile chipset makers, are some of its other investors. 

On the business-facing side, PalmPay offers cross-border payments for merchants who want to send and collect payments across Africa via a single API, a recurring pain point (even with the promise of stablecoins). This newly launched business feature, currently live in Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania (with South Africa in the pipeline), already processes “hundreds of millions of dollars monthly,” the company's spokesperson confirmed.

Kind of.A lot of the apps I work with have front-ends developed by one team, and those rely on back-ends developed by one or more teams. Serving server-rendered HTML is not a great option in this case (as much as I loved the ""3270 way"" of 1990's web). As client-side complexity increases, it starts to pay off to build on foundations that add more functionality, such as React, Vue or Angular, the same way some teams will prefer TypeScript over vanilla JavaScript. Adopting a well known framework makes easier to onboard new team members, as nomenclature and organization are already known to them. And, while we are at it, the team in charge of the visual representation will appreciate ways to better organize their CSS files, and, if possible, just serve a single CSS assembled from a set of files with definitions organized by subject or function. A build step allows an application to be served with files that define only the functionality needed, leaving most of the framework behind.Not all web applications require it, of course, but I wouldn't say the expectation is to build a web application with bare HTLM/CSS/JS.

I hope that one effect of AI assistance will be that we can go back to full stack teams again. It should be easier to know enough about both sides to be productive in them with AI help.Then things like backend templates + HTMX would maybe work great for 90% of apps and be vastly simpler than the huge pile of technology we've been using in the frontend.

Honestly, what confuses me the most is that looking at the codebase FTA it just looks like a modern webapp codebase (albeit a small one) except without TypeScript. I don't really see the point in this case. It was one thing when tooling really sucked, but we're past the Webpack days: you can setup Vite in a minute and have a really nice and very fast bundled workflow out of the box. Nowadays the performance critical bits of bundlers are written typically in Go or Rust and decently optimized, so it's not like it takes a ton of memory or CPU time to bundle a modern app, especially one that is fairly small.There's really nothing wrong with rawdogging HTML/CSS/JS like the old days, I've certainly done it from time to time, but in this case it doesn't really look like the outcome is much different. If you're going to write a client-heavy app in a style that works perfectly well with modern tools, why not use the tools? If you don't like them, you can always get rid of them later. You can always strip out the TypeScript types and remove any reliance on bundler features and ship it as normal ES modules. It's really not hard at all, the reason why people don't do it is lack of obvious benefit.There's some middle ground between ""only dev tool is Notepad"" and ""hello welcome to my Vite + TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + Svelte + SvelteKit + tRPC + Y.js + leftpad starter pack"", you could always just choose the high-impact tools that help improve the code and the resulting application experience and be very deliberate about what you depend on.I read the article but I still don't entirely understand the point. (There's a focus on ""not using JS the browser doesn't understand"" but also, you don't have to?

If you're going to write a client-heavy app in a style that works perfectly well with modern tools, why not use the tools? If you don't like them, you can always get rid of them later. You can always strip out the TypeScript types and remove any reliance on bundler features and ship it as normal ES modules. It's really not hard at all, the reason why people don't do it is lack of obvious benefit.There's some middle ground between ""only dev tool is Notepad"" and ""hello welcome to my Vite + TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + Svelte + SvelteKit + tRPC + Y.js + leftpad starter pack"", you could always just choose the high-impact tools that help improve the code and the resulting application experience and be very deliberate about what you depend on.I read the article but I still don't entirely understand the point.

It's not that it's required per se, just that when it seems like most people use applications with a build step, experimenting is the right word to use when going the other way, even if it is the default. It might even be the case that the author hasn't made apps without a build step so again in their case, they indeed are experimenting with it, even if to others it doesn't seem like an experiment. In any case, as with any experiment, they are learning something new.

Well, I have to build it of course. As in, me as the developer has to make it.

Python, SQL, Linux, those are core skills I've used for over a decade and are just as useful as they were a decade ago.Javascript is obviously more than a decade old but a reason I've avoided that ecosystem is that you're often operating in the domain of year to year tools and skills on top of it.Decade long skills come as easily to you as English. (Or whatever your native language.) It's easy for people to overlook this because it's so easy to ""learn"" a skill right away and feel fluent.I've optimized for keeping as much of my work as possible/practical in decade long skills because it's pure productivity. If I'm turning over frameworks and tools regularly I'll still be productive, but not productive. I see it as a qualitative difference, not quantitative.

NPM/Node is at the heart of my displeasure with JS. I don't mind JS in the browser when done tastefully. But I don't think it makes much sense outside of the DOM. As another comment noted, you often have to go dig through CDNs and hack at URLs to get the actual JS files for non-insane hosting models (i.e., statically from the same machine that hosts everything else). The notion that I need a CDN to serve a few kilobytes of source for anything short of netflix.com is absolutely insane.I would advocate starting your next web project using 0 lines of JS, even if you intend to use the full USS Enterprise to build it out for prod. See how far you can get with just HTML & CSS. Consider that anything proximal to layout/style/art/etc. is entirely within this box. Javascript is not going to save you from an art problem. It can only make it worse.

Scientists have just discovered something most of us probably would've been fine never knowing: wild nematodes—also known as roundworms—love to climb on top of each other to build fleshy, writhing towers.

Researchers in Germany detailed their discovery in a new study published Thursday in Current Biology. They found and videotaped several nematode species, living out in the wild, organizing into these living worm towers—a phenomenon previously only seen in the lab. The findings also show that the microscopic worms use these structures to climb onto animals or objects that can bring them elsewhere, though there remain many other questions about the practice.

This Worm Has 100 Butts

According to senior study author Serena Ding, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, the towers are hardly a secret among the worm science community. But the behavior had reached a sort of mythical status, since no one had ever documented it in wild nematodes. That could have meant the worms are only compelled to build towers under lab conditions, which might have limited the usefulness of any research on the behavior.

“It's just something that always bugged me. I mean, yes, we're studying nematode collective behavior in the tower context and other contexts, but is it real?” Ding, the leader of a lab focused on nematode research at Max Planck, told Gizmodo. “So when I started my research program four years ago, I really dedicated a push towards just actually finding nematodes at a high density and high numbers doing this stuff out there. And then we were successful.”

It ultimately took months for Ding's colleagues, particularly co-author Ryan Greenway, to find and record instances of natural worm tower building in the decaying fruits strewn across the orchards near the University of Konstanz (one of three locations where the Institute is based). Once the towers were found, the researchers brought some into the lab for further study. They also encouraged and studied the creation of worm towers in the lab with Caenorhabditis elegans, a species frequently used for research.

“There's the important finding of, ‘Yes, they do exist.' But the second finding is that we actually confirm the towers can serve to disperse individuals at the same time,” Ding said. “This [has] always been thought of as a dispersal behavior, but nobody's really confirmed it.”

The researchers observed the worms in these towers latching onto animals like fruit flies passing them by, for instance, or using them as a sort of bridge to cross otherwise unreachable gaps. Moreover, the towers appeared to collectively respond to stimuli like being touched. The fruits contained loads of nematodes, but the towers themselves were always made of only one species at a time. All of this suggests that these living buildings should be seen as temporary “superorganisms,” similar to slime molds or certain ants.

Though Ding and her team did hope and expect to find the worm towers in nature, they were surprised in other ways.

The researchers found no evidence of the lab worms taking on different roles inside the tower, for one. The worms were equally mobile, and none appeared to have an advantage over others in becoming the head of the tower (i.e. the part that most benefits from this behavior). These worms are clonal, however, meaning they're practically identical to each other genetically. And it's possible that things aren't quite so chummy among more distantly-related worms in the wild.

“These are active directions which we're trying to follow up on right now, because not everybody gets to disperse. So who gets to disperse? Are they helping each other? Are they cheating?” Ding said.

There are other questions left to be answered about these towers. The team's lab experiments showed that C. elegans worms were capable of building towers throughout their lives, for instance, including adulthood. Previous research had suggested this behavior was only performed by dauer worms—a larval stage of life some worms adopt to survive harsher environments. At the same time, the natural towers they found were only made out of dauer worms, so maybe there's something else that makes the behavior more common during that stage of life.

Scientists Discover That Worms Get the Weed Munchies, Too

This research is only the start for Ding and her team, since they plan to pursue these mysteries further. But Ding hopes her team's work can already impart a valuable lesson, especially to other worm researchers. She notes worms like C. elegans are commonly altered in the lab so scientists can track how certain behaviors might work on the molecular level. But she argues that there's also still plenty more to be learned from studying them out in the real world.

“What I'm trying to do is to take really well-known organisms but study them from a more natural perspective. I want to understand not just how the behavior is generated, but also what the behavior means for the animal from a more ecological and evolutionarily relevant perspective,” she said. “At least for me, this is an important study where as a worm person, I can publish a study without using a single mutant and we're just looking at the behavior, and what those behaviors say. For me, that's super exciting.”

Personally, I'm just glad I now have more frightening trivia to bring up at my next party.

We've known for a while that the video gaming match made in heaven that is pairing IO Interactive–the studio behind the Hitman games–with the James Bond franchise. After all, Hitman is already essentially Bond with a bald guy and more ludicrous improvised weapons, why not let them actually take a crack with 007? After years of waiting, we finally have our first look: and IO is definitely shaking things up, and leaving them rather unstirred.

Last night during Sony's Playstation State of Play livestream, IO debuted the first trailer for 007: First Light, giving us a look at the tone to expect out of their twist on Bond–a wholly original rendition of the agent, of course, rather than being built on any of the prior actors to take on the mantle. It's got a very action packed modern day spy-fi vibe: you've got sneaking, you've got shooting, you've got lavish locales, beautiful women for Bond to flirt and fight with, high-tech gadgetry. It feels like a proper whizz-blend of all the eras of Bond, from Connery to Craig, in a contemporary setting. Plus, it uses the On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme for its big dramatic music track over the classic Bond motif, so you know it's good.

Being a brand new Bond, First Light will follow the plight of the reckless, but charming young MI6 agent as he's tapped by M for a mission that could grant him his fabled 00 status. And we mean young: although IO's staying tight-lipped about just who's playing the character yet, First Light‘s Bond has been confirmed to be just 26 years old in the game's story, making him the youngest-ever Bond.

Bond's age in Fleming's novels has always been obfuscated, but he's typically presented as being in his mid 30s to early 40s, while George Lazenby was youngest actor to play Bond on the big screen in his solo outing for On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But even he was 29 at the time, 3 years older than First Light‘s Gen Z Bond.

James should've been at the club (he at least briefly gets to go to one in this trailer)! We realistically might have our first Bond who has realistically played Fortnite with the boys! All your favourite heroes are getting rebooted to be younger and hotter and more licensed to kill than you! God, the passage of time is a lot sometimes.

It's kind of fascinating to see that First Light‘s Bond, even at his young age, still carries a lot of the same early origin details as Fleming's novels had for Bond: the climbing accident that orphaned him, his career in the British navy before he signed up for MI6. Young James has already lived a life before he gets set on a globe-trotting spy adventure. Now he's all grown up and flinging pistols at baddies' heads.

007: First Light will hit PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo Switch 2 when it arrives some time in 2026

Heads up, folks. This 20,000mAh Anker power bank is down over 40% for a limited time. That brings the price to just $40 (down from $70). It's equipped with two two-way USB-C ports, one of which already has the built-in cable, along with a USB-A port. This means you can charge up three devices at once. Plug in your laptop while your phone is recharging as well. And it's is compact so it can store easily in a backpack or messenger bag. The main USB-C cable can actually click back into the power bank so you'll never find yourself without a cable.

20,000mAh is the total energy this power bank holds. To put that in more grounded terms, It can charge an iPhone 15 four times from zero percent to a hundred before running out. Similarly, it's got just shy of four charges of a Galaxy S24 in it. It's fast too, operating at 30W. You can charge an iPhone 16 Pro Max to 50% with the Anker portable charger in just 27 minutes. Compare that to your traditional power bank which will take about an hour.

See at Best Buy

The portable charger features an interactive digital display so you can see just how much juice it has left while charging your phone, laptop, or earbuds.

I used to have a good power bank, but I lent it to a friend and never got it back. I considered picking up a new one before the trip, but figured, “Ahh, I probably don't need it. All planes these day have outlets and charging ports at your seat.”

Well, when I got there, the only port was a USB A. I went to pull out a charging cable and low and behold, it was USB C-to-C. All of my devices I had with me were USB C or my iPhone which again, the only cable I had was USB C-to-Lightning. Stranded in my aisle seat with a Nintendo Switch I forgot to charge and a laptop loaded with movies and shows with only about a half hour of use left. This flight sucked.

Don't do what I did. Grab this travel-friendly Anker power bank on sale for $40 and save $30 (-43%).

While it might feel as though artificial intelligence is getting dangerously smart, there are still some basic concepts that AI doesn't comprehend as well as humans do.

Back in March, we reported that popular large language models (LLMs) struggle to tell time and interpret calendars. Now, a study published earlier this week in Nature Human Behaviour reveals that AI tools like ChatGPT are also incapable of understanding familiar concepts, such as flowers, as well as humans do. According to the paper, accurately representing physical concepts is challenging for machine learning trained solely on text and sometimes images.

“A large language model can't smell a rose, touch the petals of a daisy or walk through a field of wildflowers,” Qihui Xu, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at Ohio State University, said in a university statement. “Without those sensory and motor experiences, it can't truly represent what a flower is in all its richness. The same is true of some other human concepts.”

The team tested humans and four AI models—OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and Google's PaLM and Gemini—on their conceptual understanding of 4,442 words, including terms like flower, hoof, humorous, and swing. Xu and her colleagues compared the outcomes to two standard psycholinguistic ratings: the Glasgow Norms (the rating of words based on feelings such as arousal, dominance, familiarity, etc.) and the Lancaster Norms (the rating of words based on sensory perceptions and bodily actions).

The Glasgow Norms approach saw the researchers asking questions like how emotionally arousing a flower is, and how easy it is to imagine one. The Lancaster Norms, on the other hand, involved questions including how much one can experience a flower through smell, and how much a person can experience a flower with their torso.

In comparison to humans, LLMs demonstrated a strong understanding of words without sensorimotor associations (concepts like “justice”), but they struggled with words linked to physical concepts (like “flower,” which we can see, smell, touch, etc.). The reason for this is rather straightforward—ChatGPT doesn't have eyes, a nose, or sensory neurons (yet) and so it can't learn through those senses. The best it can do is approximate, despite the fact that they train on more text than a person experiences in an entire lifetime, Xu explained.

“From the intense aroma of a flower, the vivid silky touch when we caress petals, to the profound visual aesthetic sensation, human representation of ‘flower' binds these diverse experiences and interactions into a coherent category,” the researchers wrote in the study. “This type of associative perceptual learning, where a concept becomes a nexus of interconnected meanings and sensation strengths, may be difficult to achieve through language alone.”

In fact, the LLMs trained on both text and images demonstrated a better understanding of visual concepts than their text-only counterparts. That's not to say, however, that AI will forever be limited to language and visual information. LLMs are constantly improving, and they might one day be able to better represent physical concepts via sensorimotor data and/or robotics, according to Xu. She and her colleagues' research carries important implications for AI-human interactions, which are becoming increasingly (and, let's be honest, worryingly) intimate.

For now, however, one thing is certain: “The human experience is far richer than words alone can hold,” Xu concluded.

Handle with care.

Nintendo's long-anticipated and likely most leaked handheld, the Switch 2, is set to hit shelves today. If you plan to purchase one, handle it with care, as replacement parts are expected to become more expensive, via Notebookcheck. Nintendo Japan's pricing indicates a massive surge of up to 92% for replacement parts, affecting components like the mainboard, LCD, dock, Joy-Cons, and even the new Pro Controller.

Since Nintendo has only disclosed these prices on their Japanese storefront, a direct comparison for U.S. customers is not possible. We have, however, drafted a table outlining the replacement parts for the Switch 2 alongside those for the Switch OLED, Switch V1 (HAC-001), and the Switch Lite from Nintendo Japan. With some expected variations, we may probably see a similar spike globally as well. (U.S. prices are conversions purely for reference)

Replacing the main board, which houses the Tegra T239 SoC along with 12GB (2x6GB) of LPDDR5x-8533 RAM, and 256GB of TLC-based UFS 3.1 storage, will run you 27,500 Yen ($175), or about 67% more expensive than the original Switch V1 from 2017. Even with an IPS panel, the Switch 2's display costs 30% more to repair than the Switch OLED (or 60% more than the Switch V1), attributable to its 120 Hz, HDR10, and VRR capabilities.

To Repair

4,290 Yen ($27.44 USD)

4,290 Yen ($27.44 USD)

4,290 Yen ($27.44 USD)

Replacement for parts excluding the CPU board and LCD were consolidated into a single package previously, but now Nintendo will charge different prices depending on the affected components. A faulty game card slot, Type-C port failure, or a battery replacement will cost Japanese consumers around 9,900 Yen ($63), or 65% more. Meanwhile, audio-related issues or a broken SD card reader are priced at 7,150 Yen ($45), or 18% more expensive than previous models.

Similarly, resolving video-output issues with the new dock will cost $44, a 76% increase compared to the Switch OLED dock's $25 repair fee. Despite not featuring hall-effect joysticks, the new Joy-Cons will cost $25 to repair, making them 40% pricier than their Switch OLED/V1 counterparts. Lastly, the Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back $41.50 in repair costs, making it 50% more expensive than its predecessor.

Most of these changes can be attributed to increased manufacturing costs and new features, but the clear takeaway is the importance of carefully handling your console. Given the Switch 2's MSRP increase from $299 to $449, higher repair costs were almost a guarantee. Aside from authorized repair, iFixit has lowered the original Switch's repairability score from 8/10 to 4/10, citing issues with parts availability, repair manuals, and design challenges. It remains to be seen if the Switch 2 will improve upon this or achieve an even worse rating.

Dutch team celebrates autonomous drone milestone.

A team of scientists from TU Delft in the Netherlands is celebrating a highly significant autonomous drone milestone. According to a university press release, “for the first time, a drone has beaten human pilots in an international drone racing competition.” This milestone for AI-controlled drones was passed at the recent A2RL Drone Championship 2025 in Abu Dhabi.

Situated in a large indoor space in the UAE capital, there were two prestigious drone racing events. The Falcon Cup Finals saw the best human pilots pit their skills against each other. Meanwhile, the A2RL Drone Championship was a showcase for the fastest AI-powered, autonomous drones. Perhaps most interestingly, a subsequent race dubbed the A2RL Grand Challenge allowed the best human pilots to face off against the best AI contenders. As per our headline, the TU Delft AI drone was the ultimate winner.

Central to the Dutch scientists' drone racing win was a finely tuned AI “capable of split-second, high-performance control.” The A2RL took place on the very winding track, with drones reaching flight speeds up to 95.8 km/h, so there's not a lot of room for suboptimal racing technique, let alone mistakes.

Readers must also understand that the autonomous racers were confined by several factors. Firstly, the drone only had access to a single on-device forward-facing camera and a single motion sensor, making the competition much fairer vs humans. The AI drone teams were also strictly time, computationally, and energy limited, notes the source.



TU Delft shares what might be one of the most important advances behind its drone's race success. The researchers say that a new element in this drone's AI is “the use of a deep neural network that doesn't send control commands to a traditional human controller, but directly to the motors.” This methodology yielded a very efficient AI model, which worked well with the limited on-board processing. It was suggested that, thanks to this technology, the Dutch racing drone could “more closely approach the physical limits of the system.”

The above milestone marks a great advance for the AI drone racing community. Obviously, there are implications to drone-based activity in the real world. Delivery drones could benefit from similar AI tuning, for example. However, wider implications for industries that will one day churn out millions of autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and so on are also clear.

Now, tardigrades can play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Physicists at Loughborough University in the UK have printed the ""world's smallest violin"" using new nanolithography tools. The team behind the instrument, which is thinner than a human hair, chose the project as a reference to the timeless insult. More than just a SpongeBob reference, the instrument represents the future of nanoscale computing.

Using a process the Loughborough team compare to screen printing on a microscopic scale, the violin is a tiny 13 microns wide and 35 microns tall. This puts it thinner than human hair, and small enough that even the smallest tardigrades could not play it—a fact made slightly less relevant by the violin's inability to produce musical notes.

The instrument is made of platinum through a process called thermal scanning probe lithography. The violin is a test print for the university's new thermal scanning probe microscope as it prepares to research nanoscale memory devices.

The above video shows Professor Kelly Morrison explaining the tech behind the diminutive etching. ""Building the world's smallest violin may all seem like fun and games, but a lot of what we've learnt in this process has essentially laid the groundwork for the research that's going to be implemented here,"" shares Morrison.

The university used its new thermal scanning probe microscope, a NanoFrazor from Heidelberg Instruments in Switzerland. The tool has an ultrasharp, ultra-hot probe tip that etches structures at the nanoscale into many different materials at resolutions as fine as 15 nm; a ""very, very, very, small needle that can see atomic interaction,"" per Morrison.

A stencil of sorts was etched into a resist-coated chip by the probe, which was then developed to dissolve the resist and leave behind an imprint in the shape of the etched violin. A layer of platinum was deposited on the chip, with a final acetone rinse leaving behind only the platinum violin statuette.

Loughborough's NanoFrazor is one of a very small number of units in the UK, and is unique among its peers thanks to its being installed in its so-called ""glove box"", keeping the probe and its potential air- and water-sensitive work materials safe from interference.

The nanolithography process employed to create the violin is already being studied by two teams at Loughborough's School of Science to iterate on and improve data storage technologies. One such research team is studying a future in heat-based storage systems; utilizing nanolithography to fabricate heat-sensitive nanoparticles may be a major step in memory devices utilizing multiple different materials on a single memory device.

Another project utilizing the nanolithography tools is an inquiry into using the probe to develop nanoscale magnetic sensors for even smaller magnetic memory devices. As magnetic hard drives continue growing smaller, it becomes more difficult to read and write magnetic data with acceptable stability at ever-increasing densities; this was the physical limit necessitating HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology in today's bleeding-edge hard drives. But if the magnetic reader could be made on the nanoscale, a new frontier in memory density could be opened up.

While many scientists and researchers have begun looking beyond to alternate hardware trends like photonic-based microchips as Moore's Law begins to slow, this push deeper into nanolithography promises to return dividends in extending the lifespan of traditional compute technologies. And from now on, when someone offers up a truly sad anecdote, you really can play for them a song on the world's smallest violin, provided, of course, you can catch a ride to Loughborough in Leicestershire.

Some concerns over a persistent SSH backdoor left by a stealthy exploit soothed by Asus


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Asus has issued multiple statements regarding a highly publicized botnet attack infecting over 9,000 routers to date. Per our previous reporting, the ""AyySSHush"" botnet has infected its hosts through a mix of brute-force attacks and authentication bypasses, and hides its backdoor in non-volatile memory, thus attempting to hide from firmware updates and refreshes.

In an official statement regarding the insecurity, Asus told Tom's Hardware that the vulnerabilities can be avoided for those yet uninfected, and fixed for those routers that have been compromised. The hostile agents utilize a known command injection flaw, CVE-2023-39780, to enable SSH access on a custom port (TCP/53282) and insert an attacker-controlled public key for remote access.

This exploit has been patched in the latest Asus firmware update, and as such, Asus advises all users of its routers to update their firmware. After this, Asus advises a factory reset, followed by adding a strong administrator password. For those users with routers that have reached end-of-life support, or those who are tech-savvy enough to open up their router settings and wish to avoid a factory reset, Asus recommends ""disabling all remote access features such as SSH, DDNS, AiCloud, or Web Access from WAN, and confirming that the SSH (especially TCP port 53282) is not exposed to the Internet.""

The AyySSHush botnet was first discovered by security firm GreyNoise in March, making its findings public in May, via alerts thrown up by its proprietary AI monitoring technology, Sift. GreyNoise categorizes the attackers responsible for the botnet as ""a well-resourced and highly capable adversary"", though without making any accusations about who the attackers were. A Censys search of the affected routers, which at the time of writing numbers above 9,500, can be found here. To date, activity from the botnet has been minimal, with only 30 related requests registered across three months.

In further comment specifically sent to Tom's Hardware, Asus adds that it sent push notifications to applicable users alerting them to update their firmware once the exploit became widely known. Users also have resources, including Asus's product security advisory page and an updated knowledge base article covering the exploit specifically.

Asus also claims to have been working to update firmware on models, including the RT-AX55 router, well before the GreyNoise report went up to protect against this known vulnerability. This is a key detail from the company, as CVE-2023-39780 reporting shows that Asus had been made aware of the vulnerability before the most recent GreyNoise report went out.

Any concerned Asus router users should confirm that their SSH is not exposed to the internet, and are advised to check their router's log for repeated login failures or unfamiliar SSH keys indicating a past brute-force attack. Leaving routers exposed to WAN access and the open internet is a recipe for disaster, and nearly all routers infected by the botnet were likely operating under highly vulnerable, unsafe conditions caused by end users. Still, as with all web security matters, it is better to be safe than sorry, and to ensure routers and other web-connected devices are operating on modern firmware.

The Wo-We Mini PC is amazingly cheap, but there are some trade-offs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


I was browsing through the r/buildapcsales today, looking for something interesting, when I stumbled onto quite the deal. Amazon is selling a fully-functional desktop mini PC for just $44.99, and that's not even a limited-time sale. But just what do you get for your money?

The Wo-We Mini PC is powered by a dual-core, Intel Celeron N4020 CPU and sports 4GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and Wi-Fi 5 wireless connectivity. It comes with Ubuntu Linux preinstalled, though we don't know which version.

In terms of video out, the PC has both a VGA and an HDMI port. It can support dual screens and a maximum resolution of 4K (on a single screen) via its Intel UHD Graphics 600 integrated GPU.

On its Amazon page, Wo-We claims that the Mini PC offers ""powerful performance without breaking the bank"" and that its Intel UHD 600 GPU offers ""state-of-the-art"" graphics technology. The company says that its 802.11ac Wi-Fi offers ""faster, smoother and more stable Internet access"" too.

The tiny, 5.12 x 6.61-inch black box has a USB-C 5 Gbps port, microSD and dual USB Type-A 5 Gbps ports on the front. The back has the VGA, HDMI, 1 Gbps Ethernet, and dual USB 2.0 ports.



Depending on your needs, the Wo-We is either ""Whoa, we got a lot for the money"" or ""Woe betide we who bought this."" If you just want to use web tools, are comfortable working in Ubuntu Linux (which isn't hard to learn), and don't do much multitasking, this could work out.

If you like to have many tabs open or you don't have a lot of patience, this could end up as a $44 paperweight. We haven't gotten the Wo-We Mini PC in for testing. However, we wouldn't expect great performance, considering that its 2019-era Celeron has two cores, two threads, 4MB of cache, a base clock of 1.1 GHz, and a boost clock of 2.8 GHz.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Those are some weak specs, as most desktop CPUs and even many mobile CPUs these days have boost clocks in the 4 to 5 GHz range. The good news is that the Celeron only has a 6W TDP, so it doesn't need active cooling. That keeps the Mini PC from making noise.

What probably hurts the experience more is the 4GB of RAM, which would make web browsing with more than a couple of tabs open a challenge. However, Linux usually makes better use of memory than Windows does.

Another problem: the eMMC memory is probably about equivalent in speed to a typical (not high-speed) microSD card. So boot time and the time you wait to open apps could be slow.

Tech-savvy users who know to expect lag may have the patience for slowness, but those who need this the most -- people who don't have computers already -- will likely be less inclined to tolerate it. If you're a low-information user, you may be confused by Linux and frustrated by any problems you run into. You could always get Windows and install it, though not Windows 11.

Of course, there are other low-cost choices that allow you to do basic computing. Right now, Woot has a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB of RAM for $44. However, during non-sale times, you're getting 2GB of RAM on your Pi at this price and 4GB will cost you quite a bit more. And with Raspberry Pi, you'd need to buy a microSD card to install your OS on, get micro HDMI cables for video and you couldn't run install Windows (like you can on the Wo-We).

Wo-We also sells a $54 Mini PC with 8GB of RAM but with an even older AMD Excavator A9-9400 CPU that launched in May 2016. That's a bit long in the tooth, even for a bargain.

It's interesting to see that you can get a workable, brand-new desktop PC for $44. However, the people most fascinated with this system (PC enthusiasts like me) probably need it the least.

A new ban on the sale and licensing of semiconductor design software to China could hit the company hard when it comes to building more advanced semiconductors in the future. While a new FT report notes that China has usable software for the 7nm process and up, more advanced processes for use in AI aren't supported yet, possibly hampering China's longer-term semiconductor development.

Less advanced chips for smartphones and the like are not expected to be affected.

The U.S. has extended tariff exemptions under Section 301, which include graphics cards and motherboards, until at least August 31. It means a 25% price rise that has been lurking behind some PC components for years. While a court recently struck down some of President Trump's tariffs, they'll remain in effect as the court battle over their legality plays out. Section 301 tariffs aren't included in the ruling, however.

 DISCLOSURES Authors and DisclosuresAuthor

Disclosure: Mauricio Sarmiento Chavero, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

In 2018, Samuel Kaufman, MD, specialist in gynecology and obstetrics, published a book titled Delivering Justice, in which he recounted his 15-year ordeal through a legal battle that he ultimately won — but at great emotional cost. The introduction notes that the physician became emotionally involved in the case and was pulled out of his comfort zone, and that the anxiety experienced during legal proceedings as a defendant was exhausting.

In many parts of the world, lawsuits for medical malpractice have become increasingly common. In Mexico, for example, standards of accountability in healthcare have broadened, and there are now multiple legal avenues through which patients can file complaints when they feel inadequately treated. This has led to malpractice suits becoming more routine.

A review conducted in India in 2024 explored the intersection of terms such as negligence, malpractice, litigation, and consequences. The review identified 17 relevant articles and concluded that legal cases involving healthcare professionals have a significant negative emotional impact. Not only can these situations lead to stress and guilt, but in extreme cases, they have even been associated with suicide. The authors argue that more research is needed to better understand how these proceedings affect health professionals.

In 2000, Albert Wu, MD, MPH, professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, coined the term “second victim syndrome” to describe a condition experienced by healthcare workers who have committed a medical error and suffer psychological trauma as a result. The symptoms often include emotional distress, cognitive disruptions, and burnout, which can increase the likelihood of future errors.

Although second victim syndrome and stress resulting from a medical negligence case are not the same, it's clear that both errors and legal issues in day-to-day practice can harm clinicians' mental health.

A 2009 article described the natural course of recovery from second victim syndrome, outlining six phases:

Today, it is increasingly likely that healthcare professionals will, at some point, face legal proceedings related to medical negligence. This makes it all the more important to understand the emotional toll of these processes and how to respond to them. 

Some hospitals have introduced morbidity and mortality conferences where clinicians' decisions are reviewed and mistakes are openly analyzed. Such discussions are valuable for improving the quality of care and preventing future errors, but little attention is paid to the emotional and psychological impact on the physicians involved.

Sometimes, as in cases of second victim syndrome, negative emotional responses can occur even in the absence of a lawsuit. It is crucial that we continue discussing clinical errors within healthcare institutions while ensuring these conversations do not further heighten emotional distress for the people involved. These meetings should not feel like an inquisition.

With regard to medical liability, much research has focused on the specialties most often sued, the economic impact of claims, and the relationship between quality of care and liability judgments. However, there is a notable lack of research on how litigation affects healthcare workers and their performance after they are notified of a legal complaint.

It is difficult to offer general recommendations on this issue, because each case is unique. In my opinion, feelings of guilt or anxiety after a serious error or in the face of litigation are normal. Personally, I would be concerned about someone who felt no such emotions at all — or who felt them only minimally.

My first recommendation is to seek psychological support. The second is to obtain medical liability insurance, especially because many malpractice cases are handled in civil court and carry financial consequences. If we can reduce the fear of losing our assets through proper insurance, that may help alleviate some of the stress of being involved in legal proceedings.

Today, lawyers need primary care physicians just as much as physicians need legal counsel.

Nirsevimab implementation in Catalonia, Spain, was associated with a 44% reduction in emergency department (ED) visits for bronchiolitis in infants younger than 6 months and a 48% reduction in hospital admissions compared with previous seasons. The multinational study analyzed 1,574,392 ED visits and 255,689 hospital admissions across Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy.

“Nirsevimab had a clear impact in reducing attendances and admissions for infants with bronchiolitis aged < 6 months in Catalonia. However, the impact on older infants was less clear, making it unrealistic to imagine a substantial change in the epidemiology of infants accessing EDs or inpatient wards, at least in the near future,” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Aida Perramon-Malavez, Computational Biology and Complex Systems Group, Department of Physics, Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, Spain. It was published online in The Lancet Regional Health – Europe.

As a retrospective analysis, the study faced several limitations. The proportion of visits and admissions coded as bronchiolitis varied widely across countries, potentially due to coding differences or health system factors rather than true epidemiological differences. The researchers could not directly match all diagnoses in International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms codes. Limited virology testing of ED visits prevented determination of the relative contribution of respiratory syncytial virus toward the disease burden in the studied seasons.

CHICAGO — Can spotting an emerging ESR1 mutation early and changing first-line drugs before progression improve outcomes in patients with hormone receptor (HR)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative advanced breast cancer?

Interim findings from the SERENA-6 trial suggest that may be the case. 

Patients who switched from a first-line aromatase inhibitor to camizestrant, an investigational next-generation oral selective estrogen-receptor degrader, at the first signs of an emerging ESR1 mutation demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival compared with those who continued their initial regimen.

Notably, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing allowed investigators to identify ESR1 mutations, which emerge at the time of disease progression in about 40% of patients on a first-line aromatase inhibitor and lead to treatment resistance. 

Camizestrant, which has shown activity in patients who develop ESR1 mutations, helped improve first-line outcomes and has “potential to become a new treatment strategy,” according to co-principal investigator Nicholas Turner, MD, PhD, professor and honorary consultant in medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital, London, England, who presented the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. Results were simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

This trial also demonstrated “the clinical utility of ctDNA monitoring to detect and treat emerging resistance in breast cancer,” said Turner.

While praising the findings, others were not convinced that the SERENA-6 results warrant a change in practice yet.

“Based on first-line progression-free survival alone, this could represent a new regulatory approval path,” said invited discussant Angela DeMichele, MD, of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. But, DeMichele cautioned, “I cannot recommend the SERENA-6 strategy at this time.”

One key reason, DeMichele noted, is that it's too early to tell whether this strategy improves overall survival. If camizestrant is approved based on progression-free survival and quality of life, DeMichele wondered, is it worth going through the ctDNA testing process if the drug doesn't help patients live longer?

Paolo Tarantino, MD, a breast oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston, echoed this sentiment in a tweet on X: “Outstanding results, though not ready for clinical practice (yet),” adding that it will also be “important to take into account financial, psychological, and systemic costs of the strategy.”

In the study, 3256 patients who had received at least 6 months of treatment with aromatase inhibitors and CDK4/6 therapy (palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib) received ctDNA testing with Guardant360 CDx every 2-3 months at the time of routine staging exams.

Overall, 315 patients who had an ESR1 mutation detected and had no radiologic evidence of disease progression were randomly assigned to either switch from the aromatase inhibitor to 75 mg of camizestrant daily (n = 157) or continue their aromatase inhibitor/CDK4/6 regimen (n = 158). (An additional 233 patients who had an ESR1 mutation detected were not included for a variety of reasons, including disease progression and consent withdrawal.)

At the planned interim analysis, the median progression-free survival was 16.0 months in the camizestrant group and 9.2 months in the aromatase inhibitor group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.44; P < .00001). At 24 months, only 5.4% of patients who had continued their initial first-line treatment had not progressed compared with 30% of patients on camizestrant. The progression-free survival findings were consistent across clinically relevant patient subgroups.

Patients who switched to camizestrant also showed improved time to deterioration in global health status and quality of life — a median of 23.0 months vs 6.4 months in the aromatase group (aHR, 0.53).

At the time of the interim analysis, overall survival data were immature, with 20 deaths in the camizestrant group and 19 in the aromatase inhibitor group (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.48-1.73). As for time to second progression, there were 38 events in the camizestrant group and 47 events in the aromatase group, but the findings were also immature.

As for adverse events, 60% of patients in the camizestrant group had a grade 3 or higher event, 10% of which were deemed serious compared with 46% in the aromatase group, 12% of which were serious. Neutropenia (45% vs 34%, respectively) and anemia (5% in both groups) were the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events. Only 1% of patients on camizestrant discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

Overall, Turner concluded that “for people with HR-positive advanced breast cancer, the results of SERENA-6 show that camizestrant plus CDK4/6 inhibitor could be a new treatment option to use at the point of ESR1 mutation detection during treatment with first-line aromatase inhibitor plus CDK4/6 inhibitor — but before the cancer grows.”

Despite the promising findings, DeMichele highlighted several key unanswered questions and challenges.

Notably, will this strategy lead to longer overall survival and demonstrate clinical utility?

Overall survival and time to second progression are currently not known, DeMichele said. The trial did not address whether first-line treatment gains would be lost if camizestrant was given in the second-line setting after anatomic progression.

DeMichele also noted the high cost and potential anxiety associated with serial ctDNA testing. Overall, “the full complement of financial, psychological, and systemic costs is needed to fully assess utility and feasibility for implementation,” she added.

SERENA-6 was supported by AstraZeneca. Turner disclosed consulting or advisory roles with AstraZeneca, Exact Sciences, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Guardant Health, Inivata Lilly, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Relay Therapeutics, Repare Therapeutics, and Roche. DeMichele disclosed a consulting or advisory role with Pfizer.

The PREVENT trial found preventive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) combined with optimal medical therapy was more effective than medical therapy alone in reducing major adverse cardiac events in patients with non–flow-limiting vulnerable plaques. The new analysis found patients with non–flow-limiting vulnerable plaques had similar 2-year cardiac outcomes regardless of diabetes status, but those who received preventive PCI combined with optimal medical therapy had lower rates of cardiac events than those who received medical therapy alone.

“These findings support that preventive PCI…irrespective of diabetes status, in patients with non–flow-limiting vulnerable coronary plaques,” the researchers wrote.

Vulnerable plaques “may be guilty by association but may not be the sole culprit behind residual cardiovascular risk,” wrote Diana A. Gorog, MD, PhD, of Imperial College London, London, England, in an editorial accompanying the journal article. Such plaques “may be just one marker of a vulnerable patient, but not the only determinant of risk. Perhaps we need to find better ways of identifying the vulnerable patient, rather than focusing solely on vulnerable plaques,” Gorog added.

This study was led by Min Chul Kim of Chonnam National University Hospital in Gwangju, South Korea. It was originally presented at American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2024 and was published online on May 29, 2025, in European Heart Journal.

The clinical outcomes were exploratory as the study was powered only for the composite primary endpoint, with event rates lower than anticipated. The researchers did not differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which might have limited the generalizability of the findings. Intravascular imaging at follow-up was not performed routinely.

This study was funded by the CardioVascular Research Foundation, Abbott, Yuhan Corp, CAH-Cordis, Philips, and Infraredx. Several authors reported receiving research grants, consulting fees, and honoraria from various pharmaceutical and healthcare companies, including the funding agencies.

Ethanol ablation was highly effective in treating smaller and pure cystic metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, but it was less effective in treating larger or solid nodes. Patients with lower disease stages at diagnosis were more likely to have a good response to ethanol ablation.

“Our results suggest that neither a positive BRAF mutation status nor an aggressive histological subtype in the primary tumor is crucial to determine if the patient will be a suitable candidate for EA [ethanol ablation],” the authors wrote.

“While surgery remains the first-line treatment, further evidence is needed to better understand any potential role of EA as an alternative to surgery in selected cases, also in surgically untreated neck regions,” they added.

This study was led by Pål Stefan Frich, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital in Oslo, Norway. It was published online in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

The exclusion of many eligible patients increased the risk for selection bias, affecting the generalizability of the findings. The sample size was limited and division into small subgroups reduced the study's statistical power. The retrospective design and long follow-up periods posed a risk for information bias due to incomplete documentation.

This study was supported by grants from the Ødegaard and Frimann-Dahls foundation. The authors declared no relevant conflicts of interest.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Consuming higher amounts of diet drinks and/or saccharin was associated with an elevated risk of developing diabetes, while total artificial sweetener intake, sucralose, and aspartame showed no significant association, according to an analysis of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.

The current analysis, presented at NUTRITION 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, included 4654 adults (54.4% women, 50.1% White individuals) enrolled in the CARDIA study, with a mean age of 24.9 years at baseline in 1985-86.

Dietary intake was assessed by the CARDIA diet history at year 0, year 7, and year 20. The cumulative average intakes of artificial sweeteners, diet beverages, aspartame, and sucralose were calculated.

Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL, oral glucose tolerance test 2-hour glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL, A1c ≥ 6.5%, or use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits.

Associations of incident diabetes across quintiles of artificial sweetener, diet beverage, aspartame, or sucralose intakes through year 30 were assessed with time-dependent multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models.

The models were adjusted for age, sex, race, field center, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol drinking, diet quality, and family history of diabetes.

Over a median follow-up of 30 years, 691 incident diabetes events occurred. Participants in the fifth quintile of diet beverage intake had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes than those in the first quintile (hazard ratio [HR], 2.29).

Positive associations were also observed for intakes of saccharin (HR, 2.10).

Adjustment for waist circumference attenuated the associations slightly, but overall, higher intakes of diet beverages and saccharin were associated with an increased risk for incident diabetes.

This study represents a “first pass,” as the team still has more work to do, including a mediation analysis, explained coauthor Lyn Steffen, PhD, professor of Epidemiology and Community Health at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis.

“These findings highlight the need to evaluate the long-term metabolic effect of artificial sweeteners on glucose metabolism,” the authors noted.

A previous CARDIA analysis by Steffen's team suggested that long-term intakes of aspartame, saccharin, or diet soda were related to greater volumes of visceral, intermuscular, and subcutaneous adipose tissue.

“I recommend limiting the use of any sweetener,” Steffen told Medscape Medical News. “For beverages, I suggest unsweetened water, coffee, tea, milk, or small amount of 100% fruit juice — a small amount meaning limited calories, not 12- or 20-fluid-ounce containers.”

CARDIA is supported by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Steffen declared having no relevant competing interests.

CHICAGO — The antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pivekimab sunirine (PVEK) yielded high response rates with good durability in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) in the phase 1/2 CADENZA trial.

“We conclude that PVEK represents a potentially practice-changing paradigm for patients with the rare disease BPDCN,” said study author Naveen Pemmaraju, MD, of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, during an oral abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. “One half of first-line patients treated with PVEK subsequently received stem cell transplant. PVEK treatment had a manageable safety profile, and infusion-related reactions and peripheral edema were resolved with supportive care. No capillary-leak syndrome was observed.”

CADENZA enrolled 84 adult patients with CD123-positive BPDCN. Of these patients, 33 were newly diagnosed, and 51 patients had relapsed or refractory (R/R) BPDCN with one, two, or three prior lines of therapy. In the first-line group, 22 patients had de novo disease and 11 had a prior or concomitant hematologic malignancy (PCHM). 

CADENZA's primary endpoint was the composite rate of complete response (CR) plus CR with minimal skin abnormality (CRc) in the first-line de novo patients.

The authors found that 70% of patients achieved the composite CR, while 14% of the patients with R/R disease did. Regarding the overall response rate (ORR), 85% of first-line patients responded to PVEK, while 35% of patients with R/R disease responded. 

Responses among patients with R/R disease were early and durable (median, 1.4 months and 9.2 months, respectively).

PCHM status did not affect overall survival (OS) in first-line patients: Median OS was 16.6 months in both the de novo and PCHM subgroups.

The discussant for this study, Raajit Rampal, MD, PhD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, told Medscape Medical News that the CADENZA trial supports the use of CD123 as a therapeutic target in BPDCN. He also noted that the current standard of care often causes potentially life-threatening capillary leak syndrome (CLS): “There were no cases of CLS in this dataset, which means we may have an opportunity to deliver anti-CD123 therapies, with no CLS as a potential side effect.” 

Rampal also cited PVEK's apparent ability to enable many patients to bridge to stem cell transplant, “the fundamental prospect in terms of long-term survival provisions with BPDCN.”

Following this presentation, Pemmaraju sat down with Medscape Medical News. The following interview has been edited for clarity. 

Please give us some context on BPDCN and why it is difficult to treat.

BPDCN is a rare, aggressive hematologic malignancy primarily involving skin, bone marrow, lymph nodes and the central nervous system. We think there are only 500 BPDCN diagnoses per year in the United States. Current treatment regimens are limited to chemotherapy regimens adapted from AML, ALL, lymphoma, and myeloma. The median age at diagnosis is around 65 years, so many patients are not eligible for intensive chemo or stem cell transplant. CD123 is overexpressed on all BPDCN blasts, making it an ideal target for immunochemotherapy.

What is the top takeaway from your presentation?

BPDCN has an overall poor prognosis with significant unmet need. Currently, tagraxofusp-erzs is the standard of care and the only approved treatment for BPDCN. PVEK is a new CD123-targeting agent. This novel monotherapy, given once every 3 weeks, had high response rates for frontline patients with BPDCN and was highly durable. Even for patients with R/R disease, whose prognosis is only a few months, PVEK showed some promising activity both in response and durability.

Patients with BPDCN are in need of improved frontline therapies to treat their disease, so we're very excited to see this phase 1/2 trial going extremely well in terms of safety and efficacy. The responses we have observed make PVEK a strong candidate as a standard-of-care treatment.

What is another important thing you want your colleagues to know about this study?

The CADENZA trial enrolled 84 patients, which is a huge number in a rare disease field like ours. I'm proud we were able to achieve a real-world demographic split. That means we had older patients, just like I see in the clinic, and half the patients had skin involvement along with bone marrow. In the relapsed group, the prior therapy had been quite intense. Half of these patients had received chemo, half had received tagraxofusp, and a third had received a transplant. This may be the best study I've ever done in terms of enrolling patients who are truly representative with all the comorbidities, and all the difficulties, you see in clinical practice. 

You mentioned that PVEK is more patient-friendly than the standard of care. Why is that?

PVEK is given once every 3 weeks via an infusion that takes only 30 minutes or less. Many of our other drugs, of course, require a much more intensive schedule that can be difficult for patients, especially when they must be given on an inpatient basis. PVEK can be given outpatient even from the beginning, which is much more convenient for patients.

You referred several times to patients' skin lesions. Is that part of the BPDCN disease process or is that a treatment reaction?

I want to emphasize this is a BPDCN trait not related to treatment. BPDCN has a predilection for the skin. The vast majority of patients with BPDCN, anywhere from 70% to 90%, will present with skin findings. It's very common for my patients to present with “just” a skin lesion that turns out to be anything but. Unlike other skin-containing malignancies, BPDCN is a bone marrow blood cancer that can go to an acute leukemia and become acutely life threatening. Let's differentiate that from the cutaneous toxicity very commonly seen in chemo-based regimens.

We will keep presenting our data, including at the European Hematological Association and as an ASCO Encore presentation. We hope to submit PVEK to regulatory agencies in the near future. Ultimately, can we combine PVEK with other agents active in the AML and BPDCN space to create a next-generation therapy? Eventually, once we have two active agents for BPDCN, we will need to determine the sequencing of these drugs. What's the natural history of these treated patients? Are they living longer? I think answers to all those questions will come out in the coming year or two.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has reiterated that women using weight-loss drugs must use effective contraception, as the risks of these drugs to a foetus remain unclear.

The warning follows concerns that some users in the UK may not be taking GLP-1s safely. To date, the MHRA has received more than 40 reports relating to pregnancies in women taking these medications.

“These medicines must not be taken during pregnancy, while trying to get pregnant, or during breastfeeding,” the MHRA stated. 

Women who become pregnant while using these drugs should stop treatment immediately and consult a healthcare professional. There is not enough safety data to determine if the drugs could harm a developing baby, the agency said.

The MHRA also warned against buying these drugs from unregulated sources such as beauty salons or via social media.

“Not only does this expose people wanting to lose weight to serious health risks, it is also against the law to sell these medicines in this way,” said Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer.

The agency emphasised that weight-loss drugs should not be taken without first consulting a healthcare professional.

“The only way to guarantee receiving a genuine GLP-1 medicine is to obtain it from a legitimate pharmacy,” Cave said.

“Community pharmacies have been experiencing unprecedented levels of interest for weight loss injections,” said Jasmine Shah, medication safety officer at the National Pharmacy Association. 

“It is therefore important that regulations and guidance keep pace with this demand.”

The MHRA noted that Mounjaro (tirzepatide) may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in people with overweight or obesity. 

Women taking Mounjaro should use a non-oral contraceptive method for 4 weeks after starting the drug and for 4 weeks after any dose increase. This advice applies only to Mounjaro users.

Patients are also advised to be alert for signs of acute pancreatitis.

“There is hardly any available data from human studies to be able to advise if these weight loss drugs are safe in pregnancy,” said Rebecca Reynolds, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Edinburgh. “The data from animal studies suggests the potential for harm with low birthweight and skeletal abnormalities, though more evidence is needed to assess if there are risks of taking these drugs in humans,” she told the Science Media Centre (SMC).

Dr Bassel Wattar, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, supported the MHRA's warning. 

“There is some data from animal studies suggesting there is a risk of malformation to the foetus — in animals falling pregnant while taking GLP-1 agonists — but data remains limited in humans,” he said. 

However, Dr Caroline Ovadia, senior clinical lecturer in obstetrics at the University of Edinburgh, noted to the SMC that existing human cohort studies had not shown clear evidence of harm.

Although direct evidence linking GLP-1 drugs to contraceptive failure is limited, the high number of users means even a small risk could have public health implications, experts warned.

Professor Ying Cheong, consultant in reproductive medicine at the University of Southampton, speaking to the SMC, said that gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, could impair oral contraceptive absorption, increasing the risk of unintended pregnancy. 

“Many people are buying weight loss drugs online and so may not receive this important advice about contraception,” Reynolds pointed out.

“These are not harmless lifestyle drugs,” stressed Cheong. “The public urgently needs to understand that these medications require proper medical supervision to avoid unintended harm, particularly to reproductive health.”

Maintaining optimal vascular health throughout late life can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia before age 80 years, new research showed. Investigators estimated the proportion of new dementia cases linked to modifiable vascular risk factors.

The results suggested that 22%-44% of dementia cases by age 80 years could be attributed to poor vascular health through age 74 years.

The findings highlighted the “potentially immense value of early detection of vascular risk factors and primordial prevention (eg, vis-à-vis promotion of physical activity and healthy body weight management) beginning in midlife,” wrote the study team, led by Jason Smith, PhD, with Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

The study was published online on June 2 in JAMA Neurology.

Hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are widely recognized modifiable vascular risk factors for dementia. While their roles have been studied individually, the cumulative impact of these risk factors across the lifespan — and how this varies by genetic background, race, and sex — has been less clear.

Smith and colleagues used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study, with 33 years of follow-up, to assess the fraction of dementia attributable to hypertension, diabetes, and smoking measured at different life stages.

A total of 7731 participants were included in the analysis of risk factors measured at age 45-54 years (58% women, 71% White, 29% Black); 12,274 contributed data at age 55-64 years (55% women, 76% White, 24% Black); and 6787 contributed data at age 65-74 years (56% women, 80% White, 20% Black). Overall, a total of 2218 people developed dementia by their 80th birthday.

By age 80 years, the population attributable fraction of dementia attributable to at least one vascular risk factor measured at age 45-54 years was 22%; at 55-64 years, it was 26%, and at 65-74 years, it was 44%.

Only 2%-8% of dementia cases occurring after age 80 years were attributable to these vascular risk factors.

Subgroup differences emerged. For example, the attributable fractions for the vascular risk factors were higher in APOE-ε4 noncarriers aged 55 years or older (range, 33%-61%). “This reflects the fact that in populations with lower genetic Alzheimer risk, the extent of the relative contribution of vascular disease to dementia risk is greater,” the study team explained.

Attributable fractions for the vascular risk factors were also higher in Black individuals aged 45 years or older (range, 26%-53%) and women aged 55 years or older (range, 29%-51%).

Risk factor clusters such as hypertension plus diabetes and smoking plus diabetes significantly increased dementia risk, with hazard ratios ranging from 2.00 to 3.54, depending on age and risk factor combination. The importance of hypertension and diabetes increased with age, whereas the importance of smoking decreased with age.

“Given the contribution of vascular disease to dementia and the overlap in risk factors between CVD and dementia, interventions that address these underlying risk factors have the potential to reduce the risk of both outcomes,” the co-authors of a linked editorial said.

These results also suggest that “to be optimally effective, interventions to reduce dementia risk by addressing vascular risk factors may need to be individualized and targeted based on factors such as age, genetics, race, and sex,” Roch A. Nianogo, MD, PhD, with University of California, Los Angeles, and Deborah E. Barnes, PhD, MPH, with University of California, San Francisco, wrote.

The study had no commercial funding. Smith, Nianogo, and Barnes reported having no relevant disclosures.

The latest results from the BREAKWATER trial have confirmed encorafenib plus cetuximab with chemotherapy as the new first-line standard of care for BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), according to research presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting.

At the interim analysis, encorafenib plus cetuximab with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy doubled median overall survival compared with the current standard of care — investigators' choice of chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.

In addition, at a median follow-up of 16.8 months, the new treatment regimen led to a significant improvement in median progression-free survival of almost 6 months.

This survival finding is “unprecedented” and “practice changing” for these patients who historically have a poor prognosis, said lead investigator and presenter Elena Élez, MD, PhD, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Italy. The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with Élez's presentation.

BRAF mutations, which occur in up to 12% of patients with metastatic CRC, are associated with poor outcomes. In December 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib alongside cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 for patients with metastatic CRC and a BRAF V600E mutation. This approval was based on earlier results from BREAKWATER that showed a 21% higher objective response rate and a longer duration of response with this regimen.

The accelerated approval means that this regimen has already been making its way into the clinic, but “we were all waiting for this [latest] data,” Pamela Kunz, MD, chief of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, told Medscape Medical News. The doubling of overall survival “is a big deal,” she said. 

In the trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either first-line encorafenib plus cetuximab with mFOLFOX6 (n = 236) or to a control group — physician's choice of either mFOLFOX6, FOLFOXIRI, or CAPOX chemotherapy (n = 243). Most patients in the control arm also received the tumor angiogenesis inhibitor bevacizumab.

The broad options in the control arm speak to how heterogeneous treatment has been for BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic CRC, said study discussant Andrea Sartore-Bianchi, MD, a medical oncologist at the University of Milan, Milan, Italy.

Patients in the trial had received no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Investigators excluded patients with high levels of microsatellite instability because they are candidates for immunotherapy.

At a median follow-up of 16.8 months, median progression-free survival was 12.8 months for the encorafenib group compared with 7.1 months for the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; P < .0001).

At a median follow-up of 22 months, overall survival was 30 months in the encorafenib group compared with 15 months in the control group (HR, 0.49; P < .0001).

The benefits of the combination were held up in high-risk subgroups, including in patients with liver metastases and those with metastases in three or more organs. 

With the use of more agents and a longer duration of treatment due to improved efficacy, there was an expected increase in toxicity with the new regimen.

The rate of treatment-related grade 3/4 adverse events was 76.3% with encorafenib vs 58.5% with the control regimen. Patients receiving encorafenib also had higher rates of anemia, arthralgia, rash, and pyrexia, but there was no substantial increase in treatment discontinuation.

BREAKWATER also included an encorafenib plus cetuximab arm without chemotherapy, but enrollment was stopped early at 158 patients due to possible futility. Still, these patients had as good or numerically better outcomes than the control group, which means the drug combination alone is a valid option for those unable to tolerate chemotherapy, said Élez.

“The results are striking,” said Sartore-Bianchi in his discussion. “Now that we have the big picture” from BREAKWATER, the combination should be considered the first-line standard of care.

Mark A. Lewis, MD, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Intermountain Healthcare in Murray, Utah, explained that what usually happens in metastatic CRC is that people are treated with chemotherapy for a bit before oncologists notice the tumor is behaving more aggressively than expected and order a BRAF test.

This delay is now “completely unacceptable,” he told Medscape Medical News. The takeaway from BREAKWATER is that testing must come sooner.

To help with BRAF testing, the FDA approved the Qiagen therascreen BRAF V600E RGQ polymerase chain reaction kit.

“As soon as you know patients are BRAF-mutated, you need to play your entire hand” because it will double survival,” said Lewis. “This absolutely validates a biomarker-informed approach to colon cancer,” similar to what we have in breast cancer.

BREAKWATER was funded primarily by Pfizer, maker of encorafenib, with support from Eli Lilly and Merck, who jointly market cetuximab. Élez reported numerous ties to the companies, including research grants, travel funding, honoraria, and/or consultant work. Lewis, Kunz, and Sartore-Bianchi had no relationships with the firms.

Patients with pollen allergy who were exposed to higher concentrations of grass pollen were more likely to have physical symptoms and impairments in day-to-day life.

“To enhance clinical practice, it is essential to address the gap in adequate medical care for pollen allergy patients and prioritize patient education on recognizing and managing allergic rhinitis,” the authors wrote. “Advancements in technology-assisted self-monitoring could further empower patients in managing their symptoms and understanding the interplay between environmental triggers and allergic complaints,” they added.

Jonas Huss, with the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Munich, Germany, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on May 28 in Scientific Reports. 

The study relied on physician-diagnosed allergies and self-reported patient data. Additionally, the absence of individualized air pollution or weather data, a limited sample size, and strict exclusion criteria further limited the generalizability of the findings.

The study was funded by the Bavarian State Ministry of Health and Care. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

In individuals with obesity, 90 minutes of cold exposure increases energy expenditure by 18% but also raises energy intake and causes significant discomfort.

“The negligeable impact on [energy expenditure], as well as the overall absence of effects on [energy intake], seem to make [cold exposure] an unlikely candidate for improved body weight control in individuals with obesity,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Kurt McInnis, University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was published online in International Journal of Obesity.

Energy expenditure was measured in a postprandial state, potentially masking the true effects compared with fasting conditions. The study used only a single dose of cold exposure, so the effects of repeated exposure remain unknown. Core body temperature was not measured.

This study was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research. One author disclosed receiving support from Bausch Health, Canada.

I recently presented a clinical scenario of a young woman who presented with fatigue and had a long history of nightmares. I was concerned that she might have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and I asked readers whether they agreed with my management of this patient.

Thank you for the comments on this case. The majority of the comments focused on a workup for the patient's symptoms beyond mental illness, which is completely appropriate for this patient. First, a targeted history should be completed to include the following elements:

I would also recommend the following basic laboratory evaluation:

Other labs may be ordered, as needed, based on the patient's targeted history.

But adding all those elements to this case would yield quite a lengthy document to read online! And of course, there are always more questions to ask of patients and more studies to be ordered, but the pressure of time in primary care dictates that we be judicious with our fact-gathering.

Although my decision to ask the patient about past events that might relate to her fatigue and bad dreams was the most popular answer selected in the reader poll, some commenters disagreed with my approach. I was surprised by multiple comments that suggested my consideration of a potential psychological disorder would be considered patronizing or offensive to this patient, and one commenter recommended “physiology before psychiatry.” I respectfully disagree.

First, a mental health or sleep disorder is at the top of the differential diagnosis of an otherwise healthy young woman with fatigue. When a physician fails to address a potential mental health disorder for fear of offending said patient, they risk delayed diagnosis, worsening symptoms, diminished treatment options, and a breakdown of trust in her care, all of which could have devastating consequences. As mentioned in my original article, PTSD negatively affects multiple domains of function and is associated with an increased risk for suicide.

I completely understand that patients can feel marginalized by the idea of a mental health diagnosis. And it's entirely understandable that a woman presenting with persistent fatigue might fear that a psychological explanation simply repeats historical patterns of medical sexism; after all, attributing women's health complaints to “hysteria” is a real historical wrong. Yet when that same fatigue is coupled with a decade-long history of recurring nightmares — symptoms strongly suggestive of an underlying mood or stress ‐ related disorder — a thoughtful clinician must expand the differential diagnosis to include those possibilities. By transparently describing how each symptom fits into a broader clinical picture, the doctor honors the patient's concerns and makes a diagnosis based on comprehensive evidence, not gender bias.

In responsible practice, a physician uses validated screening questions, explains the medical rationale clearly, and invites open dialogue with the patient (at their own pace). That way, mental health issues are assessed objectively, based on clinical need and symptom presentation. We, as a society, need to move away from stigmatizing mental health diagnoses, and that starts with the patient encounters we have every day. 

There is no reason that mental health diagnoses should be placed at some level below other diagnoses. Mental health diagnoses incur significant amounts of morbidity and are risk factors for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease. Patients who are diagnosed with mental health disorders should not feel any different from patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.

It is up to us, as clinicians, to lead insightful, evidence-based, empathic evaluations of our patients to accurately diagnose their conditions and treat them appropriately. I hope that this case reminds you of that calling.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

A new diabetes-specific 10-item screening tool demonstrated excellent performance in detecting binge eating disorder in both patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), showing strong associations with glycaemic control and mental health outcomes.

""A two-step approach using the PAID followed by the DEPS-10 can be a feasible and time-efficient procedure in routine care,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Laura Yvonne Klinker, Diabetes Center Mergentheim in Bad Mergentheim, Germany. It was published online on May 29, 2025, in Diabetic Medicine.

Higher DEPS-10 scores in one fifth of the participants may have been affected by glucagon-like peptide 1 therapy. Additionally, the relatively low positive predictive value of the DEPS-10 could have been attributed to its broader scope in detecting various disordered eating behaviours beyond binge eating disorder.

Airborne hazardous chemicals can be dilute, mobile and hard to trap. Yet, accurately measuring these chemicals is critical in protecting human health and the environment.

Now, a new, small, low-cost device, nicknamed ABLE, could make the collection and detection of airborne hazards much more efficient. The device, just four by eight inches across, was devised by Jingcheng Ma, assistant professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the University of Notre Dame, and researchers at the University of Chicago. The results of their work were published in Nature Chemical Engineering.

ABLE has immediate applications in hospitals, where viruses, bacteria and nanoplastics can be detected directly from the air - offering less invasive alternatives to blood draws, particularly for vulnerable infants in neonatal units.

""Many important biomarkers - molecules your body produces when it's dealing with pathogens - are very dilute in the air. They could be at the parts per billion level. Trying to find them is like locating six to seven people in the global population - very difficult,"" said Ma, the study's first author, who conducted the research as a postdoc at the University of Chicago.

Ma, whose graduate training was in thermal science and energy systems - a field in which the transfer of water from liquid to steam is central - wondered how airborne biomarkers might behave if condensed into liquid. Could these molecules be captured in water droplets? Would their concentration in liquid be the same as their concentration in air? Would different molecules condense differently?

If airborne biomarkers are tested in gas form, large, expensive machines - such as mass spectrometers - are usually necessary. However, if the researchers could convert the air into a liquid, an array of low-cost, accurate measuring tools became available - paper-based test strips, electro-chemical sensors, enzyme assays and optical sensors.

We discovered that many molecules can effectively enter water droplets even when their concentration is very low. We didn't need to develop any advanced chemical systems to capture these biomarkers in water. It's a very natural process.""

Jingcheng Ma, assistant professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering, University of Notre Dame

The ABLE device, which can be made for under $200, sucks in air, adds water vapor and cools it. The air sample condenses into water droplets on a surface of microscopic silicon spikes - a process through which even tiny amounts of contaminant become highly concentrated. These droplets then slide into a reservoir where they are tested for biomarkers.

Ma's research group, the Interfacial Thermofluids Lab (ITL), is exploring ways to miniaturize ABLE, enabling it to fit into portable sensing systems or robotic platforms for environmental and healthcare monitoring. The group is also working with community partners to monitor the health of vulnerable infants in neonatal care.

""I like to do what I call 'budget research,' that is, use simple and low-cost components, but do something important that no one has achieved before. I like research that delivers something everyone can buy from the store,"" Ma said.

An echocardiography of the baby's little heart soon after the onset of labor can predict the outcome of the birth and in particular whether the baby will adequately tolerate the contractions or will be more likely to go into distress, necessitating a caesarean section or an operative delivery.

This is suggested by a study published in the BJOG, British Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and coordinated by Professor Tullio Ghi, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart, campus of Rome campus – and Chairman of the Obstetrics Unit at the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. The study was carried out with the collaboration of other experts, including Professor Andrea Dall'Asta from the University of Parma and Professor Basky Thilaganathan from St George's University in London.

Preventing intrapartum hypoxic injury during childbirth is crucial for the future health of the baby.

In this work, at the onset of labor we studied and measured the changes in the shape of the baby's heart with ultrasound scanning. We noticed that, based on certain parameters, it is possible to predict which infants have a heart strong enough to tolerate maternal contractions, and which ones instead are at greater risk of developing hypoxic stress during labor and will therefore need a caesarean section or an instrumental vaginal birth to prevent possible complications.

Professor Tullio Ghi, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Catholic University of Sacred Heart, campus of Rome campus – and Chairman of the Obstetrics Unit at the Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS

He continues: The assessment of baby's heart morphology seems to work as a triage test, allowing to pick up since the very beginning of labor the small group of babies who are unfit for vaginal delivery because they are more susceptible to intrapartum hypoxia

The study involved 208 pregnant women at the onset of labor. The majority of these women had a spontaneous uncomplicated birth while in 20 of these an operative delivery was necessary due to suspected foetal distress. In the latter group, the study of the fetal heart revealed different morphological parameters compared with the group that had an uncomplicated delivery.

The study suggests for the first time that identification of abnormalities of fetal cardiac function early in labor may impact the clinical management. In  such circumstances the the decision to expedite birth through an operative delivery (e.g. caesarean section or use of vacuum extractor)  with the aim of preventing intrapartum hypoxic injury might be considered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Statins show no additional benefit for depression treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250604/Statins-show-no-additional-benefit-for-depression-treatment.aspx","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 02:51:00 GMT","

Lipid-lowering medicines, known as statins, are prescribed in cases of high cholesterol levels, to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke. The results of some small studies suggest that statins could also have an antidepressive effect. Researchers from Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin have now conducted an extensive study to investigate this claim. However, they could not verify that statins cause any antidepressive additional effects. As a result, the researchers suggest following the general guidelines and prescribing statins to help lower cholesterol, but not to manage depression. The study has now been published in the JAMA Psychiatry journal.

Cholesterol-lowering drugs are the most commonly prescribed medicines globally. They have anti-inflammatory effects and lower the production of cholesterol in the liver, which in turn reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. In the past, numerous small studies have suggested that statins may also have antidepressive effects, alongside these more common properties. ""If statins really did have this antidepressive effect, we could kill two birds with one stone,"" says Prof. Christian Otte, Director of the Department of Psychiatry and Neurosciences on the Charité Campus Benjamin Franklin, and leader of the study. ""Depression and adiposity, or obesity, are among the most common medical conditions globally. And they actually often appear together: Those who are obese are at a higher risk of depression. In turn, those with depression are at a higher risk of obesity."" Obese patients often have higher cholesterol levels, so statins are administered to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. But could they also alleviate depression?

Led by Christian Otte, the research team conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the potential antidepressive effects of statins that have been suggested. A total of 161 patients took part in the study, all of whom suffered from both depression and obesity. During the 12-week study, all participants were treated with a standard antidepressant (Escitalopram). Half of the participants also received a cholesterol-lowering drug (Simvastatin), while the other half were given a placebo. It was decided at random who would receive statins and who would be given the placebo – the recipients of each were unknown to both the medical team and the participants. This ensured a randomized and double-blind study that would produce reliable results.

This method should show us whether we can observe a stronger antidepressive effect among participants treated with statins, compared to those in the placebo group.""

Dr. Woo Ri Chae, co-lead author, Charité BIH Clinician Scientist at the Department of Psychiatry and Neurosciences

The researchers used established clinical interviews and self-completed questionnaires to record the severity of depression in the patients at the beginning and end of the study. Blood samples were taken from the participants to determine their blood lipid levels and level of the C-reactive protein (CRP), which are known indicators of inflammatory processes in the body. ""People with obesity and/or depression commonly exhibit slightly raised inflammatory markers in the blood. For some of those affected, this can actually be the cause of depression,"" explains Christian Otte. ""And this is precisely where we began with our hypothesis on the potential antidepressive effect of statins: If administering statins leads to an improvement in inflammatory markers, could this also possibly be accompanied by an antidepressive effect for some of the study participants?""

At the beginning of the study, the participants ranged from moderately to severely depressed. Over the course of the 12-week study, the depression symptoms in all patients showed clear improvement – there was, however, no difference between those who received statins and those in the placebo group. ""Administering the cholesterol-lowering drug improved blood lipid levels, as expected, and the inflammatory marker CRP also displayed a marked reduction,"" says Woo Ri Chae. ""So, unfortunately, this does not point to an additional antidepressive effect."" Christian Otte adds: ""When it comes to treating depression, statins therefore have no additional benefit. To our present knowledge, traditional antidepressants remain the gold standard."" According to current guidelines, statins should be prescribed to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. The researchers recommend that the same should naturally also apply for patients suffering from depression.

In further studies, Christian Otte's team will conduct a more thorough analysis of the blood samples taken as part of this research on a cellular and molecular level, to reveal potential differences and correlations. The researchers are also continuing to work at full speed on improved strategies for treating patients with depression who also suffer from other conditions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early gut bacteria may help protect babies from respiratory infections","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250605/Early-gut-bacteria-may-help-protect-babies-from-respiratory-infections.aspx","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 04:48:00 GMT","

A baby's makeup of gut bacteria - their microbiome - which starts to form as soon as they are born, could help protect against viral infections later in childhood, a new study suggests.

As part of the largest study of UK baby microbiomes to date, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University College London (UCL) found that babies with a specific mix of gut bacteria at one week old, which was only found in some babies born vaginally, were less likely to be hospitalised for viral lower respiratory tract infections (vLRTI) in the first two years of life.

This research, published today (4 June) in The Lancet Microbe, is the first study to show an association between the makeup of the gut microbiome in the first week of life and hospital admissions for respiratory infections in early childhood. The team did this using whole genome sequencing and analysis of stool samples from 1,082 newborns and then using their electronic health records to track admissions to hospital up to the age of two years old.

Building on previous findings from the UK Baby Biome Study, this new research suggests that certain microbiome compositions could give different benefits, such as protection against viral infections.

While further research is needed to prove this link, these findings could help shape future research and prevention efforts for childhood respiratory diseases, including the development of effective infant therapeutic probiotics to reduce the risk of respiratory infections in infants.

Overall, this study sheds more light on how the gut microbiome in early life plays a role in our future health and underscores the importance of even larger studies such as the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project.

The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of millions of microbes that are vital for human health and important in immune system development. As it begins to form immediately at birth, the first month is the earliest window for intervention that could be used to restore or boost the microbiome.

Previously, the team found that babies born vaginally have a different microbiome compared to those born via caesarean section (C-section), although the differences largely evened out by the time the child was one-year old. A different study from the same team also found that all UK babies have one of three bacteria within the first week of life, called pioneer bacteria. Two of these, Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) and Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve), are considered beneficial as they help promote the development of a stable microbiome.

In new research that builds on both of these studies, the team at the Sanger Institute and UCL analysed stool samples from 1,082 newborns to understand how pioneer gut bacteria acquired in the first week of life may affect their health outcomes later in infancy. The researchers then looked at electronic health records to track admissions to hospital from birth and up to the age of two, and see if there was any association.

The researchers found some babies born vaginally, with a higher amount of pioneer bacteria B. longum in their early gut microbiome, alongside other similarly beneficial Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species, such as B. bifidum and B. dorei, had a lower risk of being admitted overnight to hospital for vLRTI, when compared to all other babies. This was still seen after taking account of important confounders, such as babies receiving antibiotics, and whether babies were fed with breastmilk, formula, or both.

However, not all babies born vaginally had the same microbiome composition. The team identified two other groups of babies based on their microbiome profile, who had a higher risk of hospital admission for vLRTI compared to those in the B. longum group. These other microbiome profiles were found in babies born vaginally and by C-section.

It's important to note that the team observed this finding as an association, otherwise known as correlation, and further research is needed to prove any causal links. While this study has examined only one common health outcome in children - respiratory viral infections - future research with a much larger cohort is needed to investigate whether the possible protective effects of B. longum, or other potentially beneficial pioneer bacteria such as B. breve, may be linked to other health outcomes. The researchers aim to explore this in the upcoming 4M study.

Dr Cristina Garcia-Mauriño, first author of the study at UCL, said: ""Viral lower respiratory tract infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalisation in young children, and our research raises the possibility that certain early gut microbiomes might help lower this risk. Further research to confirm and explore the factors behind this, including if there is an interaction between the gut microbiome and the lung microbiome, could lead to new ways to help prevent respiratory infections in childhood.""

While observational, our findings that certain infant microbiomes are linked to a lower risk of viral respiratory infection in childhood are striking and new. This is the first time that this association has been observed, and it was only possible due to the size of the Baby Biome Study, and by combining high-resolution genomics technologies with clinical outcomes. To understand more about how our microbiome impacts health, larger studies such as the 4M project are crucial, and I am looking forward to insights from both the Baby Biome Study and 4M that will further shape our understanding of how our microbiomes and our health interact.""

Professor Nigel Field, senior study author at UCL, and co-lead of the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project

Professor Louise Kenny, Lead Investigator of the Children Growing up in Liverpool (C-GULL) study and previously a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, who was not involved in this study, said: ""A Caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby. Furthermore, decisions around childbirth are personal and complex, and there is not one single approach that is best for everyone. While this study suggests that some babies born vaginally may be less likely to experience severe respiratory infections, this was not seen across all babies born this way, suggesting that other factors are at play. Further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture and to help find new ways to ensure advice and clinical approaches are tailored to personal situations.""

Dr. Trevor Lawley, senior study author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and co-lead of the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project, said: ""Within the first few days of our lives, our microbiomes are already thriving ecosystems that develop and adapt with us as we age. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that the pioneer gut bacteria acquired in early life may influence health later on, highlighting how gut microbes could help protect us from infections and other diseases. Different types of infant gut bacteria may provide different benefits, and understanding these could pave the way for developing targeted infant probiotics to support early microbiome development. In the future, we might be able to create personalized interventions that optimise a child's gut microbiome based on their unique microbial profile, promoting better health and development.""

A new National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant will aid Wayne State University researchers in measuring the effects of fentanyl during pregnancy on maternal behaviors and offspring at birth through early development.

This two-year, $423,500 grant, ""Understanding the effects of gestational fentanyl exposure on external morphology, neonatal opioid withdrawal, and brain volume, morphology and neurochemistry of offspring,"" is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the NIH. The principal investigators on this study are Shane Perrine, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences in Wayne State's School of Medicine, and Susanne Brummelte, Ph.D., professor of psychology in Wayne State's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Our labs have collaborated on prior studies and this project is a natural extension of our previous work. I was working on the study of illicit fentanyl use and Susie's lab was looking at the effects of opioids, including morphine and buprenorphine, during pregnancy.""

Shane Perrine, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences in Wayne State's School of Medicine

Both researchers credited a news report and a previous NIH grant received by Brummelte to examine the effects of opioids during pregnancy as what inspired them to explore this area.

""An NBC news report came out that was based on a published study suggesting there's a new syndrome called fetal fentanyl syndrome related to fentanyl use during pregnancy,"" said Perrine. ""This was characterized by birth defects such as facial abnormalities, webbed toes and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. We wanted to study these effects in our rodent model since it involved both of our areas of study.""

The study will determine the impact of gestational fentanyl exposure on morbidity and mortality, developmental milestones, external morphology, blood cholesterol, brain morphogen signaling, and neonatal opioid withdrawal and related behavioral measures in offspring. The team will also measure brain volume, morphology and the neurochemistry of offspring using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in vivo.

""No previous studies used proper animal models to study the effects of fetal fentanyl syndrome,"" said Brummelte. ""In humans, timing, exposure, the dose and so forth can make interpreting findings difficult so we wanted a more controlled study using the funds from this grant.""

""Developing the animal model will allow us to explore the neurobiological mechanisms that cause these fetal fentanyl syndrome defects,"" said Perrine. ""We want to see if it is just fentanyl or if there are other factors at play such as polydrug use or genetic predisposition that can contribute to these defects.""

Perrine and Brummelte hope their findings may help mitigate adverse health outcomes of infants exposed to fentanyl during pregnancy.

""Once we find out what specifically is causing these defects, we can start looking for solutions to prevent them or address them,"" said Brummelte.

""R21 awards from the National Institutes of Health help support researchers explore new research ideas that could foster innovative ideas that may one day lead to breakthrough discoveries,"" said Ezemenari M. Obasi, Ph.D., vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. ""I look forward to the findings that Drs. Perrine and Brummelte will have that may lead to new knowledge about the impact of fentanyl on unborn children.""

The award number for this grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health is R21DA062066.

A study of almost 1000 pregnant women in Zimbabwe found that a daily dose of a commonly used, safe and inexpensive antibiotic may have led to fewer babies being born early. Among women living with HIV, those who received the antibiotic had larger babies who were less likely to be preterm. 

One in four live-born infants worldwide is preterm (born at 37 weeks' gestation or before), is small for gestational age, or has a low birth weight. The mortality rate for these small and vulnerable newborns is high, with prematurity now the leading cause of death among children younger than 5 years of age. Maternal infections and inflammation during pregnancy are linked to adverse birth outcomes, particularly for babies born to mothers living with HIV, who have a greater risk of being born too small or too soon. 

An international group of researchers, led by Professor Andrew Prendergast from Queen Mary University of London, and Bernard Chasekwa from the Zvitambo Institute for Maternal and Child Health Research in Zimbabwe, conducted the Cotrimoxazole for Mothers to Improve Birthweight in Infants (COMBI) randomised controlled trial, to examine whether prescribing pregnant women a daily dose of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent with anti-inflammatory properties that is widely used in sub-Saharan Africa) would result in heavier birth weights, decreased premature births, and better health outcomes for their babies. 

993 pregnant women were recruited from three antenatal clinics in Shurugwi, a district in central Zimbabwe, and received either 960 mg of the drug or a placebo daily. The participants received regular antenatal care during their pregnancies and data regarding their birth outcomes were recorded. 

Although birthweight did not differ significantly between the two groups, the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group showed a 40% reduction in the proportion of preterm births, compared to the placebo group. Overall, 6.9% of mothers receiving the drug had babies born preterm, compared to 11.5% of mothers receiving the placebo, and no women receiving antibiotics had babies born prior to 28 weeks. For babies born to a small group of 131 women with HIV, the reduction in premature births was especially marked, with only 2% of births in the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group preterm, as compared with 14% in the placebo group. Babies exposed to antibiotics during pregnancy also showed a 177 gram increase in their birth weight. 

Our trial, conducted within routine antenatal care and enrolling women predominantly from rural areas, showed that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not improve birthweight, which was our main outcome. However, there was an intriguing suggestion that it may have improved the length of pregnancy and reduced the proportion of preterm births. We now need to repeat this trial in different settings around the world to see whether antibiotics during pregnancy can help reduce the risk of prematurity."" 

Bernard Chasekwa, first author

Professor Andrew Prendergast, Professor of Paediatric Infection and Immunology at Queen Mary, said: ""Our findings suggest that a low-cost, daily antibiotic, in a setting where infections like HIV are common, might reduce the risk of preterm births. We desperately need new strategies to prevent preterm births, which are the leading cause of under-5 child mortality. If we can confirm in other trials that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduces the risk of babies being born too soon, it would be a promising new approach to help newborns survive and thrive."" 

Sophie Hawksworth, Senior Manager of Clinical Discovery Research at Wellcome, said: ""If we are to reduce child mortality globally, it is critical to reduce the risk of preterm births, especially in areas with limited access to neonatal intensive care units and resources. This is a promising study and whilst the primary outcome of birthweight was unaffected in the trial, the prospect that this treatment prevents preterm births warrants further study.""

Giving a P2Y12 inhibitor anti-clotting drug to patients with coronary artery disease is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke compared with traditional aspirin, with no increased risk of major bleeding, finds a study published by The BMJ today.

P2Y12 inhibitors are often given to patients alongside aspirin (""dual therapy"") after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) - a procedure to widen or unblock a coronary artery - to help prevent cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

After several months, patients are usually switched from dual therapy to lifelong aspirin, but some trials have suggested that a P2Y12 inhibitor may be more effective for long term prevention than aspirin.

To explore this further, researchers analysed individual patient data from five randomized clinical trials involving 16,117 patients (average age 65; 24% women) who were assigned to a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) or aspirin after completing dual therapy following PCI.

After an average follow-up period of around 4 years, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy was associated with a 23% lower risk of an outcome that combined cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke, compared with aspirin, with no significant difference in major bleeding. This means that for every 46 patients taking a P2Y12 inhibitor instead of aspirin after dual therapy, one cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke would be prevented.

When considering outcomes individually, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy reduced heart attacks and stroke compared with aspirin. However, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and stent thrombosis were similar between the treatments.

The researchers acknowledge that some changes in the original design of some trials were needed to create uniform data, and that certain characteristics of individual trial populations may reduce the generalisability of the findings.

But they say no significant difference in major bleeding between groups was seen, and results were consistent after further analyses accounting for factors such as age, sex, geographical region, smoking, previous heart attack or stroke, underlying conditions and medication history, suggesting they are robust.

""Overall, this study supports preferential P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy prescription over aspirin due to reductions in major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) without increasing major bleeding in the medium term,"" say researchers in a linked editorial.

However, they note that ""medium term efficacy does not necessarily extend lifelong, which is the duration we advise patients to continue these medications.""

As such, they suggest that ""a large-scale globally representative trial directly comparing different monotherapy strategies (including discontinuation) with extended follow-up would benefit our understanding of the long-term impact of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy across the treatment class for secondary prevention following PCI.""

A person aged 75 to 80 is less likely to have dementia today compared to someone of the same age several decades ago, a University of Queensland study has found.

UQ researchers analyzed data from more than 62,000 people over the age of 70 who were born from 1890 to 1948 to determine whether there were generational differences in the prevalence of dementia.

Dr. Sabrina Lenzen from UQ's Centre for the Business and Economics of Health said it was likely improvements in cardiovascular health, education, living conditions and access to healthcare had contributed to the findings.

""We often see statistics that show dementia prevalence rates are increasing – our study doesn't refute that.

As more people live longer, the total numbers of people diagnosed with dementia will grow.

What we found was a statistically significant decline in people from more recent birth cohorts having dementia.""

Dr. Sabrina Lenzen from UQ's Centre for the Business and Economics of Health

PhD student Xiaoxue Dou worked with Dr. Lenzen to analyse data from 62,437 people, including 21,069 from the US, 32,490 from Europe and 8,878 from England.

Participants were divided into 8 birth cohorts and 6 age groups.

Cohorts were grouped roughly into 5-birth-year blocks, with the earliest including people born between 1890-1913 and the most recent 1944-1948.

The 6 age groups were 71-75, 76-80, 81-85, 86-90, 91-95, and 96 and older.

""This enabled us to examine how dementia prevalence changes with age and across generations while taking into account when the surveys were conducted,"" Dr Lenzen said.

She said the results consistently showed people born more recently were less likely to have dementia, including in the US where 25.1 per cent of people aged 81-85 who were born between 1890-1913 had dementia, compared to 15.5 per cent of those born between 1939-1943.

""There has been a lot of improvement in education – particularly for women if, for example, we compare to the baby boomer generation,"" Dr. Lenzen said.

""We've seen improvements in cardiovascular health, better control of blood pressure and cholesterol – all risk factors for dementia.

""We see this strong correlation between age and dementia, but I think it's really important to understand that it's not just age driving those onsets.""

Dr. Lenzen said while the results provided some hope, there was a need for continued investment in public health campaigns.

""Some of the risk factors have been improving but we have been seeing a shift in terms of high obesity rates and things like air pollution,"" she said.

""We know those are also related to dementia, so it's not certain these trends will continue.""

The research was published in JAMA Network Open.

Researchers from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with multiple collaborators, have developed a compact diagnostic platform that can evaluate antibody protection against COVID-19 using only a single microliter of fingertip blood. Known as the Tip Optofluidic Immunoassay (TOI), the system delivers a comprehensive immune profile-measuring both antibody binding and viral inhibition-in just 40 minutes.

As new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge and individual vaccination or infection histories grow more complex, there is an urgent need for accessible tools that can assess immune protection quickly and accurately. The TOI platform addresses this challenge by combining microfluidic biosensing and chemiluminescence detection in a portable format suitable for both clinical and field use.

At the core of the platform are high-affinity polystyrene microfluidic immuno-reactors that interface directly with standard pipette tips. These reactors are paired with a portable chemiluminescent imaging station, creating a simple yet powerful workflow. This design supports the rapid and quantitative evaluation of IgG binding levels, binding kinetics, and virus inhibition capacity-all using only a small drop of fingertip blood, without the need for complex laboratory equipment or large sample volumes.

Compared with traditional assays such as ELISA or virus neutralization tests (VNTs), TOI significantly reduces testing time and operational demands. It achieves a detection sensitivity of approximately 0.1 ng/mL, spans a dynamic range of 3 to 4.5 orders of magnitude, and delivers a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10,000. These features enable accurate, high-resolution immune analysis at the point of care.

A key innovation in the methodology is the development of RIVIA 2.0, a rapid in vitro inhibition assay that emulates viral neutralization. Central to this advance is the rational protein engineering of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S-ECD) trimers, synthetically optimized with orientation-specific Avi-biotin tags to ensure consistent and functional surface presentation. These engineered protein probes, paired with human ACE2-Fc receptors, form a highly controlled binding interface that enables precise measurement of neutralizing antibody activity within just 20 minutes. By applying synthetic biology principles to optimize these probes, RIVIA 2.0 significantly improves the speed, reproducibility, and scalability of functional immune testing over conventional neutralization assays.

The system was validated with 135 samples from 113 individuals, including a subset followed over six months. The results confirmed TOI's ability to detect broad-spectrum and high-titer antibody responses, particularly among individuals with hybrid vaccine regimens. Importantly, the researchers proposed a preliminary IgG concentration threshold (~20 ng/mL) associated with reduced short-term infection risk, highlighting TOI's potential for predictive immune monitoring.

Beyond COVID-19, the platform could be adapted for other infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, or future viral threats. Its low sample requirements and portable design make it particularly valuable for decentralized testing in clinics, communities, and resource-limited settings. It also holds promise for therapeutic antibody development and vaccine efficacy studies.

This study demonstrates how TOI bridges the gap between advanced laboratory diagnostics and real-world application. By combining speed, sensitivity, and multi-dimensional immune assessment in a highly compact format, TOI sets a new benchmark for personalized and scalable infectious disease management.

The research was led by SIAT in collaboration with Peking University, Changping Laboratory, Shenzhen University, the National Innovation Center for Advanced Medical Devices, Sino Biological Inc., University of Michigan, and the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

While UK families cherish the togetherness of takeaway nights, new research uncovers surprising trends about who is most likely to indulge, challenging assumptions about income, convenience, and the real meaning of family meals.

Study: “Takeaway Night”: Understanding UK Families' Consumption of Takeaway Food for Family Mealtimes. Image Credit: Lucky Business / Shutterstock

Friday night tradition reigns supreme: Takeaways weren't just occasional; they became a ritual, with 75% of families specifically choosing Friday or Saturday dinners for their shared takeaway meals.

In a recent article published in the journal Appetite, researchers at the University of Reading, UK, investigated how families incorporate takeaway food – defined as hot food prepared away from home, collected or delivered, and eaten at home as part of a shared family meal – into shared family mealtimes. They aimed to understand the emotional and social benefits of eating together as a family that might counterbalance, though this remains unproven, the poor nutritional quality of their meals.

They found that almost all families (96%) reported at least occasional takeaway use, although most had takeout less than once a week. Parents viewed it positively as an enjoyable, convenient treat that fostered family connection. While most parents expressed positive views, some also acknowledged guilt or concern about the healthiness of takeaways. Parents from low-income households and the most deprived neighborhoods were more likely to consume takeaways frequently. However, this pattern was non-linear: high-income households showed a similar frequency to low-income ones, suggesting complex socio-economic influences.

""Break from the grind"" mentality: Parents didn't just find takeaways convenient; they described them as a vital ""break from the grind"" of daily meal planning, cooking, and cleanup, reducing stress and workload.

In today's food environment, families have widespread access to food that is not prepared at home. These options fall under the UK's broader definition of takeaway food, which typically refers to hot meals collected or delivered for consumption at home.

However, strong evidence suggests that takeaway food is nutritionally poor, being high in saturated fat, salt, and sugar. It is associated with higher calorie intake, increased body fat, and risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The growing availability and consumption of takeaway food is considered a factor in the obesity epidemic.

Despite these concerns, family mealtimes, regardless of the food served, are associated with numerous positive developmental outcomes. Research suggests that regular family meals are linked to enhanced mental health and well-being in children and adolescents, as well as decreased involvement in high-risk behaviors.

Although preparing meals can be stressful for parents, they generally value the shared experience and often prioritize health in their meal planning. In this context, takeaway food may reduce conflict and ease preparation while still promoting family togetherness.

Yet, it remains unclear whether these social benefits can counterbalance the nutritional drawbacks. This study, therefore, aimed to explore how often and why UK families consume takeaway food for family mealtimes, and under what circumstances.

Frequency Takeaway Food Consumed for Family Mealtimes (N = 189)

Joint decision-making wins: Choosing wasn't left to one person. Nearly three-quarters of families (73%) reported everyone having input on both the restaurant and what to order, making it a shared family activity.

This cross-sectional study employed an online survey to investigate how UK families utilize takeaway food for family meals, focusing on parents of children aged 18 years or younger residing in the UK.

Recruitment combined broad outreach via social media and parenting forums with focused efforts to reach underrepresented groups, such as single parents, ethnic minorities, and low-income households, through targeted platforms and community noticeboards.

Participants who accessed the survey were first presented with study information and definitions of key terms, such as ""takeaway food"" and ""family mealtime."" The survey included two main components. The questionnaire, developed by the researchers, consisted of five closed-ended and six open-ended questions assessing frequency, timing, participants, and reasons for takeaway use. It also captured decision-making processes related to ordering and consumption settings. A second questionnaire collected socio-demographic data.

Data quality was ensured through multiple checks, including attention checks, required open-ended responses, and time analysis.

Quantitative data were analyzed using binary logistic regression to explore which socio-demographic factors predicted frequent takeaway consumption. Variables for the regression model were selected through univariate analyses, and categorical variables were collapsed when needed for statistical validity.

TV dinners vs. table talk: While over half (54%) ate their takeaways at the table together, almost a third (32%) opted for TV dinners, enjoying their meals in front of the screen in the living room.

Out of 246 participants, 189 were eligible for analysis. Most were female (95%), White (86%), well-educated (78%), and lived with a partner and children (83%) in high-income households (77%). About one-third lived in more deprived areas, though the sample underrepresented ethnic minorities (14% vs 18% national average) and overrepresented degree holders (78% vs 34% nationally).

Takeaway food was consumed infrequently (less than once a week) by 74% and frequently (once a week or more) by 26%. Most frequent consumers had takeaway once a week (84%), while a few had it several times per week (16%).

Over the years, 44% reported no change in consumption frequency, 31% reported a decrease, and 25% reported an increase. Decreases were mainly due to cost or income constraints; increases were often linked to children growing old enough to eat takeaway food.

Regression analysis revealed that middle-income households were significantly less likely to frequently consume takeaway food compared to low-income households. Participants from moderately deprived areas were also less likely to consume frequently than those in the most deprived areas. Notably, high-income households showed no significant difference in frequency compared to low-income households.

Takeaway food was most commonly consumed during Friday or Saturday dinners (75%). Families usually ate together at the table, made joint decisions about orders, and mostly ordered through food apps, especially pizza.

Convenience, ease, enjoyment, and treating the family were key motivations. Downsides included high cost, unhealthiness, occasional guilt, and dissatisfaction with quality or service.

The researchers found that while takeaway consumption was common, it was usually infrequent, framed as a convenient and enjoyable family treat. Socio-demographic analysis revealed a non-linear relationship where both low- and high-income families consumed takeaway more frequently than middle-income families, indicating complex socio-economic dynamics.

The study's mixed-methods design and efforts to recruit a diverse sample strengthened its findings. However, the overrepresentation of highly educated, White mothers may have led to underestimates of takeaway frequency. The study did not assess the nutritional quality of takeaways, and the perspectives of males were limited.

Policymakers should consider the emotional and social value of takeaway meals to families and prioritize improving their nutritional quality over restricting access, including interventions addressing portion sizes, advertising standards, and reformulation. Future research should explore broader eating patterns and socioeconomic status-linked motivations, particularly how families balance convenience and enjoyment with nutritional concerns.

A team at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), led by Jorge Alegre-Cebollada, has developed an innovative method, called TEVs-TTN, for studying the specific mechanical functions of proteins through their controlled cleavage, a process that renders the proteins unable to sense and transmit mechanical force. The study results extend knowledge about the development of muscular diseases.

The study, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, demonstrates that interrupting mechanical transmission by the protein titin precipitates muscular diseases. This finding opens new routes to understanding muscular dystrophies and other diseases associated with the protein titin.

Titin, named after the titans of Greek mythology, is the largest protein in animals and plays a critical role as the structural linchpin of sarcomeres, the contractile units of muscle cells. Mutations in the titin gene (TTN) are a leading cause of congenital muscular diseases and cardiomyopathies, explains first author Dr. Roberto Silva-Rojas: ""Many of these mutations generate a prematurely truncated form of the protein, impeding its correct anchoring in the sarcomeres and disrupting muscle function.""

Through controlled cleavage of titin with TEVs-TTN, the CNIC team was able to replicate the sarcomere disorganization typical of patients with titin mutations. As Silva-Rojas explains, muscles with cleaved titin show similar defects to those observed in patients, including cell-volume reduction, nuclear internalization, mitochondrial aggregation, and interstitial fibrosis.

""In the absence of experimental animal models with titin-cleavage mutations, our approach allows a structured and targeted analysis of the impact of these types of alterations. This makes TEVs-TTN an ideal tool for testing therapies designed to mitigate the effects of impaired sarcomere integrity.""

One intriguing finding of the study is that titin cleavage caused complete disintegration of sarcomeres over the course of a few days, leaving muscle cells devoid of their basic functional unit. Nevertheless, these cells survived, suggesting that similar processes might operate in other situations, such as muscle tears, heart failure, or cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy.

The methodology developed at the CNIC marks a milestone in the study of how protein mechanics contribute to tissue and organ physiology. Just as titin is critical for force transmission in sarcomeres, other proteins, such as dystrophin, dystroglycan complexes, integrins, and lamins, play critical roles in extracellular matrix regulation and cell membrane integrity.

The new tool will enable the research team to confirm or refute hypotheses about the functioning of these proteins. These advances, in turn, could pave the way to the development of new therapeutic strategies for many diseases beyond those affecting muscle.

The study was funded mainly by the European Research Council through the ProtMechanics-Life Consolidator Grant (101002927) and a postdoctoral fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization to Dr. Silva-Rojas (EMBO ALTF 417-2022).

A new norovirus strain is sweeping the US, dethroning the long-standing leader and reshaping the landscape of gastroenteritis outbreaks. Will GII.17 remain on top, or could another variant emerge next?

Research: Increasing Predominance of Norovirus GII.17 over GII.4, United States, 2022–2025. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock

A recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases reported rising predominance of norovirus GII.17 in the United States (US). Norovirus remains the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Noroviruses are genetically stratified into 10 genogroups (GI to GX) and further into 48 genotypes and 60 P-types.

GI and GII genogroup viruses are responsible for the most outbreaks. Between 2011 and 2024, GII.4 viruses accounted for over half of outbreaks in the US in each season (September to August). In 2014, several Asian countries found that a GII.17 strain had completely replaced the GII.4 Sydney strain, and it was also detected in the US and Europe.

Nevertheless, GII.4 viruses rebounded in 2016, regaining their global predominance. The likely ancestor of the current GII.17 virus is a strain that caused an outbreak in Romania in 2021. However, during the 2023-24 season, several countries recorded increased GII.17 outbreaks and cases.

In the present study, researchers analyzed the increase in GII.17 outbreaks since 2022. First, they examined the genotype distribution of outbreaks between September 2022 and April 2025 using CaliciNet, the norovirus outbreak surveillance network of public health laboratories in the United States, which serves as a valuable early warning system for emerging strains. Genotypes were categorized into three groups: GII.4 (including GII.4 Wichita, GII.4 Sydney, and GII.4 San Francisco), GII.17, and all other genotypes.

In the 2022-23 season, GII.4 and GII.17 accounted for 48.9% and 7.5% of outbreaks, respectively. In 2023-24, GII.17 caused 34.3% of all outbreaks, while GII.4 outbreaks accounted for 27.7%. Moreover, by the 2024-25 season (data up to April 2025), GII.17 accounted for 75.4% of outbreaks so far, whereas GII.4 outbreaks accounted for 10.7%.



Increase in outbreaks of norovirus GII.17 over GII.4, United States, 2022–2025. Seasons are defined as September 1 of one year to August 31 of the next. The 2024–25 season is truncated to September 2024–April 2025. Other genotypes: GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GI.4, GI.5, GI.5, GI.6, GI.7, GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.6, GII.7, GII.8, GII.10, GII.12, GII.13, GII.14, GII.21, GII.27, and GIX.1.

Peak norovirus activity was observed in February, March, and January, in 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons, respectively. GII.17 outbreaks overtook GII.4 outbreaks in April 2024, and GII.17 accounted for more than 50% of outbreaks each month from May 2024 to March 2025. The distribution of GII.17 and GII.4 outbreaks showed no regional differences. During September-December, GII.17 accounted for 13.4%, 17.1%, and 46.3% of all outbreaks in the 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons, respectively.

The data indicate a considerable shift in the norovirus outbreak genotype distribution in the US between 2022 and 2025, with the emergence of GII.17 as the predominant genotype. This shift coincided with a decline in GII.4, which had traditionally been the leading cause of outbreaks in the US. Norovirus season usually starts in December in the US. However, during the 2024-25 season, it began in early October. During the 2023-24 season, a protracted outbreak occurred, with cases observed even in the summer, likely due to the sustained circulation of GII.17.

Meanwhile, the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons followed a more typical pattern with cases declining in the spring months. With the decline in GII.4 outbreaks, whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season remains unclear. In summary, GII.17 accounted for 75% of all outbreaks in the 2024-25 season so far, replacing GII.4 as the predominant strain in the United States.

Further genomic analyses of GII.17 and identification of neutralizing antibodies against GII.17 could help determine whether the GII.17 strain will persist. In addition, continued surveillance of norovirus is necessary to determine whether GII.17 will remain the predominant strain.

New research published in Allergy indicates that certain environmental exposures may affect a child's risk of developing atopic eczema, a condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. In other words, although some people may be genetically predisposed to eczema, certain environmental factors may increase or decrease that risk.

For the study, investigators analyzed data from 16 European studies to test for interactions between the 24 most significant eczema-associated genetic variants and 18 early-life environmental factors. They applied their findings to an additional 10 studies and used lab modelling tests to assess their results.

The first analysis (including 25,339 individuals) showed suggestive evidence for interaction between 7 environmental factors (antibiotic use, cat ownership, dog ownership, breastfeeding, elder sibling, smoking, and washing practices) and at least one established genetic variant for eczema, with 14 interactions in total.

In the additional analysis (254,532 individuals), dog exposure interacted with a particular genetic risk variant on chromosome 5, near the gene that codes for the interleukin-7 receptor, a protein involved in immune cell function. Lab modelling tests showed that this variant affects expression of interleukin-7 receptor in human skin cells and that dog exposure modifies the genetic effect of this variant on the development of eczema, essentially providing a protective effect by suppressing skin inflammation.

Additional studies are needed to explore these lab findings and the other potential interactions identified in the first analysis.

Our research aims to answer some of the most difficult questions that I am asked in clinic: 'Why does my child have eczema?' and 'What can I do to help protect my baby?' We know that genetic make-up affects a child's risk of developing eczema and previous studies have shown that owning a pet dog may be protective, but this is the first study to show how this may occur at a molecular level. More work is needed, but our findings mean we have a chance to intervene in the rise of allergic disease, to protect future generations.""

Scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milan, have found that gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in combination with AAV6 vectors can trigger inflammatory and senescence-like responses in blood stem cells, compromising their long-term ability to regenerate the blood system. The study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, outlines new strategies to overcome this hurdle, improving both the safety and efficacy of gene-editing-based therapies for inherited blood disorders.

The research was led by Dr. Raffaella Di Micco, group leader at SR-Tiget, New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Investigator and Associate Professor at the School for Advanced Studies (IUSS) of Pavia, in collaboration with Professor Luigi Naldini, Director of SR-Tiget, and several European research partners.

Homology-directed repair (HDR)-based gene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) holds great promise for the treatment of genetic blood diseases. Despite significant advances in HDR-based gene editing, translating these approaches into safe and effective clinical therapies for patients remains a major challenge. While the technology shows strong potential in laboratory settings, achieving reliable, durable outcomes in human hematopoietic stem cells - without compromising their function - has indeed proven difficult. The team of Di Micco at SR-Tiget discovered that CRISPR-Cas9 editing, especially when using AAV6 vectors to deliver the repair template, activates a strong DNA damage response (DDR) and inflammatory signals driven by p53 and IL-1/NF-κB pathways.This leads to inflammation and a senescence-like state that reduces the the regenerative capacity of the edited cells post-transplantation.

We found that a fraction of gene-edited hematopoietic stem cells shows signs of premature aging. This reduces their ability to regenerate blood cells after transplantation, which can limit the long-term success and therapeutic benefit of gene therapy.""

Dr. Raffaella Di Micco, group leader at SR-Tiget

We were surprised by the persistence of senescence-like features even months after transplantation,"" says Dr. Anastasia Conti, first author of the study and Project Leader in Dr. Di Micco's lab. ""Our findings suggest that stem cells retain a 'memory' of the genetic engineering process. These adverse effects are not just transient stress responses-they can lead to lasting impairments in stem cell function.

To counteract this adverse effect, the researchers tested two complementary strategies:transient p53 inhibition and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, particularly Anakinra - a clinically approved IL-1 receptor antagonist.

""Both approaches significantly reduced senescence markers in edited HSPCs and improved their ability to regenerate a healthy, diverse blood system in preclinical models. Importantly, Anakinra also reduced potential genotoxic events, such as large deletions and translocations, suggesting a safer profile compared to p53 inhibition alone"" says Dr. Conti.

""Our study shows that modulating the inflammatory and senescence-related response during gene editing can preserve the fitness of edited hematopoietic stem cells and enable more stable and polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution in the long-term. These findings help explain setbacks observed in recent clinical trials involving HDR-based gene editing in blood stem cells and offer a concrete path to enhance outcomes. The strategies proposed could be especially valuable for diseases requiring long-term correction and stem cell engraftment, such as immunodeficiencies or bone marrow failure syndromes"" concludes Dr. Di Micco.

This groundbreaking research was conducted in the Di Micco Lab with support from the European Research Council (ERC), the European Innovation Council (X-PAND), and the New York Stem Cell Foundation. With a longstanding history of pioneering gene therapy technologies, SR-Tiget continues to lead international efforts to optimize CRISPR-based treatments for safe clinical translation.

ASPACH, Germany – The U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team defeated Germany 2-1 in the first of two matches between the teams. Lilly Reale scored in the first half, and Evelyn Shores tallied in second-half stoppage time.

The match marked the first international game for the U.S. U-23s since Feb. 20, 2023, a span of two years, three months and 11 days, as USWNT head coach Emma Hayes looks to kickstart the U-23 program as an important part of the player pool for the full U.S. Women's National Team. For the first time in USWNT history, the U.S. U-23s started a game featuring 11 professional players.

The U.S. roster for this trip featured 15 players under 23 years of age, and, per an agreement with Germany, this is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe. Each squad had five “overage players,” none of whom were born before January 1, 1999.

The young Americans had most of the play in the match and opened the scoring off a corner kick just before halftime. Jadeyn Shaw, owner of 26 senior team caps, crossed on the ground from the left side. Chelsea FC forward Mia Fishel, who has three senior team caps of her own, dummied the ball, and it skidded through to outside back Lilly Reale, who knocked the ball off a German defender and in from close range. It was Reale's first goal at the U-23 international level. She has one goal this season for Gotham FC in the NWSL.

The USA looked to be cruising to a win, but the Germans – who featured San Diego Wave attacker Gia Corley in its starting lineup – equalized in the 86th minute as Mara Alber latched onto a cross from the right wing that flew through the U.S. goal mouth and smashed home her shot from a very tight angle on the left side of the penalty area.

With the match seemingly headed for a draw, five minutes of stoppage time were added, and the USA won it with 29 seconds left on the clock.

The USA attacked down the right wing via Portland Thorns winger Caiya Hanks, but Germany was able to poke the ball free. Seattle Reign forward Maddie Dahlien did well to dig the ball out and win it in the right side of the penalty area. She whirled toward goal, avoided a few defenders with a nice dribble and was able to poke the ball back to Seattle Reign center back Jordyn Bugg, who floated a perfect cross to the far post. Midfielder Evelyn Shores ran under the ball and struck a spectacular full volley that soared between the near post and the German goalkeeper to give the USA the win.

Shores is the only college player on the roster, along with 19 professionals. She won an NCAA title last year at North Carolina and now has netted her first goal at the U-23 international level.

Tar Heels appear to remain a part of the US national team for years to come.

With the amount of success the North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer team has had over its history, that's led to plenty of Heels also having success in the sport. The history of the US women's national soccer team is deeply intertwined with UNC, as many greats, from Mia Hamm to recent stars like Crystal Dunn, have come from Carolina. Pretty much every USWNT roster features at least Heel.

With UNC still regular contenders for the NCAA Tournament championship and current reigning champions, that's likely to stay the case in the future. On Tuesday night, we saw some of new Tar Heel faces lead the way for the USWNT.

Over the last week or so, the US national team played in some friendly matches, which included a 4-0 win over Jamaica on Tuesday night. In the roster for those matches was five former Tar Heels, most of which are very much in the newest generation of national teamers.

Apart from the 32-yeard old Dunn, the oldest of the UNC alumns in this past USWNT roster was Emily Fox at just 26. Fox has plenty of experience at the international level already, now up to 67 appearances for the USWNT since debuting in 2018. The other three Tar Heels who were in the roster for the recent friendlies were goalkeeper Claudia Dickey (25), defender Avery Patterson (22), and forward Ally Sentnor (21). Beyond them, 20-year old former Heel Savy King has also been part of US training camps in recent month, although she may not be appearing a game of any kind for a while after a very scary recent health incident.

Beyond just being part of coach Emma Hayes' recent rosters, some of the Tar Heels have also made impressive showings. Just the other night in the aforementioned game against Jamaica, Sentnor got the start for the USWNT and more than made the most of it. The 21-year old, who was the first pick of the 2024 NWSL Draft, scored goals in the 19th and 29th minutes. Fox provided the assist for the first goal, while Patterson assisted on a Lynn Biyendolo goal that was the final on in the US's 4-0 win over Jamaica.

There's no major international tournament until the next Women's World Cup in 2027, and no true tournaments of consequence until they play in the CONCACAF W Championship next November. (That tournament will decide who qualifies for said World Cup and also the next Olympic tournaments.) Rest assured that when those tournaments happen, there's a very good chance there will be Tar Heels playing crucial roles in them.

Charlotte FC are one of four MLS clubs to have two players called into the Gold Cup roster

CHARLOTTE, NC (Thursday, June 5, 2025) – Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang and defender Tim Ream made the final 26-player U.S. Men's National Team roster for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. Agyemang and Ream will be available for both international friendlies on June 7 (Turkey) and June 10 (Switzerland), alongside the Gold Cup Group Stage matches (June 15-22).

The USMNT opens Group D play on June 15 when they take on Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. (6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT). Four days later, the U.S. faces Saudi Arabia at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET/8:15 p.m. CT) and concludes the group stage against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET/6 p.m. CT).

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special place in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS NEXT Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. He's made the most of the opportunity, already collecting three goals in four matches.

Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local) and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Agyemang had a strong showing in his first national team camp and competition to kick off 2025. The East Hartford, Connecticut, native began his national team tenure with goals in back-to-back January Camp games against Venezuela and Costa Rica. He was then called back for the Concacaf Nations League Finals and scored the lone USMNT goal in the third-place match against Canada. For Charlotte this season, Agyemang has tallied eight goals and two assists across all competitions, three in MLS play and two in U.S. Open Cup competition.

Ream enters the Gold Cup as the USMNT's most capped player, having amassed a total of 68 caps, including appearances in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and helping the team take home the 2023-24 Gold Cup. The St. Louis native most recently featured with the USMNT during Concacaf Nations League Final match against Panama in March, where Ream served as captain. He has captained the last six USMNT matches he has started.

This year's edition of the Gold Cup represents the USA's final participation in an official competition ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Alongside Canada and Mexico, the three host countries for the World Cup receive automatic entries. The USMNT will seek its eighth confederation championship trophy, having won the inaugural tournament in 1991 before being crowned regional champion again in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2021.

The 18th edition of the Concacaf Gold Cup is set to take place this summer across 14 stadiums in 11 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada. The tournament will feature 16 men's national teams, including 15 from Concacaf and Saudi Arabia (guest nation). The final will be held on July 6 at NRG Stadium in Houston, marking the first time the Gold Cup Final will be played in the state of Texas.","{'href': 'https://www.charlottefootballclub.com', 'title': 'Charlotte FC'}","soccer"

HOUSTON (June 5, 2025) – Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Jack McGlynn has been confirmed as a member of the U.S. Men's National Team's (USMNT) 26-man roster for two upcoming friendlies and the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

The USMNT will host two friendlies in early June in preparation for the Gold Cup:

In Gold Cup action, the USMNT will compete in Group D of the tournament. Below is the team's group play schedule:

McGlynn returns to the national team after most recently earning a roster spot for the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League Finals, making an appearance in the Semifinals versus Panama on March 20.

The 21-year-old midfielder has earned 29 caps for the U.S. across the U-20, U-23 and senior levels. McGlynn made his first start for the senior USMNT on Jan. 18, 2025, when the midfielder recorded his debut goal and assist in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. His standout January camp under head coach Mauricio Pochettino also featured 45 minutes of action versus Costa Rica, while his senior debut came in January 2024 in a friendly versus Slovenia.

The midfielder also made his mark in Paris with the U.S. Men's Olympic Soccer Team where he featured in all four matches as they advanced to the Quarterfinals. McGlynn registered an assist in the Group A finale against Guinea.

McGlynn joined the Dynamo from the Philadelphia Union in a historic cash-for-player trade ahead of the 2025 season, as Houston sent $2.1 million in exchange for the midfielder, marking the first cash-for-player trade for a Homegrown player in MLS history.

McGlynn has made an immediate impact on the Dynamo roster this year, already scoring three goals and recording five assists across all competitions. He opened his goal tally in a 1-0 victory over LAFC on April 5, then added two more stunning goals, one in the U.S. Open Cup Round of 32 match versus Phoenix Rising FC and the other in the most recent Texas Derby against FC Dallas. Notably, McGlynn ranks third in MLS with 47 key passes and is second in the team with five assists.","{'href': 'https://www.houstondynamofc.com', 'title': 'Houston Dynamo FC'}","soccer"

Poch names his roster as Dest excused to continue “individualized” recovery.

The United States Men's National Team has now finalized who will take on Concacaf this month. Today, U.S. Soccer announced the 26-man USMNT roster who will compete in the Concacaf Gold Cup, which begins next weekend.

The training roster had been amended several times as players needed to be excused due to injury. Folarin Balogun, Patrick Schulte, Sean Zawadski, and DeJuan Jones were players originally named to the training camp roster that had to depart early due to injuries. Yesterday, goalkeeper Zack Steffen also departed camp due to injury. And with today's roster announcement, we learn that defender Sergiño Dest will not participate in the Gold Cup. He is replaced by John Tolkin.

“We are extremely excited to work with this group of players and compete for the championship,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said in a statement. “Of course our priority is to win the tournament and to show the right mentality and approach, and we are confident these players will take advantage of the opportunity.”

The USMNT 26-man Gold Cup roster:

GOALKEEPERS (3): Chris Brady (Chicago Fire), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace)

DEFENDERS (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC)

MIDFIELDERS (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven)

FORWARDS (5): Paxten Aaronson (FC Utrecht), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC),Damion Downs (FC Köln), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps), Haji Wright (Coventry City)

Our roster for the 2025 Gold Cup is here!    

The biggest news on the roster was the departure of Sergiño Dest, who had just returned to the national team after a knee injury kept him off the field for much of the last year. His return was thwarted by not being physically ready to go for the Gold Cup. “We determined the best decision is for [Dest] to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season,” Mauricio Pochettino said. His absence adds to the number of USMNT stars that will not be on the team for the Gold Cup this summer.

Another player whose status was in question was midfielder Johnny Cardoso, who according to several reports has been linked with a transfer to Atlético Madrid. Atleti is competing in the FIFA Club World Cup, which will take place at the same time as the Gold Cup. Should a move have gone through in time, Cardoso would have had to leave USMNT camp to join his new club. As it stands, his inclusion on the roster should mean that even if a transfer is finalized, he would join his new team after the Gold Cup.

The roster features four players who are in USMNT camp for the first time: defenders Alex Freeman and Quinn Sullivan, midfielder Sebastian Berhalter and forward Damion Downs. Also included are Brendan and Paxten Aaronson, the ninth set of brothers ever capped by the USMNT. They hope to become the second set of brothers to play on the field together for the USMNT.

While the roster does have some experienced players, only five have Gold Cup experience: Matt Turner, Tim Ream, Miles Robinson, Walker Zimmerman, and John Tolkin. For all of the players, it's a chance to play themselves into the conversation for the 2026 World Cup roster. And for the USMNT, the Gold Cup marks the final competition they will have before they co-host the World Cup next summer. 

The USMNT will play two friendlies - on Saturday against Türkiye and on Tuesday against Switzerland - before they enter the Gold Cup group stage. They open up group stage play on June 15th against Trinidad & Tobago, followed by matches against Saudi Arabia on June 19th and Haiti on June 22nd.

When Zack Steffen left the U.S. men's national team's pre-Gold Cup camp on Wednesday because of a knee injury, it seemed the American roster for the regional championship was set. The veteran goalkeeper's departure reduced Mauricio Pochettino's team to 26 players — the same number in the final squad U.S. Soccer was required to submit to Concacaf later in the day.

Apparently not. On Thursday morning, the USMNT announced that 24-year-old star right back Sergino Dest — a 2022 World Cup starter who has already played for elite European teams Ajax, Barcelona, AC Milan and current club PSV Eindhoven  — will also miss the tournament, which the Americans kick off next weekend against Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, California.

Dest returned to the field for PSV in March after missing almost a year with a torn ACL. He appeared in seven matches, five of them starts, and went all 90 minutes in the Eredivise finale on May 18. In a statement, Pochettino said Dest's health would be best served by sitting out the Gold Cup. He was replaced by left back John Tolkin.

""The technical, medical and high performance staff have done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season,"" Pochettino said.

Dest joins a laundry list of U.S. regulars who are out this summer. Christian Pulisic, exhausted after playing 100 competitive games for Milan over the last two seasons and with an eye on the all-important 2026 World Cup, asked for and was granted a break. Antonee Robinson just underwent knee surgery. Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna and Tim Weah are participating in the Club World Cup instead. First choice strikers Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi are hurt.

Given Dest's long absence — he hasn't played for his country since March 2024 — seeing him in action under Pochettino for the first time was supposed to be one of the few remaining silver linings this summer.

On Tuesday, U.S.keeper Matt Turner raved about the importance of having Dest back in camp.

""Serg is awesome,"" Turner said. ""He's such a fun guy, a fun teammate to play with. It's great to see him out playing again. In tranining he's looking good. His feet are as good as ever. 

""He definitely seems to have matured through this injury,"" Turner added. ""I'm just super happy to have him back and involved with the team.""

Now that reunion is on hold for at least another few months.

The final Gold Cup squad is as follows. Teams can replace an injured player up to 24 hours before their opening match.   

Goalkeepers: Matt Freese, New York City FC (MLS); Patrick Schulte, Columbus Crew (MLS); Matt Turner, Crystal Palace (England)  

Defenders:  Max Arfsten, Columbus; Alex Freeman, Orlando (MLS); Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union (MLS); Mark McKenzie, Toulouse (France); Tim Ream, Charlotte (MLS); Chris Richards, Crystal Palace; Miles Robinson, Cincinnati (MLS); John Tolkin, Holstein Kiel (Germany); Walker Zimmerman, Nashville (MLS)

Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson, Leeds (England); Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England): Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver (MLS); Johnny Cardoso, Real Betis (Spain); Luca de la Torre, San Diego (MLS); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS); Jack McGlynn, Houston Dynamo (MLS); Quinn Sullivan, Philadelphia Union (MLS); Malik Tillman, PSV 

Forwards: Paxten Aaronson, Eintracht Frankfurt (Germany); Patrick Agyemang, Charlotte (MLS); Damion Downs, Cologne (Germany); Brian White, Vancouver; Haji Wright, Coventry (England)

Jack Grealish has bit back at critics on social media and defended his recent record after being left out of Manchester City's Club World Cup squad.

The latest stub will allow the 29-year-old and his representatives to instead be focused on finding him a move away from the Etihad Stadium, as he seeks to force himself into England's World Cup plans.

Grealish started only seven times in what was a poor season for City by their own standards. While he has two years remaining on his £300,000-a-week contract, a repeat would do neither City nor the player any favours.

Following reports of the omission, accounts on social media were keen to voice their opinion on the former Aston Villa star's situation - with messages of support as well criticism directed his way. 

Interestingly, Grealish took the opportunity to put his feelings on the record amid continued speculation over his future. 

Responding to a post from talkSPORT which claimed that Villa favourite Gabby Agbonlahor is 'not happy' with Guardiola for unfairly treating Grealish, the winger wrote: 'What u want me to do score a [hat-trick] in 20 [minutes]?'

Pep Guardiola opted to leave the midfielder out of his squad for the Club World Cup this summer

Grealish took to social media to make his view on the situation public after reports revealed he is set to be left out

He also waded into a discussion between two users discussing his form for City this term. 

'Dude, Jack has been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that,' wrote one user on X. Another replied: 'Lately? Lol, been too long to be called lately. Let these people talk s***.' 

The England international chimed in with a defense of his recent displays, adding: 'Haha, I've been bad lately? Score 3 goals in my last 3 appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x'. 

Clubs in England and Europe are expected to be interested in the playmaker, although the fact that many are grappling with profit and sustainability issues may point to the likelihood of a loan deal, rather than a permanent move for a man who cost City £100m when he signed from Aston Villa for a British record fee in 2021.

After Grealish was left out of City's final Premier League fixture at Fulham, Guardiola said that officials would work with Grealish and his representatives to find a solution that suited both sides.

Players continue to be frustrated at the pace of talks, but itching to move on.

RENTON — Three days after Seattle Sounders players' pregame display prompted a heated response from team owner Adrian Hanauer, midfielder Cristian Roldan admitted the uncertainty around the split of the the Club World Cup prize pool continues to be a significant issue as the team prepares to face the Vancouver Whitecaps on Sunday.

The start of the Club World Cup is 10 days off, leaving precious little time for the sides to come to an agreement.

“With everything going on, it's a huge distraction for us,” Roldan said following Wednesday's training session. “We're playing the best team in our league. We should be focused on that. Unfortunately, we have some other things to deal with.”

That other thing is players' contention that they deserve more than the $1 million bonus guaranteed to them in the current CBA. In March, FIFA announced that each MLS team would receive $9.55 million, with an additional $1 million for each group stage tie, $2 million for each group stage win, $7.5 million more if they get out of the group stage and tens of millions more if they continue to advance.

Representatives from both the league and the MLS Players Association confirmed that the two sides have been at least discussing these concerns for months. The MLSPA insists that league negotiators have been promising a formal proposal was “imminent” for nearly as long. The league apparently felt as though they were still assessing exactly what the players wanted.

There are signs that an offer could arrive as soon as Thursday, with indications that the league understands the importance of further incentivizing the players by giving them a percentage of the performance bonuses along with the money they're already guaranteed.

As frustrated as Roldan is that it has taken this long to get here, he also indicated that the players are looking forward to moving on as soon as an agreement is reached.

“I think it's out of character for all of us to act the way we are right now,” Roldan said. “Sometimes we wear our emotions on our sleeve. We see that on the soccer field, we see that off the field as well. 

“We don't see any of this as a viewpoint to hate each other. We just want this to get resolved. This is all about trying to figure out the most fair deal for everybody. I think the league understands that this deal that's currently on the table is not fair. We need to find a middle ground and I think that's important to acknowledge.”

Jordan Morris was a full participant at training and Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer said he expects the forward to at least be available against the Whitecaps. Morris has missed the past seven games and 12 of the past 14 with a hamstring injury.

Reed Baker-Whiting (USA U20s), Osaze DeRosario (Guayana) and Stuart Hawkins (USA U19s) were all absent from training after getting called into international duty. With the Sounders looking particularly thin at centerback, they had hoped to keep Hawkins but their request was denied.

With Hawkins on international duty and Kim Kee-hee (calf) and Yeimar Gomez Andrade (hamstring) still recovering from injuries, the only two healthy and available natural centerbacks are Jackson Ragen and Jon Bell. Ragen was on a minutes restriction last week, but Schmetzer expressed some hope he'll be 90 minutes fit this week. Leo Burney, who was signed as a Homegrown Player this offseason, is a natural centerback, but was placed on a season-long loan to Tacoma Defiance and can only be called up as an “emergency hardship.” ","{'href': 'https://www.sounderatheart.com', 'title': 'Sounder at Heart'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich welcomed back Jamal Musiala as the Bundesliga champions started their preparations for this summer's Club World Cup in the United States on Thursday.

Musiala was left out of Germany's squad for the Nations League Final Four as he was recovering from injury.

The midfielder had been sidelined since the beginning of April due to a muscle injury and started training with the ball again in mid-May.

Defender Dayot Upamecano also joined the training session. He hadn't been available since March after he suffered cartilage damage.

Bayern said in a statement that the pair were able to complete large parts of the session with their team-mates.

Maurice Krattenmacher and Adam Aznou, who most recently had spells on loan at SSV Ulm 1846 and Real Valladolid respectively, were also back training with the ball for the first time since returning to Munich.

Bayern will travel to the US for the June 14-July 13 tournament on June 10, but international players will join the team later.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Fifa declined to comment on recently signed ban

Unclear whether exception includes Club World Cup

Donald Trump's newly signed travel ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with clubs participating in the 2025 Club World Cup, the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Olympics.

The US president has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term.

The nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be “fully” restricted from entering the US, according to the proclamation. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partly restricted.

There is an exemption, however, outlined in section 4 of the order, which states that “any ­athlete or member of an athletic team, ­including coaches, persons ­performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, travelling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state” are not subject to the ban.

A Fifa spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the governing body had lobbied for the exception's placement. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has gone out of his way to appear publicly with Trump in recent months, taking a seat next to the president at the first public meeting of his World Cup taskforce and arriving late to the Fifa Congress in order to meet with Trump during his tour of the Middle East.

It is also not clear whether the “World Cup” mentioned in the exemption applies to both the 2026 World Cup involving international teams and the 2025 Club World Cup, which will feature many of the world's top club teams in venues across the US this year.

Also unclear is whether the ban will force US-based players who play internationally for countries subject to the ban to return from the current Fifa international window early. Venezuela, for example, have three players on its squad who play in Major League Soccer. They are scheduled to play two World Cup qualifiers: one against Bolivia on Friday night and another against Uruguay on Tuesday. Trump's travel ban is set to come into action on Monday 9 June.

Teams that have qualified for the Club World Cup employ 10 players from countries named in the travel ban. They are: Inter Miami's Telasco Segovia (Venezuela), Botafogo's ­Jefferson Savarino (Venezuela), ­Espérance de Tunis's Roger Aholou (Togo), LAFC's David Martínez ­(Venezuela), Internazionale's Mehdi Taremi (Iran), Ulsan's Matías Lacava (Venezuela), Al-Ain's Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba (Togo), Josna Loulendo (Republic of Congo) and Mohamed Awadalla (Sudan), as well as Pachuca's Salomón Rondón (Venezuela).

Only one country on the travel ban list, Iran, has already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. Venezuela are ­seventh in South American qualifying, five points behind Colombia for an automatic World Cup place but still in the picture to qualify via an inter-confederation playoff. ­Equatorial Guinea and Libya are mathematically still alive in African qualifying but unlikely to progress to the next round. Sudan are third in their World Cup qualifying group, just one point from automatic qualification. Haiti look good to reach the next round of Concacaf World Cup qualification.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

On Wednesday night, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a travel ban against 12 countries in a move he described as “protecting the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.”

The ban goes into effect on Monday, and it entails a ban against travel into the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar (Burma), Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. This ban relates to the entry of both immigrants and non-immigrants.

Trump also imposed partial restrictions and limits on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

From a soccer perspective, the news is particularly significant because FIFA is hosting two tournaments in the United States over the next 13 months — first the FIFA Club World Cup, which will begin June 14, and then the World Cup in 2026, which will be shared with Canada and Mexico. Iran has already qualified for the tournament, while several countries facing travel bans are in contention to qualify. Additionally, Concacaf is hosting the Gold Cup this summer in the United States, with Haiti one of the competing teams. There are also players from Sudan, Venezuela and Iran due to compete in the Club World Cup.

The Athletic breaks down the instant questions that are raised by Trump's travel ban.

The good news for FIFA is that the executive order contains an exemption for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

This would appear to suggest, therefore, that Iran, whose qualification has already been assured for the World Cup in 2026, will be able to send a team and support staff to compete at the tournament. However, players will not be able to bring friends and family who are Iranian nationals beyond “immediate relatives.”

Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” adding that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.”

Among the nations with full travel bans, Haiti is currently the best-placed team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, having won its first two games in the second round of Concacaf's qualification process to sit second in its five-team group. The top two from each of the six groups of five progress into the third round — where 12 teams remain — and three nations are guaranteed access to the World Cup with an additional two Concacaf teams to enter into the intercontinental playoffs.

In Africa, Libya has an outside chance of making the World Cup, currently placed third in a group of six after six matches. The four best runners-up from the 10 African groups will enter into a playoff tournament to stand a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. Both Haiti and Libya would be in the same position as Iran, should they qualify, whereby they are permitted to attend as teams — but there does not appear to be an exception for nationals of those teams who might wish to travel to the tournament to support their country during the competition.

Among the nations with partial travel bans, Venezuela is currently placed seventh in the South America qualification table, which would enter them into an intercontinental playoff. Cuba lies third in its five-team Concacaf group, with a game in hand on second-place Bermuda after two games played. Sierra Leone is also third in group play in the CAF qualification phase to remain in with a chance of qualification.

The Gold Cup begins June 14 and ends July 6, with all matches except one due to be played in the United States.

The only competing nation impacted by the travel ban is Haiti, an opponent of the USMNT in the group stage of the competition. Saudi Arabia and Trinidad and Tobago make up the four-team group.

The exemption listed by Trump's executive order refers to athletes and teams being allowed to “travel for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

The Gold Cup is not specified and therefore it must be determined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Athletic contacted both Concacaf and the Department of State to seek clarity on the matter and to ask whether Haiti will be granted entry with the White House later confirming, following publication, that both the Club World Cup and Gold Cup are considered major sporting events, meaning it appears they will be able to play.

Trump's executive order cited overstay percentages on visas by Haitian citizens within the U.S. and claimed “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.” The order claimed that this “harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.”

While exemptions appear to have been made for athletes, teams and immediate relatives, further-reaching exemptions for supporters do not appear to be present in the executive order. Exemptions are made for nationals of designated countries who are traveling on government business, NATO business or those who are lawful permanent residents of the United States, as well as those who are dual citizens and traveling with a passport from the non-designated country. There will also be entry granted to Iranians on immigrant visas owing to ethnic or religious persecution in their home country.

These exemptions aside, however, it appears that entry will be limited for nationals from those countries who face partial and full travel bans. Venezuela and Cuba, for example, have had temporary tourist visa access forbidden. It also appears that Haitians will be forbidden from entering the U.S. to support their team at the Gold Cup this summer or if they qualify for the World Cup next summer.

The 32 teams who will be competing in FIFA's revamped club competition this summer are not from any of the countries impacted by the travel ban.

There are, however, some players who are potentially at risk of being affected. The exemption in the executive order, as explained above, states that allowances will be made for athletes and immediate relatives coming for the World Cup or “other major sporting events,” as determined by the Secretary of State. The Club World Cup is not specified in the document. The White House confirmed to The Athletic following publication that both competitions are considered major sporting events with participants therefore appearing to be exempt from the ban. A State Department spokesperson did not directly respond when asked about the tournaments' status, saying only: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.”

A quick browse of the squads offers up potential challenges. At the Abu Dhabi club Al-Ain, for example, is the Sudanese player Mohamed Awadalla, and his country has seen all visas blocked — meaning he may require an exemption — while Inter Milan Iranian forward Mehdi Taremi may also be in the same position.

The Venezuelan trio of Matías Lacava, Salomón Rondón and Jefferson Savarino — at Ulsan, Pachuca and Botafogo, respectively — may also require exemptions, even though the partial travel ban inflicted upon Venezuelan nationals does not extend to those seeking to come to the U.S. on the P-1 visa. This is used when an athlete seeks to come to the U.S. as part of a team at an internationally recognized level of performance. However, ordinarily this would only be used if they have contracts with teams in the United States. For example, MLS, NBA, MLB international players are either on a P1 or a green card. Those coming in for temporary competitions would ordinarily do so on B1 or B2 visa – a temporary visa for business or tourist purposes – both of which are now blocked for Venezuela. As such, these players will also be hoping that the Club World Cup is labelled as a major sporting event.

On Wednesday, as part of our report tracking FIFA's difficulties in filling stadiums for the Club World Cup, FIFA told The Athletic that supporters from more than 130 countries had acquired tickets for this summer's tournament. We have now approached FIFA to ask whether any nationals from countries impacted by the travel ban have acquired tickets for the tournament, as well as if any exemptions will be made to enable them to enter the country, or if these supporters can otherwise expect refunds.

Back in 2017, before the U.S. secured the World Cup a year later, FIFA President Gianni Infantino told reporters: “It's obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.”

Additionally, as part of the United States' joint bid with Canada and Mexico to host the World Cup — dated May 2, 2018 — Trump wrote to Infantino and said he was confident that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.”

The Athletic has approached the White House for comment.

Earlier this year, Infantino said: “America will welcome the world. Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun and to celebrate the game will be able to do that.”

Infantino also claimed that the two FIFA tournaments over the next year would generate almost $50 billion in economic output for the U.S. The question, however, is whether repeated news cycles about a more stringent approach to entering the U.S. may dissuade global travelers from attending both the tournament this summer and next year's World Cup, leaving FIFA more reliant on a domestic audience and host cities at risk of falling short of their economic impact, as tourists are likelier to spend more money.

Speaking about the World Cup, Vice President J.D. Vance last month said during a meeting of the White House's World Cup task force: “Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games.

“But when the time is up, we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem,” he said, referring to Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Red-hot Ole Romeny keeps Indonesia's FIFA World Cup dream very much alive","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45457855/red-hot-ole-romeny-keeps-indonesia-fifa-world-cup-dream-very-much-alive","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:56:00 GMT","

Indonesia can no longer qualify automatically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup from the ongoing third round of the Asian qualifiers.

Not after second-placed Australia established an unassailable buffer between them earlier in the evening with a stirring 1-0 win over Group C winners Japan.

Nonetheless, Indonesia's lofty dream of qualifying for the World Cup -- for the first time since 1938 when they were still known as the Dutch East Indies -- remains very much alive after a 1-0 victory over China on Thursday.

Continuing his red-hot form on the international stage, Ole Romeny converted from the penalty spot in the 45th minute -- his third goal in as many caps -- to secure a crucial three points for his side.

The result lifted the Indonesians to third on the table although Saudi Arabia can regain that spot in their game against Bahrain later in the evening.

Indonesia actually want that.

Because having now established a six-point lead over fifth-placed Bahrain, a Saudi Arabia victory -- or even a draw - would secure for Indonesia a top-four finish, along with progress to the next round of qualifiers.

The fourth round would then see them drawn alongside two other nations, where the group winners also secure tickets to the World Cup while the runners-up advance to yet another stage which eventually leads to an interconfederation playoff.

That will be something to worry about in October for the teams that do get there.

For now, there is still one more match day in the third round next Tuesday -- and there are not too many better positions that Indonesia could wish to be in.

Considering the uproar in some quarters that greeted a shock parting of ways with former coach Shin Tae-Yong in January, the fact that Indonesia have since notched two wins in three outings under his successor Patrick Kluivert has gone some way in vindicating the huge call made by PSSI, the country's football governing body.

Kluivert's first game at the helm coincided with the international bow of Dutch-born Romeny, who qualifies to represent the Southeast Asian national through his maternal grandmother.

It was a night to forget as the Indonesians were comprehensively beaten 5-1 by Australia, but Romeny did provide the Timnas faithful something to smile about with a debut goal.

Despite their remarkable rise over the past couple of years, if there was an area of Indonesia that was particularly glaring, it was probably the lack of a formidable threat leading the line.

For all his admirable endeavour, Rafael Struick only has one goal in 26 caps while others such as Ramadhan Sananta and Hokky Caraka remain prospects for the future.

Even goal threats like Marselino Ferdinan, Ragnar Oratmangoen or Egy Maulana deal the most damage from withdrawn or wider positions.

Three games do not warrant a definitive verdict but the signs suggest that Romeny could be the answer.

Having netted the only goal of the game to seal victory over Bahrain back in March, which crucially got Indonesia's campaign back on track, Romeny repeated the trick against China to now bring his team to the precipice of progress to the next round of qualifiers.

He clearly has an eye for goal but it is not his only strength.

Again, against the Chinese, Romeny was ever-mobile and constantly looked to move out wide or drop deep to provide a link-up option, displaying a savviness in finding pockets of space.

The 24-year-old was also unafraid to pull the trigger whenever a half-chance presented itself, and might even have added to his tally on another night.

He was far from Indonesia's only hero on Thursday.

Captain Jay Idzes was once again an authoritative figure in the heart of defence, aided resolutely by Calvin Verdonk and Rizky Ridho.

Ricky Kambuaya and Yakob Sayuri, part of a surprisingly-noticeable Indonesian born-and-bred presence in the starting XI given the ever-increasing number of naturalised heritage imports in the ranks, were industrious both when defending and attacking.

Making his long-awaited debut having flirted with the idea of switching his allegiance to Indonesia for several years now, Emil Audero overcame a few early nerves to be a reliable presence in goal -- suggesting there could be an intriguing duel once the incumbent Maarten Paes returns from suspension.

Even Egy, who was once the next great hope for Indonesian football but has not managed to reach his full potential, produced a lively showing.

Romeny may be the new darling grabbing the headlines for now, but he is far from the only one making a valuable contribution to the cause.

Indonesia are certainly going to need as many if, or rather when, they get to the next stage of their World Cup dream.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with most matches—including the final—taking place in American stadiums.

However, hopes among Iranian fans in particular to attend and support their national team on U.S. soil are now in doubt following President Donald Trump's announcement of a new travel ban targeting 12 countries, including Iran.

Newsweek has reached out the White House, FIFA and Iran's foreign ministry for comment.

The travel ban deepens already strained U.S.-Iran relations. With nuclear talks stalled and President Trump ramping up his ""maximum pressure"" campaign, the policy reflects rising tensions that now spill into global sports.

Events like the World Cup offer rare chances for connection across hostile borders. By barring Iranian fans, the ban closes one of the few remaining windows for people-to-people engagement, reinforcing a broader climate of isolation.

Iran is the only nation on the travel ban list that has already secured a place in the 2026 World Cup. While Iranian players will be permitted to compete, their supporters will be barred from entering the U.S. For many fans from Iran, this tournament could be a rare chance to watch their team play on American soil—an opportunity made even more meaningful by decades of political estrangement.

Other banned nations, including Venezuela, Sudan, Equatorial Guinea, Libya and Haiti, remain in contention for qualification. Venezuela currently sits five points off automatic qualification but could secure a place through a playoff. Sudan is just one point behind the leader in its qualifying group.

FIFA has yet to comment on the ban, but scrutiny is mounting. In 2017, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: ""It's obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup."" With fans from a qualified country now excluded, critics are urging FIFA to defend its own standards.

The backlash online was swift. @stephenpglenn wrote: ""So Trump's travel ban list includes Iran who have qualified for the World Cup... @FIFAWorldCup and @iocmedia must really start looking at the suitability of USA to host the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics."" Another user asked, ""How is it even possible to have a World Cup in a country that won't allow foreign fans?""

Reddit users voiced similar frustration, with one commenter speculating that FIFA will ""rig the group stage draw so that Iran, Venezuela etc play their matches in Mexico or Canada."" The growing sentiment online reflects mounting pressure on FIFA to respond—and soon.

Yesterday, Trump officially announced that fans from Iran will NOT be allowed to come and support their country at the World Cup.How is it even possible to have a World Cup in a country that won't allow foreign fans @FIFAWorldCup @FIFAcom @fifamedia ?#worldcup #football pic.twitter.com/bTGVGc4Hpj

U.S. President Donald Trump: ""The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country, by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don't want them.""

FIFA President Gianni Infantino: ""Any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.""

James Montague, soccer writer and author of Engulfed: How Saudi Arabia Bought Sport, and the World told Newsweek: ""I suspect there will be some carve out for fans since infantino has a very close relationship with Trump. But the issue of fans from certain countries being prevented from going may be a moot point. If there's a chance fans might be denied entry, arrested and deported for social media posts that criticized Trump, or Israel, I suspect a lot people will be scared away and stay at home, whatever Infantio and Trump promise.""

Trump's ban underscores how geopolitical tensions can undermine the global spirit of sports, affecting not just Iran but other nations still vying for World Cup spots. While athletes may compete, many fans face restrictions that challenge FIFA's promise of full participation and raise concerns about hosting major events in countries with strict travel policies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","The FIFA World Cup is heading to Trump's U.S. Will the world want to come — or even be able to?","https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/world-cup-trump-1.7549793","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:24:31 GMT","

You could argue the United States isn't exactly the most welcoming country for visitors at the moment.

There's been a surge of border crackdowns, new visa restrictions and an overall sense of fear over being detained amid multiple reports of foreigners being locked up for weeks in the five months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.

Yet, one of the biggest, most highly anticipated and attended sports events is coming to the U.S. next year: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, soccer's premier international competition.

The U.S. will co-host next year's World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Of the 16 host cities, 11 are on American soil. It's been estimated that, across the three countries, 6.5 million people will attend the tournament. 

FIFA president Gianni Infantino, an ally of Trump, has promised that international fans will be welcome at the World Cup. But Trump's immigration stance has raised questions about potential challenges for the numerous international fans expected to travel to the U.S.

Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have raised ""grave concerns"" about the matches being held in the U.S. And at the same time that excitement has started to build for the tournament — and Toronto and Vancouver have started preparing for a deluge of soccer fans — there have been calls to boycott the U.S. as a host.

The current political climate in the U.S., if it continues, could be a considerable deterrent, especially for fans from countries that are at odds with America, according to Vijay Setlur, an expert in sport marketing and sport business in the Schulich School of Business at York University.

""I could see fans potentially staying away out of a fear of being detained. Even though they're there to watch soccer, they could be accused of espionage or something like that,"" Setlur told CBC News.

""It could be a big problem.""

Iran for instance, was one of the first teams to qualify for the World Cup, but the two countries are engaged in a decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday night, Trump signed an order that would ban people from a dozen countries, including Iran, from entering the United States. It's set to go into effect on Monday.

The ban makes exceptions for athletes, coaches and immediate relatives travelling for the World Cup, but doesn't mention fans.

Given that the U.S. also is preparing to welcome the world for FIFA's Club World Cup later this month, golf's Ryder Cup in September and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the question becomes: will the world want to come, or will they even be able to?

Last month, Human Rights Watch wrote an open letter to FIFA's president, citing ""grave concerns"" about the impacts of the U.S.'s immigration policies on the 2026 World Cup.

""Immediate action is needed to address policies that directly contradict FIFA's stated values of human rights, inclusion and global participation,"" the advocacy group wrote in the May 5 letter.

""The 2026 World Cup was intended to raise the bar ... these commitments are now at serious risk.""

‘That place breaks you': Canadian woman describes 11 days in ICE custody

The U.S. policies cited by the advocacy group include: reported travel restrictions and bans; visa practices that require applicants to disclose their sex assigned at birth and only recognize binary sex categories; the detainment of international students; the deportation of third-country nationals; and the blocking of refugees.

Amnesty International, an international human rights NGO, has also voiced concerns for the players and fans travelling to the U.S. 

In a statement to CBC News, Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International's head of business and human rights, cited Trump's mass deportation program and ""arbitrary arrests and detentions."" He also noted that routine border crosses ""have turned into harassment,"" especially for 2SLGBTQ+ people, religious minorities and people of colour.

""It's hard to know who the Trump administration will target next,"" Cockburn said.

""With no sign of the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants and crackdown on freedom of expression slowing down, travellers may unfortunately find their human rights under threat while in the U.S.""

Human Rights Watch also noted that when FIFA awarded the bid to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the decision was celebrated as one that would unite positive change. At the time, in 2018, rifts created by tariffs and a proposed border wall were glossed over because of the neighbours' longstanding political and economic alliances.

""The unity of the three nations"" was the overriding theme articulated by Carlos Cordeiro, then-president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. 

And it was a smart decision at the time, said Setlur, not only for FIFA to grow its revenue, but because it was also an opportunity to elevate the sport of soccer in North America's very crowded sports market. 

And now, with Trump inciting trade wars with the U.S.'s neighbours and around the globe, combined with his aggressive immigration enforcement campaign?

""At this point, would FIFA from a logistical standpoint wish this World Cup was in Europe? Probably,"" Setlur said.

""But at this point they can't change it and they just have to hope they can lobby the U.S. government enough.""

Canada wins bid to co-host FIFA World Cup in 2026

Regardless of where it's held, the month-long World Cup is often considered the biggest sporting event in terms of its magnitude and global appeal. FIFA says 1.5 billion people tuned into the 2022 final match between Argentina and France live on television (the 2025 Super Bowl, by comparison, netted about 127. 7 million viewers).

Alan Rothenberg, who ran the 1994 World Cup and oversaw the bid to host the 1999 Women's World Cup as then-president of U.S. Soccer, previously told The Associated Press that he thinks fans will still come to the FIFA World Cup.

Pointing to concerns about the last two World Cups, in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, he noted those tournaments still attracted more than three million attendees apiece.

""A lot of this is government-to-government,"" Rothenberg said. ""A passionate soccer fan is not going to be held up by that.""

And as travel groups have raised concerns that wait times mean fans from some of the 48 nations set to compete will not be able to secure a U.S. visa before the FIFA tournament, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the administration is considering putting consular officers on double shifts and employing artificial intelligence to help manage the processing.

Meanwhile, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has warned that visitors must ""go home"" after attending matches.

""Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem,"" he said with a laugh as Trump smiled beside him, referring to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, while speaking to media during the first World Cup task force meeting in early May.

Setlur says he agrees die-hard fans will likely still come to the tournament despite the risks. But between the political deterrents and the economic cost of attending the match — not just ticket prices, but flying to North America and between the multiple host cities — he says he wonders if FIFA will be able to fill the stadium seats.

""In the U.S., soccer is growing, but it's not the No. 1 sport ... they're going to have to rely quite a bit on visitors.""

Brazil hope brighter times are ahead now Carlo Ancelotti has taken over as national team manager, with the former Real Madrid boss overseeing his first fixture on Thursday. 

The 65-year-old's first international match as a coach comes in a trip to Ecuador as Brazil continue their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. While they are all but certain to reach next summer's tournament, they will want to confirm their place as swiftly as possible. 

Victory against second-placed overachievers Ecuador would come in handy, even if it will be far from straightforward. Injuries have somewhat limited Ancelotti's options for his debut but he still boasts an array of superstars for the trip to Guayaquil. 

Here's how Brazil could line up. 

GK: Alisson—Fresh from lifting the Premier League title, Ancelotti will hope Alisson has finished partying. The Liverpool star is undisputed number one in June given Manchester City's Ederson hasn't been selected. 

RB: Vanderson—Vanderson enjoyed another impressive season with Monaco and he should earn his fifth international cap against Ecuador. The right back is now a regular in the Brazil squad after a swift ascent to the top. 

CB: Marquinhos—Much like Alisson, the Paris Saint-Germain skipper might still be in celebration mode after guiding the French giants to the Champions League last weekend. 

CB: Danilo—The former Real Madrid, Man City and Juventus defender is now plying his trade with Flamengo and will get little rest over the summer period given his club are one of 32 teams competing at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. 

LB: Carlos Augusto—Augusto was on the losing side in the recent Champions League final and Inter would have arguably done better with the Brazilian starting ahead of Federico Dimarco in the showpiece event. 

DM: Bruno Guimarães—The Newcastle United midfielder will be playing Champions League football next season after a dramatic final day in the Premier League. He will be hoping for a less stressful outing on Thursday. 

DM: Gerson—Another Flamengo representative in the Brazil squad, the midfielder has featured regularly for Brazil over recent international breaks. He faces competition from the returning Casemiro for a starting berth in Ecuador, though. 

RW: Raphinha—Ancelotti will hope that Raphinha's devastating Barcelona form, which brought him so much misery in 2024–25, makes its way to the national team. The winger has scored in each of the last three international breaks. 

AM: Matheus Cunha—Manchester United eyes will be fixed firmly on Brazil's clash with Ecuador as they aim to get their first glimpse of Cunha since his £62.5 million ($84.1 million) move to Old Trafford was announced. 

LW: Vinícius Júnior—It's hard to believe that Vinícius has only scored six times in Brazil colors. Ancelotti has urged the fleet-footed winger to find his Real Madrid form for the Seleção.

ST: Richarlison—Richarlison has been recalled by Ancelotti and could well slot straight into the starting lineup given Brazil's lack of world-class options in the No. 9 position.

Topic:Socceroos

Aziz Behich celebrates the match-winning goal for the Socceroos against Japan. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)

A stunning smash-and-grab 1-0 victory over Japan has put the Socceroos on the brink of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after Aziz Behich's stoppage-time winner.

Having been dominated by Japan for the full 90 minutes, a moment of magic from Riley McGree and a phenomenal finish by Behich earned the Socceroos a stunning backs-against-the-wall victory.

McGree turned on the edge of the area before racing to the by-line, cutting back towards Behich to finish with his right foot and score his first Socceroos goal in 13 years and earn Australia's first win over Japan in 16.

""It hasn't quite sunk in just yet,"" Behich said.

""But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling.

""It was a tough game. We knew we had to grind it out. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we will get our opportunity if we get to it.'

""Fortunately enough it fell to me and my right foot.

""It has been a long campaign and we have worked so hard … the group we have in this change room and the boys that come in every camp, the mentality is second to none.

For so long it seemed the very best the Socceroos could be able to hope for was to escape from Perth with a draw after a turgid display.

Japan were utterly dominant, displaying an ease of possession that made a mockery of their second-string personnel and had their hosts chasing shadows throughout.

Yet for all their possession, 69 per cent of it at full time, there was very little in the way of clear cut chances created — and the Socceroos made them pay for that profligacy.

Daniel Arzani, a 80th-minute substitute, created the spark to help the Socceroos advance down field and, tellingly, keep possession there without the swarming Japanese defence clearing their lines.

ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

He fashioned a ball towards McGree, whose stunning turn prised open the firmly locked Japanese defence.

His cut back missed the first wave of Socceroos strikers, but Behich was alert to the lose ball and curled a delightful effort past Kōsei Tani into the far corner.

Credit must be given to Tony Popovic for his changes, all of whom made an impact after a dire first half showing.

The Socceroos were more lively in the second half but still second best, right up until Behich's stunner.

Given the Socceroos far superior goal difference, only a catastrophic defeat against Saudi Arabia — who must also beat Bahrain later on Friday morning — in Jeddah on Wednesday morning (AEST) will deny Tony Popovic's side a spot in North America.

Look back on how all the action unfolded in our live blog.

By Simon Smale

Don't forget to join us on Wednesday morning over your breakfast cereal for the still important but nowhere near as important as before clash against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning, we'll be blogging that one too for you from 4:15am AEST.

But for now, let's leave you with the image of happy Socceroos - because is there anything better?

Good night, and thanks for being with me.

By Simon Smale

Here's Tony Popovic.

""Look, we stayed in the game,"" he says.

""It was a great goal at the end, we're getting our left wing 
back coming in, 90th minute to finish off a chance.

""It just shows the belief that the group has. And I believe there's more to come from them.""

Popovic says that Australia seemed second to the ball in the first half and paid credit to his subs.

""Nothing against the boys that came off, we just seemed second to the ball,"" he says.

""We didn't win our challenges and the duels. We 
tried to get more strength in there. Bit more spark and energy.

""Then Daniel came on. All the players that came on made an impact. So we're very happy with the win.""

He says Australia still want to finish with a win.

""Beating Japan, doing it at home and the last minute, you couldn't have scripted it any better,"" he says.

""We still have got a game to go. The emotions are high. 
We're very proud at the moment. And everyone in here and I'm sure every Australian that has seen this game is a proud Australian tonight. We don't want to deny anyone of that joy.

""We still have a job to do in Saudi Arabia and we want to finish well.""

By Simon Smale

Here's Alessandro Circati, who grew up in Perth and is letting the tears flow, playing his first match for the Socceroos since an ACL injury.

""I don't have many words. I'm just very happy. It is a bit emotional as well,"" he says.

""Obviously growing up here for so long, after an injury that I had, 
coming back here and playing and, we are not exactly qualified but ... It is like a dream come true. Just so, so happy. I couldn't be any happier.""

He says he's emotional because the impact of the injury.

""It's been probably seven very hard months, when vu an injury like this. It's a bit of an unknown. You don't know how you return back. Some 
people feel amazing. Luckily I do. I feel better than before. Some people come back, you know, not the same. As I said, I'm just so happy.""

By Simon Smale

Here's the man of the hour, Aziz Behich.

""It  hasn't quite sunk in just yet,"" he says.

""But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling.

""It was a  tough game. We knew we had to grind it out. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we  will get our opportunity if we get to it.'

""Fortunately enough it fell to me and my right foot, in the  A-League and managed to see the back of the net again.

""It has been a long  campaign and we have worked so hard over this campaign. We've had a  change of coach, never easy, the  group we have in this changeroom and the boys that come in every camp,  the mentality is second to none.

""I think we more than deserve of going to a World Cup again.""

Behich says that the rope a dope tactic was definitely not planned, but the result is all important.

""We wanted to take the game to them. Japan is a quality side, that's for sure.  Obviously we've had better games,  but that's football,""  he says.

""They always say the ones where you have to grind and fight with your teammates, scrap,  and then you get the win in the end, those are the ones you remember.

"" Look, we will enjoy this night. What a beautiful crowd. 60,000 here on  home soil and we get to win against an opponent we haven't beaten in a while.""

By Simon Smale

Riley McGree is speaking on Channel 10.

""I  honestly thought the cutback was too far back and no-one was going to get on it,"" he says.

""No-one was defending on  the other end, but he ended up  getting on it and I look up and it hits the net. Unbelievable.""

He says that he's getting goosebumps getting asked about the goal, even though it was only scored 10 minutes ago.

He also says that the Socceroos deserved to win...

""Japan is a quality side and at stages we had to weather the storm and with  the quality we have, it will only  take one opportunity and we were  fortunate to get that opportunity  and the way we took it, we deserved to win.""

I'm not sure I'd go that far, Riley, but the Socceroos took the one clear opportunity that they had and that was the difference and the only difference that mattered.

Unbelievable.....Aziz Behich!!!! In she goes!!!!!

- stumcin

Thanks Simon - from where I'm sitting it sounds like we've won....

- Mike

Holy cow! I didn't expect that. We finally beat Japan!! Thank you, Behich!!!!!!

- M

We will take that AZIZ!

- Chris

I'm crying!

By Simon Smale

Cos we got plenty.

By Simon Smale

Unbelievable. Japan sharper all night, created so many chances, dominated possession. To their credit, Socceroos were combative to the end. Substitutes Geria, Arzani, McGree combining for the goal. And what a finish Aziz Behich 

- j

Popovic got his subs right, that's for sure.

By Simon Smale

Now, even if Saudi Arabia wins against Bahrain in the early hours of the morning, they will need to mount a monumental assault on their goal difference to have any chance of pipping the Socceroos to second spot on the ladder.

It means the match in Jeddah is important, but only a monumental catastrophe there would mean Saudi Arabia could overhaul them.

By Simon Smale

Absolutely stunning!

The Socceroos have one foot and four toes in the FIFA World Cup finals after the latest of smash and grab wins against Japan in Perth!

Aziz Behich told 10 Sport before the match that he'd had a good five days after winning the A-League grand final with Melbourne City - how about now?!

Japan absolutely battered Australia in that match but lacked the end product and it cost them dear.

It's their first World Cup qualifier defeat in their last 20 matches and could yet see Australia make the finals.

By Simon Smale

What just happened!!!!! How good

ASTONISHING!

AZIZ BEHICH SCORES WHAT MUST BE THE WINNER!

A rare lapse from Japan's defence, a rare passage of more than five passes without an error by the Socceroos and it nets them the winner that could send them to the World Cup!

Riley McGree performed a lovely turn on the edge of the penalty area, cuts the ball back and then Behich was there to pounce on the loose ball and curl the ball home.

Astonishing.

It's his first Socceroos goal in 13 years, and could give the Socceroos their first win over Japan in 16 years, to get Australia to the World Cup next year.

The Socceroos just can't get hold of the ball at the moment, the Samurai Blue are shifting from left to right to left and back again with such ease it looks like the Socceroos are florescently-clad training models.

It's just so easy for them.

By Simon Smale

Hopefully we can hold on for a draw and a point but frankly a win would be a travesty.

In Japan earlier in the qualification tournament Australia managed a 1-1 draw without having a shot on goal, so there's always hope...

By Simon Smale

Lovely move down the left side by Japan, Yuito Suzuki on the end of the cut-back cross but his first-time effort flies well over the bar.

Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti have been at the forefront of an Italian tennis boom, and it's showing no signs of slowing down at Roland Garros.

Their simultaneous presence in the semi-finals at the clay-court major this week marks just the second time in history that two Italians have reached the last four of the same Grand Slam tournament, 65 years after Nicola Pietrangeli and Orlando Sirola made deep runs in Paris in 1960.

Yet the 2025 edition of this event feels like more than a coincidence: It appears to be a new standard.

Sinner, who is completing his 52nd consecutive week as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is chasing his third consecutive major title. He is riding a 19-match Grand Slam winning streak — the ninth longest in the Open Era — heading into the semi-finals in Paris.

Right behind him, Musetti's surge has added depth and flair to Italy's rise. Known for his one-handed backhand and natural ability, Musetti was a standout junior, reaching World No. 1 in 2019.
After an impressive clay-court swing this year, during which he became the first Italian player to reach the semi-finals at all three ATP Masters 1000 events on the surface, he has risen to a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.
“We support each other very well,” Sinner said of his relationship with Musetti. ""We know each other obviously much better now because of playing the Davis Cup together, and we have a good relationship off the court.
“I just wish him only the best to stay healthy, to be relaxed. He has found good stability off court, and you can see that on court. He's an amazing player, [a] Top-5 player now. [I'm] very happy for him, and he's reaching for more, so it's good.”
Fabio Fognini ended the 40-year wait for an Italian to rise inside the Top 10 in 2019, and Matteo Berrettini joined in 2022. Prior to that, only Adriano Panatta and Corrado Barazzutti had reached such heights since the inception of the PIF ATP Rankings in 1973.
Panatta had held the mark as top Italian ever by reaching No. 4. Now, not only has Sinner held World No. 1 for a year, but Musetti is threatening to crack the Top 4 himself at the same time. But first, they have unfinished business at Roland Garros.
“I guess it's a process of growing, but only inside the court but especially off the court,” said Musetti, who could climb as high as No. 4 this week. “Last year I became a father, and I think that gave me an extra responsibility. I think now I approach things in a more professional way, not just on the court, but in my daily routine: When I practise and in my free time.”

Despite both being 23 years of age, Sinner and Musetti have experienced contrasting routes to the top of the game.
During his childhood, Sinner was a talented skier, but later shifted his attention to tennis. He chose to focus on professional tournaments and therefore did not reach the Top 100 in the junior rankings, as Musetti did. Yet Sinner has quickly emerged as one of the Tour's most methodical and fearless competitors since immersing himself in the sport.
Now, Sinner and Musetti represent more than individual success: They symbolise a cultural shift. Italian tennis is no longer hoping for the occasional breakthrough, it is demanding excellence.
The depth in strength of Italian tennis players stretches much further than Sinner and Musetti. Jasmine Paolini, the Hologic WTA Tour No. 4, leads the nation on the women's side, while Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori have cemented themselves as a top doubles team. They have won three tour-level titles this year and reached the Australian Open final in 2024-25 as well as the championship match at last year's Roland Garros.

 With Roland Garros now down to the semi-final stage, one of the highlights of the 2025 edition of the Grand Slam major remains the emotional tribute to record 14-time men's singles champion Rafael Nadal, who retired last November. During his return visit to the Grand Slam event where he dominated for so long, Nadal offered some reflections on his stellar career. 

 The holder of 22 Grand Slam titles and 14-time winner of the Coupe de Mousquetaires at Roland Garros made many mistakes during his career. However, he always came through his errors with the help of a word that was never far from his lips during over two decades among the elite: ‘learning'. 

 “Of course I did things wrong. Of course I made mistakes. Of course I would change some things I've done in my life, there's no doubt,” said the Spaniard. “I'm not the kind of person who says, ‘No, I wouldn't change a thing'. I've never been that arrogant and I frequently made mistakes, but since I can't change them, I try to learn from my errors.”

 Nadal only has to look back to his last appearance in Rome, in 2024, to find something he would change if he could. It happened after bowing out to Hubert Hurkacz in his opener in the Foro Italico. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, the Spaniard is in no doubt that he would do things differently given the chance. 
 “Last year in Rome thousands and thousands of people were waiting on the bridge after I lost my match. They were hoping to give me a send-off and I wasn't ready,” admitted the Mallorcan. “So if you were to ask me what I'd change... Of course I would have stayed 15 minutes to say thank you and talk to them, if I'd known at the time. 
 “It was an uncomfortable situation for me because I still wasn't sure if I wanted to retire. Those are the times you make mistakes. So yes, I made a mistake then and I should have stayed longer. It was what I was feeling at that time and I didn't want feelings of retirement to invade my thoughts in any way. Because that would rob me of a genuine chance to keep fighting to recover. It's just one example. There are many other things I've done wrong and mistakes I've made, but I try to learn from them.” 

A legacy that will last forever, Merci Rafa ❤️@rolandgarros @RafaelNadal #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/UPYUzF2M4D
— ATP Tour (@atptour) May 25, 2025

 Nadal has always learned from his mistakes, both on and off the court, but did he also learn from the defeats? Perhaps surprisingly, he did not, for the Mallorcan it was quite the opposite. 
 “I learned a lot more from wins than from defeats. I always said that, because I was critical enough of myself for my wins to help me find things I needed to improve,” reasoned Nadal. “I didn't need to lose to understand what I had to improve. Defeats are a blow, a disappointment and they put you in your place, but I'll never need that in order to keep improving. 
 “Even so, what I did get from defeats, in my case, was putting everything I was achieving into perspective. Therefore, defeats also ensure you value wins much more and in a more special way.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Preview: Alcaraz peaking for Musetti matchup in Roland Garros SFs","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-musetti-roland-garros-2025-sf-preview","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 03:49:36 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti have already met twice this season on the ATP Masters 1000 stage, with the Spaniard victorious in the Monte-Carlo final and the Rome semis. The Spaniard now seeks his sixth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head win against Musetti in the Roland Garros semi-finals.

The defending champion at the clay-court major, Alcaraz enters Friday's match in peak form. After battling through a trio of four-setters in Paris, Alcaraz played his best match of the fortnight in the quarter-finals to dismiss Tommy Paul with the loss of just five games. The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has not enjoyed such a dominant victory at Roland Garros since the opening round of his 2024 title run.

""I could close my eyes and everything went in,"" said Alcaraz, who did not face a break point behind an 89 per cent win rate on first serve, according to Infosys Stats. ""My feeling today was unbelievable. I was trying to hit every shot at 100 per cent, not thinking about anything else, but just hitting. Today was one of those matches when everything just went in.""

That such a performance came against Paul, who is set for a new career high after moving up to No. 8 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, adds an air of invincibility for the Spaniard. But Musetti began Roland Garros at a career-high PIF ATP Ranking of No. 7 and is up to No. 6 in the Live Rankings. He would move to No. 4 with a semi-final victory.

The Italian has not beaten Alcaraz since their first meeting in 2022, a three-set thriller in the Hamburg final. Beginning with their ensuing meeting, at Roland Garros in 2023, Alcaraz has dropped just one set in six wins.

This April in Monte-Carlo, Musetti rose to the occasion in his first ATP Masters 1000 final to claim a 6-3 opening set against Alcaraz. But he won just one game after that, hampered by a right-leg injury. One month later in the Rome semi-finals, Alcaraz played a pragmatic match in windy conditions to knock out the home favourite, showing composure and grit to earn a 6-3, 7-6(4) victory. He went on to win the title by beating Jannik Sinner in the trophy round.

Watch Alcaraz-Musetti Rome highlights:

An Alcaraz-Sinner rematch could await in the Roland Garros final, but Musetti will have his shot to dethrone the champ first. Any upset bid will start with protecting his serve, a shot Musetti has improved this season after some offseason tweaking.

""We shortened a bit the motion to have more control, and then I got more confidence in what I was having as a motion,"" he said, noting previous struggles with consistency and his toss. ""Right now I think in really many difficult situations, I make an ace or have my serve as a weapon, and it was a pretty big change also for my game.""



Musetti's overall game earned praise from Alexander Zverev this week, with the German commenting on the ""very stable"" tennis he has found during the clay-court season. Can the Italian build on that solid foundation and take his game to new heights?

Less than two months after he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final, he is one victory away from his first Grand Slam title match. But Alcaraz, one year younger at 22, is already a seven-time Masters 1000 champ and four-time major titlist.

The 23-year-old Musetti has earned his place among the game's elite with his breakthrough season. Now he has a chance to prove he can beat the very best on the biggest stage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Preview: Sinner & Djokovic chase history in Roland Garros blockbuster","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/sinner-djokovic-roland-garros-2025-sf-preview","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:39:39 GMT","

With history on the line for both, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic will reignite their evenly poised Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry on Friday at Roland Garros, where they will battle for a spot in the championship match.

The runaway No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is riding a 19-match Grand Slam winning streak and chasing his third consecutive major title. The 23-year-old has quickly established himself as a dominant force on the ATP Tour, and his recent mastery over Djokovic adds fuel to the fire.

While their Lexus ATP Head2Head series is level at 4-4, Sinner has won the past three meetings, including last year's Shanghai final. But the Italian knows better than to rest on his laurels against Djokovic, who will compete in a record-extending 51st Grand Slam semi-final.

“He has shown in the last period that he is back to the level,” Sinner said of Djokovic. “He plays very, very well, so it's going to be quite tactical, but very, very difficult. He's such an experienced player, 24 Grand Slam [titles]. I think that says everything.”

Fresh from claiming his 100th tour-level title in Geneva, Djokovic has his sights set on another milestone at Roland Garros: a record 25th major title. The Serbian is unbeaten at the venue since 2022, having captured his third crown here in 2023 before an inspired run at last year's Paris Olympics, where he won the gold medal that eluded him for so long.
Even in the latter stages of his career, the 38-year-old continues to strive for excellence, which adds an extra layer of intrigue to his clash with the top-seeded Sinner. Djokovic has, throughout the fortnight, reiterated his enduring passion for rewriting tennis history.
“History in this sport has given me everything in my life, it means a lot to me,” Djokovic said after his first-round win against Mackenzie McDonald. “I always try to make history where I can… In all the tournaments I play, all the practises, all the matches, and especially during the biggest tournaments in the world.
“There is an opportunity to make more history, and that is one of the biggest motivations I have for competitions, for continuing to work and better myself.”


To reach a 38th Grand Slam final, Djokovic will need to back up his authoritative four-set quarter-final win over last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. He could also possibly run a gauntlet of Top-3 opponents en route to the title with Sinner up next and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who faces Lorenzo Musetti, looming in the final.
Sinner, meanwhile, has looked razor sharp since returning from a three-month absence last month. He reached the final in Rome and has been near flawless in Paris, becoming the only semi-finalist yet to drop a set and earning the fourth-longest major win streak this century behind Djokovic (30), Roger Federer (27) and Rafael Nadal (25). 
In their ninth meeting, Sinner will undoubtedly look to dictate with his trademark baseline aggression, but if Djokovic's performance over Zverev is any indication, a compelling tactical battle may unfold. After dropping his first set of the tournament, the Serbian adjusted brilliantly, mixing in frequent drop shots and shifting the rhythm to disrupt Zverev's tempo.
That same strategic variety could be crucial against Sinner, whose powerful groundstrokes and willingness to rally make him dangerous in extended exchanges. If Djokovic employs a similar pattern of softening the court and pulling Sinner forward, the Italian will need to stay alert and adaptable, particularly in neutral and defensive positions where quick changes in tempo can open up the court.

Sinner, who is now 17-1 on the season, is riding high on confidence. But no amount of dominance can overshadow Djokovic's reputation as a big-match player.
“He's going to play [at] a very high level, as he did basically every tournament that he played in the last year and a half. I don't expect anything less from him. But these kinds of matchups and challenges in a way extract the best out of me,” said Djokovic. “Playing best-of-five, late stages of a Grand Slam against No. 1 in the world is, you can't get more motivated than that for me at this age.”
With his victory over Cameron Norrie in the fourth round, Djokovic recorded 100 wins at a major tournament for the first time in his career. Trailing only Nadal (112) for the most wins at Roland Garros, Djokovic owns a 101-16 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Sinner will be eager to halt Djokovic's bid for glory in the French capital, while also keen to better his result from last year, when he fell to Alcaraz in a five-set tussle.

In their ninth meeting, Sinner will undoubtedly look to dictate with his trademark baseline aggression, but if Djokovic's performance over Zverev is any indication, a compelling tactical battle may unfold. After dropping his first set of the tournament, the Serbian adjusted brilliantly, mixing in frequent drop shots and shifting the rhythm to disrupt Zverev's tempo.
That same strategic variety could be crucial against Sinner, whose powerful groundstrokes and willingness to rally make him dangerous in extended exchanges. If Djokovic employs a similar pattern of softening the court and pulling Sinner forward, the Italian will need to stay alert and adaptable, particularly in neutral and defensive positions where quick changes in tempo can open up the court.

Sinner, who is now 17-1 on the season, is riding high on confidence. But no amount of dominance can overshadow Djokovic's reputation as a big-match player.
“He's going to play [at] a very high level, as he did basically every tournament that he played in the last year and a half. I don't expect anything less from him. But these kinds of matchups and challenges in a way extract the best out of me,” said Djokovic. “Playing best-of-five, late stages of a Grand Slam against No. 1 in the world is, you can't get more motivated than that for me at this age.”
With his victory over Cameron Norrie in the fourth round, Djokovic recorded 100 wins at a major tournament for the first time in his career. Trailing only Nadal (112) for the most wins at Roland Garros, Djokovic owns a 101-16 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Sinner will be eager to halt Djokovic's bid for glory in the French capital, while also keen to better his result from last year, when he fell to Alcaraz in a five-set tussle.

To reach a 38th Grand Slam final, Djokovic will need to back up his authoritative four-set quarter-final win over last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. He could also possibly run a gauntlet of Top-3 opponents en route to the title with Sinner up next and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who faces Lorenzo Musetti, looming in the final.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Agassi analyses Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic: Who moves 'like a flying saucer'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/agassi-sinner-alcaraz-djokovic-roland-garros-2025","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 16:21:38 GMT","

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have reshaped the landscape of the ATP Tour with their meteoric rise and distinct, electrifying styles. One dominates with clinical precision and relentless efficiency, the other dazzles with raw athleticism and instinct.

As Sinner and Alcaraz continue to cement their status at No. 1 and No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, respectively, eight-time major winner Andre Agassi weighed in with high praise and pointed insights on their game during a recent appearance on the ‘Served with Andy Roddick' podcast. Hear more of the interview here.

A former World No. 1 and one of only eight men to complete the Career Grand Slam, Agassi is well placed to talk about movement and adaptation. He was particularly astonished by Alcaraz's seamless transition between the surfaces.

“The thing that amazes me most watching Carlos play live is how little his speed diminishes [from] clay [to] grass,” said Agassi. “Most people who are fast, they go to grass, and their court coverage comes down five per cent, just because you have to play really careful in the corners, you have to let your body weight move. Even if you slide into [certain shots], your first step out has to be very careful.

“Everybody's movement comes down a touch, but his didn't. It's like he trusted himself so much on the power of his second push that, running for a drop shot that caught him cold, on Centre Court at Wimbledon, he trusts that pause and then sticks on the jets and gets there. [He's] like a flying saucer versus the F-15s. Everybody's flying a plane and he's changing altitudes, reversing, and his speed doesn't diminish.”



During his career thus far, in which he has already won four major titles and become the youngest No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz has impressed with his raw physical gifts and willingness to compete.

“He's still so raw. I hope he learns how to maximise, and we should enjoy watching him before he does, because it's so much fun for the fans to watch how he plays the game,” Agassi explained. “But he still has so much more upside from a standpoint of longevity.""

Sinner, who is one year older than Alcaraz, has strengthened his grip atop the PIF ATP Rankings over the past 12 months. He is completing his 52nd consecutive week at World No. 1 and is chasing a third consecutive major title at Roland Garros.

In contrast to Alcaraz's instinct-driven brilliance, Agassi described Sinner as a model of precision and efficiency.

“Sinner is the exact opposite, he is constantly maximising. He's never hit a ball he doesn't really need to and when he does let one rip, it makes you wonder if he was forced to, what that gear would really look like,” said Agassi. “He's taking 85 per cent cuts and his jab is like a straight right. Jannik just wants to take over and never look back.”

When it comes to Novak Djokovic, however, Agassi's reverence reached another level. The 38-year-old might now be in the twilight of his career, but remains an ever-present threat at the top of the game. Djokovic is this week chasing a record 25th major title at Roland Garros.
“I see the greatest defensive player the game has ever seen, and shockingly, when he needs to be, possibly the greatest offensive player the game has ever seen,” said Agassi. “He's like the boxer that needs to feel the glove hit him before he even engages.
“He goes into this lockdown mode, then you start throwing punches at him, then you get away with a few, then you start getting him engaged and he goes into hyper lockdown mode. Then he throws some offence in, and you're thinking ‘I couldn't win a point when he was on defence, now he's on offence.'""

It may not have been the French Open final, but Coco Gauff played like a champion during her semifinals match vs. Lois Boisson on Thursday. Gauff turned in a dominant performance in the win, beating Boisson (6-1, 6-2) in straight sets.

It was an excellent performance from Gauff, who seemed completely locked in against Boisson.

Despite her dominance, Gauff played an emotionless game. She didn't react to mistakes or excellent shots. She was just solely focused on taking down her opponent.

The strategy worked. Seemingly every shot hit by Gauff landed where ever she desired. She often had Boisson running across the entire court just to keep the rally alive. Boisson acquitted herself well there, showing plenty of hustle to extend rallies, but all that movement caught up with her in the end.

The loss ends Boisson's miraculous run at the 2025 French Open. After coming into the event ranked 361, Boisson out-dueled No. 3 Jessica Pegula and No. 6 Mirra Andreeva to make it to the semifinals. Boisson — who is French — had the crowd on her side in all her matches, but Gauff was able to take the crowd out of the equation with a dominant showing Thursday.

The victory pushes Gauff into the French Open final for the second time in her career. Gauff also made it to the final in 2022, where she lost to Iga Swiatek.

There will be no rematch in 2025. Swiatek lost her semifinals match to women's No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday. Sabalenka and Gauff will square off in the final Saturday.

The 2025 French Open semifinals match between Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek was as good as advertised. After a back-and-forth match, Sabalenka came out on top in three sets (7-6, 4-6, 6-0), advancing to the final.

It was a tremendous match all the way through. Despite some early mistakes by Swiatek, she was able to rally in the first set and eventually force a tiebreak.

But with the first set on the line, Sabalenka rose to the occasion, using her devastating serve to take the win.

Swiatek answered back in the second set, taking an early 3-1 lead. While Sabalenka fought her back, Swiatek came out ahead this time around, winning the second set 6-4 to set up a decisive third set. It was the first time in the entire tournament that Sabalenka dropped a set.

There was a lot riding on the final set for Swiatek, who has won the French Open the past three years. She came into the match riding a 26-match win streak, the second best figure in the history of the. French Open.

Things didn't start out well for Swiatek, as Sabalenka jumped up to an early 3-0 lead in the final set. She carried that momentum all the way through the set, winning 6-0 and advancing to her first French Open final.

Fatigue may have been the biggest factor in Sabalenka's victory. Despite a lengthy match, Sabalenka's serves remained dominant even in the final set. Swiatek, who was able to turn in some strong returns in the first two sets, couldn't seem to keep up with Sabalenka's late serves, which were still coming in at incredible speeds.

With the win, Sabalenka will face Gauff in the final. It should be a tight match. The two have squared off 10 times over their careers, with both players earning five wins in those matches.

Date: Thursday, June 4

Aryna Sabalenka-Iga Świątek start time: 9 a.m. ET

Coco Gauff-Louis Boisson approximate start time: 10:10 a.m. ET

American tennis star Jessica Pegula may have suffered a tough French Open exit against wild-card entry Loïs Boisson but she was still taking swings at critics afterward.

Boisson, a French wild-card entry for the Grand Slam tournament, defeated Pegula in the fourth round of the tournament. Pegula revealed afterward she received death threats from ""delusional"" bettors upset over the loss to the relatively unknown tennis star.

""These (bettors) are insane and delusional,"" she wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, via the New York Post. ""And I don't allow dms and try to remember when to shut my comments off during tournament weeks but they always find a way to my timeline. This stuff has never really bothered me much but does any other sport deal with this to our level? I'd love to know because it seems to be (predominantly) tennis?? It's so disturbing.""

The daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula, who own the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, also shared screenshots of commenters who ridiculed her for the loss. Some called her ""trash"" while others said she should just enjoy being the daughter of billionaires.

There were other nasty comments as well.

""You sold this match on purpose,"" one person wrote. ""Can't wait until Karma spends the block back on you. Hopefully your first born child will be a still birth.""

Pegula added that ""every person"" on the Women's Tennis Association deals with some type of awful remark.

""I get told my family should get cancer and die from people here on a regular basis. Absolutely crazy,"" she added.

""I've seen stories of comments/threats/stalking making headlines in other sports…well news flash tennis I can guarantee it's 100 times worse. The comments are nonstop for us. Win or lose – it's whatever they bet on.

""I actually had threats come through the NHL that they were worried about and sent to me. My response was, ‘oh that's it? I get those all the time' that is so messed up that that is my response. Normalizing death threats!""

Pegula added that staying off social media was unavoidable because most of their sponsorship deals involve posting on their platforms.

Opulent properties can be rented through Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes

Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes

Over half a million tennis fans from around the world will visit southwest London beginning June 30 for Wimbledon, the grand dame of tennis tournaments. Founded in 1877 and held each year at the time-honored All England Club, Wimbledon is the sport's oldest tournament. From its famed strawberries and cream to the all white dress code, Wimbledon honors tradition unlike any other sporting event. Whether you're a tennis enthusiast or not, Wimbledon is a venue that should be on everyone's “must see” list.

The world's greatest tennis players all congregate at Wimbledon.

Wimbledon is much more than a tennis tournament. It is an event where royalty and celebrities gather with everyday sports fans to witness tennis played on iconic grass courts. Wimbledon can turn a relatively unknown into a superstar as it did for a young John McEnroe and an even younger Maria Sharapova.

The Village of Wimbledon, a quaint enclave where Indie boutiques and chic cafes line the streets, serves as the perfect setting for this storied tournament. The vast fields of Wimbledon Common draw walkers and cyclists, while smaller Wimbledon Park attracts families with its playgrounds and lake.

Visitors who wish to experience London at its finest during their stay can opt for a wide variety of accommodations, ranging from high-end hotels to cozy bed and breakfasts. Home to both the Regents Park Mansion and Regent Park Avenue properties, St. John's Wood, London is only minutes from Regent's Park and within easy reach of the All England Club. These opulent properties can be exclusively rented through Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes and offer a rare glimpse into the kind of spaces the ultra-wealthy retreat to during the London social season.

Affluent travelers can attend Wimbledon and stay in luxurious accommodations.

Tennis season is officially here, with the French Open currently underway. This weekend, the HSBC Championships will kick off at the Queen's Club. And Wimbledon, of course, starts on 30 June.

Whether you're a player or a dedicated fan, here are some of the best homes on the market for tennis lovers.

 

Players, staff, entourage and hardcore fans all need somewhere to stay throughout Wimbledon. In a rental, they're looking for home comforts, proximity to the grounds and somewhere to rest between matches.

Located a 20-minute walk (or six-minute drive) away from Wimbledon, this four-bedroom period house is available on a “tennis let” throughout the tournament for £3,200 per week via Hamptons. There are two bathrooms, a large kitchen to prepare nutritious, Wimbledon-ready meals and a rear garden for players or fans to relax in. There's also parking available.

 

Why bother with tickets — or queues — for Queens when you can watch the tennis from your terrace? This two-bedroom apartment, listed for £700,000 with John D Wood & Co., overlooks the Queens Club grounds in West Kensington, which host the annual HSBC Championships. This year, it's running from 7 to 22 June, featuring some of the biggest names in the sport, including Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Jack Draper, Emma Raducanu and Naomi Osaka.

Located on Gledstanes Road, the 652 square foot top floor apartment has a west-facing terrace with “truly remarkable views” over Queen's Club.

""Properties with views over the Queen's Club are exceptionally rare, and this apartment offers one of the best vantage points we've seen,” says Nick Scott, sales manager at John D Wood & Co.'s Fulham branch. “The large west-facing terrace is perfect for entertaining or simply soaking in the atmosphere during the tennis season.”

According to the agents, the property is currently rented out to tenants who fell for its views. “It's ideal for young professionals, pied-à-terre seekers, or those looking for a smart investment in one of west London's most desirable pockets,"" says Scott.

The Grade II-listed Miramonte in New Maldon was designed in 1936 by the English modernist architect Maxwell Fry for the property developer Gerry Green. But as well as being a modernist marvel, it's the perfect home for a tennis player, with its own all-weather tennis court and pavilion, which features a shower room, kitchenette and double bed. Fans can watch from the sun terrace, which overlooks the court.

There are 1.24 acres of grounds and an indoor pool complex, with a spa pool, changing room, steam room and sauna to help boost an athlete's recovery. And, when it's time for the Championships, Wimbledon is a 12-minute drive away.

Yours for £6 million with Coombe Residential.

 

As visitors descend on Wimbledon during the Championships, some homeowners on the nearby streets make thousands of pounds renting out their parking spaces. Spaces listed on YourParkingSpace can go for up to around £70 per day, so homeowners with multiple spaces and bookings throughout Wimbledon are quids in.

This 1,891 square foot property on Somerset Road is a five-minute walk from Wimbledon, and comes with off-street parking big enough for more than one car and a large double garage. Other parking spaces in Cedar Court are being advertised for £62.50 per day.

Besides the parking spaces, the house has five bedrooms – so canny owners could also make an extra buck by renting some out during the tournament. One bedroom is ensuite and there are two extra bathrooms, plus a rear garden. It's on sale for £1.35 million with Hawes & Co.

This four-bedroom house on Grand Drive backs onto the All England Lawn Tennis Club Community Centre in Raynes Park. The centre is home to 25 public tennis courts, which are used by the pros for practice during Wimbledon. 

You might be able to spot some of those training sessions from the rooms at the back of this 1,279 square foot house – or, failing that, you'll live close enough to the community facility to hone your own tennis skills. 

There's a bright kitchen and dining space which leads onto the garden and a loft conversion from which to snoop on the players. It's on the market for £800,000 with James Bailey Property.

This house in Rottingdean, East Sussex, is the former home of Britain's most successful tennis player, Fred Perry. Perry won three Wimbledon titles in the 1930s, as well as the men's singles championships of the United States (three times), Australia and France. 

In 1935, he became the first man to win a career Grand Slam, having won all four major titles between 1933 and 1935. He remains the only British player to have done this, and in 1984 a bronze statue of him was erected outside Wimbledon. Perry founded his eponymous sportswear brand in 1952.

After the Second World War, Perry split his time between Jamaica, Florida and the UK. He moved into this house in Rottingdean in 1965, using it as his UK base until 1994. Perry died in 1995.

The house was built by the developer and financier Charles W Neville, and has 3,935 square feet of space with four bedrooms, a double garage and a south-facing garden. It's on the market with David Webb Residential for £1.5 million.

PARIS (AP) — Third-seeded Italian pair Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat fourth-seeded Americans Taylor Townsend and Evan King 6-4, 6-2 to win the mixed doubles title at the French Open on Thursday.

It was their second major title together after winning last year's U.S. Open. For Errani, it was another trophy won at Roland-Garros, after winning Olympic gold in women's doubles with compatriot Jasmine Paolini last year.

“Let's see if I will see you next year, let's hope,” the 38-year-old Errani, who was a 2012 French Open singles runner-up, told the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier.



Townsend was the U.S. Open mixed runner-up last year with Donald Young, and has won two major women's doubles titles.

She hopes their performance inspires others back home and beyond.

“This is special for me and Evan. We grew up on the south side of Chicago,"" Townsend said. ""I hope this is inspiration for people to know that this is possible.”

As kids, they learned the game at the same courts.

“He's seen me since I was coming up,” she said. “We used to play at the public courts, Jackson Park, we used to play at the same park and we used to be at the same places.”

She added they will have another go.

“We're running it back at Wimbledon so we're going to try it again,” she said. ___

PARIS -- Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori of Italy swept to a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Americans Taylor Townsend and Evan King on Court Philippe-Chatrier to claim the French Open mixed doubles crown Thursday.

Errani and Vavassori won their second mixed doubles Grand Slam title, with the first coming at the US Open last year when they also defeated Townsend and her longtime former partner Donald Young.

The title was a seventh overall in Grand Slam doubles for Errani, who also has five women's doubles major victories.

""Congratulations to Evan and Taylor. It was so tough to play against you. We had to study a lot,"" said Errani, who is also playing in the women's doubles semifinals alongside Jasmine Paolini on Friday. ""Thanks to Andrea, to my best friend, it's so much fun to play with you. You're an amazing person, and it's so special to be here with you.""

Errani and Vavassori were tested early in the first set but saved two break points to secure a tight hold at 1-1 before grabbing the decisive break and taking a 4-3 lead when Townsend sent a forehand wide.

They dialed up the intensity in the second set, twice breaking serve before Townsend netted a volley to give the third seeds a dominant win.

""It's unbelievable to be in another Grand Slam final together,"" said Vavassori, whose win helped make up for the disappointment of losing the French Open men's doubles final last year. ""We had an amazing run, the US Open was a dream come true, and we love to play together.""

The American pairing looked disjointed throughout the match and racked up 25 unforced errors, almost three times as many as Errani and Vavassori's nine.

""Thank you guys for cheering us on and taking us through this week. We're running it back at Wimbledon,"" said Townsend, who teamed up with King ahead of the French Open.

The French Open continues to receive criticism for its scheduling decisions at this year's tournament.

As the tournament reaches its latter stages, fans on Paris' most famous court, Philippe Chatrier, have yet to see WTA stars headline a night session.

Instead, it's the men who have been given the nod, entertaining the French Open fans in the evenings.

Several women's players have shared their thoughts on the controversial topic, including Jessica Pegula who complained about the lack of equality shown. 

Iga Swiatek, Ons Jabeur, and Coco Gauff have all expressed similar beliefs, as the question rages on as to why the women aren't being given the opportunity to shine on Chatrier late into the night.

As Roland Garros officials receive complaints, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has weighed in with his thoughts.

Appearing on the Australian Open YouTube channel, Tiley gave his verdict on the French Open scheduling controversy.

“There are many factors that go into making a decision around scheduling,” said Tiley.

“The French [Open] will have their factors and their considerations, and they have different circumstances from us.

“It's a new initiative, it's only been a couple of years that they actually have a night match, normally, like Wimbledon, they just roll through the evening. 

“It's a new thing, and they've got one match; they've got to take that into consideration.

“I haven't spoken to anyone at the French Tennis Federation, so I can't go into the basis of their decision.”

The 63-year-old went on to explain how the Australian Open divides matches between the men and women.

“We have 26 sessions over the course of the fortnight, and a session every night, so there are 14 nights of tennis. Some nights there's three courts playing with two matches,” said Tiley.

“We generally schedule two matches and share them between the men and the women.

“We start earlier, we start at seven. It's even, sometimes the men go first, sometimes the women go first. Some years, you may have it more skewed towards the women or more skewed towards the men. But generally, we try to keep it the same as much as we possibly can.

“There's the added complication of three sets versus five sets, that's just the time, not a value, because you can get three-set matches that are more intense, but on average, the three sets are going to be shorter.”

Tiley outlined the factors that go into making scheduling decisions at Grand Slam tournaments.

“Our decisions are based on what the players want, what the broadcasters want, between when you played your last match, are you playing singles, doubles mixed?” he said.

“The players are a big part of that too, some like day, some like night, so you take all of these into consideration and you do the best you can.

“Because you're dealing with two people every time, you're never going to get it 100%. 

“I always say to the players, we'll make sure it's fair, not necessarily equal.”

The two key differences between night sessions at the Australian Open and French Open are the start times and number of matches.

In Melbourne, the night session starts much earlier, which gives them the opportunity to schedule two matches, whereas the later start in Paris allows for just one match.

With that being the case, there is more riding on the length of the singular night session match at the French Open.

If they were to schedule a women's match on Chatrier's night session, which finished in two short sets, fans would likely leave without a full evening's entertainment.

Last week, former world number four Tim Henman provided a simple solution to the scheduling controversy, addressing those two key issues.

“Go to two matches and start earlier,” said Henman.

It remains to be seen if any changes will be made ahead of the 2026 tournament but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Through the first 11 days of the tournament, fans on Chatrier have been treated to several evening classics between ATP stars, but could their female counterparts have offered up even more entertainment?

It's of course up for debate whether the women's matches would've been better choices than the men's, but the French Open certainly can't say they weren't spoilt for choice.

Day 12 of the French Open will see Aryna Sabalenka take on Iga Swiatek, before Lois Boisson plays Coco Gauff.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Jannik Sinner's comments about Novak Djokovic speaks volumes about him","https://www.express.co.uk/sport/tennis/2064734/Jannik-Sinner-Djokovic-French-Open","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:54:00 GMT","



Jannik Sinner admitted that beating Novak Djokovic when he's playing at his best is a monumental feat. The ATP No. 1 is currently gearing up for a French Open semi-final clash with the Serbian titan this Friday, looking to add to his two Australian Opens and a US Open title.

However, the Italian tennis prodigy knows the task at hand as he faces off against the 24-time Grand Slam champion at Roland Garros on Friday. At just 23 years old, Sinner has been vocal about his respect for Djokovic, having met with him eight times on the court to date. And although Sinner has beaten the seasoned star in their last three matches, his own experiences tell him how formidable Djokovic can be when performing at his best.

Reflecting during the Australian Open this year, Sinner responded to Alexander Zverev's comments comparing him to a prime Djokovic. He said: ""Well it's an amazing compliment from Sahsa. I think everyone is different in a way.

""Obviously I have some similarities with Novak's game-style. I still believe when Novak plays at his best it's very, very, very, very tough to beat him. Game-style wise, I looked up to him, trying to understand what he's doing.

""How he handles the pressure moments and important moments. I still believe we are different as players, because everyone is different. But for sure we have similarities, and the similarities are having quite clean well striking from the base-line, having good movement, understanding a little bit where your opponent plays the ball.



""Obviously I aim to improve as a player, because I feel like I still can improve in certain areas. And that is where we are going to work on.""

The comments came after his impressive 6-3, 7-6 [7-4], 6-3 victory over Zverev in the final at Melbourne earlier this year. And it's not the first time he has praised Djokovic. Speaking after his loss to the 38-year-old at the 2023 Nitto ATP Final, he said: ""I think today [Djokovic] played really, really good, especially in the back of the court.

""But I think today I was not that sharp in certain moments. I felt like also that I dropped this little bit physically. When you drop a little bit against the best player in the world, he makes it look like it's a big difference.""

Meanwhile, Djokovic has reciprocated respect for his rival, despite rumours of disrespect before this year's Australian Open. Djokovic participated in a word association game with GQ prior to the tournament, and while he tied Roger Federer with ""elegance"", Rafael Nadal with ""tenacity"" and Carlos Alcaraz with ""charisma"", his succinct response of ""skiing"" regarding Sinner raised eyebrows amongst some fans.

However, the tennis ace was swift to clarify the situation, saying at the the tournament: ""Yes, I've seen it on social media that it's being made into some kind of drama or a story, like I humiliated him or I've intentionally shown disrespect toward him.

""That's ridiculous. It was one of those quiz type of interviews where you have to think of something in a second. Sinner's name came up and I had this image in my head of him skiing, because I saw he was skiing somewhere.

""Also, the two of us talk about skiing always, how we're going to ski together, etc. That's why I said 'skiing', not because I don't respect his achievements in tennis, on the contrary.""

He added: ""It is as clear as day that the way he is dominating is worthy of every praise – both his playing style and the level of play. He's got all the attributes I've mentioned in others [Federer, Nadal, Alcaraz], and now people make it seem like I am disrespecting him. Rubbish.""

All eyes are on Sinner and Djokovic as they prepare for their showdown on Court Philippe-Chatrier come Friday, each aiming to secure their place in the French Open final where they will face either Lorenzo Musetti or Carlos Alcaraz.

Novak Djokovic is a 24-time major champion and less than two weeks ago he won the 100th tour-level title of his career. But as the sixth seed at Roland Garros, the Serbian did not arrive in Paris as the leading favourite.

The three-time champion at the clay-court major made a statement in the quarter-finals Thursday, reminding everyone of his potential at the event with a four-set win against Alexander Zverev.

“I think at the moment he's a bit underrated, to be honest,” Zverev said. “Funny that you say that, but I think like a lot of people count him out already, but this year he's had wins over Carlos at the Australian Open, he has had a win over me at the French Open. Forget the age. I think for any player, those are pretty good results.”

Winning seven best-of-five-set matches at a Grand Slam tournament is a big physical challenge, and Djokovic still has two tough matches to go to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires. However, the 38-year-old has proven his game is still very much there. 

“He's still beating the best of the best,” Zverev said. “So I think everybody needs to respect that.”



While Djokovic arrived in Paris fresh off claiming the title in Geneva, he had lost three consecutive matches before that. He is now 21-7 this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

“He's won 24 of these things. I think, yes, I expected him to be able to play like this. I have not seen him play like this this year yet,” Zverev said. “I think it was very, very high level from him. It was at some point difficult for me. 

“I mean, in the first set when the sun was not completely down, there was still some heat on the court. I could still, I felt like, hit some winners and do some damage with my serve. Then later on when it got really, really cold, I couldn't really do much.”

The two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion explained that as the match wore on, Djokovic found solutions to the various things he was doing during points and “felt like I didn't know how to win a point from the baseline against him”.

Now Djokovic is moving on to face the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner, and Zverev is departing the tournament trailing the Serbian 5-9 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

 Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori maintained their stunning 2025 season on the mixed doubles court by capping a dominant title run on Thursday afternoon at Roland Garros. 

 The third-seeded Italians downed Evan King and Taylor Townsend 6-4, 6-2 to triumph at the clay major without dropping a set across their four matches. Errani and Vavassori were cool under pressure throughout the 71-minute final. The pair saved all four break points it faced, according to Infosys Stats, while they also converted three of their own 11 break points. 

 It was a second major mixed doubles title for Errani and Vavassori, who defeated Townsend and Donald Young to clinch the trophy at last year's US Open. The duo also went 3-0 at the 2025 United Cup. 



 “Congrats to Evan and Taylor, it was some battle today against you. We had to study a lot,” said Errani at the trophy presentation. “Thanks of course to Andrea, my best friend. It is so much fun to play with you. You are an amazing person, and it is special to be here with you. You had an incredible tournament.” 

 Vavassori added: “Thanks to Sara. It is unbelivable to be in another Grand Slam final together. We had an amazing run at the US Open, it was a dream come true. We love to play together. We are best friends, so it is amazing.” 

 It was a seventh Grand Slam crown for Errani, who has lifted five women's doubles crowns to go with her two mixed doubles triumphs. The 38-year-old could still lift her eighth major doubles title on Sunday in Paris: She is into the semi-finals of the women's doubles alongside her fellow Italian Jasmine Paolini. 

 Thursday's victory helped banish 2024 disappointment for Vavassori on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where he fell in that year's men's doubles championship match. The 30-year-old, who is No. 8 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, has reached three major men's doubles finals overall.

The 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up Roland Garros with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history.BySteve TignorPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 05, 2025

“Pristine” is not a word that comes to mind to describe Wednesday's women's quarterfinals at Roland Garros.In a nervy, topsy-turvy, largely rhythmless opener, Coco Gauff and Madison Keys combined for 40 winners and 101 errors, and broke each other 14 times. Both players were tense and prone to mistakes early; playing a countrywoman in a Grand Slam quarterfinal will do that to you. But only one of them, Gauff, managed to cut those errors out as the match progressed. By the third set, she'd returned to the lockdown mode that has served her so well at this tournament in recent years.“I'm very happy with how I managed to fight today,” a relieved Gauff said after her . “It was a tough match. Madison is a tough opponent, but glad to be in the semis.”“I wasn't feeling the ball obviously to start the match,” she said, but a change in racquet tension helped. “Usually if you're playing too passive, in the end the more aggressive player is going to win. I was just trying to be aggressive.”

The second quarterfinal, between Biosson and Mirra Andreeva, was of somewhat higher quality, through both made more mistakes than winners. The ugliness came in the second set, when the 18-year-old Andreeva, regularly booed by the capacity French crowd, came unglued, smashed her leg with her racquet, bashed a ball high into the seats and watched a 3-0 lead turn into a .“I didn't really pay attention to the [booing], but obviously with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder,” Andreeva said. “But, anyway, I think that I can learn from this, so nothing more I can say for now.”Andreeva credited Boisson's good play for her win, which is only appropriate. The 22-year-old, 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up the tournament with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history.

Her game—physical, spin-based, forehand-centric—is the embodiment of how tennis has been played in this decade. She can hit her serve with flat pace or a high-bouncing kick. She sets up points to feature her forehand, and she loves to take it inside-in for blistering winners. She adds slice and finesse with her backhand.“She has a great serve,” Andreeva said. “She has a great forehand. I think she hit a lot of winners with her forehand today. I think that she also played solid and consistent throughout the whole match.”

Boisson vs. Gauff is a great unknown. It's the rare Slam semifinal in which the two players have never met—by contrast, the other semi will give us the 13th encounter between Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.We can start by saying that Gauff is ranked No. 2 and Boisson, as we all know by now, is 361st. But that 361 is somewhat misleading; she has climbed as high as 152, and surely would have moved higher if not for an injury. Still, Gauff has a huge edge in experience, especially on big stages.Game-wise, the match will likely be defined by high, heavy topspin exchanges that may go on at length. Boisson hits with a lot of topspin on both sides, and Gauff does with her forehand. One dynamic to watch: When Boisson runs around and cracks her forehand inside-out, can Gauff counter that with her flat two-handed backhand down the line? Andreeva had some success doing that on Wednesday, but not enough.

Boisson hits with a lot of topspin on both sides, and Gauff does with her forehand. One dynamic to watch: When Boisson runs around and cracks her forehand inside-out, can Gauff counter that with her flat two-handed backhand down the line? Andreeva had some success doing that on Wednesday, but not enough.

Both women can and will disrupt the points with drop shots, but both are quick enough to track them down. Look for a fair amount of cat and mouse after they've drawn each other up to the net. Boisson's serve looks more reliable. Avoiding a cascade of double faults will be crucial for Gauff, but if her serve is clicking, it will make her more confident all around.As for the Lois-loving fans, Gauff says she's ready for whatever they bring, citing other matches in other countries where she has handled a hostile audience.“I think there are two ways I have done it in the past,” Gauff says. “Either, A, just pretend they're cheering for you, and B, just using it and not letting that get to you.”Gauff and Boisson seem close to evenly matched at the moment. Coco has been here before, and she would likely beat the Frenchwoman in any other place, at any other time. But this week. Boisson is a home-town Cinderella. The old tennis axiom is that a hot-hitting player will eventually show you why they're ranked where they're ranked. I waited for that to happen to Boisson against Pegula, and again versus Andreeva. It hasn't happened yet. Winner: Boisson

The three-time defending champion is a (slight) underdog on Court Philippe Chatrier.ByZachary CohenPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

On Thursday, June 5, world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka will look to end Iga Swiatek's three-year reign at Roland Garros. Perhaps improbably, Swiatek finds herself as a (slight) underdog in this match, owing to the Belarusian's rise—on all surfaces—and the Pole's extended slump.Sabalenka has gotten much better on clay in recent years. She's 20-3 on the surface over the last 52 weeks, her dropshot is tremendous and her movement continues to improve. She has also gotten much better at hitting with heavy topspin. When Sabalenka plays with shape, she can go big and aim for larger targets, reducing her error count. It was a given for Swiatek to extract errors from Sabalenka, but Aryna isn't as mistake-prone as she once was, and Iga isn't as sturdy as she once was.While Sabalenka has improved on clay, Swiatek was just 6-3 across Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome this year. She was blasted off the court by Jelena Ostapenko (again), Coco Gauff and Danielle Collins. Swiatek's hold percentage is down from where it was last year, and she hasn't looked as solid from the baseline. But getting back to Paris appears to have awoken the beast.

Swiatek trailed Elena Rybakina 6-1, 2-0 in the fourth round—it looked like we seeing the same kind of matchup that undid the four-time Roland Garros champion earlier in the clay-court season. But Swiatek snapped out of it from there, winning 1-6, 6-3, 7-5. Her serve got a lot better, her return game was potent and she was firing on all cylinders with her forehand. When that forehand is on, it's the best shot in tennis, especially on slow clay.She followed that win up with a 6-1, 7-5 victory over a red-hot Elina Svitolina. Now, you have to weigh whether or not you care more about a few months of shaky play or Swiatek's 42-2 record in Paris. I'm going with the latter.

Swiatek leads their head-to-head 8-4 (5-1 on clay) but Sabalenka won their most recent meeting last summer in Cincinnati.

In 2022, Swiatek beat Sabalenka in Rome 6-2, 6-1. Last year, she also beat her in Rome, 6-2, 6-3. While Sabalenka got on the board with a clay-court win over the Pole in Madrid last season, we still haven't seen her beat Swiatek in slower conditions. And for as many improvements as Sabalenka has made on the dirt, I still think Swiatek's ability to defend the baseline and hit with heavy topspin can cause the world No. 1 problems.Realistically, it shouldn't shock anybody if Sabalenka wins this match. She's the world No. 1, and she's been the best player in tennis for almost two years. But Swiatek's struggles have been a bit overblown. And when she's in form, she shouldn't be an underdog on Court Philippe Chatrier.Pick: Swiatek ML (+112)

The 24-time Grand Slam champion was brilliant against Alexander Zverev, but now faces a quantum leap in pace from the other side of the net.BySteve TignorPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

“This is where I lock in and really give my best,” Novak Djokovic says. “I thrive on Grand Slams.”If you had any doubts that this was still true, he gave us all the proof we needed in a grinding, grueling, four-set win over Alexander Zverev on Wednesday. Djokovic, who has just one ATP title in the last year and a half, produced a throwback performance to beat the No. 3 seed.He had more aces than the big-serving German, as well as more winners. He made 71 percent of first serves and was broken just once, at the very beginning of the match. He won key points serving-and-volleying, was 27 of 37 at net, and in the final set, he saved a break point by finishing a killer 34-shot rally with a forehand pass. Whenever he couldn't afford to miss, Djokovic didn't miss.All of which is to say that the 38-year-old who stumbled his way through much of the first half of the season, lost two first-round matches at Masters 1000s, and fired his coach, is back in peak form, right on time. Did we expect anything less? I have to say I had my doubts that he could still win seven best-of-five-set matches on clay. Now he just has two more to go.

One of which will come against Jannik Sinner, the No. 1 player in the world, and the winner of his last 19 matches at the majors. Maybe more importantly, the Italian has also won his last three matches, and four of his last five, against Djokovic.The Serb understands what he's up against.“I know what to expect from Jannik,” Djokovic says. “He's going to come out, he's going to play on a very high level, as he did basically every tournament that he played in the last year and a half. I don't expect anything less from him.”That's thing with Sinner these days: You can pretty much count on a five-star, fifth-gear performance from him. The strokes are clean, the pace is blistering, the ball is back on you, or past you, seemingly in no time at all. To say he hasn't dropped a set in five matches feels like a gross understatement. Three of those sets were bagels, and three were 6-1. Against Alexander Bublik in the quarters, Sinner hit 31 winners, made 13 errors, and wasn't broken, despite making just 56 percent of his first serves.“Felt like today I was very, very consistent from the back of the court,” Sinner said afterward. “I think that paid off a lot throughout the whole match.”

As well as these two have looked, neither has played an opponent anywhere near their level so far in Paris. Whose form will hold up better under the heightened pressure?Djokovic will be facing a quantum leap in pace from the other side of the net. While he was able to grind with Zverev, he'll need to up his defensive level against Sinner, who takes the ball much earlier, and find some way to push back and make the tall Italian move.Does that sound impossible? We've seen Djokovic do it before here. Two years ago, when he played Carlos Alcaraz in the semis, he countered the younger man's power by standing toe-to-toe with him, and it worked. Djokovic was both wily and confident against Zverev; he'll need to be both of those things again.“These kind of matchups and challenges in a way extract the best out of me,” Djokovic says.

(Yet another) legendary feat complete.

Sinner is also well aware of what's coming. While Djokovic is 14 years his senior, that means he also has 14 more years experience winning big matches.“He has shown now in the last period that he is back to the level,” Sinner says of Djokovic. “He plays very, very well, so it's going to be quite tactical, but very, very difficult. He's such an experienced player, 24 Grand Slams. I think that says everything.”Sinner will play his game, because why wouldn't he? It's the best there is right now. Djokovic will try to find a way to surprise him and disrupt that game; he's as good as anyone has ever been at that.Djokovic is the man with 24 majors, but these days it's Sinner who has been coming up big at the biggest moments.

The Case For Djokovic First of all, they've only met once before on clay, and Djokovic won in straight sets. Granted, that meeting was four years ago, at Monte Carlo in 2021—but after Rafael Nadal, Djokovic has been by far the most accomplished player on clay this century, the only other man to win Roland Garros three times since 2000 and capturing 11 career Masters 1000 titles on this surface, second only to Nadal's 26.Second of all, he's won his last 22 matches in a row at Stade Roland Garros: seven en route to winning Roland Garros in 2023; four en route to the quarterfinals of Roland Garros last year before having to withdraw from the tournament due to a knee injury; six en route to the gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics, which were held on these courts; and now five more en route to the semifinals of Roland Garros this year.Finally, he leads at majors, 2-1, and though they haven't played here—Djokovic's two wins came at Wimbledon and Sinner's win came at the Australian Open—those are the only three times they've played the best-of-five-set format, so at the very least that will come into play on Friday.

The Case For Sinner Even though their last three meetings—all of which Sinner won—have come on hard courts, it's hard to ignore the clear shift in the head-to-head, especially given the manner in which he's beaten him.Across their last two meetings, at the Australian Open and Shanghai last year, not only did Sinner hold all 30 of his service games, Djokovic didn't even get to break point in any of them—a testament to the Sinner serve that arguably the greatest returner of all time didn't even make a dent.Djokovic isn't the only top player Sinner has dominated as of late, either—he's won 11 of his last 12 matches against Top 10 players, a stretch that dates back to last October, the only loss coming to Carlos Alcaraz in the final of Rome a few weeks ago, his first tournament back on tour.And finally, Sinner knows a thing or two about managing best-of-five, too, as he's currently on a 19-match winning streak at the Slams, a run that has taken him to titles at the 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open, and now the semifinals here. All best-of-five matches, all wins.So will Djokovic win his 23rd match in a row at Stade Roland Garros, or will Sinner extend his Grand Slam winning streak to 20 in a row?Tune into Tennis Channel on Friday!

Christian Horner has insisted that Red Bull will give Yuki Tsunoda “time and support” in order to increase his confidence in the car, with the team boss backing the Japanese driver to deliver after displaying “flashes of performance”.

Tsunoda was promoted to the outfit from sister squad Racing Bulls after the opening two races of the season, the 25-year-old swapping seats with Liam Lawson amid a difficult start to the campaign for the New Zealander.

While Tsunoda has scored points in three of his seven Grands Prix for Red Bull so far, he has struggled to match the pace of team mate Max Verstappen and faced two particularly tough weekends in Monaco and Spain, having failed to reach Q3 in Qualifying on both occasions.

Tsunoda reckons points were on the cards before the Safety Car was deployed

This has left him in 15th place of the Drivers' Championship as things stand on a total of 10 points, meaning that Verstappen is responsible for 134 out of the team's 144 point-tally.

When asked in Barcelona about what the team can do in helping Tsunoda to feel more confident at the wheel of the RB21, Horner explained: “I think the only thing that we can do is give him time and support and try and get a set-up that he's got confidence in.

“Driving these cars is all about confidence, and that's what he needs to find. I think he'll get there.

""He's fast. He's just got to piece it all together. We keep seeing flashes of performance. We just need to see him put it all together. I think he's capable of that.”

Horner has backed Tsunoda to deliver after showing ""flashes of performance""

With various drivers having filled the seat alongside Verstappen in recent years – including Pierre Gasly, Alex Albon and Sergio Perez – Horner also faced questions on the future options for the team, including the possibility of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar being on the radar after a strong start to his rookie campaign.

However, the Briton was adamant that the team are in no rush to make a decision about that, responding: “I think I'm going to take a leaf out of Flavio [Briatore's] book and say, ‘I don't want to answer it'.

Felton, who played the character in the films, will make his Broadway debut with the role.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, will reprise the role on Broadway. 


	Felton will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway starting Nov. 11, for a 19-week engagement through March 22, 2026. The play is set 19 years after the end of the original Harry Potter series, and sees Draco as a father, alongside Harry, Ron and Hermione, who are all sending their children off to Hogwarts.




	This will mark Felton's Broadway debut and the first time a member of the Harry Potter film cast has joined the stage production.

	In addition to his work on Harry Potter, Felton has recently appeared in the films They Will Kill You, alongside Zazie Beetz and Patricia Arquette for Skydance, and Fackham Hall, with Thomasin McKenzie and Damian Lewis. He made his West End debut in 2022, playing the lead role of Sam in 2:22 A Ghost Story; in 2024, he starred as the lead, Bob Edwards, in Gareth Farr's play A Child of Science at Bristol Old Vic.


	“Being a part of the Harry Potter films has been one of the greatest honours of my life. Joining this production will be a full-circle moment for me, because when I begin performances in Cursed Child this fall, I'll also be the exact age Draco is in the play. It's surreal to be stepping back into his shoes — and of course his iconic platinum blond hair — and I am thrilled to be able to see his story through and to share it with the greatest fan community in the world. I look forward to joining this incredible company and being a part of the Broadway community,” Felton said. 


Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, written by Thorne and directed by Tiffany. The production has been running on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre since April 2018.  Since its opening, the play, which was once in two parts and running longer than five hours, has been revised and now is one part under three hours.

If a deal makes, then James Wan, who directed the first movie and launched the horror franchise with Leigh Whannel, would get an ownership stake in his creation.  


							By 

	Borys Kit


Senior Film Writer


	Like any horror movie villain, you can't keep a dead deal dead.


	The on-again, off-again talks of Blumhouse acquiring part of long-running horror franchise Saw are back on, and this time may actually be far enough to close.




	Blumhouse is in the midst of a deal to take over the ownership stake of Saw from Twisted Pictures, the banner run by Oren Koules and Mark Burg. Twisted co-owns the rights with Lionsgate, which has distributed the films since the releasing the first film in 2004.

	If a deal makes, it would bring the franchise back into the partial hands of James Wan, the filmmaker who directed that movie and created the franchise with co-writer Leigh Whannell. Blumhouse, run by Jason Blum, merged with Wan's production banner, Atomic Monster,  in early January 2024.

	










			Popular on THR		







	The talks between Blumhouse and Twisted began last year but broke down earlier this year. A sale price was one of the big sticking points.


	Made for only $1.2 million, Saw became one of the most profitable horror movies of all time when it opened to $18.2 million domestically and earned $104 million worldwide. Home entertainment was equally massive (this was the DVD era, after all) and a franchise, that encompassed 10 movies as well as merchandizing, video games and more, followed.


	The last Saw movie was the 2023's Saw X. An 11th movie was in the works but stalled out.


	It is unclear what the plans for any new stories would entail — more movies? a series? — but the deal is the latest in a growing number that have creatives or filmmakers own, partially or entirely, their creations. Koules and Burg reportedly financed most of Saw's budget after first seeing Wan and Whannel's short film. Wan, off the success of Saw, went on to create or co-create the Insidious horror franchise and The Conjuring horror universe.

The planned 'The Birds' TV show also got a shout-out as SXSW London brought together Surian Fletcher-Jones of Working Title Television, Heyday Television's Sue Gibbs and Carnival Films' Noemi Spanos.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Upcoming Sarah Snook-starring thriller series All Her Fault and Lena Dunham rom-com show Too Much, as well as a planned TV take on Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds got big shout-outs during SXSW London on Thursday.


	They were in the spotlight as global hit series from various production labels under the Universal International Studios umbrella took center stage at the first-ever SXSW London.




			Related Video		







	“Global Stories: What makes compelling TV?” was the question discussed by Surian Fletcher-Jones, head of drama at Working Title Television; Sue Gibbs, head of development at Heyday Television, the joint venture of producer David Heyman and Universal International Studios; and Noemi Spanos, creative director at Carnival Films. Beatrice Springborn, president, Universal International Studios and Universal Content Productions (UCP), functioned as the moderator.

	Confronted with a question about how TV industry cost reductions, other spending cutbacks and layoffs are affecting their work, the execs shared insight into the challenges but also opportunities.


	“One is adapting,” offered Gibbs. “Heyday as a company, historically, we've always worked with IP. David's known for it with Harry Potter and Paddington. So we will always be looking for IP. I think we're probably looking less to the new books that are coming out because it's so super competitive. They're so expensive. So, we're looking at classic books, old TV shows, articles, etc. So I think it's adapting in that way.”

	











	Gibbs also mentioned that Heyday has often commissioned scripts with writers and then taken them out to the market to buyers. “We're slightly changing that now and trying to be more fleet of foot,” she explained. “Perhaps you just go out with a pitch so you can be faster. Or we're trying to set up more projects with buyers. [In the past], we would have perhaps taken them out to a number of buyers at the same time. Now, we are trying to get in with a buyer straight off, which is a financial incentive, but it's really more about the emotional incentive. If the buyer is emotionally invested in your project from the off, they can be more likely to try and help make it work.”


	In terms of upcoming shows they are excited for, Spanos touted psychological thriller All Her Fault for Peacock. “Sarah Snook's character knocks on a door to pick up a kid from a play date, and the older woman who opens the door has never heard of her, her kid has no idea what she's talking about,” she explained. “That kicks off that sort of thriller engine, but also it turns into a sort of bigger Big Little Lies kind of mystery about all the secrets and lies between these different families and relationships.”


	Concluded Spanos: “What I liked coming into it, reading it fresh and watching it fresh was that there's quite a thematic feminist messaging underneath it all, because it's called All Her Fault, and it's all really about how the mother is treated very differently from the father in that circumstances by the police, by the community, by everyone, really.”

	











	About the series planned on The Birds, Spanos shared: “This is obviously a Universal film title, the iconic Hitchcock movie. We're not adapting that. We're going back to the source material, the Daphne du Maurier novella and using that as inspiration. And at its heart, it's looking at when nature turns on you. Obviously, with climate change that is very timely, and we just attached an exciting U.S. showrunner who's very experienced in genre.” She didn't mention their name.


	Fletcher-Jones, meanwhile, touted Too Much and how it explores the differences between the U.S. and U.K. in lovable ways. 


	And she said that Working Title and the BBC are developing a TV adaptation of E.M. Forster's popular 1924 novel A Passage to India, which is set against the backdrop of the Indian independence movement against the British Empire and has previously received the film treatment. The companies are collaborating with Canadian director and writer Richie Mehta on the five-part series. “Richie is Indian by heritage, so it is completely turning that novel on its head and doing it from the Indian point of view,” shared Fletcher-Jones. “It's a beautiful piece he's writing and directing it all.” She also called it a take that will “reclaim colonial history, which feels really sort of Soul Food-y.”


On Wednesday, SXSW London sessions featured appearances by the likes of Idris Elba, ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus and Letitia Wright, among others.


	SXSW London, which not only features panel discussions, but also film screenings and live music events, among other things, runs through June 7. Penske Media, the parent company of The Hollywood Reporter, is the majority stakeholder of SXSW.

The ‘Letterkenny' and ‘Shoresy' director wrote and is helming the six-parter based on the enemies-to-lovers romancer by Rachel Reid and picked up by Crave.


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


	Jacob Tierney is directing a TV adaptation of Rachel Reid's Heated Rivalry, a gay hockey romance novel, for the Crave streamer.


	Tierney, a veteran actor and director, is shooting the six episode series in southern Ontario. Hudson Williams is playing pro hockey star Shane Hollander of the Montreal Voyageurs and Connor Storrie has the role of Boston Bears captain Ilya Rozanov.




	Both are rivals on ice but share a secret away from the hockey rink that could change their lives. A synopsis from the producers reads: “Shane Hollander and Ilya Rozanov are two of the biggest stars in Major League Hockey, bound by ambition, rivalry and a magnetic pull neither of them fully understands. What begins as a secret fling between two confused teenagers at 17 evolves into a years-long journey of love, denial, and self- discovery. Over the next eight years, as they chase glory on the ice, they struggle to navigate their feelings off of it. Torn between the sport they live for and the love they can't ignore, Shane and Ilya must decide if there's room in their fiercely competitive world for something as fragile — and powerful — as real love.”

	François Arnaud, Robbie G.K., Sophie Nélisse, Dylan Walsh, Christina Chang and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova round out the ensemble cast. The series is from Accent Aigu Entertainment, run by Tierney and Brendan Brady.


	“Heated Rivalry had me hooked from the very first chapter. At its core, it's a beautiful love story with characters who feel real and so deeply human. Hudson and Connor are bringing Shane and Ilya to life with all the heart, heat, and chemistry that made the book such a fan obsession. This series is exactly what we had in mind when we started Accent Agui — bold, resonant storytelling with global reach. We're beyond excited to bring it to the screen.” Tierney said in his own statement.

	











	Besides directing episodes of Letterkenny and Shoresy, Tierney also writes and directs films, and as an actor appeared in Xavier Dolan's Laurence Anyways. His other credits include This Is My Father and Poor White Trash. Teirney also directed and wrote Good Neighbors, which premiered at TIFF, Preggoland and The Trotsky. 


Heated Rivalry is executive produced by Tierney and Brady, with Rachel Reid serving as a consulting producer. Bell Media is handling international distribution rights.


	Williams is repped by RED Management, Storrie is repped by Sovereign Talent Group and Marina Masowietsky. Arnaud is repped by IAG and Anonymous Content, Robbie G.K. by The Talent House and Nélisse is repped by CAA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners.


	Walsh is repped by IAG and Bob McGowan, Chang is repped by Strand Entertainment and Kharlamova by Hero Artists and Brave Artists Management. Tierney is repped by CAA, 3 Arts and GGA, while Accent Aigu Entertainment is repped by CAA.

Premiering on Hulu, the film pits a Viking, a ninja and a World War II pilot against the titular adversary.


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	A Viking warrior, a Japanese ninja and a Hispanic World War II fighter pilot walk into a bar…


	It's not the beginning of a bad joke, but rather the unlikely connective tissue in the new animated Predator movie directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who has undeniably given the franchise new creative life. Premiering on Hulu domestically, Predator: Killer of Killers serves as a fan-pleasing amuse-bouche between the last film in the series, 2022's critically acclaimed Prey (also directed by Trachtenberg), and the upcoming Predator: Badlands, opening in theaters this November.

The Bottom Line

	
	A satisfying dip into the Predator-Verse.
	



Release date: Friday, June 5Cast: Lindsay LaVanchy, Louis Ozawa, Rick Gonzalez, Michael BiehnDirector: Dan TrachtenbergCo-director: Joss WassungScreenwriter: Micho Robert Rutare

									Rated R,
								1 hour 30 minutes			






	This anthology-style entry, divided into three chapters plus a final segment that ties up the stories in highly imaginative fashion, reveals the versatility of the franchise. Like the video games, it shows that the alien killers are just as fearsome in animated form. And with its time-hopping storylines — taking place in the first, 17th, and 20th centuries, respectively — it demonstrates that the Predators can effectively be plunked into any era. The crossover possibilities seem endless — get ready for “Predator vs. the Karate Kid.”




			Related Video		







	The storylines are not exactly complex. In the first, entitled “The Shield,” a middle-aged female warrior — “You look like a Viking washerwoman,” one of her enemies sneers — seeks brutal revenge on those who wronged her, only to have her mission disrupted by the arrival of a Predator. In the ensuing violent confrontation, her son is killed.

	











	“The Sword,” taking place in feudal Japan, focuses on the fierce rivalry between two brothers that becomes a fight to the death after their father's demise. When a Predator shows up, they overcome their hostility to join forces against it.


	And in “The Bullet,” set in 1941, a young pilot figures out that the alien vessel threatening his fellow flyers is not the enemy they think it is. “Fellows, don't engage with whatever that is,” he implores them, to no avail. After his aircraft takes a hit, he manages to repair the wing while still in mid-air like an animated Tom Cruise and later channels Harrison Ford when he tells one of the creatures, “Get off my plane!”


	So far, so simplistic. But screenwriter Micho Robert Rutare, working from a story devised with Trachtenberg, ties things together in an extremely clever, satisfying manner that won't be disclosed here but that makes the film more than the sum of its parts.


	More to the point, Predator: Killer of Killers provides the non-stop action that the diehard fans crave. And no concession has been made to the animated format; the film easily earns its R rating with copious amounts of gruesome violence and bloody gore that should well sate viewers' bloodthirsty tendencies. The animation takes a bit of getting used to, with its exaggerated, video game-style visuals, but it serves the material well. 


	The voice cast features Michael Biehn, providing him the impressive genre trifecta of having appeared in Alien, Terminator and Predator films. And there are plenty of Easter eggs in the form of callbacks to previous films, as well as hints about future installments, that should generate the desired social media chatter.

With its streaming service set to launch later this year, the sports media giant is debuting a new brand effort during the NBA Finals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


ESPN will use this year's NBA Finals to tee up its big bet on direct-to-consumer.


	The sports giant will debut a new brand campaign with the tagline “Sports Forever” during the series, leaning into its heritage on TV, and setting the stage for its “next era” on whatever device viewers choose.




	The spot, which you can watch below, features a clip from ESPN's first ever broadcast on Sept. 7, 1979, with anchor Lee Leonard introducing viewers to “sports heaven.” In the background, as clips of Leonard are interspersed with current athletes, teams and games, an anthemic version of ESPN's “dadada, dadada” sound plays in the background.

	“That is literally the first broadcast, the first words ever spoken on ESPN broadcast,” says Sinan Dagli of BSSP, the creative agency behind the campaign. “And we talked about it as almost this prophecy that he's like, setting out this oracle who is setting out the next four decades right from the beginning, it's not modified at all, this is what he said, and it is perfect for ushering us into the new era.”


	The Sports Forever campaign will kick off an extended marketing effort for ESPN, building up to the launch of the ESPN streaming service later this year.


	“Sports Forever is a campaign that emphasizes that being a fan is not just a momentary engagement,  it's a lifelong journey, and that ESPN has been on that journey now for over four decades, with many generations of fans connecting them to sport as well,” says ESPN senior VP of marketing Jo Fox. “That was the sort of starting spot, and we wanted to make sure that we're raising our share of voice and really hitting on ESPN's legacy and leadership in the sports space, before we then do our product launch later in the fall.”


	The inaugural spot ends with a sports fan on the couch, picking up their phone as the ESPN “dadada, dadada” chime plays. A text block says “Fall 2025: The Next Era Begins,” teeing up the streaming service.

	











	“We will have a really large launch campaign in the fall, which will talk about the two jobs we have to do. One is, of course, about launching our direct to consumer service, and that is something we'll have to explain a lot because we've had such a long history within the cable bundle. And the second is about all the features that we have coming to the enhanced app,” Fox says of the next phase of the campaign. “So there's quite a lot to say in that messaging when we go to launch, but we wanted to make sure before we did that and we started talking through these what will be quite comprehensive messages in our campaign that we reminded consumers, reminded fans, that ESPN has the authority in this space and the leadership in this space to really give this to fans, to give them an amazing sports experience that they've had before.”

The new legal salvo, which argues that the song's references to prostitution describe the rapper's views on women, comes amid a backlash to citing rap lyrics in court cases.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Locked in a legal war with Jay-Z, attorney Tony Buzbee is now quoting the star's lyrics from “Big Pimpin” in his latest court filings, claiming they describe the rapper's views on “how men should treat women.”


	Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) and Buzbee have been battling for months after the Texas lawyer filed shocking rape allegations against him last year. Those claims, which the star denied, were quickly dropped – and now Jay is suing the attorney for defamation and extortion across two different court cases.

	Seeking to dismiss one of them, Buzbee took an unusual step Wednesday: directly quoting from decades-old lyrics in his legal filings. The song, the 2000 smash hit “Big Pimpin',” includes crass references to prostitution – which Buzbee suggests contradicts Jay-Z's claims to a stellar reputation.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Carter's latest pleading bemoans what he describes as the ‘incredibly painful' event of explaining [the rape] allegations to ‘his wife' and ‘their children,'” Buzbee writes. “To put those allegations in their proper context, it is helpful to view them alongside the following lyrics from one of Carter's most successful songs, which became famous nationwide around the time [the accuser] claims her sexual assault occurred.”


	The filing included four lines from the opening verse of “Big Pimpin',” including: “You know I thug ‘em, f*ck ‘em, love ‘em, leave ‘em ‘cause I don't f*ckin' need ‘em /  Take ‘em out the hood, keep ‘em lookin' good but I don't f*ckin' feed ‘em.”


	“Released more than 25 years ago, this song of Carter's, like many of the others that made him famous, contains lyric after lyric describing Carter's views on the loss of innocence and how men should treat women,” Buzbee writes in the filing.


	Jay-Z himself has previously expressed regret about the lyrics to “Big Pimpin',” which reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 and spent 20 weeks on the chart in 2000. In a 2010 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said that re-reading the song's words was “really harsh.”


	“Some [lyrics] become really profound when you see them in writing. Not ‘Big Pimpin'. That's the exception,” Jay-Z said at the time. “It was like, I can't believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”


	The use of rap lyrics in court cases has become increasingly controversial in recent years, as critics argue that statements made in hip hop songs are unfairly treated more literally than other song lyrics. Efforts have been made to ban rap from criminal cases, and a group of law scholars recently warned that Drake's civil lawsuit – claiming the lyrics to Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us” defamed him – is “dangerous” and could have a “chilling effect” on future artists.


	The case against Jay-Z, filed in December, claimed that he and Sean “Diddy” Combs raped a 13-year-old Jane Doe at an after-party following the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z forcefully denied the allegations, calling them a “blackmail attempt” by Buzbee and his client. And after just two months of heated litigation, the accuser dropped her case without a settlement payment.


	Weeks after the case was dropped, Jay-Z sued both Doe and Buzbee in Alabama, accusing her of defamation and accusing both of malicious prosecution and other wrongdoing. That case followed an earlier lawsuit in California in which the star accused Buzbee of extortion and defamation.


	In Wednesday's filing, the Texas lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss the Alabama case, calling it a “clear attempt by Carter to punish his accuser and silence potential accusers.” And he cited the “Big Pimpin'” lyrics, using them to suggest that Jay-Z was being hypocritical when he said he “mourns his children's loss of innocence.”


	A rep for Jay-Z did not immediately return a request for comment on the new filing. In a statement to Billboard on Thursday, Buzbee said: “Mr. Carter's lawyers have spent millions of dollars aggressively trying to cast me as a villain and unethical person with blatant lies and half truths. At the same time they've vainly attempted to portray Mr. Carter as a bastion of virtue. Look at my background and compare it to his. I'm a Marine Corps Captain who served my country in the infantry and recon during two conflicts. Enough said.”


	Jay-Z's California case against Buzbee also remains pending. As reported by Rolling Stone, the judge hinted in February that he might dismiss Jay-Z's extortion claims while allowing the defamation claim against Buzbee to move ahead. Following new evidence about recorded conversations and a heated April hearing, the judge is still currently mulling whether and how the case should proceed.

""Thunder"" is the lead single from the superstar K-pop group's just-released fifth studio album Happy Burstday.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


SEVENTEEN found their way back to The Kelly Clarkson Show on Wednesday (June 4) to perform “Thunder,” the lead single from their just-released fifth studio album Happy Burstday.


	The off-site performance takes place in an industrial warehouse, and it starts with THE 8 answering a ringing payphone branded with the logo of The Kelly Clarkson Show. He's then surrounded by his 10 other bandmates — S.COUPS, JOSHUA, JUN, HOSHI, WOOZI, MINGYU, DK, SEUNGKWAN, VERNON and DINO — as they quite literally answer the call to give a bombastic performance on Clarkson's daytime talk show. (JEONGHAN and WONWOO sat out the performance as they're currently serving in South Korea's military.)

	











	Each of the group's three units — hip-hop, vocal and dance — are spotlighted throughout the performance, as the 11 members switch places throughout to put different artists center stage for the stomping choreography in the wide open space.




			Trending on Billboard		







	For her introduction, Clarkson called SEVENTEEN “a K-pop performance powerhouse” — and she's had a front-row seat to this powerhouse before. Back in January 2021, the group hit Clarkson's show for the U.S. debut performance of their 2020 hit single “Left & Right.”


Happy Burstday, which was released last month to celebrate SEVENTEEN's 10th anniversary, includes solo songs from all 13 members for the first time, as well as three group tracks: “Thunder,” “HBD” and the Pharrell-produced “Bad Influence.” Timbaland also produced on the project. Billboard previously shared exclusive behind-the-scenes photos from the “Thunder” music video set.

A Seoul court granted a request by the group's agency, ADOR, to prevent members from performing without prior approval. A second hearing is scheduled for Thursday (June 5).


													By
												

	Billboard Korea



The ongoing dispute between K-pop breakout group NewJeans and its agency ADOR, a HYBE subsidiary, escalated this week as the Seoul Central District Court approved a stricter legal measure restricting the group's independent activities. 


	In a ruling issued Friday (May 31), the court granted ADOR's request for indirect compulsory enforcement, ordering each member of the group — Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein — to pay 1 billion KRW ($734,000) for every unauthorized entertainment activity carried out without the company's approval. The ruling applies per violation, per person, meaning the members could be collectively fined up to  5 billion KRW (approx. $3.6 million) for a single unapproved group appearance. 


	“Since NewJeans violated the obligations set by the injunction by performing under a new group name and even releasing new songs before and after the injunction ruling, it is necessary to impose indirect compulsory enforcement to ensure compliance with the order,” the court added. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The decision follows the group's March appearance under the name NJZ at ComplexCon Hong Kong, where the five performed a new track titled “Pit Stop.” According to court documents, that performance, along with the release of new content, was deemed a breach of an earlier injunction that barred independent activities. 


	“Until a verdict on the first trial on the ongoing lawsuit regarding the validity of NewJeans' exclusive contracts is delivered, the members are prohibited from engaging in any entertainment-related activities without ADOR's prior approval,” the court stated. 


	The second hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday (June 5), and a final decision is expected to significantly shape the future of both the group and the structure of idol contracts within K-pop. All eyes are now on the upcoming hearing, which could define not only NewJeans' future but also reshape expectations for artist-agency relationships in the K-pop industry.

	Jonas has issued one solo studio album previously, 2011's Fastlife, which debuted and peaked at No. 15 on Top Album Sales. Jonas is also a member of Jonas Brothers, and that trio has logged seven top 10s on Top Album Sales (including four No. 1s). DNCE also counts Joe as a member, and that group has reached Top Album Sales once, with its self-titled project, reaching No. 14 in 2016.

	Elsewhere in the top 10 of the Top Album Sales chart, Playboi Carti, BAEKHYUN and Stereolab all shake-up the region with moves reentries and debuts.

	











Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units.


	Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem holds at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart for a second week (28,000; down 79% from its debut of 133,000). Playboi Carti's MUSIC reenters the list at No. 2 with nearly 18,000 (up from a negligible sum the week previous) following the fulfillment of deluxe boxed sets, exclusively sold via his webstore, to customers during the tracking week. BAKHYUN's Essence of Reverie debuts at No. 4 with nearly 10,500. Kendrick Lamar's chart-topping GNX rises two spots to No. 5 with 8,000 (up 16%).


	Rounding out the rest of the top 10: Jin's Echo falls 2-6 in its second week (just over 6,000; down 82%), BOYNEXTDOOR's 4th EP: No Genre dips 3-7 in its second week (6,000; down 57%), Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Short n' Sweet rises 11-8 (nearly 6,000; up 2%), Stereolab's Instant Holograms on Metal Film debuts at No. 9 (almost 6,000) and Sleep Token's former leader Even in Arcadia falls 4-10 (5,500; down 29%).

Billboard hosted its inaugural Global Power Players event in London on Wednesday (June 4) to celebrate music industry leaders from across the world.


	The invite-only event at Shoreditch House in east London honored the chosen executives for the Global Power Players list and the first-ever U.K. Power Players selections. Huge names including Sir Elton John and his husband and manager David Furnish, EMPIRE founder and CEO Ghazi Shami and afrobeats superstar Tems were recognised with special awards.


	John and Furnish collected the Creators' Champion Award, and John used his speech to warn the U.K. government that “we will not back down” in relation to the Labour party's controversial AI bill, which proposes an opt-out approach for music rights holders. Key industry figures such as John have called upon the government to work with the creative industries to find a solution; the government's bill has been rejected by the House of Lords on five occasions in recent weeks.

	“Copyright has to be transparent and seek permission,” John said. “These two principles are the bedrock of the industry and they must be included in the data bill as a backstop. Let's be clear: we want to work with the government, we want our government to work with us. We are not anti-AI and we are not anti-Big Tech.”


	He added: “I will fight for this until it's done and people have a fair deal. Every young artist or new person who writes a song, I want them to have a future and have their copyright respected.”


	Ahead of her headline set for Billboard Presents The Stage as part of SXSW London on Thursday (June 5), Tems collected the Diamond Award from incoming Billboard Africa editor Nkosiyati Khumalo. 


	“Being African and a musician is a whole new world and I feel like Billboard has been so supportive of not just African music but the whole scene and the culture,” she said. “This has been a really great honor, especially given that that African music is moving to heights that has never been seen before, and Billboard is one of the key players in moving that needle forward.”

EMPIRE founder and CEO Ghazi Shami was the recipient of the coveted Clive Davis Visionary Award, joining TDE's Punch and Top Dawg (2024), Bang Si-hyuk (2023) and Joe Smith (2014) as honorees. Named after the iconic recording executive, the prize was presented by Nigerian musician and YNBL label boss Olamide, and follows EMPIRE alum Shaboozey's record-busting stay atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 2024 with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”


	Collecting the award, Ghazi said: “I often tell people that EMPIRE is a philanthropy company masquerading as a record label. I truly believe that in my heart. It wasn't always that way. Being a visionary means you see a need in your community and you try and figure out how to serve that need. I felt that the San Francisco and the Bay Area community had a void in the music distribution space and fast-forward 15 years later, I'm blessed to say we built a global operation that reaches the four corners of the earth. We have employees in 25 countries and have probably the most diverse staff in the music business by design and intention.”


	He added, “I grew up as an immigrant kid in San Francisco with Palestinian parents who were refugees of war, and sometimes as a child I often felt like I was invisible. How would I be seen in a world that didn't see me? I took the initiative to build a company where everyone could be seen and everyone could be heard and I always like to tell people that if you're excellent they can't deny your existence.”

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Nick Jonas is near closed on a deal to star as KISS lead singer Paul Stanley in Shout It Out Loud, the McG-directed film about the formation of the venerable hard rock band in the 1970s. The film will go into production at the end of the year or in early 2026, with STX fully financing. The most recent draft is by Darren Lemke.


	I'm told that Jonas will do his own singing, and he'll need time to train to replicate the jet-engine vocals of Stanley. Besides headlining in the sibling band The Jonas Brothers, Jonas has also proven his chops onscreen. His rise began with the 2016 toxic masculinity hazing drama Goat. He shone in the MMA series Kingdom, as a young gay man who grows up in a family of fighters and has to hide his sexuality from a domineering father.

	











	Jonas grew up on the Broadway stage in numerous musicals, including starring turns in Les Miserables, Hairspray and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and he played singer Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys Live. His screen credits also include Jumanji and The Good Half, and he will co-star opposite Paul Rudd in the John Carney-directed Power Ballad for Lionsgate.  




			Watch on Deadline		







Shout it Out Loud focuses on the formation of the ‘70s glitter rock band. Stanley hardly fit the persona of a sex symbol front man as he was growing up. “I was deaf in one ear and had a slight deformity that made me look different,” Stanley once said. “I was this short, fat kid, and music became my salvation, a place to hide and dream. And when I played music, there were always girls around.”


	McG is zeroing in on a star to play Gene Simmons, the fire-breathing, blood-dripping, growly voiced bass player who formed the band with Stanley. His compulsion to take a rock and roll path also had a lot to do with girls.


	Simmons was a Hasidic Orthodox Jew from Israel who found a new faith one fateful day while exiting the yeshiva. “I remember walking out onto the street, seeing this Spanish girl jumping rope across the street, and staring at her long black hair slapping against this great butt,” he once said. “It occurred to me this was better than religion. How could I get near that?”

	











	They teamed with lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss, and then made themselves stand out by playing in face makeup with each adopting different personalities. Their enduring success was fueled by a steady array of power rock anthems including “Rock and Roll All Nite.” They beat the odds to become one of the most commercially successful bands in rock history. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.


	The project has been percolating for years, developed by Mark Canton, Simmons, Stanley and Doc McGhee alongside Jody Gerson for Universal Music Publishing Group and Polygram Entertainment, and Bruce Resnikoff of Universal Music Group/Ume, who control and rep the band's song publishing and recorded music rights globally, and Polygram's David Blackman. Canton, Simmons, Stanley, McGhee, Gerson and Blackman will be producers or executive producers, joined by Leigh Ann Burton. Also producing are McG and his Wonderland producing partner Mary Viola, as well as David Hopwood, Courtney Solomon and Dorothy Canton, and Swedish-based Pophouse, which acquired global rights to the KISS brand. Christa Campbell and Annie Herndon are overseeing for STX.


	McG most recently wrapped Way of the Warrior Kid, an adaptation of the Jocko Willink novel that stars Chris Pratt and Linda Cardellini for Apple TV+.


	Jonas is repped by UTA and Schreck Rose.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Following the award-winning run of his documentary Will & Harper, and with a new Spaceballs movie next on the docket for production, Josh Greenbaum has been tapped to direct a new Care Bears film for Warner Bros. Pictures.


	Good Fear's Chris Bender and Jake Weiner will produce alongside GoldDay's Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. Sean Gorman and Daniel Barnes from rightsholder Cloudco will exec produce, with Sheila Walcott overseeing for Warner Bros. The project doesn't yet have a writer, so it's early days here. Asking for plot details will get you the Care Bear Stare…

	











Care Bears has an interesting origin story, as the franchise was built around greeting card characters popularized in the 1980s by American Greetings (now Cloudco Entertainment). Each bear had a distinct color and “belly badge” that symbolized their personality and duty — with names like Tenderheart Bear, Cheer Bear, and Grumpy Bear — the idea being to personify different emotions and positive traits to help children express their feelings and foster empathy.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The popularity of the cards led to the creation of a toy line, which then spurred animated TV specials and, eventually, a TV series. The original Care Bears cartoon aired from 1985 to 1988 and was followed by three theatrical films spanning the mid-to-late 1980s. Over the decades, the franchise has undergone several revivals. New iterations of the Care Bears TV series were released in the 2000s, 2010s, and most recently with Care Bears: Unlock the Magic, which launched in 2019.


	With $470 million in global retail sales in 2024 and over $10 billion in lifetime retail, the Care Bears franchise remains a global commercial powerhouse.


	Premiering at Sundance, Greenbaum's Netflix road trip doc Will & Harper examines Will Ferrell's decades-long friendship with former SNL colleague Harper Steele and how it changes, or doesn't change, after she comes out as a transgender woman. The film won a Peabody and a Critics' Choice Documentary Award for Best Documentary Feature, in addition to being nominated for a BAFTA. Currently, the director is in post on pickleball comedy The Dink, starring Ben Stiller and Jake Johnson. Next set to helm the new Spaceballs for Amazon MGM, his other credits include Universal's Strays, cult hit comedy Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, and the Hulu Original documentary Too Funny to Fail about The Dana Carvey Show. The filmmaker is repped by UTA, Entertainment 360, and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols. 

	











	Daley and Goldstein are repped by CAA, Fourth Wall Management, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller; Bender and Weiner by Rick Genow & Allison Binder.

EXCLUSIVE: Following one of the more unique auctions the industry has seen in some time, Amazon MGM Studios has landed a film and docuseries package on the legendary Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race with two movie stars at the center of it. Sources tell Deadline that Channing Tatum is attached to star in the film about the motorcycle races, which will be directed by Dog director Reid Carolin, who also wrote the script with Jason Keller and Bryan Johnson.


	The film will be produced by Tatum and Carolin's Free Association, Pitt's Plan B, Keller and Entertainment 360's Guymon Casady. Insiders say once 360 landed the rights and began bringing it to each individual to bring this massive package together.

	











	The corresponding docuseries was filmed during last year's TT races with never-before-seen access to the riders and the races due to an exclusive partnership between the producers and the event promoters. The docuseries was produced by the same group, along with pre-eminent sports documentary producer Box to Box Films and Mediawan — the leading independent European studio and majority stakeholder of Plan B — with the participation of Entourage Ventures.

	Plot details remain vague, but the scope and history of the legendary race have all the notes of an epic feature film. Long before Formula 1, World Endurance and MotoGP, there was the Isle of Man TT. As the world's oldest continuously running motorsport event, it remains a one-of-a-kind spectacle. With riders pushing man and machine to the edge at nearly 200 mph, the TT represents the pinnacle of sporting endeavor and the relentless pursuit of glory.


	The never-before-seen docuseries is a 4×45-minute cinematic, character-driven series where riders chase their dreams and embrace life to its fullest. Through intimate moments, the series explore what drives these extreme riders to take such risks. The series looks into the consequences of this commitment, not only for them but for those around them. It is not just a thrilling adventure experienced through these extraordinary individuals but a deep dive into what sometimes drives us as human beings.

	











	For most of its century-long history, the Isle of Man TT was an event experienced only by dedicated motorbike enthusiasts who made the pilgrimage to the island or tuned in via radio. However, the 2022 launch of livestreaming through the TT's OTT platform, TT+, marked a new era, offering full coverage of every qualifying session and race. Combined with an enhanced social media strategy, this shift has spurred greater public interest, with online searches for the event doubling over the past two years.


	The film and docuseries represent key pillars in the development of a major franchise set to expand across a 360-degree strategy, building on the success of major IPs developed by the talented creators of the Mediawan group and embraced by audiences worldwide such as Call My Agent, The Count of Monte Cristo or Miraculous.


	While the projects were announced lat year along with the news of the docuseries going into production, the packaging of the two has been months in the making given the unique circumstances of bringing two separate things to market with such high-profile talents involved. One project involving a well known event and two stars like Tatum and Pitt could of easily sold somewhere on its own but all parties wanted to make sure whoever took on the package properly handled both projects leading to a thorough auction. In the end, Amazon MGM Studios proved to be the perfect fit given the global reach the studio could give to both the film and docuseries.


	Tatum and Carolin have had strong ties going back to when the two launched the Magic Mike franchise that Tatum starred in, Carolin penned and both produced. The film would mark the second film Carolin has directed following the hit MGM feature Dog, which Tatum also starred in and produced.


	As for Pitt and Plan B, seem to have a strong feel for racing films these days as the upcoming Warner Bros. and Apple pic F1 bows later this month. Pitt stars in the pic which is already earning strong buzz as it is set around the iconic sport.


	Tatum, Carolin and Free Association are represented by CAA, Hansen Jacobson and Relevant. Brad Pitt and Plan B are represented by CAA and Pitt is represented by Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Box To Box Films is repped by CAA. Keller is represented by Entertainment 360.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


Morten Harket, the singer of the Norwegian synth-pop band a-ha who helped define the 1980s MTV sound with its gorgeously sung global hit “Take On Me,” revealed Wednesday that he has Parkinson's disease.


	“I don't feel like singing, and for me that's a sign,” Harket said in an interview on the band's official website. “I'm broadminded in terms of what I think works; I don't expect to be able to achieve full technical control. The question is whether I can express myself with my voice. As things stand now, that's out of the question. But I don't know whether I'll be able to manage it at some point in the future.”

	The 65-year-old Harket disclosed his illness in an interview with Jan Omdahl, the band's biographer. He did not indicate how long he's been battling Parkinsons.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Using a two-and-a-half of his five octave vocal range and with model good looks, Harket became the voice and face of MTV and pop radio during the mid-1980s as a-ha's infectious hit song (and its inventive music video that made heavy use of rotoscoping) “Take On Me” became ubiquitous. With a bouncy synth pop introduction, the song was particularly distinguished by Harket's performance of the song's chorus that begins with a low-register “take on me” and moves skyward to a falsetto “I'll be gone in a day or two,” the final word sung near at dog-whistle heights.


	The New Wave song has proven remarkably durable, appearing in such films as Deadpool 2, Despicable Me 3, La La Land and Ready Player One. Most recently, the song and the band became a talking point during a memorable scene in Episode 4 of Netflix's hit series Adolescence.

	











	In his interview with band historian Omdahl, Harket said, “I've got no problem accepting the diagnosis. With time I've taken to heart my 94-year-old father's attitude to the way the organism gradually surrenders: ‘I use whatever works.'”


	Wednesday's announcement follows on the heels of the 40th anniversary of the song's release. “Take On Me” was the first single of the group's first album Hunting High and Low. 


	Omdahl reports that Harket has to date shared his diagnosis with few people in his immediate circle. “Part of me wanted to reveal it,” Harket says. “Like I said, acknowledging the diagnosis wasn't a problem for me; it's my need for peace and quiet to work that has been stopping me. I'm trying the best I can to prevent my entire system from going into decline. It's a difficult balancing act between taking the medication and managing its side effects. There's so much to weigh up when you're emulating the masterful way the body handles every complex movement, or social matters and invitations, or day-to-day life in general.”


	In the interview, Harket said he takes medicine to manage his symptoms. He has twice traveled to the Mayo Clinic to have electrodes implanted in his brain to control the symptoms of Parkinson's, though, he said, “problems with his voice remain “one of many grounds for uncertainty about my creative future.”


	Parkinson's is a progressive and incurable disease that affects the central nervous system and causes tremors, muscle stiffness, impaired balance and other symptoms. More than 10 million people worldwide are estimated to be living with Parkinson's, according to the Parkinson's Foundation.

International Investigations Editor


	The BBC has revealed that three of its journalists were detained at gunpoint by the Israel Defense Forces while they were reporting in southern Syria.


	The BBC said the incident, which took place on May 9, was “wholly unacceptable” and it has made a complaint to Israeli authorities. The UK national broadcaster said it is yet to receive a response. Deadline has contacted the Israeli military for comment.


BBC News Arabic correspondent Feras Kilani, a British citizen, was among the seven people held. Two other Iraqi BBC staff were part of the group, as well as three Syrian freelancers. They were in Syria to report on the demilitarised buffer zone seized by Israel following the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime.

	Kilani described how they were apprehended by Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint near Quneitra city and detained for seven hours. In a piece on the BBC News website, he recalled how he was strip-searched and grilled about his children and their ages. He recalled a gun being pointed at his head.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I was in shock. I asked why they were doing this when they knew we were a BBC crew,” he said. “[The lead officer] said he wanted to help get us out quickly and that we had to comply with their instructions.”


	Kilani said his colleagues were tied up and blindfolded, describing it as a “horrific scene.” They were also taken to a room to be strip-searched and questioned. Kilani added that their phones and laptops were examined, and photos were deleted. He claimed they were told there would be “worse consequences” if they approached the area again.

	











	In a statement, the BBC said: “The BBC strongly objects to the treatment of our staff and freelancers in this way. Despite making clear to the soldiers on multiple occasions they were working for the BBC, the behaviour they were subjected to is wholly unacceptable.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","Michael Imperioli, Josh Brolin, Matt Dillon, Director Ebs Burnough & More Go ‘On The Road' With Jack Kerouac In Tribeca Documentary","https://deadline.com/2025/06/kerouacs-road-the-beat-of-a-nation-exclusive-clip-1236424180/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:10:00 GMT","


					By Matthew Carey 

Documentary Editor, Awards


EXCLUSIVE: Author Jack Kerouac set an ambitious task for himself when he pondered writing On the Road, his 1957 masterpiece that still reverberates in the American imagination.


	“My purpose is to conquer knowledge of the U.S.A.,” he wrote, “to know it as I know the palm of my hand.”


	Those words, immodest, carried away with possibility and essentially romantic, are articulated in the new documentary Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation, which makes its premiere this evening at Tribeca Festival in New York. Actor Michael Imperioli voices Kerouac's writings in the film directed by Ebs Burnough and produced by Burnough, Eliza Hindmarch, and John Battsek. Watch an excerpt from Kerouac's Road in the exclusive clip above.

	The documentary interweaves “stories of modern-day travelers with insights from those influenced by or connected to the legendary author,” Tribeca's Jarod Neece writes in the festival program. “The film retraces Kerouac's restless journey across America while exploring how his emphasis on experience over material success, as well as authentic connection over digital convenience, speaks powerfully to our screen-saturated era.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Burnough and team not only enlisted Imperioli but other prominent artists and admirers of Kerouac's novel, including actors Josh Brolin and Matt Dillon, cultural commentator W. Kamau Bell, singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant, and writer Jay McInerney.


	“I am a huge fan of Michael Imperioli, his work speaks for itself, but he digs deep, and it comes through in the work,” Burnough tells Deadline. “He is also a scholar and his knowledge of Kerouac, and his work is incredibly robust, and he is honest about how Kerouac has impacted him.”

	











	Regarding Dillon's participation in the film, Burnough describes the actor as “the consummate artist. He is everything I think Kerouac would have wanted to be had he not had such a complicated life and early death. Matt is a director, actor, writer, and a painter. And he too is honest about the book's impact on him. I owe meeting Matt to my eldest son Bernie! We were having dinner and I said, ‘Matt Dillon really loves On the Road and he voiced the audio book and I have got to find him.' And Bernie (perhaps my most reserved child) said ‘I know him, should I introduce you?' LOL. That made Matt's involvement all the sweeter.”


	“Truly, it was incredible to work with all of our incredible cast,” comments producer John Battsek, “and hear the way that Kerouac's work has touched or influenced their lives in so many ways.”


On the Road has sold millions of copies since it was published in 1957. Readers have been captivated by its syncopated prose, and its imperative to explore – both an outward journey to the wide open spaces of America, and a journey within of self-discovery.


	“America is a vast country, ‘from sea to shining sea' we are BIG, and there are around 340 million Americans in this varied geography; and yet hide as we might, or run as we might, we are all connected,” Burnough observes. “In the tangible sense, we're connected by the incredible highway system that links grandma to grandson or friend to friend; but it's the connection that we long for. It's the feeling of getting out of where you are, the ability to hit the road and find yourself and at the same time know that you are not alone. Americans in particular hold a sense of independence, a drive that says if I hit the road the future is in front of me and whatever I am leaving is behind me. Keep pushing forward towards the unknown, but we know it is great inspire of not knowing exactly what it is. 


	“But I must say, it is not only an American impulse. Our landscape lends itself to getting on the road; but the concept is global. And that is where Kerouac truly understood human nature. In England and India and Africa and Asia, the roads may be different, the topography transformed, but the idea of finding YOUR place, the idea of traveling YOUR road of discovering your voice and your place in the world is as resonant as it is in America. We are all on our own individual journey and Kerouac gives us his manual which we are allowed to update (thank goodness) and alter as we see fit.”


	Notes Battsek, “I was struck by the fact that even though the book was written over half a century ago, its themes of freedom, self-discovery, and rebellion still resonate in today's world. In many ways the book is timeless because it captures the raw, restless energy of youth. I was struck by how Jack struggled so quickly with the success he received from the book and so it felt he wasn't really able to enjoy his success.”


	Kerouac, forever associated with the Beat Generation (he coined the term), published several books after On the Road, none of them approaching the acclaim of that novel. He died of alcoholism in 1969 at the age of 47. Kerouac was born in Lowell, MA to a family of French-Canadian descent (there is some dispute about his birth name, but he said it was Jean-Louis Lebris de Kérouac). He attended Columbia University in New York before serving in the Merchant Marine during World War II.

	











	“New York was such a significant part of Jack's story, and it feels fitting that we're able premiere the film here. It's going to be a really special screening,” Battsek comments. “I hope that the film surprises audiences and shows that Kerouac's passionate and poetic quest for understanding is still relevant in our world.”


	Commenting on the film's implicit themes, Burnough observes, “What binds us together is stronger than what divides us. The road, the physical road that we travel is connective tissue (not the only one) but our system of grids and stop lights and highways brings us together, regardless of gender or race or politics. We all travel it one way or another. And it forces us to bump into one another and see each other as we are finding ourselves. We can travel these roads on our own or with friends and family, but we are all on them together. And whether you're American or African or Asian or European, it's all also a metaphor for the path we're on in our individual lives. I hope this film reminds people that we're all in this thing called life together!”


	In addition to tonight's world premiere, Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation screens on Friday evening and Sunday morning.


	“This is the second film I have ever directed,” Burnough tells Deadline. “To be at Tribeca is a dream come true. To be premiering this in New York is a dream come true. I keep thinking to myself that I hope Jack would think this is pretty cool. But I am also very nervous! Actually, scared is probably a better word, just because we've worked on this for a long time and now it's time to present it to the world and that is scary.”

“Dancing With the Stars” alum Brooke Burke is in a long-term relationship with Scott Rigsby, and the couple has been engaged since September 2021. They should have celebrated their wedding day last week, but had to make the tough decision to postpone, and now Burke is opening up about why they did that.

A post shared by Brooke Burke (@brookeburke)

In an interview with Page Six on May 28, which was published on June 4, Burke was asked about her wedding day, and she revealed that it was meant to be that day. She confirmed that “actually no one knew,” that they had confirmed the date, but they were filled with sadness about not having the ceremony. “Today when I woke up, we were both, like, [crying],” she told Page Six. “We have been so busy. We built a home in Arizona. We blended our family. We moved in together [in Malibu]. We had the fires and then the fires again and the floods.”

Burke also discussed how the last few years had been “weird” for her and Rigsby, and that after being engaged for almost four years, she felt it was “almost embarrassing” when people ask about when she will get married. She doesn't want to stay engaged forever. It is not just her fans who are curious about their wedding, but even their children. Burke confirmed that she and Rigsby would like to have their wedding before the end of 2025.

A post shared by Homeworthy (@homeworthy)

The topic of wedding planning has been something Burke has been asked about several times in the last few weeks. In an interview with People on June 3, she commented again on her upcoming nuptials. She also revealed why May 28 was so special to her (so could 2026 be the year she says “I do?”).

“I had a really weird wish — because I'm a little bit weird — to get married on 5/28, which is the frequency of love,” she told People. The publication reports that the “love frequency” is often thought to be 528 Hz. 

Burke again commented on how they had been busy and the date had to be pushed back again. But she teased, “We gotta do it next year.” The actress referred to herself as being “slow” to get married, but when she does, it's going to be a memorable occasion. “It's got to be big,” she told People. “That's why it hasn't happened yet.”

She continued, “We want to do something different and innovative and show people how to make a difference. But it's not just about writing checks, it's about having fun, telling your story, living out loud, participating. Generational philanthropy. Nobody's talking about that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Morgan Wallen Can't Stop Gushing Over Tate McRae and Their Viral No. 1 Hit ‘What I Want'","https://entertainmentnow.com/country-music/morgan-wallen-tate-mcrae-what-i-want/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 02:30:30 GMT","

To some, Tate McRae and Morgan Wallen might seem like an unlikely pairing. One is rooted in pure country storytelling with a gritty edge. The other is a major pop powerhouse known for viral heartbreak anthems. But their new collaboration, “What I Want,” is proof that musical opposites can not only attract, they can dominate.

The single debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Wallen's fourth Hot 100 chart-topper and McRae's very first. The “Exes” singer topped her previous high with the No. 3 hit “Greedy,” marking a new milestone in her career. This time around, “What I Want” proved to be another hit for the singer, who decided to dive into the country world. Part of Wallen's long-awaited album “I'm the Problem,” the song leaked a day before its official release, and yet, it still managed to go viral on TikTok and explode across streaming platforms.

A post shared by Club Wallen (@clubwallen)

For Wallen, this was more than just another chart milestone. The collaboration pushed him out of his comfort zone and into a new creative space. While many fans expected him to pair up with another female artist from the country world, he knew McRae was the right choice for this particular track.

“Man, I just think she's awesome,” Wallen said in a recent interview with Zane Lowe. “I think nobody's really doing what she's doing. She seems like a new age real deal—with dancing, the singing, the type of songs she makes.”

Wallen revealed that “What I Want” was the only song he sent to McRae. He was confident that her voice would bring the track to life. “She was awesome, man,” he added. “She didn't ask me a lot of questions—‘Hey, can I change this? Can I do that?' Her range is phenomenal. You can tell… she sang the song that's written for a duet, and she absolutely crushed it. I can't say enough great things about her.”

“What I Want” doesn't just live in one lane. It's not exclusively country, not strictly pop, it's a blend that captures the evolving sound of mainstream music. The song appeals to fans across the spectrum, from rural radio stations to TikTok scrollers. It's proof that the genre-bending appeal has helped it rack up more than 35 million streams in its first week alone.

While the track faces stiff competition from major releases by Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift, Wallen and McRae's duet continues to hold strong on Spotify, Apple Music, and radio. Its success also highlights a larger trend in music. It proves that genre lines are blurring and fans are embracing it.

Ultimately, “What I Want” isn't just a hit; it's a moment. One born out of mutual admiration, fearless collaboration, and the kind of chemistry you can't fake. Whether it holds at No. 1 or not, it's already made its mark, and Wallen isn't shy about who helped him get there.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Latest Update on Kroy Biermann","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/kroy-biermann-update-kim-zolciak-divorce/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 16:22:25 GMT","

You have to admit, Kroy Biermann has led a pretty interesting life. First, he played in the NFL for eight seasons, and then he married Kim Zolciak and starred with her on the “Real Housewives of Atlanta” for two full seasons before dropping to recurring status.

The ex-couple's fights played out very publicly for years, until Kroy decided to step back from the limelight. Kroy now works as a Crane and Rigging Coordinator, and according to his daughter, Ariana Biermann, in a new interview with The Daily Dish, he is living on his own.

After years of chaos and police calls, Kroy Biermann and Kim Zolciak finally called it quits in May 2023, with both filing for divorce. Now, two years later, it's their daughter, Ariana Biermann, who is providing a little bit of an update on what the ex-NFL player is up to.

She is a cast member of the brand-new Bravo series “The Next Gen NYC” and revealed how her dad has been doing amid his divorce from her mom, Kim Zolciak.

Ariana first admitted to The Daily Dish that she “doesn't know” how her dad has been, saying, “I haven't spoken to him in a little bit.” he then said that Kroy, who legally adopted her and her older sister, Brielle Biermann, in 2013, had been trying to call her so she believed that she would be “speaking to him soon.”

Kroy Biermann and Kim Zolciak spent many months fighting over their million-dollar mansion located in Georgia. According to People, the property sold for $2.75 million in January 2025, less than half of its original $6 million asking price

Ariana says that since the property is no longer an issue, Kroy is now living on his own. “I hope he's doing amazing,” she said while pondering the implications of the divorce on her entire family. “I think it's really a tough situation right now, between the family, and it goes through its waves,” she admitted. “I hope he's happy. I'm doing great.”

According to Kroy's new job description, he oversees logistics and helps with improving workplace efficiency. He started the position back in March 2024, and in May 2024, Superior Rigging and Erecting Co. shared a post on Instagram naming him the “Rockstar of the Month.”

When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. 

Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word.

A post shared by Sofronio Vasquez III (@sofroniovasquez)

Since his win in 2024, Vasquez — the first Filipino singer to win the U.S. version of “The Voice” — has documented some of the ways Bublé has continued to be involved in his life and career, from working on new music to helping him get gigs. 

On June 5, he posted a screenshot from a FaceTime chat he'd just had with Bublé and wrote, “Not only is he my coach from The Voice, which historically made us win, but he also became family. He calls and sends some wisdom and great news for people like me who dream bigger than the world. Thank you, @michaelbuble”

The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. we skipped dessert because we are on diet LOL 😂”

Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.”

Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee.

Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. 

He told the outlet, “You know what? This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. He's such a good dude. I won't sleep.”

“He had all the talent, all of it, all the ambitions, all of the unique ability,” Bublé continued. “And all I ever did was just, I wasn't coach. I was a buddy, man. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” 

On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. 

“Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet. “I don't think I can reveal anything truly, but we've had some conversations about things. And actually, I spoke with Sofronio Vasquez, and we've had some conversations, too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Adam Levine Unlikely to Return to ‘The Voice': Report","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/will-adam-levine-return-coach-2025/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 03:03:04 GMT","

Fans were thrilled when Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine decided to return as a coach for season 27 of “The Voice” six years after abruptly leaving the show. But according to a report from the U.S. Sun on May 31, 2025, he's unlikely to be back anytime soon. 

An unnamed insider told the outlet that although Levine enjoyed the experience overall, he didn't realize how much he would miss the rapport he had with longtime coach Blake Shelton, who left the NBC series in 2023. 

A post shared by Adam Levine (@adamlevine)

Levine, 48, was one of the original coaches on “The Voice,” launching the show in 2011 with Shelton, Christina Aguilera, and CeLo Green. After 16 seasons, he shocked fans when he abruptly left the show in 2019, telling media outlets including “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” that he wanted to spend more time with his family. 

He announced his return to the series in June 2024, just before filming started on season 27 with Michael Bublé, John Legend, and first-time coach Kelsea Ballerini. 

In January, Levine told E! Online, “I just felt like it was time. I had some time to reflect and do my thing and be with my family. I was ready to do it, then the stars aligned and here I am.” 

But according to the insider who spoke with the U.S. Sun, Levine felt a “void” filming without the friendly, funny bickering and bantering he used to enjoy with Shelton, explaining, “Adam didn't realize how much his experience was made by having Blake on set with him until this season when he had to film without him.” 

The source continued, “He didn't enjoy this season as much as he anticipated, but he definitely feels Blake's void and misses him. That's not to say he doesn't like the other coaches this season, he does. But he didn't have as much fun as he did in the past with his buddy Blake.” 

The U.S. Sun's source told the outlet, “Adam's dream would be to return with Blake again, he desperately misses that guy. It'd probably kill it with the ratings.” 

But that's not likely to happen anytime soon, given that Shelton will launch his own singing competition in the fall of 2025 on CBS, called “The Road.” Shelton announced in November that he'd partnered with “Yellowstone” creator Taylor Sheridan to develop the competition series, which follows aspiring country stars out on the road. 

“No more shiny floors and studio audiences,” he said in a press release, clearly referring to his many years on “The Voice.”

No formal announcements about Levine's future on “The Voice” have been made, but he won't be part of season 28, which starts filming in July with Bublé, Snoop Dogg, Reba McEntire, and Niall Horan.

Mike Flanagan Calling Her Bluff","https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/mia-sara-back-to-acting-life-of-chuck-1235129414/","Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Nearly forty years since its initial release, “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” still gets quite a bit of play. Turn your television on during most hours of the day, and the Matthew Broderick-starring comedy is likely to be on. So when the John Hughes classic popped up last week, just a few days before IndieWire's scheduled interview with star Mia Sara, this writer took some time to catch up on an enduring favorite.

As Sloane Peterson, Sara — just 18 at the time of production, basically still a high schooler herself — is both an iconic cool girl (you'd have to be, to be Ferris‘ girlfriend) and the rare teenager with a real regard for the weight of life itself. If Ferris is the Id of the story, Sloane is the Ego. She's not just along for the ride, she's also the one giving actual thought to the deeper stuff that's unfolding around Ferris' wacky high-jinks. When Cameron (Alan Ruck) is flipping? It's Sloane who grounds him, who steadies him.

Not that Sloane doesn't have her fun, too. Consider one of my favorite scenes of the film, one of the rare moments in which we see Sloane without Ferris or Cameron, and one wholly emblematic of Sara's incredible range and impeccable timing. She's sitting in her classroom, bored out of her skull, waiting for Ferris to break her out. When the school nurse finally appears, Sara engages in a wonderful bit of business: waking up, packing up her stuff, smiling knowingly at a pal, and then delightfully pretending to be surprised that she's the one being taken out of class. It's a small moment, but it says a lot.

 










It's also the kind of moment we've missed over the last decade or so, as Sara took a break from acting after starring in a wide range of projects, from the early Tom Cruise fantasy “Legend” and the Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi joint “Timecop” to later offerings like the first “Birds of Prey” TV series and the “Witches of Oz” miniseries. For her first on-screen credit in over a decade, Sara co-stars in Mike Flanagan's deep-feeling Stephen King adaptation, “The Life of Chuck.”

Told in three chapters, Flanagan's film follows, well, the life of Chuck. Sort of? Told backwards, the film ostensibly guides us through the painful and rewarding life of everyman Chuck Krantz (played by Tom Hiddleston, Jacob Tremblay, and Benjamin Pajak at different points in the film). A big part of Chuck's joy and identity comes from his grandmother, Sarah (Sara), who shows him much-needed affection after tragedy and teaches him how to dance. Sara is lovely in the role, again offering the kind of grace and steadiness she mastered way back when with “Ferris Bueller.”

So, of course, the million dollar question: Why this project? Why now? And how can we make sure we're not waiting so long again for another Sara performance?

“It's Mike,” Sara told IndieWire during a recent interview. “Mike Flanagan is a beautiful man and he's a friend. My husband and I had met him socially and his stunning wife, Kate Siegel, who I think is a genius. We became friends and Mike said [one day], ‘You know what? Come on. Why don't you want to act anymore?' And I had lots of reasons, but then he said, ‘Well, what if I asked you to do something?' And I said, ‘Oh, come on, Mike, for you, I'd do anything.' He called my bluff.”

 










Bluff called, Sara said she still approached the project with some nerves, most of them sprung out of being a fan of Flanagan's large body of work, from other King adaptations like “Doctor Sleep” and “Gerald's Game” to his popular Netflix series like “The Haunting of Hill House” and “Midnight Mass.”

“My whole family, we're such Mike Flanagan fans, so it's very daunting that I'm a part of this,” she said. “Because I'm actually, aside from being his friend, I am a huge fan, which I'm not really of many people. So it was an incredible experience.”

Family was also top of mind when Flanagan pitched the film, based on the early King novella of the same name, to Sara. That sort of stuff sticks with the actress, who had her first child (son Dashiell Quinn Connery) in 1997, followed by her daughter Amelia with second husband Brian Henson in 2005.

“When Mike spoke to us about why he wanted to do it, he said, ‘This is what I want to make for my kids,'” the actress said. “Mike is a wonderful father, and I have kids, and we talked about that and what we want the world to be like for our kids. Then when he sent [the script] to me, I couldn't stop crying and I called him through tears and said, ‘Are you kidding? You really want me to do this? Yes, of course. Absolutely.'”

 










The time-bending and -twisting nature of the script didn't surprise Sara, but she was struck by how much the structure reflected the emotion and meaning of the story.

“Mike had explained it to me, and it lends itself to the whole theme, which is that our whole life, we all contain so many different stories and lives,” Sara said. “Yes, we're born, we live our lives, and then we die, but it doesn't really feel that way to live. We're always going back and forth and back and forth in our lives and memories and experience.”

Funnily enough, the film isn't Sara's first Stephen King joint. In 2006, she appeared in the first episode of the miniseries “Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King.” She's simply credited as “Beautiful Passenger.” What does she remember of that experience? Not too much, even as she delighted in the new connection.

“I was the lady on the plane!,” she said with a laugh. “I was on the plane, and I was married to the director, so I don't know if it counts. But that's right actually. You know what? I did that. But you're right. I never actually made that connection.” (Yes, Henson directed the episode, one of many collaborations the couple have enjoyed over the years.)

A couple of years before, during another interesting period in her career, Sara starred as Harley Quinn on The WB's short-lived “Birds of Prey” series, long before synergistic superhero mania overtook Hollywood. It's one of her last big credits, and one that she recalls extremely fondly. 

 










“I loved doing that so much. I loved it, I really did,” Sara said. “That was pretty much the last thing I did, and it wasn't because it was a bad experience, it was a great experience and I loved that part. If I could play parts like that for the rest of time, that would be awesome. But it also was right as Brian and I decided to have our daughter, so things happened and I got a kind of different life and it was really great and that was it. I felt like I started acting really young and I was ready to take a break.”

Did she happen to see the “Birds of Prey” film in 2020? No, but I assured her there's still time to catch up.

“No, I didn't see it. I wanted to see it. I didn't. I should have seen it,” she said. “I love Margot Robbie. It wasn't because I didn't want to see, I mean, I love Margot Robbie and I would've seen it, but honestly, I spend a lot of time with my horse. That's one of the things I've been doing!”

When Sara stopped acting, she had plenty going on: a new baby, her horse, and a burgeoning career as a poet. But that doesn't mean she didn't like acting anymore, just that — as she wisely noted — she'd been doing it since she was a kid, and maybe it was time to try some other stuff. 

“I started working when I was 14 years old, and from going from always being the youngest person on set and then taking this huge long break and then coming back? It's wonderful to be older,” she said. “I mean, there are some things that are kind of a bummer, but it's great.”

 










In “The Life of Chuck,” Sara spends most of her time with Pajak, who was twelve at the time he filmed the role of “young Chuck.” Sara cannot say enough good things about her young co-star.

“I got in the night before I started rehearsals, and I went to this rehearsal room and there was Benjamin and Mandy Moore, the choreographer,” Sara said. “And Benjamin, I have to tell you, he's a very talented actor. But that light that you see in him, that intelligence, that spirit, that's him. He's an amazing kid. He literally went up to me and he threw himself in my arms and I was like, ‘This kid's wow. This is great.' We had so much fun. He is such a lovely, lovely person. It was a very nice, it felt like a really beautiful cycle for me to be there.”

As a former child actor, did Sara have any advice for the rising star? She laughed. “I don't know, Benjamin's very curious and he asked me all kinds of questions and I tried to answer them, but I don't know if he needs any of my advice,” Sara said. “He's an extraordinary kid. He's so lovely. So it was an absolute joy to work with him.”

Sara also shares the screen with another legend: Mark Hamill, who plays Sarah's husband and Chuck's grandfather Albie. In a film flush with emotions and reveals, it's Hamill, nearly unrecognizable, who carries much of it.

 










“Mark Hamill is the coolest guy. He's just a gorgeous human being. He really is. He was such a delight. I think we just liked each other,” Sara said. “We have friends in common. There's certain history with my husband, Brian Henson, and with Jim Henson's Creature Shop and all that. So we had people that we could talk about.”

Hamill, of course, has a long history with the Hensons, Frank Oz, the Creature Shop, and the Muppets, spanning everything from “Star Wars” to “The Dark Crystal” and back again. And while Sara and Hamill technically both appeared in “Birds of Prey,” they never shared the screen. “The Life of Chuck” granted that wish.

“He is really a lovely human being, and so it was an instant chemistry. Really, by the end we were like, ‘Oh, is that all?' We wanted to do more together,” Sara said. “And come on, I'm a child of the '70s, I get to be married to Mark Hamill, how can I top that?”

So, OK, I had to ask, does she still get recognized for “Ferris Bueller”? “Not anymore,” she said with a little laugh. “I used to. It was always like people would think they went to school with me. They'd say, ‘Wait, don't I know you?' Like, ‘No, no.'”

And, yes, I had to ask one more: that scene, my favorite little scene, with Sloane in the classroom, does she remember that one at all? 

 










“I remember that scene! I don't remember what I was thinking, but I do remember doing that scene, absolutely,” the actress said. “That was so interesting, because I went to a really small school, so it was kind of cool for me. I was not that far from high school, maybe the youngest of that main cast. For me it was like, ‘Wow, is this what a lot of high schools are really like?'”

She added with a laugh, “‘Oh, there's a lot of people in this room.' I went to a really small school.”

Now that she's on the other side of her return to the big screen, Sara doesn't seem quick to shake it. There's so much to take away from the film, about the way life works, the people we meet, the choices we make, the path taken and not taken. It's the kind of thing that sticks with you, the kind of thing that was worth the wait. 

“What I take from it is that every person we meet, every person has all of these things inside of them, and every person we meet, we affect that person and they affect us,” Sara said. “We're not always going to recognize that in the moment, but it does make you realize that we have a choice. In every interaction we have, we have a choice. We can be a benefactor or we can be a detractor. We can smile at that person who we pass on the street or we won't notice them. Each and every one of us is going through that. We all are holding all of that all the time. It's wild all that we have going on in ourselves. If we can recognize that, if I can recognize that in you, if you can recognize that in me, all the stories, all the people, all the connections, all the missed connections, that's so cool.”

 










The big question: how long will we have to wait for another Sara screen performance? Look to Flanagan, who probably won't need to call any bluffs for the time being. “If Mike ever needed me, I would be there,” she said. “I would be happy to be a Mike Flanagan person, that's it.”

Neon will release “The Life of Chuck” in theaters on Friday, June 6.

Noah Hawley is trading “Fargo” for a more out of this world location: space. Hawley is the showrunner for “Alien” franchise prequel series “Alien: Earth,” which is set in 2120. The eight-episode series takes place prior to the events of Ridley Scott's “Alien.” Sydney Chandler leads the show, along with Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Adarsh Gourav, Essie Davis, Kit Young, and Samuel Blenkin. 

The official synopsis reads: “When the mysterious deep space research vessel USCSS Maginot crash-lands on Earth, Wendy (Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. In the year 2120, the Earth is governed by five corporations: Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold. In this Corporate Era, cyborgs (humans with both biological and artificial parts) and synthetics (humanoid robots with artificial intelligence) exist alongside humans. But the game is changed when the wunderkind Founder and CEO of Prodigy Corporation unlocks a new technological advancement: hybrids (humanoid robots infused with human consciousness). The first hybrid prototype named Wendy marks a new dawn in the race for immortality. After Weyland-Yutani's spaceship collides into Prodigy City, Wendy and the other hybrids encounter mysterious life forms more terrifying than anyone could have ever imagined.”

FX's “Alien: Earth” was created for television and executive produced by Hawley. This is the first TV iteration of the long-running sci-fi franchise, which spans nine films (the most recent of which is Fede Alvarez's “Alien: Romulus”).

Hawley told IndieWire that he spoke to auteur Scott while making “Alien: Earth.” Scott's Scott Free banner produces the series as well. 

“Ridley is the man. He's the creator of this franchise, he's come back to it later in his career,” Hawley said. “But you know, like the Coen brothers [with ‘Fargo'], he was very respectful of the fact that I seem to know what I'm doing, and I have my own take on it. That's the thing with these films, is that they take on a life of their own. And at a certain point you have to take a step back and let them be what they want to be.”

Hawley added of the recent “Alien” film, “I thought ‘Romulus' was great. It's a thrill ride. These movies are always survival stories. And the challenge in television is, that's great for two hours, but for 20 or 30 or 50 hours, survival isn't enough. You need to tell a larger story that engages you with characters and emotions and is not just about ‘Who is the last one standing?'”

“Alien: Earth” premieres August 12 on FX and Hulu. Check out the trailer below.

Sydney Sweeney attended the New York City premiere of Apple Original's “Echo Valley” on Wednesday, June 4. The “Euphoria” alum stars alongside Julianne Moore in Michael Pearce's latest film, written by “Mare of Easttown” scribe Brad Inglesby. 

Sweeney spent this past fall filming an upcoming biopic about Christy Martin, directed by David Michôd (“Animal Kingdom”), before wrapping on November 15. “Christy will forever be one of the most inspiring in my life,” Sweeney talked to IndieWire about stepping into the ring to play the iconic boxer.

 










“She has faced such tremendous challenges inside and outside the ring, and her story inspired me beyond anything, and I cannot wait for other people to be inspired by her,” she said. “She's just one of the most strong women I've ever met.”

Martin was the most successful female boxer of the 1990s. She signed with Don King and is the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Martin became welterweight champion — but that was about the end of the good things in her life. Christy was physically abused by husband (and boxing coach, and manager) Jim Martin, who was eventually convicted of attempted second-degree murder with a firearm and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Christy Martin's life is documented in “Untold,” the excellent series of documentaries by Chapman and Maclain Way. Her episode is subtitled “Deal with the Devil,” and is part of Volume 1.

 










The scripted biopic will be produced by Kerry Kohansky-Roberts for Anonymous Content, Michôd for Yoki, Inc., Justin Lothrop and Brent Stiefel for Votiv, Sweeney for Fifty-Fifty Films, and Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, the company financing the film. Executive producers include Michael Heimler, John Friedberg, Foulkes, Brad Zimmerman for Yoki, Inc., as well as David Levine, Ryan Schwartz, and Nick Shumaker, who will executive produce on behalf of Anonymous Content. Black Bear plans to bring the project to international buyers at the Cannes Film Market; UTA Independent Film Group, AC Independent, Anonymous Content's sales and finance division, and Black Bear will co-represent the U.S. rights.

As for “Echo Valley,” Sweeney told Vanity Fair that she watched hundreds of YouTube videos of addicts interviewed on Los Angeles' Skid Row to prepare to play Claire. She also drew from personal encounters with addicts as well. “I've had a lot of family members deal with addiction and then struggle with similar issues as Claire and her friends, and her group that she hangs out with,” Sweeney said. “I've kind of had firsthand experience with it. I mean, there's a manipulation underneath a lot of it. But when there was love in the air in the room, you truly still felt it. The person that they are at the core, as buried as they might be, is still there.”

 










“Echo Valley” premieres June 13 on Apple TV+. Check out the trailer here.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains some spoilers for the Season 1 finale of “MobLand.”]

Having just completed five movies and Guy Ritchie's Shakespearean gangster series “MobLand,” Pierce Brosnan is kicking up his heels in Kauai. It's the day after the airing of the Paramount+'s series bloody first season finale. He's tired, but happy to declaim on a show that he and his wife Keely Shaye Smith enjoyed watching every week as it unfurled, commercials and all. “It is a toxic mess of pure mayhem and great shenanigans,” said Brosnan on Zoom.

 










Brosnan was the first in, after Ritchie sent him five scripts by showrunner Ronan Bennett. At first, Brosnan figured he was going for a North or South London accent: that's where Conrad Harrigan bases his crime family. But Ritchie had other plans, said Brosnan: “In his shoot-from-the-hip style, with great bravado, he said, ‘Go Irish. Don't worry about it. We'll sort it out on the day. Put it out of your mind.'”

Of course, Brosnan did work on the text; then revisions arrived from the pen of Jez Butterworth (“Edge of Tomorrow”). “The writing became even more lyrical and nuanced,” said Brosnan. “I was working with Helen [Mirren] last summer on ‘Thursday Murder Club.' She came up to me one day said, ‘OK, I'm in. If you're doing it, I'm doing it.' And we set sail. Right before shooting, she showed me photographs of herself, how she wanted to play the character, Lady Macbeth, that emblem is there. You take a Jacobean tragedy, any of those desperate pieces of writing. And then she called me up, and she said, ‘I hear you're doing an Irish accent.' She was doing Irish on ‘1923.' Helen is very, very nimble on her feet, and she jumped in. We both flew together.”

 










We've seen Brosnan carry many movies with iconic characters over the years, from James Bond to Thomas Crown, but the older, wiser actor is unfettered and unleashed as he plays a powerful London kingpin who is used to getting his way. He's truly dangerous, capable of doing anything, a Mad King George. 

His wife Maeve (Dame Helen Mirren) is equally unhinged. Conrad's second son Kevin (Paddy Considine) runs the operation with fixer Harry Da Souza (Tom Hardy). Where Conrad and Maeve are volatile powder kegs ready to ignite a mob war, Kevin and Harry are more contained, tasked to keep operations running. “It was palpable on day one,” said Brosnan. “I spoke to Ritchie last summer. Five weeks later, I show up on the set first day. We don't have read-throughs. We had one rehearsal of the scene. It's my first day. Tom Hardy, myself, and Guy said, ‘more Irish.'”

Brosnan wound up deploying a Kerry accent inspired by the father he never knew. “Guy just said, ‘Go mad. Got it?' That was it,” he said. “And we took off from there, and everyone jumped in. It was the most incredible ensemble. Everyone knew what they wanted to do. Everyone was given free rein to just play, and we all knew each other's style. Helen and I had worked together. Tom is one of those great charismatic presences on screen. We never discussed the parts. And I thought, ‘Fuck it. If you're going to start working like this, then I'm free. I'm free. I can do anything I wish to do, whatever comes out of my mouth.'”

There's no question the heightened intensity created a charged atmosphere on set. For Brosnan and Mirren, “both of us, there is a theatricality,” said Brosnan. “There is an operatic tone to the performances. They are grandiose, they are flamboyant. They are mangled, bottled spiders of venom with humor and cutting, biting Irish lyricism. And the writing, I was supported by the great words of Jez Butterworth, who captures the Irish heartbeat of discontent and caustic hearts.”

 










As the cast and crew knocked off the episodes, Butterworth was running behind, supplying new scripts for the final episodes at the last minute. “It was like a carpet that unfurled before me each and every week,” said Brosnan. “There were surprises. And you put your heart, your soul, your passion, your drive, the sheer alchemy of these great actors that you were surrounded by. And it was extremely liberating. Suddenly people were dying, and suddenly I'm losing my son. He's getting his head lopped off. Hence, you're in a nest of vipers.”

One of the vipers is Mirren's Maeve, Conrad's wife. “She is beyond words,” said Brosnan. “She's Lady Macbeth, Phaedra. She's poisoned. She is the ultimate bottled spider. Conrad knows, and he loves her. They love each other. They're joined as these rogue genes from an early age, who challenge each other, love each other, and drive each other on. But there is a deep fracture of psychological damage to all of these characters. They're all not well. They're from abused backgrounds. They all come from a gene pool of bad blood and that's the joy of it. And, Conrad is a pig farmer. He was a car thief. He's done time. He's hurt people. He's a monster, but he has humanity to him as well.”

At the end of the series, Conrad is in Reading Gaol, behind glass with a phone as he meets his son Kevin (Paddy Considine). Conrad unravels as Kevin, who has stayed loyal to him his whole life, finally abandons him and calls him out. “It was a poignant scene,” said Brosnan. “As the series went on, we were playing catch-up all the time, so by the time we got to Episode 8, we really didn't know what was going on, the scripts were coming in last minute. And then you have the poignant, brilliant, soul-searching, Paddy Considine. And when you work with people like that, they make you real, they give you so much. It was the last day, and we were doing this father-son scene in Reading jail where dear Oscar Wilde met his brutal, brutish end, really. That prison holds such tremor of desperation and dank tomb-like death.”

 










Producer David Glasser has teased a Season 2, which has yet to be officially announced. The end of the series sets up nasty conflicts between the surviving players, Conrad included, who goes out on a prison riot. Brosnan suggested playing the Rolling Stones' “Sympathy for the Devil.” 

“Give the guy some juice,” he said. “Because they're all applauding, you know? And they did, and then we cranked up ‘Sympathy for the Devil' in Reading jail, and it just went through the roof.”

Next up: In the remake of the Sylvester Stallone chestnut “Cliffhanger,” “It's Lily James and myself up the mountain, and the bad guys come,” Brosnan said. “I'm the dad, and she's the heroine.” He plays a trainer in docudrama “Giant,” about Prince Naseem “Naz” Hamed, a British-Yemeni boxer who became world champion. And he goes West as a Sheriff battling villain Samuel L. Jackson in “Unholy Trinity.”
 










“There's been work,” he said. “There's been an abundance of work.”

“MobLand” is now streaming on Paramount+.

Blumhouse founder Jason Blum has an axe to grind when he hears people say Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” is not a horror film. Admittedly, the movie is a genre-bending period film and folk fable about the roots of blues music, but it's got vampires killing people in it, so it's a horror movie. And Blum wants you to know it.

“Sinners'” box office success — $350 million worldwide to date — has defied expectations for what an original horror film can do, and even though Blum didn't make it, it's good for his business when the genre as a whole thrives. But much of the discussion around that movie before its release was its hefty budget — a reported $90 million — that complicated its path to profitability. For Blum, he's built his empire on movies made on the cheap that can still be marketed as events, break out in a big way, and spawn franchises. But as Blumhouse has scaled up and the demand for horror has increased, Blumhouse can't make movies as modestly, and the industry too runs into challenges to continue to make horror movies work financially.

Blum on Tuesday took the stage in Hollywood at a press event called The Business of Fear, in which he and a panel of Blumhouse and Atomic Monster associates discussed box office trends for the genre and how horror has evolved over the years, such that the genre “horror” can't be viewed so narrowly. IndieWire asked him about “Sinners,” a movie he says is “one of my favorite horror movies I've seen in a long time,” and why he felt “Sinners” was the rare exception to the rule about making horror movies work on such a massive scale.

“We are definitely not interested in doing movies with that size a budget. That said, I'm glad they had the budget that they had because I think it really helped make the movie rich and incredible and amazing; but we are not going to make horror movies at that level anytime soon, maybe ever,” Blum said in the panel discussion. “The bigger the budget, the more strain on the creative and the more sanding down of edges. And I think, generally speaking, ‘Sinners' being the exception, the product is less interesting. So we are committed to lower budgets to continue to be able to take creative risks and do interesting things, which I think is harder to do when you have more money.”

Blumhouse, following its merger with James Wan's Atomic Monster, has scaled up significantly such that it needs to have “major studio-level success,” as Blum puts it. That means $100 million+ movies, which even for Blum and Wan is rare for movies made for just $1 million. He acknowledges that an indie like last year's “Longlegs” pulled off the feat, and films like “Terrifier 3” came dang close, Blum said today “it's much harder to do what we started doing 15 years ago.”

 










“So the way that we've addressed that is by adding a bit of money to our model; but still, by studio standards, for instance, the budgets of our movies are 60 percent off the average sticker price, actually probably more, 75 percent off, the average sticker price,” Blum said. 

Blumhouse has five remaining movies on its slate for 2025, all of them sequels, including “M3GAN 2.0,” “Five Night's at Freddy's 2,” a new “Conjuring” movie, “The Black Phone 2,” and “Mortal Kombat 2.” At the event, Blumhouse also announced it's in development on “Ma 2,” with Octavia Spencer set to return. But it's threading a needle in finding original properties that someday can be the next major franchise for Blumhouse. 

Together with Atomic Monster it's branching out into video games, an exciting growth area to tell other horror stories, but Blumhouse president Abhijay Prakash explained that they're positioned to adapt one of those games into a film should one break out, though that wasn't the reason it launched the division. Blumhouse also announced at the event it will be adapting another indie horror game hit, “Phasmaphobia.” 

Blum is also staying true to the company's philosophy about finding good stories, things that are genuinely scary, rather than trying to stack them with stars or buzzy directors and figure out the rest later. IndieWire asked Blum about a recent viral video from Charli XCX in which she pitched the idea of a “Final Destination” movie starring all “It Girls,” and directed by Coralie Fargeat for good measure. Blum hadn't seen the video, but he'd want to hear a bit more. 

 










“Generally, I am not a fan, I think no one on this panel is, of reverse-engineering movies. You never get a good result,” he said. “It's how, unfortunately, the vast majority of movies are made, but it's very hard to get a good movie reverse-engineering it.”

Blum added the studio is unlikely to again release a movie day-and-date in theaters and on Peacock as it did with “Five Nights at Freddy's” but won't be repeating with the sequel. Horror works best in the theater, not at home, and it's the reason the genre has consistently grown in popularity and still hasn't reached its peak. He says it will lead to movies that are one day constructed very differently for theatrical than they are for streaming — not just a difference in quality or budgets — and horror is very equipped for that evolution. 

“Horror, in my mind, is the only genre that you just can't get what you are going to see a horror movie for at home on TV. It doesn't work,” he said. “The only way to be really scared is when your phone is not with you and when you are in a dark room with a lot of other people and you are fully focused on a movie. You guys try it. Watch a horror movie on streaming, and when you know a scare is coming, look away for two seconds and look back. It stops working. It's just, your suspension of disbelief is broken, and when you are leading that up to a scare, you are just not scared. It's actually made horror in cinema stronger.”

Willem Dafoe is deepening his hold on the modern thriller: The acclaimed actor is putting his talents to the adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel “The Man in My Basement” alongside “The Color Purple” standout Corey Hawkins. Dafoe stars as Hawkins' unexpected summer tenant who has ill intentions…

The logline reads: “Down on his luck, Charles Blakey (Hawkins) agrees to rent his basement to a mysterious stranger (Dafoe), unaware he may be letting in a force much darker than he imagined.” The film is set in 1994 Sag Harbor, New York, with Charles on the verge of losing his ancestral home to foreclosure. Anna Diop co-stars.

Nadia Latif makes her feature directorial debut with “The Man in My Basement.” She opted to have the film take place a decade before the novel is set (in the early 2000s) to coincide with the backdrop of the Rwandan genocide during the Rwandan Civil War of the '90s. Latif teased to EW that the timeline shift was necessary for a meditation on “who gets to tell whose history,” with a “darker, scarier, and more baroque” tone than the source material. 

 










“I haven't stopped thinking about the novel since I first read it 20 years ago,” Latif said. “It's such a dark, twisted, and wickedly funny journey into the heart of evil.”

Hawkins also told EW that the film “asks each of us to sit in the uncomfortable. We're exploring mental health, trauma, exploitation, and yes, the nature of evil, but we're also dealing with legacy, lineage, home, and love. A script centered on blackness in middle-class Sag Harbor in the '90s is loaded with cultural significance. I love that Nadia honored all of that and was willing to deconstruct the script with us, interrogate it, and put it back together — all of the ugly, all of the beauty. She took the essence of Mosley's novel and distilled it into something very unique.” 

Hawkins, whose role in “The Man in My Basement” was originally to be played by Jonathan Majors before Hulu parted ways with the actor, previously told IndieWire that he was brought in to replace Majors a few months after he exited the film. “It's an incredible look at a Black man who is experiencing trauma, but also legacy and family and curiosity,” he said of the feature. “I don't think we've seen a story like this. It gave me an opportunity as an actor to go deeper than I've ever gone before. To bounce off of somebody like Willem Dafoe day after day after day, it was just like two bulls in the ring. It's a gift.”

 










“The Man in My Basement” will premiere later this year in theaters and on Hulu. Check out the teaser below.

When Aubrey Graham stepped out of the wheelchair and tried his hand at rapping, he had to prove to hip-hop he wasn't just an actor messing around with music like it was a weekly pottery class. This was back when “gatekeeping” still mattered. The journey into music for New Jersey streamer PlaqueBoyMax has been much smoother. Beyond the usual factors of relatability and charisma, Max has a semblance of taste, which the streaming world woefully lacks. On his streams, which routinely rack up tens of thousands of concurrent viewers, he's helped put on a new generation of rappers like Lazer Dim 700 and Nino Paid by featuring them in online shows like “Song Wars,” where songs are pitted against each other in a bracket, with winners determined by a panel of judges. (The Fader's Vivian Medithi aptly described it as “American Idol for the SoundCloud set.”)

Almost like an underground DJ Khaled, PlaqueBoyMax is good at assembling records by calling up his contacts, picking beats from his Discord community, and catching a vibe. As his platform has grown, he's shown he can find common ground with virtually any guest, from Central Cee to Will Smith, like a late-night TV host. His music aptitude really comes into focus in his series “In The Booth,” where he engineers sessions in real time for rappers, meticulously punching them in, line by line, giving us unexpected collabs like the rapturous BabyChiefDoIt/Nino Paid song “Coolin.” Sure, streaming is altogether pretty uncool, a sign of male loneliness and the death rattle for traditional media, but if we have to live with it, I'll take “Coolin” over Adin Ross kissing Donald Trump's ass.

So what happens when Max himself starts rapping? That's the question his debut solo mixtape, Five Forever, tries to answer. What is gleaned across these 13 songs is that surrounding yourself with cool people can only take you so far; at some point, you've gotta have something original to say, too.

Released on Zack Bia's Field Trip Recordings, which, of course it is, Five Forever finds Max trying out different trending styles like he's a character in GTA flipping through fits: He's Ken Carson on “Sevan, ” deep-voiced Carti on “Yacht,” Summrs on “Tank Davis.” None of it is remotely inspiring; none of it sticks to your brain. “Rockstar lifestyle, rockstar lifestyle, she tryna get drunk, she tryna get piped down,” he moans on “Rockstar,” lyrics you might find typed out by a fan in the YouTube comments of a Yeat type beat.

It's a shame, you'd think he'd learn a thing or two from hanging out with funny and inventive rappers like Lazer Dim 700, but this music hits like a slat of plywood. The subject matter is late nights at the club and the millions he's made off sitting in front of a computer, but he sounds totally uninterested in any of it. That can be cool if you're trying to flex how regular it is (see: Veeze or Jay-Z), but Max sounds more like he's falling asleep.

He's got a good ear for beats, but Max could tap into his network of producers even more. If we are to believe that streamers are supposed to be these larger-than-life entertainers, then their art should at least have some of that personality. Why isn't PlaqueBoyMax really leaning into the hardest, strangest beats coming out of the underground? He needs to take a page from the book of iShowSpeed, whose harebrained experiments with baile funk as a streamer-turned-rapper feel like a musical parallel to his fish-out-of-water international travels. The most fun this thing gets is the rambunctious bounce of “Paid For,” but, then again, how do you mess up a bounce track? Instead of channeling the spontaneity and creative bursts of his streams, Five Forever drifts into the miserable grey waters of music that you wouldn't turn off, but you would probably never turn on.

A few weeks ago, a 38-year-old Drake gave the commencement speech at the awards ceremony for Streamer University, Kai Cenat's wild idea to invite 150 up-and-coming streamers and influencers to a weekend of classes at the University of Akron taught by luminaries like Duke Dennis and others. “It's my belief that the individuals that attended this program and that are sitting watching this video are the next shift in media,” he said in a pre-recorded video, comparing their plight of being ridiculed to the reality TV stars of yore who now rule the world. If this is true, we might be in for a new overload of uncool, and a new generation of amorphous artist-streamer-entertainer “Guys,” characters in a constantly expanding online universe, whose main goal is to infiltrate your algorithm and capture your attention using every avenue possible. Now, kids everywhere are reaching for PlaqueBoyMax's faux-Opium schlock on Spotify as they might for a Feastables at Walmart for the simple fact that they trust content creators who burn holes into their retinas more than faceless corporations. What's ironic about that is you'd be hard-pressed to find a popular rap record more mind-numbingly anonymous this year.

Are Brooklyn's Purelink a boy band or a jam band? Well, they're neither; they're three former Chicagoans making ambient music in the Y2K-era clicks + cuts tradition, yet those faintly disingenuous tags actually say a lot about what sets them apart from their forebears. Guys like Oval, Pole, Jan Jelinek and Vladislav Delay carried themselves with modesty, reserve, and dry Northern European humor; they didn't seem like people you'd necessarily want to have a beer with. Purelink, meanwhile, are the kind of band you'd want to be in: three 30-year-olds with impeccable music taste and even better networking skills, driving south every year to link up with artists like Ulla and Huerco S. at Kansas City's C- parties.

This sense of eagerness and irrepressible youth, the kind you'd associate more with a sparky young rock band like Friko than three guys wired into their laptops, shines through on their second album, Faith. They're not interested in the unreadability and weirdness that led a lot of their predecessors to name their tracks after snippets of data and cryptic non-words. They prefer bright timbres and billowing chords rather than the spaciousness their forebears inherited from dub, cocooning the stereo field in midrange pad noise. The album caps at 38 minutes, far shorter than a CD-era sprawler.

A lot of this can be attributed to the simple fact that they're a band; there weren't a lot of those in the clicks + cuts era. The sunniness of their approach can also be attributed to the way they treat ambient music as something communal, rather than the solitary, private practice of many laptop scientists. While the only guest on their 2023 debut, Signs, was the cryptic J, Faith features a conspicuous appearance from Loraine James, whose voice imparts a whisper of spliffy trip-hop paranoia on “Rookie,” while on “First Iota,” poet Angelina Nonaj muses on beauty and artifice as guitars slash angrily across the space.

That Purelink are so good at replicating the precise sounds of the '90s and '00s only emphasizes what differentiates them from their inspirations. Huerco must have passed them some tricks of the trade, because no record since his own Railroad Blues EP in 2015 better reverse-engineers the pneumatic snaps Vladislav Delay perfected on his four-album 2000 run: a sound kind of like a methane bubble escaping an ice thaw, or someone smacking an exercise ball in a diving bell. “Kite Scene” undergirds its reluctant chord plucks with a schaffel beat, folding Wolfgang Voigt's glam-rock-enamored take on techno into their circle of influences.

For all the ways Faith dresses to impress, it's actually a gentler, more overtly ambient album than Signs. While the drums on that album were made of little tonsorial snaps and clicks, the drums here are slow and waterlogged, moving with lopsided grace on “Circle of Dust,” stirring the depths of the music and maintaining a passing link to the dancefloor without approaching anything resembling momentum. The four tracks without guests sound pretty similar to one another, all the tracks are between five and seven minutes, and the guest vocalists have a way of waking the listener up just when the music threatens to drift into the corners of the mind.

It's possible Purelink are too eager and genial to really throw themselves into the bizarre computer logic that drives this music at its best, at least at this stage in their career. But you can either pine for what's been lost in translation as these young producers mine Mille Plateaux classics that came out when they were preschoolers, or you can embrace the fact that music that sounds like this doesn't very often feel like this.

For better or worse, Garbage never became as big as Smashing Pumpkins. A decade removed from the goth tropes they adored, both bands scored a chart crossover at the same time. “1979” and “Stupid Girl” formed part of the scrim of 1996: beatwise, shrewd about electronic manipulations, lavishing hooks upon chewy hooks, and posting lyrics as vivid as graffiti. In 1998, as the Pumpkins' mass popularity plateaued, Garbage released Version 2.0, the Parallel Lines of the Y2K era, on which singer Shirley Manson and her male colleagues lustily pillaged genre after genre until their reconfigurations of saint, sinner, whore, and angel tropes gleamed anew. The Pumpkins may have collected the multi-platinum certs, but Version 2.0 made Adore, Billy Corgan & co.'s committed take on what we then called “electronica,” sound wan.

With both acts playing to their respective cults these days, it's worth pondering what a Garbage fan looks like in 2025—a '90s nostalgist? Herein lies the curse of being a second-tier act. An experiment begun as a diversion for Nirvana/Pumpkins producer Butch Vig and mates Duke Erickson and Steve Marker took off when their studio expertise meshed with Manson's talent for pastiche. During that pre-internet false dawn when the CD boom rekindled curiosity about bygone sounds, Garbage—energized by a well-chosen record collection—epitomized a savvy, smart present that few confused with the future. They had a sell-by date.

Nevertheless, they've kept on keeping on, still capable of impeccable assemblages of fuzz and melody, and their disgust at the rise of authoritarianism distinguishes them from their contemporaries. A series of incisive and gently brutal tracks on 2021's No Gods No Masters demonstrated that Garbage still had it. Slip “Godhead” and “The Creeps” on a playlist next to evergreens like “Supervixen” and “I Think I'm Paranoid” and no one will blink. By contrast, new album Let All That We Imagine Be the Light is as tentative as mid-period albums Bleed Like Me and Not Your Kind of People. Manson still sounds uncannily fierce and in command; the songs are rudderless, neither here nor there. A fabulous conceit in search of referents, “There's No Future in Optimism” sums up the problem. Those guitars-as-keyboards and vice versa still boast a processed vigor, but after sketching an apocalyptic party-like-it's-1999 scenario in the first verse, Manson has nothing else to say except to repeat “future love love future” as a hook.

The least a listener can expect from Let All That We Imagine Be the Light is a sharp mix. Vig, Marker, and Erickson, old pros, listen to modern music and get the levels right; no overcompression or thinness here. On the thunking “R U Happy Now ” the question of whether, say, Deep Sea Diver are on Manson's best-of-2025 playlist isn't irrelevant. She's not afraid to call out shit. “Make no mistake, friend, they hate your women/They love your children and they love their guns” is right on: Garbage understand that they have to spell out the obvious in perilous times. But other tracks are suggestions, or function as overtures for absent symphonies. The album's middle section (“Radical” and “Love to Give”) has identical minor-key progressions and first-draft lyrics.

That said, at least a third of the album summons the churn of yore, with callbacks to former triumphs that don't play like rewrites. “The Day That I Met God” pushes Manson into a plaintiveness that recalls Version 2.0's “You Look So Fine.” “Chinese Fire Hose” has the insouciance of “Empty” with Manson archly belting, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a fucking minute,” over slap bass—the kind of musical vulgarity the quartet has earned, three decades into a career. And the twangy riff on “Get Out My Face AKA Bad Kitty” is the foundation for one of those sparkling kiss-offs that's Garbage's specialty.

Of course, lower expectations help second-tier bands like Garbage. Their career arc since 2001's Beautiful Garbage suggests that wobbly songwriting is as much a tic as their masterful studio expertise. The cult still thrives, and we'll happily settle for Let All We Imagine Be the Light—until the next album.

Zohran K. Mamdani presents like a true man of the people. The 33-year-old Queens assemblyman frequently travels by Citi Bike, is unfailingly gregarious in encounters with his constituents, and, in March, showed up to the State Capitol to demand the release of Columbia graduate activist Mahmoud Khalil—still detained for his role in organizing the school's protests against the war in Gaza. But Mamdani wants to be the man of the people, and his eye is set on the highest office in the five boroughs: mayor of New York.

When Mamdani announced his run last October, he (and, frankly, anyone else without the last name Cuomo) was considered a dark horse in the race. But in just five months, his grassroots, social media–driven campaign—inspired by fellow young, internet-savvy progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Florida representative Maxwell Frost, and City Council member Chi Ossé—and affordability–driven messaging made him the first candidate to max out on public fundraising, with more individual donors than all of his primary competition combined. According to a recent Intelligencer profile, around 22,000 volunteers and counting have canvassed on behalf of Zohran for NYC, as Mamdani challenges to win the Democratic nomination.

“There's a lot of your life that you cannot live in the same way in the midst of a campaign of this scale,” Mamdani told me recently over the phone from Albany. “But music is one of the things that you can hold on to, because you can listen to it in the midst of doing something else.”

Mamdani has never found himself too far from the world of music. He volunteered for Ali Najmi's campaign for City Council, in 2015, after learning about the candidate from former Das Racist rapper Heems, and even pursued his own short-lived hip-hop career under the name Mr. Cardamom. Earlier this spring, Mamdani turned an MJ Lenderman concert at Brooklyn Steel into an impromptu rally, speaking about his policies and concerns for the city for several minutes.

Summarizing his platform to me, Mamdani said “It's about the fact that New Yorkers can't afford to live in the city they call home.” To that end, he recently pledged to increase governmental assistance to one-to-one small business programs by $20 million and slash fines for those same businesses in half, to “ensure that the places that make this city feel like home, the places that make our city so special, are the ones that continue to thrive here.” Mamdani and I spoke about living on a “permanent digital tape delay,” making Spotify Blend playlists with his wife, and the New York hip-hop classic that he believes is the perfect anthem for Primary Day, Tuesday, June 24.

A lot of the way I get around the city while I'm running for mayor is via Citi Bike, and this is a song that has been stuck on loop in my head for many, many months of the campaign. I was once actually singing along to it a little bit too loudly as I ran into a potential constituent. A major initiative we've been leading since the beginning of this campaign is making the slowest buses in the country fast and free, and getting around quickly is also at the core of that song, when Blake speaks about trading in the blue for the white bike.

I think many of us Citi Bikers can attest that when you have to actually get somewhere fast, there's no better way. Part of what connects Citi Biking with that same vision around buses and public transit in general is that if we want New Yorkers to use public transit, then we should incentivize it and ensure that it's not actually more expensive depending on what mode you use. And, right now, it can be prohibitively expensive to use a Citi Bike to get somewhere, which I've found myself a number of times, where you can see a cost going past $10 because you missed a train and the only way to get there as quickly as possible is by bike—yet it was costing you more than three times the amount.

So I live on a permanent digital tape delay, which is how I describe watching Instagram Reels instead of TikTok, and that's how I found this song. Unlike most people who hear a song in that matter, I then went and added it to my playlist and now know many of the words.

It's a song where one of the lines is “I know there's an email that hopes to find me well/Well, I hope it don't find me.” And it is a song that I identify with, especially as this race intensifies: just how many emails and text messages I'm currently behind on, dreaming every night as I go to bed of “inbox zero” and waking up to “inbox a thousand.” I try to go through as close as I can to 50-100 text messages each day, but the thing about sending one is you might get another one back.

A classic. It has some hints of Indian representation with the shoutouts to Slumdog Millionaire, and it's indicative of what you have to do with the campaign—just keep your head above water.

I think Kendrick absolutely destroyed him. It's a real testament to message discipline over many songs, and it's an inspiration for me as a politician to always stay on my message. I'm trying to do what Kendrick did in the course of that beef, but, specifically, around affordability. At every juncture, he would bring it back to his central points, and I think that's the key, is that you keep coming back to what your core message is. For me, it's about the fact that New Yorkers can't afford to live in the city they call home.

This song brings me back to the little Arabic I've been able to retain, because the opening is just her counting from one to 10. It reminds me of how much work I have to do to get back to some kind of conversational fluency. I studied Arabic in college and was at one point conversational, but that has, sadly, left me in the years since.

I think there's a lot of your life that you cannot live in the same way in the midst of a campaign of this scale, but music is one of the things you can hold on to because you can listen to it in the midst of doing something else—walking to the train, getting on the bus. Even in the morning, just as I'm getting ready, my wife and I will listen to a number of Indian songs that are sometimes classical, sometimes a little more lo-fi, and then as I get out of the house, it tends to go into a lot of rap and hip-hop and also a heavy dose of nostalgia for the 2010s.

I remember when we first met, my wife and I did one of those blended Spotify playlists, and it was really embarrassing, because all of her songs were these lovely beautifully curated songs, even though it was algorithmically generated. It just felt very thoughtful and intentional, and all of mine were, like, “Love in this Club,” by Usher featuring Young Jeezy.

Speaks for itself. Never has a song been made specifically about June 24 until this.

Talking Heads are celebrating their 50th anniversary by releasing the first-ever video for “Psycho Killer.” The band enlisted the great Mike Mills to direct, with Saoirse Ronan starring as an office worker who dances, squirms, shudders, and screams through her daily routine. “This video makes the song better,” the band said in a press release. “We LOVE what this video is NOT—it's not literal, creepy, bloody, physically violent or obvious.” Watch it below, and stay tuned for Talking Heads' ongoing celebrations of the 50 years since their formation.

Mills, who previously directed the National's I Am Easy to Find short film, said Talking Heads' debut album, Talking Heads: 77, “literally changed what was possible in life for me.” He went on, “To get to play with the subversive, uncategorizable beauty of Talking Heads, and to play with Saoirse who brought so much surprise, power, vulnerability and mischief to the party, it's one of the best things I ever got to be a part of—still can't believe it actually happened.”

Ronan added, “To simply be mentioned in the same breath as Talking Heads is hands down one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me, let alone making a video with the singular Mike Mills to accompany one of their most iconic songs—‘Psycho Killer.' I have grown up listening to their music, so this truly is a childhood/teenage/lifelong dream come true. Mike, myself and the rest of the creative team had so much fun making this, and I can't wait for Talking Heads fans to see it!”

							By 

	Waiss Aramesh



Fletcher has a few revelations to make. In fact, the singer born Cari Elise Fletcher has 11 of them, manifested as tracks on her third studio album, Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me?, out July 18. All 11 songs are secrets spilled in one form or another; some of them might shock even the most fervent of Fletcher fans. Still, they are stories she had to tell. 


	On the album's intro, “Party,” Fletcher sings about how she's not the chaotic, drama-fueled pop star who taunted her ex's new girlfriend on the viral 2022 hit “Becky's So Hot.” “I'd love to let you love me/Cause I'm that kind of whore/Who needed the attention/I don't need anymore/It's not that kind of party,” she sings.


	So what kind of party is it? “Maybe the kind of party where I have a chill, more intimate heart-to-heart with close friends,” Fletcher tells Rolling Stone in a new interview. “And revealing some really vulnerable shit.” In a note to fans announcing her new project, the singer calls Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me? “both an open wound and an act of liberation.”

	











	On the single “Boy,” released today, she shares something even more personal: “I kissed a boy,” she sings. “And I know it's not what you wanted to hear/And it wasn't on your bingo card this year/Well it wasn't on mine/I fell in love.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Fletcher has long emphasized her sexual fluidity, and she has many queer fans; the relationships that she's sung about have, until now, exclusively been with women. “There will be people that feel disappointed and feel confused and have questions,” Fletcher tells RS. “Girl, I had questions and I was confused too. It shocked me just as much as anybody else.”

	











	Of course, who a person chooses to date and how that person identifies across the gender spectrum doesn't negate anyone's queerness. “I am so proud to be queer,” Fletcher continues. “That is not something that has ever wavered or changed. Being queer for me is this lens that I get to view life through.” She knows not everyone will understand what she's sharing, but she's seemingly found peace with that in the name of being unabashedly herself.

	Fletcher tells Rolling Stone that the flood of emotions that informed her new album happened around late 2024 and early 2025, after her last tour. When asked whether she and the muse behind “Boy” are still together, she doesn't answer directly, but makes it known that she's in a great place. “I am getting to experience love again,” she says. “That is the most magical feeling in the entire world. I met a boy who is somehow way more connected to his feelings and his emotions and his heart than even I am.”


Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me? is a candid retrospective of the singer's twenties, navigating love in all its forms, and thinking about fame. On “Hi, Everyone Leave Please,” Fletcher questions why she's not getting more radio play despite selling out Radio City Music Hall (“Kinda bruises my ego”). She says it's her favorite song on the new project.


	During our conversation, Fletcher takes a few emotional pauses while chatting about identity, her support system, the new album, and feeling like Cari was getting lost in her larger Fletcher persona.


What message did you want to send with “Boy”?I was in the studio with [songwriters] Jen Decilveo and Shane McAnally. We were all discussing our queer journeys. I really wanted to capture and talk about what was happening in mine. I had met a boy and started feeling romantic and emotional feelings, and we kissed. I was like, “What the fuck is going on?” My whole world felt flipped upside down. I've always written about my love stories and my heart and very candidly written about what I've been experiencing. “Boy” is just another love story. ”Boy” is just one revelation of many. It's not an album about a guy.

	I think I became known for this chaos and this toxicity and bitterness and sapphic drama, and then I started having different experiences in my personal life. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease [in early 2023] and went through a really intense healing journey, which allowed me to pause. I started having so many questions about my career and my purpose. I think through allowing myself to ask those deeper questions about this fixed dream I thought I would always be chasing, my heart opened in a way I wasn't expecting, and I fell in love with a boy.

	











What exactly was that “fixed dream”?Just the childhood dream of being the biggest pop star in the world. Being an artist that gets to stand up on a stage and share my heart and my feelings with the world…. And I've gotten to achieve that in so many ways. When I started going through all the things I was going through last year, I started to question … if I wasn't singing about creating all this chaos and drama in my life, would anybody want to hear from me? Would anybody still be there, would anybody still love me if they really knew me now?


Have the assumptions people made up until this point about you bothered you?I think people have experienced me as what I've shared with them, you know? All of my romantic relationships over the last 10 years have been with women. And it's what I've written my music about. Through this larger-than-life character that Fletcher became, I feel like there wasn't a lot of room for the parts of me that weren't wild and crazy and aching. There were other parts of me that, as I've gone through this healing journey, I've felt haven't been fully brought to life. I'm a queer woman. I've always been queer. I will always be queer. My identity is not shifting and it's not changing. My community is not changing. But I've had these new experiences that I wanted to let people in on and give them a chance to know me now. 


How gradually did your life change? When we talked early last year, you had already become more measured with certain things. A water between each margarita, that type of thing.I think it's been gradual. I had so many different eras throughout my career. In between all of them, there was love, but there was also my toxic “Becky's So Hot” era. Then there was [In Search of the Antidote] and going on this deeper health journey and learning so much about myself. I feel like it's been gradual, but…. My last tour was just so hard for me. It was really painful for me. I thought that people didn't know the most current version of me. I thought that Cari was getting lost in this larger persona.


Is there any part of you that is scared of how people are going to react to a song like “Boy”?Oh my gosh, yeah. I'm terrified. It's so scary to share your truth, you know. My career launched with a song called “Wasted Youth” in my early twenties about falling in love with a girl. Here I am, 10 years later at the start of my thirties, with a song about falling in love with a boy. Through this entire time, all I've expressed…. My deepest desire for people was for them to boldly and unapologetically be themselves. And I have to walk that walk. If that's what I've been preaching to my fans who I love so much this whole time, then I have to give myself that same grace. Otherwise, what the fuck is the point?

	











	I understand that my love life is not the most important thing in global news in the world, especially within the queer community. Trans people's existence right now is being threatened, and their rights are being threatened at every angle. There's a lot more important things to put attention and energy and love to. But at the same time, even through the fear that I have, the commitment to being myself no matter what is where my heart will always lay. It's my north star that I have to just run towards.


Has your thinking on your identity shifted at all?I'm so proud to be queer. That's not something that's shifted. There's so many other components to me, aside from my queerness. I'm so fortunate to even be lifted up by the community the way that I have been all of these years. I'm a queer woman, that's not changing…. I'm so lucky I've gotten to experience so much magic in this life because of my openness and my curiosity. For me it's always been this living, breathing expression. It doesn't shift or evolve for everyone. But for me, it's always been this living, breathing thing. 


What kind of support system are you leaning on these days?I have my family and my friends who love me so much, and I have people who love on me through every single season. I know there will be people that feel however they're going to feel. That's OK. I'm OK with that. I could have buried this song somewhere in the soundtrack in the larger context of this album. I chose to lead with it first. That's because I knew that it was something that my fans, and the people who have supported me all these years, would care about. I didn't want there to be any veil between me and my truth. It's something that I'm willing to talk about. I have cycled through every emotion through the making of this album. I have cycled through tears, and grief, and guilt, and shame, and fear, and excitement and joy. It is an embodiment of the human experience.

Are there other revelations on this album that you hope fans pay attention to?My biggest hope is for everybody to be free to be themselves and to love themselves and to express themselves. It's scary to share new discoveries about yourself. This album, and “Boy,” is really a permission slip for me to be myself. And for me to love and express myself. I just want it to be a permission slip, you know. I'm stepping into this bravery even if I'm scared, in hopes that other people are able to do that in their own lives. Whatever evolution in your life, whatever doesn't fill your cup anymore — a relationship, or a job, or some version of you that evolved and wants to come through. Fuck it. Life is way too fucking short. Truly. To do anything else. At the end of the day, even if everybody hated me, I'm still myself.

	











If you knew how everything would play out — who you would meet last year — would you do anything differently?No. There's nothing that I would rewrite. There's nothing that I would change about any of my journey. I love all of the women that I have been and the woman that I am becoming. I would never rewrite history. It all happened exactly the way that it was meant to. I celebrate it all.

	The first public glimpse of Lil Wayne's upcoming Tha Carter VI album will be heard on ESPN. “The Days,” a collaboration between the iconic rapper (and May Rolling Stone cover star) and U2's Bono, is the theme song of the NBA Finals' promotional ad for the first day of the championship series between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. The network has previously played his “I Am Not a Human Being,” “Uproar,” and ‘Glory” tracks in the playoffs.


	In the NBA Finals ad, highlights of both teams are interspersed with Wayne rapping bars like, “live to fight another day if yesterday beat me, cause I ain't gettin' younger, but I'm gettin' better” while Bono sings, “these are the days.”


	“Basketball's been in my blood since day one, so to team up with ESPN less than 24 hours before the drop of Tha Carter VI for the NBA Finals is an incredible honor,” Wayne, who just announced a North American tour, says about the campaign. “My music and the NBA are vibin' on the same frequency because it's perfect timing for fans to hear Tha Carter VI on the game's grandest stage.” The campaign is yet another intersection of sports and music for the avid sports fan and co-founder of Young Money APAA Sports Agency, which represents several NBA players.

Tha Carter VI is Wayne's 14th studio album, and the first since 2023's Welcome 2 ColleGrove with 2 Chainz. Wayne played Rolling Stone songs from the project in January, including “The Days,” an introspective track where he reflects on his life and times. He told Rolling Stone that the project is collaboration-oriented, noting, “If there's one thing about this album that's different, it's me approaching it like, ‘Man, what would I sound like on something with such and such.'” He'll be celebrating Tha Carter VI's launch with the ESPN campaign as well as his first headlining concert at Madison Square Garden on Friday, the album's release date. 

	











	“Lil Wayne brings the energy, edge, and emotion that define the NBA Finals,” said Curtis Friends, Vice President of Sports Marketing at ESPN. “Integrating his music into our NBA Playoffs coverage has been a strategic brand flex – amplifying our storytelling and connecting with fans as we showcase today's rising stars on the league's biggest stage.”

	Inside a cavernous, neon-lit ballroom in the bowels of a joyless Washington D.C. hotel, Carly Simon blasts from the speakers in an effort drown out the chants of “Free, Free Palestine” from protesters who've crashed a conversation with Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) — the gay, Black, self-described Zionist representing one of the most Democratic districts in the country. 


	Liam Kerr, co-founder of the centrist-supporting political action committee Welcome PAC — decked out in a West Virginia Mountaineers jersey with senator-turned-lobbyist Joe Manchin's name emblazoned across his back — bodies out a bespectacled, man-bunned individual trying to film the scuffle. It would have been a particularly crude piece of performance art depicting the Democratic Party in its present incarnation, but unfortunately, it was real.


	Organizers of WelcomeFest, an event billed as “the largest public gathering of centrist Democrats,” were expecting disruptions when they convened in D.C. on Thursday — you could even say they welcomed them. Earlier that day, as Kerr kicked off the festivities, he drew a contrast between his own apparel and a t-shirt he told the crowd organizers had on hand for any protesters who might show up. The tee featured a depiction of Babydog, the beloved bulldog belonging to Jim Justice, the West Virginia Republican who replaced Manchin in the U.S. Senate this year, and his slogan, “Delivering Justice for West Virginia.”

	











	“I am wearing a jersey of someone who stepped on the West Virginia campus 50 years ago on a football scholarship, who is the number one-rated ‘Wins Above Replacement' candidate,” Kerr told the crowd of his Manchin jersey. (Wins Above Replacement, or WAR, is a sports statistic that measures a certain player's contributions to their team. More on that later.)  The Justice t-shirt was meant to send a message to progressive-minded: If you're not with us, you're against us. Or, as Kerr put it even more bluntly, “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin.”

	Manchin's dark money group, Americans Together, was, incidentally, one of the sponsors of the event.


	Over the course of the afternoon, speakers at WelcomeFest offered their diagnosis for what ails the Democratic Party, which might be summed up as: too much democracy. Too many people making too many demands of their elected representatives. 


	Onstage, speakers used the shorthand “The Groups” when discussing this phenomenon. Speaker after speaker blamed “The Groups” for Democrats' failure to win elections and to govern effectively when they did win them. (Names of the specific Groups in question were rarely invoked on stage, but a recent New York Times op-ed by one of the day's speakers, Democratic operative Adam Jentleson, called out the American Civil Liberties Union, the Sunrise Movement, the Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats as some of the culprits responsible, in his view, for browbeating Democratic candidates into adopting positions in primaries that Republicans could weaponize against them in a general election.)


	The blogger Matthew Yglesias flogged this thesis most aggressively in his presentation. To illustrate his point that “Bad Groups create bad incentives for Democrats,” Yglesias pointed to Democrats' outspoken opposition to a Maryland man was illegally renditioned to a Central American supermax prison by accident — some even traveled to El Salvador to seek Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release and return to the U.S. 


	Besides this being the only moral position one can take on the question of whether the government should be allowed to extrajudicially seize individuals, ship them off to a foreign jail, and refuse to bring them back when ordered by the courts, Yglesias appears to be wrong about this being a politically dangerous position for Democrats to stake out: Media coverage of this case, kept alive by Democrats who continued to raise awareness about it, damaged Donald Trump's image, pollster G. Elliott Morris points out. Approval for Trump's immigration agenda nosedived during the height of the furor over Abrego Garcia's wrongful seizure.

	While speakers at WelcomeFest generally seemed to agree The Groups' influence was to blame for Democrats' failures, no one seemed to offer much in the way of a contrasting vision for what the party's orienting principle ought to be going forward. Abundance, the airport book that some Dems appear determined to adopt as a policy platform, got only brief attention at the WelcomeFest. Instead of a mission or any one overarching vision, there only seemed to be consensus on the fact that Democrats need to start winning again, by whatever means necessary. 

	











	The political analyst Lakshya Jain urged reorienting party recruitment efforts to focus on candidates with high “Wins Above Replacement” statistics. The concept will be familiar to anyone who has read Moneyball, Michael Lewis' book about how the Oakland A's used sabermetrics to identify and recruit undervalued players. Jain's model compares a generic match-up in a particular district with the actual results in an effort to evaluate who overperformed or underperformed expectations for their particular race. 


	To illustrate this point, Jain compared the results of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's race with that of Janelle Stelson, a candidate who ran in Pennsylvania's 10th district. In his model, AOC, who won her race and outperformed Kamala Harris by six points, underperformed a generic race in her district by two points; Stelson, who lost by one point and outran Harris by four points, overperformed a generic Democrat by nine points. 


	Jain's pitch was that, in the current political environment, which he says is D+6, Democrats have a real opportunity to seize legislative majorities if they focus their efforts on recruiting candidates with high WAR scores — the catch is that these candidates might be unpalatable to The Groups and other party faithful. 


	“Being very blunt, if we run candidates that D.C. finds appealing, we're probably going to lose. There is an inverse correlation between what you guys all find appealing and what the median voter finds appealing,” Jain told the room. 


	He brought up Blue Dog Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), who spoke on a panel with Yglesias and Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) and Adam Gray (D-Calif.).


	“A lot of you may say you find some of Jared Golden's votes to be annoying for a Democrat,” Jain said. “Well, guess what? The choice isn't between Jared Golden and AOC. The choice is between Jared Golden and Paul LePage. So who would you rather have?”


	It was an echo of Kerr's opening remarks — “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin” — and it's a real question that gets at the heart of Democrats' present predicament. 


	Do Democrats — or Americans writ large — need more candidates in the mold of Joe Manchin, the man single-handedly responsible for torpedoing Democrats' expanded child tax credit, a program that had lifted 2.1 million children out of poverty?

	Unappealing as the choice is, there's also a high probability that it is a false binary too: Jain claimed in his presentation, “The base will vote for you anyway… Don't worry about liberal defections.” 

	











	But if the results of the 2024 election have indicated anything, it's that attitude — the attitude that was also adopted by the Harris campaign — is a losing one: We know that demoralized Democratic-leaning voters who stayed home decided the election.

	Legendary producer Timbaland has taken his fervent embrace of AI music production to a new level, launching a new AI entertainment company, Stage Zero — and an AI-generated “artist,” TaTa, who will be dropping a debut single soon. Timbaland, who co-founded the company with his current creative partner, Zayd Portillo, and film producer Rocky Mudaliar, tells Rolling Stone he's had the idea for the venture since he began making music with the generative AI platform Suno last year.  ”I saw the path,” he says, “but I had to wait till everything caught up.”


	TaTa is intended to be the first of many personas launched by the company, and the co-founders have dreams of the characters becoming virtual influencers and even starring in movies and TV shows.  ”Ultimately what Tim's here to do is to pioneer a new genre of music — A-pop, artificial pop,” says Mudaliar, who originally met with Timbaland to discuss a documentary on his career. TaTa will maintain a social media presence, with music videos generated by various AI video tools.  

	











	TaTa and other potential artists from the company will have their music created via a collaborative process between human creators and the AI music platform Suno. (Timbaland is a creative advisor to that company, but Stage Zero is entirely independent of Suno.)  Timbaland and Portillo have developed a workflow where they upload Timbaland demos created by conventional means to the platform, have Suno extrapolate upon them, and then insert human-written lyrics. TaTa's voice first appeared a Suno generation that caught Timbaland's ear: “It came to a point where I'm like, ‘Yo, this voice, it's  amazing,'” the producer says.  He's able to capture and reuse that specific voice via the platform's Personas feature, introduced last October.

	“We have these stacks of music that needed to be finished,” Portillo says. “And then it just so happened that the TaTa ones were just getting finished faster. There was just something about those songs that were just like. ‘Man, this just flows.'”

	Stage Zero arrives as the music industry and artists continue to wage legal and cultural war against AI music tools. Major labels have filed massive lawsuits against Suno and competitor Udio over their use of copyrighted material in training data, although recent reports suggest settlement talks are under way.   Artists including Billie Eilish and Stevie Wonder have signed open letters denouncing AI as a threat to human creativity. 


	Timbaland and Portillo have suggested the backlash will die down, and Mudaliar agrees.  ”It's gonna be a bit of a battle,” he says, “but it's not going anywhere…. We were thinking about the example of the influencer itself and how ridiculous that might've sounded 10 years ago, where we're like, ‘Nah, there's no way YouTubers can be bigger than actors.' And now they're the biggest stars in the world.”

Donald Trump took his war on immigrants up a notch on Wednesday night, issuing an executive order barring nationals from 12 different countries from entering the United States, and another denying visas to any foreign students trying to enter the U.S. to attend Harvard University.


	The president posted a video to Truth Social on Wednesday explaining the travel ban, asserting that the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, has “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who have come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas.”


	“We don't want them,” Trump said, noting that there are “millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country.”


	The attack in Boulder was carried out by an Egyptian national who the administration says overstayed their visa. Egypt is not mentioned in the executive order.


	The travel ban affects Afghanistan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The order cites “national security and the national interests” of the nation, as well as the need to protect America from “foreign terrorists.” Trump is also partially restricting the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

	











	Trump attempted to impose travel bans during his first term in office, but they were blocked by the courts. He vowed in the run-up to his run to take back the White House that he would bring a travel ban back “even bigger and much stronger than before.”

	











	Trump has also ratcheted up his war on the nation's most prestigious higher-education institution, signing an order barring foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard. The order, titled, “Enhancing National Security by Addressing Risks at Harvard University,” deems that Harvard is “no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.”

	The administration has been doing everything it can to hamstring the university — including freezing billions in federal grants — alleging that it hasn't done enough to crack down on antisemitism as students have protested the war in Gaza. Harvard has fought back, most recently in a lawsuit last week over the administration's move to restrict the school from enrolling international students. A federal judge quickly blocked the effort.

	The school did not take kindly to Trump's order on Wednesday night, either. “This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights,” a spokesperson for the school said in a statement. “Harvard will continue to protect its international students.” 


	Harvard has shown it is willing to take Trump to court over the administration's actions. The courts have been mixed on the president's immigration agenda, although multiple federal judges have blocked the push to deport immigrants without due process. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the administration can revoke the temporary protected status of over 500,000 immigrants, making them subject to deportation.

In 2019, I walked away from my dream job, as editor-in-chief of Deadspin, three months after a private equity firm bought our parent company. Our new CEO seemed categorically uninterested in the work we did, what made us successful, or even what we could improve; he just wanted to issue often nonsensical directives. Three months after I left, the rest of the staff followed me out the door. Our loyal readership evaporated overnight. Deadspin is now run by a Maltese gambling company that uses the site to drive traffic to online casinos.


The experience made me obsessed with how private equity works, and why their deals so often go wrong. My book  Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream [out June 10] follows four protagonists whose lives were upended by private equity involvement in the retail, housing, local media, and heath care industries.


	BEFORE SHE MOVED HOME TO SOUTH TEXAS, NATALIA CONTRERAS kept two sticky notes tacked to the bathroom mirror of her rental apartment in Austin. Written in her own neat script in thick black marker, the three-by-three squares drew her attention every time she washed her hands or applied her makeup. “You have more power than you realize!” announced a fluorescent green note. Just below and to the right, a neon pink one carried a more specific message: “News organizations need people like you!”

	As a kid, Natalia didn't dream of being a journalist, but looking back, she can see how it happened. She's thrilled to talk to new people for as long as they'll let her, the type of person who answers a question with a twenty-minute story peppered with expletives and colorful descriptions. She's endlessly curious about the world, about why everything from America's voting system to her favorite local Mexican restaurant works the way it does. With long straight black hair parted to the side, a Cindy Crawford– esque birthmark just beneath her mouth, and perfect eye makeup, she exudes glamour, but her wide smile makes her easy to talk to.

	Natalia was born in 1989 in Tampico, a midsize city three hundred miles from the U.S. in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Her parents divorced before she was out of diapers, and she never had any siblings. As far back as she can remember, it was always just her and her mom, Luz, at home. Luz was a teacher, and to make ends meet, she worked multiple shifts: she would drop Natalia off at private school early in the morning, then continue on to her first job of the day. In the afternoon, Luz would teach at a second school, while Natalia would take a school van to her grandparents' house and stay there during her mom's afternoon and evening classes. 


	Every day, Natalia's grandfather read the afternoon newspaper as soon as it was delivered, and both grandparents watched the news on TV. Natalia wasn't especially interested in the coverage; it was always something “terrible, terrible, terrible,” she remembered. Her cousins, who lived nearby, sometimes came over to play, but mostly she was on her own for hours, watching cartoons in the bedroom or talking to her friends on the phone until her mom picked her up at 8 or 9 p.m. 


	Natalia didn't like school much — she thinks in part because she had undiagnosed attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. She realized later that she actually liked reading, but her school didn't assign novels, just boring textbooks. And she constantly got in trouble in class for talking. In elementary school, she remembered, a teacher said, “Natalia, I never see your face; I only see the back of your head.” “And it was true!” Natalia said, laughing. 


	Saturday brought time with her mom. Natalia and Luz would pick a restaurant for breakfast. On the way, they would stop at a newsstand, where Luz— ever the teacher— would instruct Natalia to pick out something, anything, to read. As they ate, Luz would read the newspaper while Natalia flipped through a magazine about beauty or celebrity gossip. Then they'd go hang out at the beach or see a Julia Roberts romcom dubbed into Spanish. When possible, they'd sneak into a second movie afterward; for years, Natalia had only seen the last scene of Bridget Jones's Diary, the one where Renée Zellweger sprints through the snow in her tiger-print underwear to find Colin Firth, then makes out with him in the street.

	When Natalia was in middle school, her life flipped upside down. Through a friend, her mom met a man from Corpus Christi, a Gulf town in Texas. Within a few months Luz was making plans to move with Natalia to the U.S., a country Natalia had never even visited. She was in seventh grade, with a close-knit group of friends and crushes on boys. Moving 450 miles away, to a country whose primary language she didn't speak, felt unfathomable. But she was excited too. Her wealthier cousins had passports, and they frequently crossed the border to shop, go to Six Flags, and eat at Mr Gatti's— a place Natalia describes as “like Chuck E. Cheese, but better.” She figured her school would look just like the one in Saved by the Bell, a show she loved. Plus, Selena was her favorite singer, and Corpus Christi was Selena's hometown. 

	











	When Natalia arrived in Texas at the beginning of eighth grade, her mom and new stepdad wanted her to go to Baker, a highly regarded middle school that also happened to be just down the street from their house. But Baker offered no resources for students who didn't speak English, and the counselor pointed out, correctly, that Natalia didn't. The counselor suggested she go to Martin, which was all the way across town, in a building that seemed dark and scary. She and Luz said no, she'd pick up English on her own as a Baker student. 


	School had never come easily to Natalia, even in her first language, but her new English teacher, Ms. Guerra, refused to let her skate by. One day, the teacher kept her after school to rework an assignment. They sat side by side in the library, the teacher explaining the work over and over until Natalia understood. Ms. Guerra also always made sure to tell people “Natalia is bilingual,” never “she doesn't speak English.” That made Natalia feel special, like speaking another language was a superpower instead of a disability. 


	There were a lot of Latino students at Baker, but Natalia learned the hard way that few of them spoke anything close to fluent Spanish. She'd try to talk to them and they'd look at her blankly; they'd try to talk to her and she'd do the same. But she was an extrovert, so she had no choice but to figure it out. One day, a girl asked to borrow Natalia's pencil. That taught her how to ask to borrow something, and it gave her an opening to befriend the girl. Another girl never seemed to say anything, which struck Natalia as strange because she literally always had something to say. She decided to find out why. It turned out the girl was just shy, but Natalia's investigation made them friends too. “At the time, all I could do was observe and try to figure out what was going on,” Natalia said. She didn't realize it at the time, but later, it seemed obvious: she was teaching herself how to be a journalist. 


	Natalia realized as an adult that there was another reason she was destined for a life as a reporter: before she was born, both her parents had been journalists. They met in the newsroom of a newspaper called El Heraldo— Luz was a reporter for the society pages, Natalia's dad a cartoonist and illustrator. There were three newspapers in Tampico at the time, but El Heraldo was the most important, a progressive trailblazer with a storied history of advocating for workers and peasants and providing much of the best coverage of the Mexican Revolution. 

	











	In July 1981, eight years before Natalia was born, El Heraldo's staff went on strike, demanding better wages and benefits. Low pay was a chronic problem for newspaper reporters in Mexico, and the journalists' union believed El Heraldo was making plenty of money that it should be sharing with its reporters, so they occupied the building, blocking its owners from entering. The owners refused to negotiate, and the workers were locked out of their jobs permanently. The newspaper never published again. So Luz became a teacher. 


	Back in Mexico, when Luz would drive by the abandoned, graffiti-covered El Heraldo building, she would tell her daughter stories about the strike. Natalia took note of a key detail: years later, long after Luz had left journalism behind, a judge ruled that the newspaper's owners owed every member of the union back pay. Luz won a decently sized payout. Natalia never forgot that story. 


	NATALIA HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED DRAWING and painting, so she thought she might try to become an artist like her biological father. During her senior year in high school, she joined the yearbook staff and developed an interest in photography. But she also discovered that she loved interviewing members of student clubs; after years of getting in trouble in school for talking instead of doing her work, she almost couldn't believe that now teachers wanted her to go ask her classmates questions. 


	After graduation, Natalia enrolled at Del Mar, the local community college in Corpus Christi. She knew she needed to sign up for intro English and math classes to be able to transfer to a four-year school, but she wasn't prepared when the registrar asked her what kind of degree she wanted to earn. She said she liked art and photography, but Luz, who had accompanied her to the appointment, pointed out that she also loved to write. The registrar offered a suggestion: “There's a newspaper here if you want to do that.” Suddenly, that idea seemed perfect. She was directed to the journalism department, where she signed up for the intro-level class in news writing as well as the staff of the student newspaper, the Foghorn News. 


	Both the class and the newspaper were overseen by a professor named Robert Muilenburg, who taught Natalia how to report and how to structure a news article. But he also preached a more fundamental lesson: being a journalist, Muilenburg explained, is not just about talking to people, but about closely following current events. Natalia had never picked up on her family's habit of reading and watching the news every day, but now she wanted to know everything that was happening in the world. “If I didn't know it, I was like, ‘Fuck, I feel stupid that I don't know.' ” That's how she started reading the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. That's how she started to think, for the first time, about a career as a reporter.

	











	IN 2008, THE YEAR NATALIA started at Del Mar, there was plenty of news to follow. The world was mired in the second year of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Congress passed the historic bank bailout during her first semester. A month later, Barack Obama was elected president. 


	The newspaper industry was also in the midst of upheaval. Advertising revenue plummeted during the recession, nearly 30 percent across the industry in the first quarter of 2009. That led to layoffs in newsrooms across the country. In 2009, the Baltimore Sun laid off 61 employees, nearly a third of its newsroom; the parent company of Time, Fortune, and Sports Illustrated cut around 540, a year after cutting around 600. The Los Angeles Times laid off 300 and folded its state news section. In a single week in June 2008, roughly 900 people at nine newspapers were informed their jobs would disappear. Even the vaunted New York Times announced it would “trim” 100 jobs in 2008 and another 100 in 2009. Swaths of journalists a few years older than Natalia, the ones just starting their media careers, were driven out of the industry for good. 


	But the Great Recession didn't create newspapers' financial crisis. Media industry leaders had done that to themselves. 


	Long before the internet glimmered to life, even medium-sized towns were home to as many as half a dozen newspapers. Each charged as little as possible so they could boast they had the most readers— even if the low price of those subscriptions didn't cover the cost of getting the paper to people. The real money came from advertisers, and advertisers liked lots of subscribers. 


	Many economists and other experts, including those affiliated with the United Nations, consider journalism a “public good.” In technical terms, that means it is both “nonexcludable” and “nonrivalrous”: many people can access it at once, and consumers don't need to pay in order to benefit from it. In other words, news spreads. Even if you don't pay for the New York Times, for example, information from its biggest stories will be aggregated and reprinted in numerous free outlets, and discussed in coffee shops and around the dinner table, not kept secret from everyone who fails to subscribe. 


	Because public goods are expected to serve the public interest, they are often funded by taxes. In the United States and many other democracies that guarantee an independent press, journalism is a striking exception. While public television and radio are partially taxpayer-funded, the vast majority of American publications and broadcast outlets are owned by for-profit companies. Media is almost singular among public goods for how it must grapple with competing notions of value: worth to the community versus worth to profit-minded executives. 

	











	That anomaly has always made journalists vulnerable to owners looking to maximize shareholder value. But for most of U.S. history, their goals were more or less aligned. As Warren Buffett, who once owned more than two dozen newspapers, put it, they were the “ultimate bulletproof franchise”: everybody read their local newspaper in part because it had ads for every local business, and it had every ad because everybody read it. For much of the 20th Century, running a profitable newspaper barely required any strategy, Buffett said— the perfect place to stash an “idiot nephew” in need of a cushy job. 


	In the early 1900s, there were newspapers for every type of person: morning versus evening delivery, conservative versus liberal editorial pages, sensationalist versus straight-down-the-middle sensibilities, stories and ads targeting factory workers versus bankers and lawyers. In the first decade of her journalism career, Natalia would work at three papers— the Caller-Times, the Indianapolis Star, and the Austin American-Statesman— all of which once had competition in their hometowns. By 1999, when the evening Indianapolis News stopped publishing, none of them did. That made those three newsrooms typical. By the start of the 21st century, just 1.4 percent of U.S. cities had multiple local newspapers. 


	That shift proved lucrative for newspaper owners in the short term. Suddenly each surviving newsroom had sole control over its market. Between 1975 and 1990, ad rates jumped 253 percent, nearly twice as much as inflation. As recently as the early 2000s, this rapid growth created fears that newspapers could grow too powerful. When the Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News agreed to centralize their printing and commercial operations in 2001—while continuing to operate separate newsrooms, preserving Denver's status as the rare two-newspaper town for another eight years — then– attorney general Janet Reno had to approve an exemption to antimonopoly regulations. 


	Looking back, the idea that two newspapers sharing a printing press could violate antitrust laws is laughably quaint. The following decade showed that the concept of a newspaper holding a monopoly was a castle in the sky. In rapid succession, Craigslist took over the classified ads market; print advertising revenue fell off a cliff; readers became accustomed to getting journalism free online and stopped paying for print subscriptions; local TV news stations expanded their web coverage to go head-to-head with daily papers; Google and Facebook gained control over outlets' readership and local ad markets; owners began cutting back on true local news in favor of cheaper syndicated coverage; and the advent of ad-targeting technology undercut the prices publications could charge. The vast majority of American newspapers might have been the only one in their respective towns, but they didn't hold monopolies either as news purveyors or places to buy ads. 

	











	Traditional journalism business models were becoming difficult to sustain, in large part because executives were unable to catch up to, or keep up with, the changing world. Publishers failed to anticipate the downturn in the ad market, failed to adapt to the rise of the internet, failed to protect themselves against social media devouring their market, failed to develop a strategy for online subscriptions. They failed to take advantage of their status as one of the few types of court-endorsed monopolies. Long before Natalia dreamed of a career in journalism— long before she was born— newspaper executives' blind spots were creating the conditions that would usher private equity firms through the doors. 


	BY THE TIME SHE BEGAN reporting stories for the Foghorn News in late 2008, Natalia knew the media industry was in trouble. Her professors talked about the financial challenges newspapers were experiencing, and the dwindling number of jobs. But Natalia had discovered she loved reporting more than anything she had ever done, and she couldn't imagine doing anything else. She wasn't going to be talked out of a career in journalism. 


	She was also committed to improving her skills, no matter how much hard work it took. Muilenburg, the newspaper advisor, was legendarily tough on his student journalists. He rarely doled out compliments, only criticism. But she thrived on the feedback: “He didn't just say ‘this is terrible,' ” she remembered later, “always ‘this is terrible, because . . .' ” She would write down what he said, resolving to do better next time. She never forgot what happened when she filed one of her first stories, for which she had taken her own photos. “Did you get their names?” Muilenburg asked of the people in the picture. Sheepishly, she admitted she didn't. “We're not going to be able to use it now!” he told her. “Next time get everyone's names!” She never made that mistake again. 


	By her second semester on campus, Natalia was promoted to managing editor, which came with a small stipend. That spring, the staff went to the annual conference of the Texas Community College Journalism Association, which would crown one student its Journalist of the Year. The title was prestigious in its own right, but more importantly, it came with a guaranteed summer internship. Natalia was nominated for the award in the spring of 2009. She desperately wanted that spot in a professional newsroom. 

	











	A girl from Amarillo, in the extreme north of the state, won the title. But something surprising happened: the judges had been impressed by Natalia, so impressed that they awarded her an internship too. The summer after her first year at Del Mar, Natalia went to work for the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, her hometown paper. 


	She knew the pressure was on. She had one more year of community college, during which she would have to apply to four-year schools. So when she got to the newsroom, she resolved to outwork everyone. “I was always fucking on time. If they told me, ‘Go here, go there, do this,' I was like, ‘Yes, yes, yes.' ” She wrote breaking news, obituaries, crime stories, event previews, profiles of local residents. When she filed a bad draft, she memorized what the editor told her about how to make it better, and she fixed it the next time. 


	One day, Natalia was assigned to cover a Bob Dylan concert, for an article and for the paper's fledgling social media presence. Just tweet what songs he's playing, an editor instructed. The problem was, she had barely heard of Bob Dylan — even a decade and a half later, telling the story, she struggled to come up with his name — and didn't know a single one of his songs. So she found a guy in the crowd, clearly a Dylan superfan, and stood next to him all night. Every time a new song started, he told her what it was, and she would put it on the paper's Twitter account from her BlackBerry Pearl. “It was very much an intern moment, but I did the assignment,” she said, laughing. She loved working at a real newspaper. 


	In 2009, the Caller-Times still had more than a hundred people on staff between writers, editors, designers, copy editors, and photographers. There was a features department, a bustling sports desk, even a couple of reporters covering local real estate. The paper was owned by the E.W. Scripps Company, which had bought it and four other midsize papers from a San Antonio– based firm in 1997. Scripps wasn't a big player in newspapers; in 2004, before the worst of the industry's challenges began, it only served about 1.5 million readers, spread among 22 newsrooms. But it was a highly profitable company. In 2004, its profit margin was 35 percent, compared to 20 percent at the New York Times and around 10 percent at the typical Fortune 500 company. By 2008, the year before Natalia arrived at the Caller-Times, revenue had plummeted at Scripps (and every other newspaper chain), but the company's profit margin was still a healthy 14 percent. 

	











	To many people, 14 percent profits in an industry trying to adapt to seismic change would be a cause for celebration. But to the corporations that owned an ever-growing number of American newspapers, the acolytes of the Milton Friedman gospel, 14 percent was a crisis. Just as Natalia was starting her journalism career, the executives who controlled the industry were working to reinvent how daily newspapers operated — at the expense of an almost unfathomable number of journalists. 


	DURING HER SECOND YEAR AT Del Mar, Natalia was accepted to the journalism program at the University of Texas at Arlington to complete her bachelor's degree. The school was just outside of Dallas, more than six hours from Corpus Christi. It would be her first time living away from home. 


	As soon as she got to campus, she applied to join the staff of the Shorthorn, the university's award-winning daily student newspaper. The staff of major college dailies skew toward the obsessive and cultish, boasting about pulling all-nighters in the newsroom and treating coverage of picayune scandals as if they're the Pentagon Papers. Budding student journalists tend to react one of two ways: either they dive headfirst into the depths of the mania, never emerging until graduation day, or they feel totally alienated and quit as soon as they can. 


	Natalia joined the Shorthorn thinking she was the first kind of person. She quickly realized she had been wrong. The Foghorn News had been a weekly publication; even when she was managing editor, journalism didn't dominate her entire existence, and hanging out in the newsroom involved as much shooting the shit as actually putting the paper together. At UTA, though, working full-time — or more— on the paper was the norm. “I was living my life for the first time, and these people were acting like they worked at the Washington Post,” she said. “It was like, ‘Come on, y'all, this is not even real life.' ” Suddenly, the girl who had been known at Del Mar as the most reliable person in the newsroom was blowing deadlines and half- assing stories. During her first semester, she still wrote more articles than anyone else on staff, earning the title “Byline Champ,” but she disappeared after winter break. 


	She had never been a disciplined student, but back in Corpus Christi, her mom had kept her on track, enforcing curfews and minimum GPAs. Now she was living on her own, drinking heavily, and thrilled by her newfound freedom. She started partying regularly and going to class seldomly. Some mornings, she and her boyfriend would wake up and go immediately to Applebee's, the only bar they knew of that opened that early. By the time she and the guy broke up at the end of her first year, she was failing so many classes she knew there was no chance of returning to school the next year. 

	











	When her mom found out that Natalia wasn't going to earn a degree, she was furious. Luz told her she had better get a job, because she sure wasn't going to get any help with living expenses anymore. Natalia, who had come home when the semester ended, yelled at her, calling her overbearing. She wasn't going to stay in Corpus Christi after that, so she threw all her stuff in her car and drove back to Arlington. She didn't have a plan for what she would do when she got there. She didn't even say goodbye. The memory still made her weep more than a decade later. She knew her mom was right. “I fucked up school. I felt really dumb,” she said. 


	Natalia found an immigration law firm in Dallas that was looking for a bilingual administrative assistant, which allowed her to pay $300 a month in rent for an apartment she shared with a former classmate. Her old editors from the Caller-Times were still kicking her freelance work, mostly writing event previews for the entertainment section. But she worried that with no college degree and few recent clips, she would never be able to get a full-time job in journalism. 


	Natalia moved back home to Corpus Christi, back into her childhood bedroom. Now 25, she picked up some shifts filing papers for a local oil company and got an interview for a full-time job at a regional office for Subway. She thought her mom would be happy. Instead, Luz was baffled. “You can do better!” she told her daughter. “Why aren't you calling the Caller-Times?” 


	That question transformed the course of Natalia's life. It had been five years since her internship; she had no idea whether the editors would even remember her. But she called. A former editor told her the paper needed someone to fill in for the news clerk while she was on leave; the temporary job was hers if she wanted it. She typed up the events calendar and obituaries and took reader calls — which  “suuuuuuuuucked,” she said; someone was always mad about something. But she was back in the newsroom, which was all she had wanted. 


	In the five years she had been gone, the Caller-Times had cut its staff by half. Revenue across E.W. Scripps's newspapers was dropping, in large part because of the declining ad market. (Employment and classified ads, the two sectors most imperiled by the ubiquity of the internet, declined 17.5 percent and 11.3 percent at Scripps newspapers in the second quarter of 2013 alone.) The conventional wisdom was that newspapers might not survive the digital age, but were persevering in their heroic quest to tell the truth. The fact that many journalists couldn't survive on the wages they were paid — the median entry- level salary for graduates of undergraduate journalism programs was $32,000 in 2013 — wasn't their employers' fault, they were told, but rather the inevitable outcome of choosing such a mission-based career path. We're all in this together, newspaper owners routinely told their workers. We're doing the best we can. 

	











	The truth was more complicated: those newspaper owners were making out just fine; only the workers were suffering. Overall revenue from Scripps's fourteen newspapers did drop about 3.5 percent in 2014, the year Natalia returned to the Caller-Times, but profit remained steady: $28 million, the same as in 2013 and 7 percent higher than in 2012. It wasn't the 30 percent profit margins of a decade earlier, but it hardly indicated a mortally wounded industry either. In Scripps's 2013 annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), filed three months before Natalia went to work for the company, executives made clear how they were growing profits in the newspaper division: “During the past five years, we have reduced our workforce from 4,100 employees to approximately 2,300.” 


	For Scripps, though, $28 million in profits wasn't nearly enough. The company's fourteen television stations were making almost four times as much profit, and dumping the newspaper assets would allow Scripps to acquire new stations without worrying about federal  regulations that prohibit one corporation from controlling multiple major outlets in a given region. So, in the summer of 2014, Scripps announced it would merge with a company called Journal Communications, the publisher of Milwaukee's daily newspaper, then spin the newspapers off into their own company so as not to weigh down the strong TV division. In a press release, the company's CEO said the move would create an “industry-leading” local television company and a “financially flexible” newspaper company. When it came down to it, Scripps was first and foremost a corporation focused on shareholder value. 


	Industry observers viewed the Scripps– Journal Communications spinoff as a worrisome sign for local journalism. “The persistent financial demands of Wall Street have trumped the informational needs of Main Street,” media critic David Carr wrote. Most newspapers “are being cut loose after all the low-hanging fruit, like valuable digital properties, have been plucked. 


	“More ominous,” Carr wrote, “most of the print and magazine assets have already been cut to the bone in terms of staffing. Reducing costs has been the only reliable source of profits as overall revenue has declined. Not much is left to trim.” 


	In the short term, though, the turmoil was the reason Natalia was able to restart her journalism career. The news clerk she was filling in for briefly came back from leave but decided to retire, which meant Natalia got to keep the job. Then the editors needed someone to pick up Sunday reporting shifts because they were so short-staffed, so she volunteered. Then, in the fall of 2014, the paper needed to replace a full-time breaking news reporter. 

	











	Natalia got the job. At 25, she had become a real newspaper reporter, just as she had dreamed about. 


	SIX MONTHS INTO NATALIA'S NEW job, a maneuver many, many levels above her pay grade changed the trajectory of her career. 


	In April 2015, eight months after E.W. Scripps agreed to merge with Journal Communications, the renamed Journal Media Group officially acquired fourteen local newspapers, including the Caller-Times. The move was part of a trend: “In just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers— Gannett, Tribune Company and E.W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television— dumped those properties like yesterday's news in a series of spinoffs,” Carr wrote. 


	The scale of the Gannett Company breakup, which came seven days after the Scripps– Journal Communications deal, was far larger. Like Scripps, Gannett started as a newspaper company: in the early 1900s, Frank Gannett was the co-owner of the Elmira Gazette in Upstate New York. Then he went on a buying spree, acquiring newspapers across the region— and often merging one-time rivals to ensure control over advertising rates in a given town. Time magazine dubbed him “The Great Hyphenator.” Over the second half of the twentieth century, the Gannett Company added a series of TV stations to its portfolio, just as Scripps was doing. By the beginning of the 21st century, TV revenue at both companies was dramatically outperforming the original newspaper business. 


	When Gannett announced that it would split its print and broadcast divisions, the newspapers kept the Gannett name. The TV company, which had been renamed Tegna Inc., held on to most everything else of any value. Tegna even got the most profitable digital assets: Cars.com and CareerBuilder.com, two of the sites that had risen from the ashes of newspapers' once-lucrative classified advertising business. 


	In interviews with reporters the day the deal was announced, Gannett CEO Gracia Martore sought to assure doubters that the newspaper company was set up for success. The new Gannett would assume no debt, which would leave its leaders free to acquire other papers. In a quote that belongs in a corporate buzzwords hall of fame, she told the New York Times that “we can now do smart, accretive acquisitions of community newspapers in an unlevered company where they can create tremendous synergies.” (Despite the use of “we,” Martore was in fact going to run the TV business, leaving Gannett in the hands of a deputy.) 

	











	After the deal closed, at the end of June 2015, Gannett didn't wait very long before executing its first major accretive acquisition to create tremendous synergies. That October, the company announced plans to buy Journal Media Group, the Scripps spinoff that owned the Caller-Times, for $280 million. None of the Journal Media newspapers were particularly lucrative targets on their own, but the deal created a company with newspapers in 106 cities and towns across the U.S. In a press release announcing the purchase, Gannett's CEO made the larger plan clear: “This transaction is an excellent first step in the industry consolidation strategy we have communicated to our shareholders.” 


	Consolidation had been Gannett's goal for decades, as journalist and critic Ben Bagdikian laid out in his seminal 1983 book, The Media Monopoly. Bagdikian identified 23 corporations that together controlled more than 50 percent of the media business (including newspapers, magazines, television, books, and movies). He took a special interest in Gannett, then the largest newspaper chain in the country: “It is neither the best nor the worst. But Gannett Company, Inc. is an outstanding contemporary performer of the ancient rite of creating self-serving myths, of committing acts of greed and exploitation but describing them through its own machinery as heroic epics.” 


	Gannett executives boasted about how they stayed out of newsrooms, leaving control over each paper's journalism to its editor. That seems to have been largely true, but the reasons for that philosophy were arguably less noble than the company claimed: seen through another lens, its deliberate oblivion to what its newsrooms were producing looks more like apathy to journalism writ large. 


	Increasing profits could mean raising ad rates, boosting subscriber numbers, and launching new products, but that was rarely enough in the eyes of media executives. The real key to growth, financially speaking, was cutting staff. Between 1966 and 1980, Bagdikian found— a time when Gannett newspapers were routinely increasing profits by 30, 50, or even 100 percent every quarter— the average newsroom size dropped from 45 to 26, while average circulation remained steady. Unsurprisingly, the pressure to juice profits resulted in decreased journalistic quality: multiple studies in the 1970s and '80s concluded that chain-owned papers published fewer news stories than independent ones. Many began relying more on syndicated national news to replace the local stories they no longer had enough staff to cover. 

	











	Well before private equity was in the local media game, Gannett was creating firms' playbooks for them: ruthlessly consolidate, centralize as much as possible, boost shareholder value at all costs— even when the cost was the journalism, the company's ostensible raison d'être. “The highest levels of world finance have become intertwined with the highest levels of mass media ownership,” Bagdikian wrote, describing the state of affairs but also forecasting the next half century of change in the industry, “with the result of tighter control over the systems on which most of the public depends for its news and information.” 


	By the time Gannett acquired the Caller-Times and its sister Journal Media née Scripps publications, the evolution from locally owned newspapers to investment firms controlling the entire industry was nearly complete.

A team of physicists from the University at Albany has proposed scientifically rigorous methods for documenting and analyzing Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) building upon the work of numerous past and present researchers in the field.

The team tested their methods in the field for the first time and reported their findings in Progress in Aerospace Sciences.

UAP is the term used by government agencies like NASA to refer to ""observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.""

Utilizing a diverse set of devices to capture different types of data on many channels, UAlbany authors Matthew Szydagis, Kevin Knuth and Cecilia Levy, along with Ben Kugielsky of UAPx, a non-profit scientific research organization, collected observable-light and infrared images during a field expedition in 2021 to Laguna Beach, California.

The team also used weather radar data and radiation detectors to create a robust framework for documenting and testing potentially anomalous phenomena that moves away from reliance on eyewitness testimony and similarly subjective methods.

""Following on from the recent joint Congressional subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, the study of UAP is slowly moving from the fringe to the mainstream of scientific study,"" said Szydagis, lead author and an associate professor of physics at UAlbany.

""As this process moves forward, it's critical that future study of UAPs follows a rigorous, repeatable method that can be tested and confirmed by other researchers. We aim to establish a roadmap for these efforts with this paper.""

Szydagis noted the combination of tools and data sets his team relied on during the study included the first use of National Weather Service public Doppler weather radar data to corroborate observations from other instruments, the introduction of coincidence timing between detectors to determine whether potential anomalies were simultaneously recorded by multiple instruments, and a radiation-detection tool known as the Cosmic Watch to determine whether anomalies observed on infrared cameras were accompanied by detectable ionizing radiation.

To help analyze the data from the infrared cameras, Szydagis developed new software, Custom Target Analysis Protocol (C-TAP), which combines artificial intelligence with human verification to do a pixel-by-pixel analysis of successive camera frames to study differences and distinguish actual observations from digital noise in the camera images—similar to an approach used by physicists like him and Levy to look for direct evidence of dark matter.

The researchers coupled this data with robust trigonometric calculations to identify and exclude known objects in the night sky, such as the International Space Station.

Ultimately, the UAlbany research team succeeded in plausibly explaining all but one of the potential anomalies detected—demonstrating that their method is effective and completing important field-testing of the equipment and analysis software.

""While we did not find evidence indicating that UAP have anything to do with non-human intelligence, we still cannot fully explain our one remaining ambiguity, or potential anomaly, which was a collection of bright white dots within a dark spot seen in multiple videos,"" Szydagis said.

The special edition of Progress in Aerospace Sciences includes a comprehensive review of studies conducted on UAPs from 1933 to the present, including more than 20 historical government and privately funded projects, as well as recent scientific research efforts in Ireland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States.

That article, ""The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP),"" aims to clarify the current and historical scientific narrative around UAP and highlight that UAP/UFOs are longstanding global phenomena that have been observed and recorded for well over 150 years, that UAP/UFOs have been observed and studied by astronomers, scientists, and engineers, and that there are currently several serious academic efforts in multiple countries working to collect hard scientific data on UAP using modern instrumentation.

Knuth is lead author of the article, which was co-written by Szydagis and more than 30 other researchers from around the world.

""Given the longstanding, global nature of the UAP/UFO question, the air safety and security implications of their presence, and the potentially profound importance of their nature, studying and understanding these phenomena is of great and urgent importance,"" Knuth said.

Home - News - Lithium deposits are of «extraterrestrial» origin — scientists analyze chemical composition

Oleksandr Fedotkin

Author of news and articles

Scientists from Duke University in the United States have found that lithium-rich brine solutions contain a high concentration of boron.

This chemical composition distinguishes lithium salt brines from other saline waters, such as ocean water. This discovery could change the way lithium is mined and the way wastewater generated from mining is managed. 

Currently, about 40% of global lithium production is concentrated in the so-called «lithium triangle» in South America and the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. In these regions, lithium is extracted from underground salt pools.

«We found that the pH of the brines in these regions is almost entirely determined by boron, unlike seawater and other conventional saline waters. It's a completely different geochemical landscape, as if you were studying an extraterrestrial planet», — says study leader professor Avner Vengosh.

The pH of a solution determines its level of acidity or alkalinity. In most natural waters, chemical reactions involving the carbonate molecule affect the pH level, determining alkalinity. However, scientists have discovered that in a large salt lake Salar de Uyuni on the plateau in Bolivia, under which the world's largest lithium-rich salt solutions are located, completely different chemical reactions take place. 

The researchers analyzed the pH and chemical composition of the brines and salts associated with mining on the Uyuni salt marsh. Lithium mining typically involves pumping natural brine from the ground to a series of shallow above-ground ponds. The liquid evaporates from these ponds, leaving a concentrated brine containing lithium and boron. 

The scientists found that the pH level in the natural brine samples was close to neutral. However, the brine samples from evaporation ponds had very high acidity levels. The modeling results showed that high boron concentration was a key factor in the pH level in both cases. 

Natural brines contain high levels of boron in the form of boric acid and borates, the relative distribution of which determines the pH level. Evaporation in the ponds increases the total boron concentration and leads to the breakdown of boric acid, generating hydrogen ions that lower the pH. 

«As a result of a series of geochemical reactions, carbonate alkalinity in the brine from the Uyuni salt marsh decreases, while boric alkalinity begins to prevail», — says the lead author of the study from the Vengosh laboratory Gordon Williams. 

To support their findings, the researchers collected data from more than 300 analyses of lithium-rich solutions from various salt basins, including those in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and the Tibetan Plateau. The modeling results showed that boron had the greatest impact on alkalinity and pH in most brines. 

«In addition to our new data, we have compiled a geochemical database of lithium brines from around the world and have consistently found that boron is often a key component of brine alkalinity and controls its pH, confirming the results obtained at the Uyuni salt marsh in Bolivia», — Gordon Williams added.

According to the researchers, their work has demonstrated for the first time the role of boron in the chemical changes that occur during the evaporation of lithium brine in salt vats. The results may provide information on future lithium mining technologies as the world explores ways to extract lithium more efficiently and safely waste water management.

The CW's Supernatural is one of the most beloved franchises of the last two decades, but with various complex story arcs, character resurrections and shifting plot devices, it's easy to see how things can get a bit muddy at times. Villains come and go, some having much more impact than others. Certain relics work on specific creatures while losing their potency. When time travel and multiple dimensions were introduced, the series' storylines became shaky.

Sam and Dean themselves have both died and returned several times over. While Supernatural was initially supposed to end after 5 seasons, the fan response urged the studio and show creators to keep the Winchesters around for much longer than intended. This welcome but elongated stay has led to a few head-scratching details in the show's history.

In Season 5 of Supernatural, viewers are introduced to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Each of the four wears rings that help them manifest in human form. The rings themselves are also the keys to unlocking Lucifer's cage and starting the apocalypse. While Death stands out as much older and somewhat immune to the rules that govern the other three, they each represent an aspect of human nature that is necessary to ignite the end of times.

In the macabre world of The CW's Supernatural, the Winchester brothers have faced some of the most vile and powerful villains in TV history.

Since Death existed just as long as life itself, viewers might concede that his arc stands alone and separate from his brothers. However, when Death is killed in a later season, he must be replaced by a reaper as the role of Death is necessary to the universe itself. When the other horsemen are defeated by Sam and Dean, their roles are never replaced. The horsemen were crucial to the plot of Season 5, widely considered the best season of Supernatural, and ultimately fizzled out as major villains in a single episode.

In season 8 of Supernatural, viewers are introduced to the history of the Men of Letters. The Men of Letters were a secret, occult organization that had long monitored the history of magic and monsters, gathering data and means by which humanity could survive and defend themselves against things that go bump in the night. They would work with hunters by supplying information or materials necessary to aid them in their struggles.

Initially, it seems the Men of Letters are extinct until it is revealed there is an entire sect of the organization still very active in Britain. They possess ample resources and are highly organized, as seen when they provide the Winchesters with the hyperbolic pulse generator device, which they use to defeat Lucifer again. When conflict arises between the Winchesters and the British Men of Letters, their entire base of operation is overthrown, and their footing in America is severed through the attack on a single base. For a secret organization with decades of experience and resources, this defeat seems sudden and unrealized.

Season 7 is considered a bit of a bumpy stretch of road in the Supernatural ride. One highlight of the season, however, was the introduction of fan-favorite character Kevin Tran. Kevin was a smart young kid, focused solely on his studies before he was chosen as the next prophet of the lord. He is watched over by the angels as he learns to decipher the tablets until he is ultimately kidnapped by the Leviathans. The Leviathans wanted Kevin to read their tablet before Crowley interfered with his demons and took Kevin. He's thrown into the world with all the forces of good and evil clamoring for his services.

Supernatural, as a series, was filled with highs and lows. But certain choices left fans of one season deeply divided even after the show's end.

Kevin spends most his on-screen time in Supernatural under duress. Even though he was thrust into this position at no fault of his own, he assisted Sam and Dean to the best of his capabilities. For a large portion of season 8, Kevin is decoding the demon tablet for the Winchesters as Sam is undertaking the trials to shut the gates of Hell forever. In the 9th episode of Season 9, under orders from Metatron, the angel Galadreel assassinates Kevin, smiting him in the Men of Letters bunker. This death was sudden and never fully foreshadowed. It doesn't help that Sam and Dean barely mention Kevin past this point.

In the finale of season 8, viewers witness all the angels fall from heaven at the hands of Metatron's spell. Throughout season 8, Metatron tricks Castiel into aiding him in the completion of what Castiel thinks are the angel trials to lock the gates of Heaven. Metatron is lying to Castiel and using the items collected by Castiel to cast a spell that will expel all angels from Heaven. This leads to the primary storyline of Season 9 focusing on the angels adjusting to life on Earth and forming various warring factions hoping to reenter Heaven. The result is a jumbled mess of follow-the-leader that seems to shift each week.

The leaders of the main primary factions are angels named Bartholomew and Malachi. Bartholomew is billed as a fearsome warrior angel, once under the command of Castiel during the war that took place after the first apocalypse. Malachi, known as the Anarchist Angel, is more brutal in his approach and spreads this trait among his followers. However, Bartholomew is easily dispatched by Castiel after nearly a full season of buildup, when they meet to discuss Castiel's recruitment to Bartholomew's side. Malachi's fate is even more underwhelming as he is killed by the angel Galadreel off-screen. The Angel Civil War and its leaders were ultimately just a season full of filler and storylines that led to a dead end.

 The Leviathans were God's first pet project in Supernatural. Before man, before angels, Chuck created the ancient Leviathans, which proved to be a big mistake. Also known as the Old Ones, the Leviathans were a perfect killing machine, devouring everything in sight. God was forced to create the realm of Purgatory to house the Old Ones to prevent them from destroying all of his creations. So, when Castiel accidentally unleashes the primordial beings at the end of Season 6 by opening a portal to Purgatory and absorbing all the souls within, viewers were expecting a lot of carnage from the Leviathans.

Initially, the Leviathans appear unstoppable. Even decapitation only slows them down, as their heads eventually reattach. As they are older than angels, even angels fear them and resort to flight before attempting to fight. The oldest of the monsters seems to be no match for the Leviathan either, as seen when the Alpha Vampire must succumb to their orders. So, when it was revealed that the ultimate answer to battling the Old Ones is borax, fans found it extremely underwhelming, to say the least. Sheriff Jody Mills unintentionally discovers this weakness when cleaning Bobby's house, and the borax, found in most cleaning products, drips onto their Leviathan captive.

In the early years of Supernatural, demons were a big deal. The primary story arc that launched the show focused on the demon Azazel and his murder of Mary Winchester. The first two seasons are dedicated to the Winchesters searching for their father and hunting Azazel to avenge their mother. In the season finale of the second season, many of Hell's inhabitants are released when the Devil's Gate is opened. The episode marks a major turning point in the series where demons become one of the primary antagonists. Outside of exorcism, the only way the Winchesters have to kill demons is the use of the demon-killing knife, which they retrieve from the demon Ruby.

When the seven deadly sins are released in the first episode of Season 3, it's labeled as one of the biggest challenges modern hunters have ever faced. The seven sins have been imprisoned in Hell since the Dark Ages, and when they're discovered on Earth, Bobby is visibly shaken. Crossroads demons were also much more prominent in the early seasons, seen as a major issue for Sam and Dean as they often tricked humans into trading their souls for wishes, which would ultimately backfire. As Supernatural progresses, the demons become weaker and commonplace and are easily dispatched. Later, demons in Supernatural fit more into the monster-of-the-week category, more so than the season-long antagonist that appeared during the first years of the show.

When Sam and Dean go to Heaven in Season 5 of Supernatural, they encounter the angel Joshua in Heaven's garden. Initially, the Winchesters are being followed and attacked by the angel Zachariah until Joshua intervenes, telling Zachariah that he needs to speak with them because God has a message for them. It's hinted that God sometimes speaks to Zachariah because they both consider themselves gardeners. Sam and Dean tell Joshua they wish to speak with God about the upcoming apocalypse on Earth in hopes of having God intervene and save humanity. While part of what Joshua tells them is true, it is not the whole story.

Though Supernatural didn't reveal Chuck Shurley's identity as God until Season 11, hints about his true nature started popping up in Season 4.

Joshua is right when he tells Sam and Dean that God has intervened by saving them up to this point. For one, he transports them to the airplane when Lucifer's cage is opened. He also brought Castiel back to life to aid them. Joshua says this is the most God has done for anyone in quite some time, which is partly true. However, viewers know in retrospect that God, under the guise of Chuck, was much more involved than Joshua revealed. He was writing the story as it unfolded throughout all of season 5. Chuck is well aware of all the events taking place and points Sam and Dean in the right direction all over the apocalypse-filled season.

In season 8 of Supernatural, Sam undertakes the Trials of God. As the prophet Kevin Tran reveals to the Winchesters via his translation of the demon tablet, the trials are tasks designed by God for one to undertake should they wish to close the gates of Hell forever. Most of the season highlights Sam's journey as he completes the trials and the negative effects that the trials have on him. Sam has been visibly ill since the completion of the first trial. When pursuing Metatron, Sam collapses from a fever of 107, forcing Dean to throw him in a tub full of ice to save his life.

After the Winchesters save Bobby's soul from Hell, the only trial that remains is to cure a demon. Sam and Dean ultimately capture Crowley and lock him in a church, and begin curing him. While Sam continues with the efforts to cure Crowley, Dean encounters Naomi and informs him that if Sam finishes the trials, he will die. Castiel teleports Dean to Sam, and Dean tells Sam that if he doesn't stop, it will lead to his death. After much convincing, Sam agrees to stop as he and Dean witness the angels falling from Heaven. The effects of the trial and the storyline all but disappear from this point forward, rendering the main arc of season 8 all but useless in the grand scheme of Supernatural.

Jack Kline is the offspring of Lucifer and the human Kelly Kline, making him a powerful Nephilim. Jack's powers are expressed before his birth when he chooses Castiel as his guardian and aids Castiel in dispatching the demon Dagon while still in his mother's womb. Thinking that because Jack is the child of Lucifer, he will be pure evil, Kelly attempts to destroy herself and Jake, but Jake resurrects Kelly to save her and himself. However, it is after Jack is born that viewers are introduced to the scope of his true power.

Jack appears to be just like any child after he is born until the Winchesters realize he is growing up at a rapid pace. In a matter of days, Jack is a young man. The reason for his rapid growth is never explained, nor is the reason for it stopping ever addressed. Despite his apparent age, Jack still has the mind of a young child and has to learn his abilities from scratch. If he were aging at such a pace from the moment he was born, it would make sense that he is much older after being alive for a few weeks.

Throughout the history of Supernatural, Sam and Dean have had to find creative ways to gather intel on the various cases they've undertaken during their hunting careers. From hacking into sensitive and encrypted computer systems and posing as police officers, the Winchesters have done it all for the sake of solving the case. Not to mention the endless credit card scams to eat and buy hotel rooms. Hunting monsters doesn't pay well, after all. The boys keep drawers filled with throwaway phones and forged badges to use at the drop of a hat, should a clue come back from some far-off agency.

It can be hard for viewers to swallow, however, that in the 15 seasons of Supernatural, the Winchesters have rarely, if ever, been apprehended for illegal activities. One would think that with the resources the FBI has, at least one or two agents would find it odd that the same two individuals show up at the scenes of many violent, high-profile cases. Not to mention, the Winchesters usually have fun with their agent names, typically using the last names of famous musicians. Considering the cultural popularity of many of the musicians' names used, it would make sense for them to be discovered as frauds a few times.

Spiritual Curiosity in the Post-2020s Era

The last few years have seen an undeniable cultural shift toward introspection. Following the collective trauma of a global pandemic, economic uncertainty, and significant geopolitical change, people have sought answers beyond traditional logic or material success. According to spiritual trend analysts, 2025 has seen record levels of interest in tarot, astrology, mediumship, and intuitive coaching, especially online.

In this environment, free psychic reading online services have flourished. For newcomers, these free sessions offer a safe, low-pressure way to explore metaphysical guidance without financial obligation. For those already attuned to spiritual practices, a free psychic reading offers a chance to sample different readers and modalities before committing to a more in-depth session.

⇒ Chat live with psychics who truly care — free today

The Cost Barrier of Premium Readings

One of the key drivers behind the surge in free psychic consultations is the rising cost of premium sessions. Accurate psychic readers — particularly those with a strong following or years of experience — often charge rates ranging from $5 to $15 per minute or more. While this pricing may reflect the value of their service, it can be a significant barrier for those facing financial hardship or exploring spiritual guidance for the first time.

That's where a free psychic reading becomes an empowering alternative. By offering initial sessions at no cost, platforms like the psychic experts are helping democratize access to this ancient practice. Users can now test the waters with a free psychic question, receive a few minutes of clarity via free psychic chat, or speak to a real psychic by phone — all without swiping a credit card.

⇒ Receive insight and healing with a free psychic reading

Accessibility Through Technology

Another major factor fueling this demand is accessibility. Thanks to mobile apps, text platforms, and secure chat portals, psychic guidance is no longer confined to candle-lit rooms or in-person appointments. The emergence of free psychic chat and free psychic reading online services has enabled users from any location — urban or remote — to get spiritual support within minutes.

This shift is especially valuable for individuals who may feel nervous about speaking to a psychic in person. Chat and phone services allow users to remain anonymous, reducing anxiety and fostering more open conversations. Data shows that users are often more likely to ask a free psychic question honestly and directly through chat than in a face-to-face setting.

⇒ Get a trusted free psychic reading without a credit card

The Psychology of Asking a Free Psychic Question

There's also a deeper psychological appeal to asking questions about the unknown. In moments of confusion, asking a question—even a small one—provides the illusion of control. It's a way to anchor oneself to possibility, hope, and answers that may not come from within.

That's why a free psychic question holds such power. It's not just about the information you receive — it's about reaching for it. Whether you're wondering if your ex will return, if you're on the right career path, or if you're blocking your blessings, simply voicing your question can be cathartic and illuminating.

With the stigma around spiritual services fading fast, 2025 is shaping up to be the year when free psychic readings become as normal as therapy or self-help books. From Gen Z to Boomers, people realize there's no harm in asking a free psychic question — and in fact, it may just be the beginning of a meaningful journey.

How The Psychic Experts Evaluate Free Psychic Reading Platforms

Not all psychic platforms are created equal in the ever-expanding world of online spiritual services. That's why The-Psychic-Experts.com has built one of the most trusted, independent evaluation systems for identifying the most recommended free psychic readings available online. With thousands of websites claiming to offer real insight, clarity, and connection, the team behind The-Psychic-Experts.com works tirelessly to separate genuine spiritual guidance from vague, automated responses.

The result? A carefully curated, annually updated list of free psychic reading platforms that users can trust.

⇒ Ask anything in a free psychic reading — love, work, more

Strict Editorial Standards and Testing

Every platform featured on The-Psychic-Experts.com goes through a thorough multi-step internal checking process designed to test for accuracy, transparency, and overall user experience. It includes secret-shopper style evaluations where trained team members request a free psychic reading by date of birth and time to measure how precise and personalized the answers are.

Testers often ask complex or emotionally charged questions to see if the psychic is attuned to more than just general advice. Responses are then scored on relevance, empathy, and whether the psychic provides actionable insights. Platforms that rely heavily on vague, cookie-cutter replies are immediately removed from consideration.

⇒ Discover real guidance through live psychic chat

No Credit Card = No Gimmicks

One of the most essential standards in the the-psychic-experts.com evaluation process is whether the platform offers free psychic readings, without forcing users to enter credit card details.

While many sites advertise “free” readings, they often require users to sign up for a subscription or provide payment information upfront. These bait-and-switch tactics can create mistrust and leave people feeling scammed.The platforms recommended by The-Psychic-Experts.com highlight psychic services that allow for at least one initial free psychic session, often via chat or phone, with no billing details required. It makes it easier for first-time users to explore their spiritual questions risk-free.

Evaluating Reading Types and Specializations

Not all psychic readings are the same, and the editorial team considers this during evaluation. Readers on the platform are assessed for the types of readings they offer, including free psychic love reading, mediumship, tarot, astrology, numerology, clairvoyance, and energy healing.

This variety is significant because not every question fits neatly into one modality. A user seeking romantic advice may benefit most from a love psychic or tarot reader, while someone dealing with grief may need a medium who can connect with passed loved ones. Free psychic reading by date of birth and time may appeal to astrology-focused seekers. The leading platforms provide access to a broad spectrum of reading styles.

Each reader is tested for communication skills, clarity, and the ability to make users feel safe. A psychic might have talent but lack compassion — or vice versa. Only those who excel at spiritual insight and empathetic delivery are considered highly rated.

⇒ Experience a free psychic chat that feels personal and real

Internal QA

The psychic experts don't just rely on staff evaluations. The site also collects thousands of real-user testimonials to verify consistency and satisfaction across a broad user base. Comments are analyzed for patterns, such as repeated praise for emotional accuracy, relationship guidance, or intuitive timing.

All feedbacks are vetted through an internal QA process to ensure authenticity and eliminate paid or spam submissions. This approach helps build long-term credibility and keeps the annual rankings relevant and trustworthy.

By combining professional testing, real-world feedback, and a commitment to ethical standards, the psychic experts ensure that users receive guidance from only the most accurate, accessible, and genuinely free psychic resources available in 2025.

3. Tarot Card Pulls

A classic and still one of the most reliable options for free and paid readings, tarot cards remain a staple in 2025. Many platforms offer a free psychic reading online using a three-card spread that touches on past, present, and future energies.

Tarot is a favorite among users because it provides specific visuals, archetypes, and symbolism that can be interpreted intuitively or directly. It works for all questions, including love, career, and self-growth.

Why it's offered: Tarot sessions can be done quickly and are visually engaging, making them perfect for limited-time or single-question free psychic readings.

4. Astrology and Birth Chart Readings

Astrology continues to experience a renaissance, and free psychic reading by date of birth and time is one of the fastest-growing categories on psychic platforms. Some services allow users to input their birth details to receive a basic sun, moon, and rising analysis or a short synastry report (love compatibility).

More advanced readers might offer brief insights into planetary transits or upcoming life themes in a 5–10 minute complimentary session.

Why it's offered: Astrology is extremely popular among Gen Z and Millennials. It's also data-driven, making it easy to automate or semi-automate for mass trial sessions.

⇒ Ask a free psychic question and get instant insight

5. Past Life Readings

Past life readings offer fascinating insight for those curious about karma, reincarnation, and spiritual history. Some free trials allow users to ask, “Who was I in a past life?” or “Why do I feel connected to this person or place?”

These readings often combine intuitive visions, energy work, and spiritual channelling to explore patterns affecting the user in their current life.

Why it's offered: It's a unique hook that appeals to deeply spiritual users and often prompts follow-up interest.

6. Yes/No Psychic Questions

Psychic Hotline, the Durham-based record label founded by Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath of Sylvan Esso with longtime manager Martin Anderson, has planted its flag in downtown Durham with a retail pop-up called Psychic Hotline Mailroom.

The Mailroom, located at 316 Holland Street, sits at the end of the cobblestone alleyway next to the Durham Hotel. Psychic Hotline keeps an office on the second floor as the label headquarters, and an actual mailroom on the first floor for shipping out online orders. But since 2022, the label has periodically opened up a small room at the front of the building for in-person shopping— a way to connect with fans and showcase the label. The Mailroom pop-up first made its debut three years ago for “The Greatest Show on Dirt,” a three-day music series at the Durham Athletic Park (DAP) hosted and headlined by Sylvan Esso.

Will Hackney, head of production at Psychic Hotline, is one of three employees who take shifts running the pop-up, alongsideAnderson and direct sales coordinator Devon Tuttle. Most of the folks at Psychic Hotline have a history of working in record stores. 

“We like that social interaction, sharing music directly, and getting to chat about things that we like,” Hackney says.

Hackney and Anderson both grew up in Chapel Hill, where Anderson used to hold down Sundays from noon to 8 p.m. at CD Alley on Franklin Street. He says that he still “loves the ritual” of overseeing the record shop and connecting with fellow music lovers.

Join 24,000 of your neighbors and stay in tune with the Triangle.

Starting this spring, the Mailroom has regular, limited hours on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. While you can't get a palm reading, you can expect to find a selection of new record releases and merchandise from Psychic Hotline's eclectic roster of artists and collaborators. 

“It's not outfitted like a real storefront, but we've been making little tweaks every few months to make it nice to be in there,” Hackney says. “When you're doing your Saturday errands, you can come by and check out some records, or take part in some of the focused events that we're doing with different artists and local businesses.”

In addition to selling records, you might catch DJs spinning records of their own during special events at the Mailroom, which has played host to album releases, merch drops, and, once, a “pancake party.” Hackney says the space is a “blank canvas” that allows the label to share the Mailroom with other creatives, both inside and outside the music industry, and provide opportunities to unite fan bases.

Reyna Tropical, a Mexican-American band that performed at Good Moon Festival in 2024, released their debut album, Malegria, on Psychic Hotline last year. To commemorate the release, the label worked with Reyna Tropical and Little Waves Coffee, the owners of Cocoa Cinnamon, to create a custom coffee blend, which was sold in limited quantities at a pop-up event at the Mailroom.

Earlier this month, the label also partnered with the team behind the NO VISA dance party series to release a collaborative clothing collection at the Mailroom, handing over turntable reigns to local DJs Mickey Slicks and Alec Lomami. NO VISA and Psychic Hotline previously worked together on an afterparty during the label's 2022 mini-festival at DAP, and Nick Sanborn, under his Made of Oak moniker, has performed for NO VISA events since the series started in 2019.

The next collaboration on the horizon is a custom skate deck with Manifest Skate Shop and musician/illustrator Nathaniel Russell.

“That's a big goal for the space is just to have an excuse or a reason to work with other cool local businesses,” Hackney says. “This is a way to make those connections and collaborate, especially with people that don't have a record for us to put out, you know, in that classic direct record label way. People that we're fans of in town—we're making up these excuses to do stuff with them.”

Psychic Hotline doesn't have an official “roster,” but the list of contributing artists does include mainstays like Sylvan Esso, The Dead Tongues, and Phil Cook. Since its founding in 2018, the label has produced records for over 50 artists in total. Albums are released project to project, and the artists have no obligation to continue working with the label, though many do come back.

“We've always wanted the label to exist as a porous, sort of connector of broader arts communities, and not just being locked into one medium or roster,” Anderson says. 

“We've always wanted the label to exist as a porous, sort of connector of broader arts communities, and not just being locked into one medium or roster.”

In a world of streaming services, the Mailroom offers a physical pace for people to discover and engage with music and the artists they care about without having to filter through ads or doomscroll social media in search of new music. 

By hosting local events for record releases and artist spotlights, even for artists like Reyna Tropical who aren't based in the Triangle, and creating collaboration opportunities with other businesses, the label aims to deepen the connection between the music and the community surrounding it.

“All of the extra stuff is just interesting ways to bring people into the music,” Hackney says. “Obviously, there's a lot of music out there, and it comes across everybody's streaming services. Some of the other avenues are just a way to let people know what the artists are about and what they're into in an attempt to get them to hear this music that we really care about and provide richness to the world of the music.”

No one can predict the future, not even a company named Psychic Hotline. But Anderson, the label's founder, is certain the Mailroom will continue to evolve.

Good Moon, the label's hometown music festival that debuted last year, won't be back until 2026. Anderson says the plan has always been a biennial event. During the off-year, fans can anticipate a series of concerts this fall, under the “Good Moon” umbrella, and more events as the  label looks at more opportunities to collaborate with other creatives and like-minded businesses to “expand the spirit of what we're doing in the Mailroom.” 

Commercial real estate prices have risen dramatically in downtown Durham, making it more challenging to sustain the DIY art spaces of yesteryear like The Mothership, The Carrack, and Durty Durham Studio.

“That stuff has to be present downtown,” Anderson says. “A lot of people come through here and say, ‘I just moved here from New York, I just moved here from San Francisco.' Alright, cool. Go spend those dollars at PS37 and at Missy Lane's and the Pinhook and these spaces that are really moving things forward.”

Now that Psychic Hotline has found a home at 316 Holland Street, due in part to a strong relationship with restaurateur Michael Lee who purchased the building a few years ago, Anderson says that the goal is to open the door for others as a way to give back to the Durham community that has supported the label from the beginning.

“That's a big part of the Durham spirit,” Anderson says. “Every time one person here cracks into something or gets something, it's like, ‘how do I share it?' And that's the coolest.”

Better communication is essential to counter misconceptions, biases and lack of accurate information.


Drawing on expertise of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Horizon 2020 projects, the European Policy Centre and the European University Institute, a new JRC report on navigating migration narratives provides communication professionals with evidence-based recommendations, insights and tools to navigate the complex and often polarised discourse on migration. 

The report serves as a call to action for policymakers and communicators to work together to promote a more informed and balanced public debate on migration. 

The experts emphasise the need for better public communication on migration. This approach should involve providing clear, factual and transparent information about EU migration trends and dynamics, explaining complex concepts, asylum processes and terminology and clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of EU institutions and Member States. 

The report also highlights the importance of having open and honest conversations about both the challenges and opportunities linked to migration, acknowledging and addressing citizens' legitimate concerns, for instance linked to job competition and distribution of national resources. The recommendations emphasise the need for balanced messages that take account of the diversity of public opinions and concerns and point to frequent citizen dialogues to better understand citizens' concerns. 

The report and its five case studies provide a valuable resource for promoting a more informed and balanced public debate on migration. Specifically, it offers a comprehensive analysis of migration narratives and their impact on public opinion, as well as evidence-based recommendations for improving communication on migration. 

The report shows that the public discussion around migration in Europe is shaped by simplified and biased narratives, which are often used to serve political purposes. These narratives can be misleading and create a distorted view of reality, influencing public perception and policy decisions. 

The report notes that discussions about migration are often stuck in one of two positions: one that sympathises with migrants and another that emphasises the challenges they pose to host societies. Both perspectives, whether positive or negative, tend to focus on the problems associated with migration. The authors highlight the need for a more nuanced conversation about migration, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the issue, and acknowledging both the benefits and challenges that migration can bring to individuals, communities and societies as a whole. 

Emotions play a significant role in shaping people's perceptions and behaviours, making it difficult to change people's understanding and reasoning of an issue once negative emotions are triggered. Populist movements exploit the elicitation of strong, negative emotions to create a sense of crisis.  

The report also includes a social media analysis which finds that the most common narrative systematically promoted by populists in migration-related social media posts is one that pits the messenger, their party and their supporters against a perceived political elite, which is depicted as out-of-touch, ineffective and failing to act in the interest of citizens.  

In this narrative, not only are national political rivals condemned, but the European Commission and the European Union as a whole are portrayed as incapable of managing migration. The messenger, on the other hand, is positioned as the voice of the people - a capable and competent agent of change who will bring stability and security to the immigration landscape. 

The report notes that the rise of populism is making more moderate politicians wary of appearing weak and losing public support. As a result, many politicians feel compelled to choose between capitalising on the same fears that populists are exploiting, or advocate for rational, technocratic solutions, which often contribute to a mixed narrative. Within this narrative, migrants are recognised as victims, but there is a persistent emphasis on keeping them away.  

The report argues that in the EU, populist movements have successfully framed migration as a crisis, evoking fear and insecurity by portraying immigration as being “out of control” and the EU's borders as insecure and ""wide open"" to unchecked immigration, thereby mobilising public support and shaping policy debates.  

The Great Replacement theory, which portrays immigration as an ""invasion"", has increasingly infiltrated mainstream, conservative and right-wing political discourse. This narrative, which suggests that native populations are being intentionally replaced by immigrants, has gained significant traction in mainstream and conservative discourse. Alarmingly, a growing number of ordinary people in believe in this theory. A 2017 poll found that 48% of French voters thought that a population replacement either would or might happen in France, and a 2021 poll found that 61% believed this. 

The report emphasises that conspiracy theories, such as those surrounding mass migration and population replacement, provide a sense of control and understanding for individuals who feel powerless and disenfranchised. These narratives tap into deep-seated fears about losing cultural, ethnic and national identity, triggering a defensive response. By offering a simplistic explanation for complex events, conspiracy theories give people a sense of agency and belonging, allowing them to make sense of their circumstances. 

The authors note that this type of divisive narrative often exploits the confusion over migration terminology and people's scarce understanding of asylum procedures. It emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach to better inform citizens, address concerns about migration and counter disinformation.  

Regardless of public opinion and political perspective, migration and the issues around it will continue to be a complex and controversial topic. The JRC and its partners are working to ensure that the public discussion can take place based on facts and evidenced based data, to provide all sides of the debate with clarity. This factually accurate, evidence-based approach is essential for developing effective policies to manage the risks as well as the opportunities posed by migration.  

This JRC Science for Policy Report is published in conjunction with a JRC Technical Report on Public perceptions of fairness in the European migration and asylum system, which describes the results and findings of a survey conducted by the JRC in eight EU Member States, and an independent expert report on Mis- and disinformation on migration, which both feed into this Science for Policy report.

Germany's Wendelstein 7-X stellarator has set a new benchmark for fusion reactors, bringing commercial, near-limitless clean energy one step closer to reality.

A recently concluded experimental campaign at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, Germany has smashed previous fusion records and set a new benchmark for reactor performances.

Nuclear fusion offers a tantalizing promise of unlimited clean energy. By smashing together isotopes (or different versions) of hydrogen at incredibly high temperatures, the resulting superheated plasma of electrons and ions fuses into heavier atoms, releasing a phenomenal amount of energy in the process.

However, while this fusion reaction is self-sustaining under the extraordinary temperatures and pressures within stars, recreating these conditions on Earth is a huge technical challenge — and current reactor concepts still consume more energy than they are able to produce.

Stellarators are one of the most promising reactor designs, so named for their mimicry of reactions in the sun. They use powerful external magnets to control the high-energy plasma within a ring-shaped vacuum chamber and maintain a stable, high pressure. Unlike simpler tokamak reactors — which pass a high current through the plasma to generate the required magnetic field — stellarators' external magnets are better at stabilizing the plasma through the fusion reactions, a feature that will ultimately be necessary when translating the technology to commercial power plants.

In the recent experiments, the W7-X stellarator outperformed previous benchmarks set by the decommissioned tokamak reactors JT60U in Japan and JET in the UK, especially over how long the plasma can be sustained.

Most notably, the international team revealed that the reactor had reached a new record high triple product — a key metric for the success of fusion power generators. The triple product is a combination of the density of particles in the plasma, the temperature required for these particles to fuse, and the energy confinement time (a measure of how well the thermal energy is held by the system). A certain minimum value called the Lawson criterion marks the point at which the reaction produces more energy than it uses and becomes self-sustaining, so a higher triple product indicates a more efficient reaction.

""The new record is a tremendous achievement by the international team,"" said Thomas Klinger, Head of Operations at Wendelstein 7-X and Head of Stellarator Dynamics and Transport at IPP in a statement. ""Elevating the triple product to tokamak levels during long plasma pulses marks another important milestone on the way toward a power-plant-capable stellarator.""

Key to the success of this latest milestone was the development of a new fuel pellet injector that combined continuous refueling of the reactor with pulsed heating to maintain the required plasma temperature. Over a 43-second period, 90 frozen hydrogen pellets were fired into the plasma at up to 2,600 feet (800 metres) per second, roughly the speed of a bullet. Pre-programmed pulses of powerful microwaves heated the plasma, which reached a peak temperature of 30 million degrees C, and this coordination between the microwave pulses and the pellet injection crucially extended how long the plasma could be stably maintained.

—There's 90,000 tons of nuclear waste in the US. How and where is it stored?

—Just a fraction of the hydrogen hidden beneath Earth's surface could power Earth for 200 years, scientists find

This same campaign also increased the energy turnover of the reaction to 1.8 gigajoules over a six-minute run, smashing the reactor's previous record of 1.3 gigajoules from February 2023. Energy turnover is a combination of the heating power and plasma duration of a fusion reactor and an indication of the reactor's ability to sustain the high-energy plasma. It is therefore another crucial parameter for future power plant operation. The new value even exceeds the record achieved by the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) in China earlier this year, further evidencing stellarators' potential.

""The records of this experimental campaign are much more than mere numbers. They represent a significant step forward in validating the stellarator concept—made possible through outstanding international collaboration,"" summarized Robert Wolf, Head of Stellarator Heating and Optimization at IPP in statement.

GOP Tax Bill:

The rift between Donald Trump and Elon Musk widened on Thursday, with two of the world's most influential figures trading insults over the Republican tax policy bill at the center of the president's agenda.  

Trump told reporters that he was “disappointed” by the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer, saying the bill's cuts to electric-vehicle tax credits drove his billionaire former adviser's opposition. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

On May 30, US President Donald Trump accused his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, of breaking a trade truce that brought down tariffs from extreme highs in early May. Investors saw the writing on the wall: tariffs would spike again, hurting the economy. Stocks fell more than 1%. But later the same day, Trump said he'd have a conversation with Xi, and optimism – and stock prices – were restored. When the call finally happened on June 5, the S&P 500 Index again briefly surged. 

The early months of Trump's second term have been marked by this pattern: The president threatens to impose sky-high tariffs and stocks tumble, then he relents and markets recover. Wall Street has learned to capitalize on this by buying into the S&P 500 when it first drops, anticipating the president will backtrack on tariffs and send markets higher.

In this article

Shares of Circle Internet Group soared as much as 235% after the stablecoin company and its selling shareholders raised almost $1.1 billion in an initial public offering.

The stock opened at $69.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after its IPO priced at $31. At one point, it traded as high as $103.75.

The New York-based company priced its IPO late Wednesday, far above this week's expected range of $27 to $28, and an initial range last week of between $24 and $26, valuing the company Thursday at some $6.8 billion before trading began.

Circle joins Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S. This marks the company's second attempt at going public. A prior merger with a special purpose acquisition company collapsed in late 2022 amid regulatory challenges.

""To realize our vision, we needed to forge relationships with governments, we needed to work with policymakers … because if you want this to work for mainstream, it's got to work in mainstream society and you need to have those rules of the road,"" CEO Jeremy Allaire told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Thursday. ""We've been one of the most licensed, regulated, compliant, transparent companies in the entire history of this industry, and that's served us well.""

The crypto industry is enjoying newfound political favor under a friendly U.S. administration. The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up on the expectation that Congress will pass stablecoin legislation this summer. Wall Street analysts say it could grow 10-fold over the next five years, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity.

Allaire co-founded Circle in 2013. Based in Boston, the company initially focused on consumer-facing payments and crypto wallet and exchange services. It moved to New York earlier this year.

Circle founded the U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to establish a standard for fiat money on the internet, launching it in partnership with Coinbase in 2018 through a consortium called Centre. In 2023, they dissolved Centre as a stand-alone entity, with Circle taking over the responsibilities of USDC and Coinbase taking a minority stake in the stablecoin company.

The two companies also entered into an agreement to split the revenue of USDC stablecoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a ""stretch goal to make USDC the No. 1 stablecoin."" 

USDC is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, behind Tether's USDT.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to that of another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies and in anticipation of Congress blessing the system.

Specifically, companies that aren't traditional users of cryptocurrencies are now interested in the efficiency and lower cost that stablecoins might bring to remittances, business-to-business payments and e-commerce, at the same time as they remain essential to tokenized financial markets. Rhetoric around stablecoins preserving U.S. dollar dominance — partly by ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins — has grown louder, too.

Migrants deported under Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act were “plainly deprived…of their right[s],” the judge ruled.

A United States district judge has ruled that the Trump administration must provide hundreds of migrants sent to an El Salvador megaprison under the Alien Enemies Act the ability to challenge their deportation. 

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Wednesday, determining that allowing those deportations to stand without recognizing migrants' due process would not only violate their rights, but also create an unacceptable precedent. Boasberg also noted that President Donald Trump issued the order for deportations against individuals who his administration had determined were part of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang. 

An independent examination of migrants who were deported to the El Salvador CECOT prison complex on March 15 and 16 shows that there is no evidence of any criminal history for around three-quarters of those individuals. Many family members of those who have been deported there also deny that they have links to gangs.

By refusing to allow these individuals the ability to challenge their deportations, the administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. 

The judge's decree does not apply to all immigrants who were deported to El Salvador, but is narrowly focused on those who were removed from the U.S. based on the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that Trump made earlier this year — individuals like Kilmar Abrego García, whose deportation is similarly questionable but was based on other rationales, are not affected by Boasberg's ruling.

Boasberg left open the possibility that some deportations could be viewed as justifiable if the administration allowed individuals to challenge their deportations.

“Perhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But — and this is the critical point — there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government's say-so,” Boasberg wrote. 

How to provide the deported migrants their due process “will be determined in future proceedings,” the judge added.

Boasberg was also mindful of the incredibly dangerous precedent that could be created by allowing the administration's actions to remain unchallenged.

“Absent this relief” from his ruling, Boasberg said, “The Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.”

It's unclear what appellate courts may do next with the case. While the Supreme Court has authorized, at least temporarily, the administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants living in the U.S., the high court also ruled in April that those subjected to his actions must be given the ability to challenge his ability to do so. 

Several legal experts praised Boasberg's ruling.

“[This is an] important moment for the rule of law and against government lawlessness,” Ryan Goodman, co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, wrote in a Bluesky post.

Noting that “details [of the case still need] to be worked out” — chiefly, how the deported migrants may see their individual cases remedied — constitutional law professor and political commentator Harry Litman applauded Boasberg for stating in his ruling that “violations must be remedied.”

This was a “big important decision,” Litman added.

Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations that is representing the migrants in the lawsuit, also celebrated the order by Boasberg.

“Today's ruling affirms what every American knows: in the United States, people are entitled to due process and no one should be removed from the country without it,” Perryman said. “We will continue to oppose this administration's attempts to re-write the Constitution.”
