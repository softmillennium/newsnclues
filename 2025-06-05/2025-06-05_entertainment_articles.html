Ryan Coogler is ready to work with one of his heroes: Denzel Washington. Washington previously let it slip in November 2024 that Coogler wrote a role for him; however, the third MCU franchise film has still not been formally announced by Marvel. Coogler told NBA legend Carmelo Anthony that he has been trying to work with Washington “since day one.” “Denzel is family at this point…I've been trying to work with him since day one. I think he's the greatest living actor, and in terms of what he means to our culture, forget about it. Related Stories Notes from a Feature Directorial Debut: Evan Ari Kelman Dives Deep Into the Making of ‘Barron's Cove' Cannes 2025 Films Sold So Far: 1-2 Special Acquires Simón Mesa Soto's Dark Comedy ‘A Poet' Coogler said there's a lot of false stuff out there, especially about Coogler himself and his work, to the point that he doesn't read Wikipedia anymore. But what Washington said was truthful, and yet Coogler was still “surprised” that Washington went public with the news, even well before anything is set in stone: “I was surprised that when he mentioned it [‘Black Panther 3'], but it's not like it's not true,” he said. Washington had said on Australian “Today” (via Variety) in 2024 that Coogler was “writing a part for me in the next ‘Black Panther,'” which would be one of his last roles. “After that, I'm going to do the film ‘Othello.' After that, I'm going to do King Lear. After that, I'm going to retire,” Washington said at the time. Washington is next starring in “Highest 2 Lowest,” which reunites him with Coogler's mentor and advocate Spike Lee. That trailer — the monologue Denzel doing…he's in rare form. I just can't put no words to how excited I am, man, because when [Lee] and Denzel get together, it's always a masterpiece,” Coogler said during the podcast. I'm just paying him back with interest, bro. Just don't expect Washington or Lee to have any cameos in the “Sinners” cinematic universe: Coogler already said there most likely won't be a sequel to “Sinners.” “I wanted the movie to feel like a full meal: your appetizers, starters, entrees, and desserts, I wanted all of it there. I wanted it to be a holistic and finished thing,” Coogler told Ebony Magazine. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

After starring in Amazon MGM Studios' action movie G20, Viola Davis is once again teaming up with the streamer, this time for a conspiracy thriller titled Ally Clark. Phillip Noyce, a veteran of the thriller genre with movies such as Clear and Present Danger, Salt and Rabbit Proof Fence on his resume, will direct the feature that will be produced by Irwin Winkler, the veteran producer behind Rocky, Goodfellas and The Alto Knights. Davis is on the producing team as well, along with Julius Tennon, her husband and partner at the duo's JuVee Productions. 'G20' Review: Viola Davis Does Her Swaggering Part as a President Under Duress in Silly but Serviceable Prime Video Popcorn Thriller The script, which was written by Ruisanchez and Irwin Winkler, centers on an investigator names Ally Clark, to be played by Davis, who, per the studio, embarks on a perilous inquiry into an international conglomerate following the suspicious death of a close friend. Davis' G20 proved to be a nice little hit for Amazon's Prime Video when it was released in April, landed the number one spot on Nielsen's movie chart debut week with 516 million minutes streamed. Davis starred in the movie and her JuVee banner produced it. Davis, who has EGOT status through her Oscar, Emmy, Grammy, and multi-Tony Award wins, is repped by CAA and Lasher Group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED, with additional back and forth: Donald Trump and Elon Musk exchanged bitter comments and accusations throughout the day on Thursday, as an all-out feud broke out between the most powerful man on Earth and the world's richest man. After a series of attacks from Musk, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!” He also wrote that Musk was “wearing thin” and that he “asked him to leave” his official White House post. Trump wrote, “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do! Musk, meanwhile, called Trump's post about being asked to leave “an obvious lie” and “so sad.” “That is the real reason they have not been made public. He added, “Mark this post for the future. It was only last week that Trump and Musk appeared in the Oval Office as a sendoff for the billionaire as he stepped away from his official government role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. But since then, Musk has gone on a tirade about the president's chief legislative effort, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier in the Oval Office, Trump made his first public comments about Trump's broadside against the bill. “Elon and I have a great relationship,” Trump said. “I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised, because you were here, everyone in this room practically was here as we had a wonderful sendoff. But as cable networks carried Trump's comments, Musk responded to the president, at times refuting his claims. As Musk has railed against Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the past 48 hours, White House officials have tried to point out where they think Musk is wrong. But that did not stop Musk's criticisms on X. Trump told reporters that Musk “knew the inner workings” of the bill, and “never had a problem until right after he left.” “People leave my administration and they love us, and at some point they miss it so badly,” Trump said. Musk responded, “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” Just before Trump spoke to reporters, Musk posted one of Trump's past tweets from 2012, in which he wrote, “No member of Congress should be eligible for re-election if our country's budget is not balanced— deficits not allowed!” Musk has called for a “slim beautiful bill,” as the current legislation encompassed tax cuts, border security funding and defense all in one massive piece of legislation. Musk posted on X, apparently in response, “Whatever. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Trump said that it was because Isaacman “happened to be a Democrat,” something that he did not think was “appropriate.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Dancing With the Stars” alum Brooke Burke is in a long-term relationship with Scott Rigsby, and the couple has been engaged since September 2021. They should have celebrated their wedding day last week, but had to make the tough decision to postpone, and now Burke is opening up about why they did that. In an interview with Page Six on May 28, which was published on June 4, Burke was asked about her wedding day, and she revealed that it was meant to be that day. She confirmed that “actually no one knew,” that they had confirmed the date, but they were filled with sadness about not having the ceremony. “Today when I woke up, we were both, like, [crying],” she told Page Six. Burke also discussed how the last few years had been “weird” for her and Rigsby, and that after being engaged for almost four years, she felt it was “almost embarrassing” when people ask about when she will get married. She doesn't want to stay engaged forever. Burke confirmed that she and Rigsby would like to have their wedding before the end of 2025. The topic of wedding planning has been something Burke has been asked about several times in the last few weeks. She also revealed why May 28 was so special to her (so could 2026 be the year she says “I do?”). “I had a really weird wish — because I'm a little bit weird — to get married on 5/28, which is the frequency of love,” she told People. Burke again commented on how they had been busy and the date had to be pushed back again. But she teased, “We gotta do it next year.” The actress referred to herself as being “slow” to get married, but when she does, it's going to be a memorable occasion. “It's got to be big,” she told People. She continued, “We want to do something different and innovative and show people how to make a difference. But it's not just about writing checks, it's about having fun, telling your story, living out loud, participating.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has been waging a full-throated campaign against Donald Trump's “big, beautiful” reconciliation bill, calling the keystone of the president's legislative agenda a “disgusting abomination” while trying to rally senators to oppose it. Trump added that Musk didn't have a problem with the bill until after he left the administration, and suggested the world's richest man may have developed a case of so-called Trump Derangement Syndrome. People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly,” Trump said. I don't know what it is. Musk escalated his criticism of the bill, which includes massive cuts to social services like Medicaid in order to fund tax cuts for the rich, on Tuesday, writing on X that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk seems to be upset that the bill is expected to add trillions to the national deficit, although some, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La. ), have wondered whether he is actually upset that the bill will strip electric vehicle tax credits, which have helped his car company, Tesla. “Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here,” the president said, adding that “he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate,” he said of Musk. Musk responded to Trump in real time on X in what turned into an hours-long onslaught against his former BFF. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” he wrote. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Musk then really hit Trump where it hurts. “Such ingratitude,” he added before continuing to rant about Trump and the bill throughout Thursday afternoon. Musk even suggested Trump is a pedophile. “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Tesla's stock price plummeted during Musk's meltdown over Trump and the tax bill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They'd go on to become one of the most influential art-house bands in music history, leaving fans with tons of iconic songs over the decades. “Psycho Killer” ended up on the band's 1977 album Talking Heads: 77 but never got a video — until now. The newly released visuals were directed by Mike Mills and star actress Saoirse Ronan, following her as she goes through a spectrum of emotions before eventually losing it a little bit. “We  LOVE what this video is NOT – it's not literal, creepy, bloody, physically violent or obvious.” To coincide with the anniversary, the band has announced the super deluxe edition of their album More Songs About Buildings and Food.

McG will direct the project, titled Shout It Out Loud, which is being fully financed by STX. The band first formed in 1970s New York and became known for its glam rock look, always performing in face paint and elaborate costumes. Their performances included theatrical elements like pyrotechnics, rockets, spitting blood and smoke.

Talking Heads are celebrating their 50th anniversary by releasing the first-ever video for “Psycho Killer.” The band enlisted the great Mike Mills to direct, with Saoirse Ronan starring as an office worker who dances, squirms, shudders, and screams through her daily routine. “This video makes the song better,” the band said in a press release. “We LOVE what this video is NOT—it's not literal, creepy, bloody, physically violent or obvious.” Watch it below, and stay tuned for Talking Heads' ongoing celebrations of the 50 years since their formation.

Mills, who previously directed the National's I Am Easy to Find short film, said Talking Heads' debut album, Talking Heads: 77, “literally changed what was possible in life for me.” He went on, “To get to play with the subversive, uncategorizable beauty of Talking Heads, and to play with Saoirse who brought so much surprise, power, vulnerability and mischief to the party, it's one of the best things I ever got to be a part of—still can't believe it actually happened.”

Ronan added, “To simply be mentioned in the same breath as Talking Heads is hands down one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me, let alone making a video with the singular Mike Mills to accompany one of their most iconic songs—‘Psycho Killer.' I have grown up listening to their music, so this truly is a childhood/teenage/lifelong dream come true. Mike, myself and the rest of the creative team had so much fun making this, and I can't wait for Talking Heads fans to see it!”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Locked in a legal war with Jay-Z, attorney Tony Buzbee is now quoting the star's lyrics from “Big Pimpin” in his latest court filings, claiming they describe the rapper's views on “how men should treat women.” Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) and Buzbee have been battling for months after the Texas lawyer filed shocking rape allegations against him last year. Those claims, which the star denied, were quickly dropped – and now Jay is suing the attorney for defamation and extortion across two different court cases. Big Machine Label Group to Celebrate 20 Years With Nashville Concert Seeking to dismiss one of them, Buzbee took an unusual step Wednesday: directly quoting from decades-old lyrics in his legal filings. “Carter's latest pleading bemoans what he describes as the ‘incredibly painful' event of explaining [the rape] allegations to ‘his wife' and ‘their children,'” Buzbee writes. “To put those allegations in their proper context, it is helpful to view them alongside the following lyrics from one of Carter's most successful songs, which became famous nationwide around the time [the accuser] claims her sexual assault occurred.” “Released more than 25 years ago, this song of Carter's, like many of the others that made him famous, contains lyric after lyric describing Carter's views on the loss of innocence and how men should treat women,” Buzbee writes in the filing. Jay-Z himself has previously expressed regret about the lyrics to “Big Pimpin',” which reached No. “Some [lyrics] become really profound when you see them in writing. Efforts have been made to ban rap from criminal cases, and a group of law scholars recently warned that Drake's civil lawsuit – claiming the lyrics to Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us” defamed him – is “dangerous” and could have a “chilling effect” on future artists. The case against Jay-Z, filed in December, claimed that he and Sean “Diddy” Combs raped a 13-year-old Jane Doe at an after-party following the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z forcefully denied the allegations, calling them a “blackmail attempt” by Buzbee and his client. And after just two months of heated litigation, the accuser dropped her case without a settlement payment. In Wednesday's filing, the Texas lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss the Alabama case, calling it a “clear attempt by Carter to punish his accuser and silence potential accusers.” And he cited the “Big Pimpin'” lyrics, using them to suggest that Jay-Z was being hypocritical when he said he “mourns his children's loss of innocence.” In a statement to Billboard on Thursday, Buzbee said: “Mr. At the same time they've vainly attempted to portray Mr. Carter as a bastion of virtue. I'm a Marine Corps Captain who served my country in the infantry and recon during two conflicts. As reported by Rolling Stone, the judge hinted in February that he might dismiss Jay-Z's extortion claims while allowing the defamation claim against Buzbee to move ahead. Following new evidence about recorded conversations and a heated April hearing, the judge is still currently mulling whether and how the case should proceed.

While Stahelski and co-writer Mike Finch have developed a story for “John Wick 5,” the franchise director is skeptical of whether or not the film will actually get made. In fact, he hasn't even brought the concept to lead star Keanu Reeves yet — despite Lionsgate announcing in April 2025 that Reeves would be back in the role. Related Stories Ryan Coogler Confirms He Wrote a Part for Denzel Washington in ‘Black Panther 3': ‘There's No Fiction Out There' Notes from a Feature Directorial Debut: Evan Ari Kelman Dives Deep Into the Making of ‘Barron's Cove' Stahelski now told THR that he is unsure if a possible fifth film could even be “satisfying” to make. “Me and Mike Finch — the writer on ‘4' who's also writing ‘5' — we've got a pretty good story that I think is cool. When asked by THR why there is a continuation of the franchise with Reeves even after the fourth film “ended so well,” Stahelski said, “I'm with you, man. We finished ‘3' and thought that was going to be the last one.” He continued, “Look, we never expected to end ‘John Wick.' So when we got to ‘4,' we wanted to have something that had a lot of fate and consequence. The ending was going to be a cliffhanger. Then we were sitting in Japan [during the filming of ‘4'] going, ‘We didn't stick the landing.' ‘Fuck, we got to finish this, right?' So I was really happy with the way ‘4' ended. I didn't want to overstay our welcome.” Stahelski added, “If we go down the road of ‘John Wick 5' and build this story and decide this isn't right, there are probably going to be 10 other things we'll discover that we'll use for other things. It's being in the room riffing with people we love. However, Stahelski's vision for the process of potentially making the film might be at odds with what Lionsgate wants. “The studio would very much will it into existence, I'm sure, at some point,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word. The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.” Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee. Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. “Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet.</p>
