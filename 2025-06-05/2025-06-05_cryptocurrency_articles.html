                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle's long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg. The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later. Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC$101,461.56, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead. However, Circle's core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they're moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance. Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. Circle's IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[June 5, 2025] – Venom Foundation, a leading provider of sovereign-grade blockchain infrastructure, issued a public invitation to central banks and financial regulators across Southeast Asia to co-develop compliant, future-ready digital financial systems aligned with national priorities and designed for regional interoperability. Addressing institutions such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Bank Negara Malaysia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the State Bank of Vietnam, the Foundation outlined its vision for a sovereign-compatible Layer-0 blockchain that can support cross-border payments, real-time settlements, and regulatory transparency at scale. “Our mission is to empower governments and institutions through next-generation blockchain technology, strengthening their sovereign capabilities and unlocking new opportunities for their citizens.” Southeast Asia has become one of the world's most dynamic financial corridors. In 2023, the Philippines alone accounted for 4.75% of global remittance inflows, while digital payment volumes in the region are expected to reach 765 billion transactions by 2027. However, despite this rapid growth, financial systems remain fragmented. Payment networks operate in isolation, settlements are delayed, and reconciliation often depends on outdated, manual processes. These inefficiencies drive up costs, slow innovation, and limit oversight for regulators. Venom Foundation views this as a strategic opportunity for governments in the region to modernize their infrastructure using blockchain technology built specifically for the public sector. The infrastructure currently supports a range of public-sector use cases. One of the core applications is stablecoin issuance, starting with a USD-backed digital currency USDV, with further plans to introduce local currency-based stablecoins across Southeast Asia. Broader regional deployment is planned for 2025, focusing on a dedicated cross-border payment and settlement layer. This layer is designed to facilitate stablecoin transfers between government and banking entities, enhancing transaction speed, transparency, and system resilience. The governance structure behind this initiative ensures that national institutions retain oversight, with partial validator control delegated to designated public-sector entities. Venom Foundation provides blockchain infrastructure tailored for sovereign and institutional adoption. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Venom is focused on building compliant, scalable systems that align with national and regional priorities across Asia and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian national Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, was allegedly held from May 6 to 23 in a luxury apartment on Prince Street for by John Woeltz and William Duplessie, who stand charged with tying up Carturan and torturing him for his digital wallet containing an estimated $28m in digital currency, according to cops. Carturan's reclusive parents, Maurizio and Lidia, only learned of the kidnap on May 25 when a family friend, Pietro Zucchetti, informed them, according to sources. However, the family were seemingly on high alert and had recently hired private security, according to a source, who also said they had put their $1m home in Rivoli, near Turin, up for sale. A neighbor told The Post Carturan has recently started travelling around the world a lot, although they said they had no idea what line of business he was in. Carturan had previously worked on Zucchetti's farm, and he described him as a “curious young man, not one to seek out trouble.” Videos which show Carturan seemingly partaking in parties at the house and talking about drugs were published this week by TMZ, although in some videos he appears to be restrained to a wheelchair or led by a leash around his neck. No missing person report was filed by Carturan's family, who were shocked when they found out what had happened to him and immediately went to ground. Carturan's father Maurizio – an author who has written 10 books about alchemy and spirituality – deleted all of his social media accounts and closed the family's shop selling herbal remedies. Carturan escaped from the alleged ordeal on May 23 and flagged down a nearby traffic cop. He was taken to hospital, where he was treated for injuries sustained from allegedly being pistol-whipped, dangled from the top of a staircase, urinated on and having his arms and legs cut with a chainsaw. Woeltz was arrested the same day, Duplessie a few days later. Woeltz, dubbed the Crypto King of Kentucky, is said to have a private jet and live a high octane party lifestyle alongside Duplessie. They are both held in custody on charges including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault and weapons possession. At Duplessie's arraignment last week his lawyer claimed the criminal case will “begin to unravel” as more details come out.</p>

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. “While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month. Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ETH futures show weak bullish sentiment despite strong ETF inflows. More upside appears limited due to weak network activity and competitors like Solana. Total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured by total value locked (TVL), fell to 25.1 million ETH on June 5, marking a 17% decline from the previous month. This suggests that Ethereum's edge over rivals is gradually eroding. However, this overlooks the fact that average network fees on Ethereum climbed 150% month-over-month. This fee increase amplifies the protocol's burn mechanism, reducing ETH's inflationary pressure. DEX activity rises, but Solana beats Ethereum by volume Although this trend supports Ether's price, rival networks like BNB Chain and Solana have expanded their share of DEX activity. BNB Chain led in DEX volume growth, though this advantage is less significant due to the network's extremely low fees. Lower costs make it easier to artificially inflate activity, making comparisons with Solana and Ethereum somewhat misleading. Even after adjusting for this distortion, however, Solana's DEX volume has surpassed Ethereum's. This shift raises questions about whether ETH still maintains a competitive edge. Notably, top-performing decentralized applications like Hyperliquid and Pump are choosing to launch their own blockchains instead of building on Ethereum layer-2 solutions or using alternatives such as Solana. Futures markets for Ether offer insight into professional traders' sentiment. As of June 5, the Ether futures premium dropped to 5%, down from 6% a week earlier. Thus, concluding that institutional demand for Ether is waning would be inaccurate. Between May 22 and June 4, US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $700 million in net inflows. Notably, there hasn't been a single day of net outflows in that three-week period, reinforcing the strength of the $2,500 support level. Thus, while demand for ETH remains, particularly from institutions, other metrics suggest that the bulls will probably be unable to break $3,000 in the near term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the spotlight in Web3 remains fixed on ETFs, token listings, and stablecoin frameworks, a quieter but equally consequential evolution is taking shape at the edge of global commerce. Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore extended Project Guardian, testing tokenized trade finance and digital asset settlement with banks including JPMorgan, DBS, and Standard Chartered. Hong Kong Monetary Authority also launched Project Ensemble to develop innovative financial market infrastructure enabling seamless interbank settlement of tokenised money, initially focusing on tokenised deposits to support the growth of Hong Kong's tokenisation market. On the protocol side, DeFi-native projects like Centrifuge are tokenizing invoices and short-term credit, while firms like Enclave Markets are developing encrypted execution environments for confidential trading. Blockchain-based systems flip that dynamic by anchoring records on cryptographically secure, shared ledgers. As David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, puts it: “When counterparties from different jurisdictions can rely on cryptographically secured records rather than opaque intermediaries, the trust barrier that typically adds friction and cost to international trade diminishes significantly.” He adds that, “At Enclave, we use secure enclave technology to enable privacy-preserving verification. This means counterparties can validate critical deal terms or performance metrics without exposing sensitive business data. It's a foundational shift - you get transparency and confidentiality at the same time, something legacy systems just aren't built for.” Where platforms like the now-defunct TradeLens stumbled due to governance limitations, decentralized or privacy-preserving infrastructure offers an alternative. Enclave, for instance, uses secure enclave hardware to enable private yet verifiable trades - part of a broader movement that includes confidential computing platforms and zero-knowledge middleware. Smart contracts don't just log terms - they execute them. When conditions are met (e.g., delivery confirmed via oracle or IoT sensor), payment flows instantly. If conditions fail, penalties or reversions execute without legal intervention. This mechanism is already live in parts of the DeFi world. As reported, Maker's RWA vaults now account for a significant share of its fee income. Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare, frames it this way: “Banks shift from paperwork gatekeepers to liquidity nodes, and insurers underwrite only risks the code can't cover.” He continues: “In our real estate tokenization work, we've shown how anchoring legal agreements - like mortgage registration or loan collateralization - on-chain creates enforceable economic rights that are provable in real time. This reduces the need for buffer escrows and limits disputes. The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has also launched the MENA region's first government-backed tokenized real estate platform, Prypco Mint, which enables fractional ownership of Dubai properties by minting real estate title deed tokens. This is supported by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), marking the first time a government real estate authority in the Middle East has implemented a public blockchain-based tokenization of property title deeds, pioneering a more accessible, transparent, and efficient real estate market. Perhaps the most profound shift is this: trade agreements, once enshrined in legalese and negotiated by diplomats, are now being expressed as code. MAS' Project Guardian is piloting asset tokenization and real-time DvP with institutional players. And we're just scratching the surface - as more data sources and real-time proofs come online, I think blockchain-based finance will become the default operating system for trade, not an optional enhancement.” The results: fewer intermediaries, faster time to cash, and real-time visibility across jurisdictions. But programmable finance rewires that system to depend on logic, not legacy. To be clear, this transition is still in its early innings. It's a new form of enforceable, exportable trust—written in code, and verified on-chain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US president is leveraging his position for personal gain by exploiting an industry known for lack of transparency and fraud Thanks to The Apprentice show that made him a reality TV star, the US president slapped his name on real estate projects around the world built by other companies – along with Trump-branded steaks, vodka, deodorant and bottled water. Many of these businesses ultimately failed, but Trump rarely invested his own funds and he still walked away with hefty licensing fees. Days before his inauguration for a second term on 20 January, Trump's family business launched a meme coin, called $TRUMP, which is a type of digital currency often connected to an online joke or mascot. The coin quickly soared in value up to $75 per token, but it crashed days later. No matter the ultimate price, Trump and his family rake in millions of dollars in fees as the coin is traded by speculators hoping to turn a quick profit, or those trying to curry favor with him. It's difficult to keep up with all the ways that Trump is corrupting the US presidency and using it for personal profit, but his crypto ventures are among the most dangerous because they potentially allow him and his family to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign investors and governments that would normally have a harder time funneling money to a US politician. While he is exempt from conflict of interest laws that ban federal employees from profiting off their positions, every US president since the 1970s had voluntarily abided by these rules – until Trump. Previous occupants of the White House either sold their financial holdings or set them aside in blind trusts. Since Trump's first term, his family business has also evolved beyond a real estate conglomerate that licenses the Trump name to hotels, luxury towers and golf courses around the world, earning millions of dollars in branding and management fees without investing its own funds in most projects. The business now includes a portfolio of social media and crypto ventures, providing Trump with new ways to profit from being in office. And Trump is more emboldened to ignore norms set by past presidents, thanks to a compliant Congress led by Republicans and a US supreme court ruling last year which gave Trump “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president. Trump's foray into cryptocurrency underscores the ways he can leverage the presidency for personal gain by exploiting his sense of impunity and an industry that is notorious for fraud and a lack of transparency. Once that contest was underway, the $TRUMP coin got a new round of media attention and its value jumped by more than 50%. Since the meme coin's launch in January, Trump-affiliated businesses received $312m from crypto sales and $43m in other fees, according to a Washington Post analysis of trading data. Of course, US presidents for decades have used private dinners and gatherings to grant special access to wealthy donors and raise funds for their political parties or their own campaigns. But campaign contributions carry legal restrictions on how they can be spent, and US donors can't remain anonymous and must disclose all of their donations to political candidates. The sweepstakes dinner organized by Trump's crypto business was not a fundraiser or campaign event – it was a gathering arranged to directly enrich him and his family. While Trump's crypto business has refused to release a list of those invited to last month's dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, media organizations compiled lists of attendees that included foreign citizens who would normally be forbidden from donating funds to US politicians. (The Washington Post found that nearly half of the top 220 Trump meme coin holders purchased their coins from crypto exchanges that reject US-based customers, meaning they are likely foreign buyers. And 19 of the top 25 buyers, who were invited to a VIP reception with Trump before the dinner on 22 May, and a “special tour” the next day, had bought coins from similar exchanges.) After Trump won the November election, Sun bought $75m in World Liberty tokens, and he was named an adviser to the company. World Liberty is at the heart of another foreign entanglement – and potential conflict of interest – for Trump and the crypto industry. On 1 May, the president's son Eric and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy), announced that an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi would invest $2bn using a stablecoin – a form of digital currency – offered by World Liberty. Years before he got into the business, Trump had dismissed cryptocurrencies as “a scam” which have values that are “based on thin air”. But Trump changed his tune dramatically when he met with the highest-paying customers of his personal meme coin at last month's dinner. And then the president promised to do things differently: “There is a lot of sense in crypto. Last year, a federal judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the now bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, to 25 years in prison for perpetuating one of the largest financial frauds in modern history, and bilking his customers out of billions of dollars.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thursday's filing is a significant step for Trump Media's move into the cryptocurrency space. The media company, of which President Trump is a majority stakeholder, announced in January it was expanding into financial services and would offer investment products through a newly created fintech platform, Truth.Fi. Last week, Trump Media said it will spend $2.32 billion to create a bitcoin treasury, issuing equity to fund the initiative. Trump announced the creation of a national strategic bitcoin reserve earlier this year. The president appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to a newly created White House role of crypto czar, and his pick for SEC chair is well-known crypto lawyer Paul Atkins. Read more: How would Trump's strategic bitcoin reserve work? The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up nearly 50% over the past year and rose as high as over $109,000 in January. But the price also plummeted below $80,000 in April as Trump's trade war roiled the stock market before it recovered again. Trump Media stock fell 2% Thursday morning and is down 54% over the past year. The new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital — a New Jersey-based affiliate of asset manager Yorkville Advisors — and will track the price of the cryptocurrency. Earlier this week, NYSE Group submitted regulatory paperwork to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain gambling is reshaping the digital world of iGaming. Yet only 23% of traditional iGaming providers have added blockchain-based elements to their products. Our close observation of this technological rise shows that blockchain technology offers exceptional transparency and trust that regular online casino methods can't match.The decentralized structure makes it harder for hackers to compromise gaming systems. Cryptocurrency payments in online casinos also process faster and cost less than traditional methods. This piece will tap into the full potential of blockchain's genuine transparency for iGaming operators. Traditional online casinos keep their outcomes hidden, but blockchain creates an open record that no one can alter once it's recorded. Provably Fair Gaming stands as the most important breakthrough. Players can check each game's outcome through algorithms instead of trusting the casino blindly. AdvertisementSmart contracts also handle gambling processes automatically without human involvement. These self-executing contracts manage everything from how games work to paying out winnings based on clear conditions. So the chances of operators interfering or manipulating results are almost zero.The benefits are clear, blockchain replaces trust in operators with math and cryptographic proof.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This means blockchain can be embedded into real-time gaming environments, opening up new possibilities for game creators. By bridging Cardano's blockchain with Unreal Engine, developers can now put on-chain assets directly into 3D worlds, creating decentralized gaming ecosystems. Key features unlocked by this integration include token gated game experiences, native wallet interactions within games and decentralized in-game marketplaces. These features not only enhance gameplay but also give players true ownership of in-game items secured on the blockchain. The gaming industry is growing fast and blockchain platforms are trying to combine decentralization with interactive entertainment. Cardano's plugin addresses the growing demand for GameFi – the fusion of gaming and decentralized finance – by supporting wallet and transaction functionality inside Unreal Engine. It's still early days but this integration has huge potential for mainstream adoption. Cardano's plugin will also support NFT and token projects, developers can embed unique blockchain assets into their games. This means emerging tokens like SNEK meme coin can gain relevance in gaming. Other blockchain platforms like Pi Network are also entering the gaming space but Cardano's focus on developer experience and real-time interactions gives it an edge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream, analysts say, as a landmark regulatory bill makes its way through Congress. Stablecoins are a type of crypto asset that is tied to the value of another currency, such as the US dollar or gold. The landmark bill would provide a boost of legitimacy to the crypto industry and is another example of how cryptocurrencies have had a major revival under President Donald Trump's second term. Proponents of crypto have welcomed the focus on advancing stablecoin regulations. Yet critics have pointed to the Trump family's ties to the crypto industry: For example, World Liberty Financial, a company tied to the Trump family, has issued its own stablecoin. “A few years ago, we probably would have debated the accuracy of that sentence. While cryptocurrencies are known for being volatile and fluctuating in value, stablecoins are supposed to be, as their name suggests, stable. This is because stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to another asset. They are most often linked to the US dollar, making one stablecoin worth $1. For example, a company issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar could buy and hold high-quality assets like US government bonds. Two of the major stablecoin issuers are Tether, which issues USDT, and Circle, which issues USDC — and both of these stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to the dollar. Tether accounts for 62% of the total stablecoin market, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. The total market value of stablecoins surged from $20 billion in 2020 to $246 billion in May 2025, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank. Stablecoins emerged in 2014 as way for crypto investors to park their money while buying and selling other more volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Since then, Stablecoins have ballooned in popularity particularly for their potential use in digital payments, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University. Stablecoins, given their stable value, can serve as a medium of exchange and function as a digital currency. The crypto coins have emerged as useful in helping speed up payments. “Cross-border payments are providing the most exciting new use cases,” Duffie said. Stablecoins gained notoriety in 2022 when TerraUSD, an obscure type of coin called an algorithmic stablecoin, crashed in value and caused a panic among investors. There are also security risks like people forgetting the pass-code to their crypto wallet. Circle would likely benefit from increased regulation more than Tether as Circle is a US-based company while Tether is based in El Salvador, Del Wright, a professor at Louisiana State University Law School who specializes in crypto, told CNN. If the legislation passes, it could usher in mainstream adoption of stablecoins for digital payments and spur growth in the stablecoin industry, said Christian Catalini, founder of the cryptoeconomics lab at MIT. He added that traditional Wall Street firms and startups would also compete to offer stablecoins. Visa (V) in May announced a partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin company owned by fintech startup Stripe, to enable payments using stablecoin in countries across Latin America. “Stablecoins are on the cusp of mainstream adoption in 2025 as the US pushes forward with landmark legislation,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a May note.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine's most fraught ideas. According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos. That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. “We know much better now what to do,” says Egli. Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique—or perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it. In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby's genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos. Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn't fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli's and one at the Oregon Health & Science University. Those efforts have operated on a shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. “We would honestly welcome that,” says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health & Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. “More research is needed, and that takes people and money,” she says, adding that she doesn't mind if it comes from “tech bros.” But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary. Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded a 10-year moratorium on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and “introduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.” Armstrong did not reply to an email from MIT Technology Review seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by Forbes. The billionaire is already part of a wave of tech entrepreneurs who've made a splash in science and biology by laying down outsize investments, sometimes in far-out ideas. Armstrong previously cofounded New Limit, which Bloomberg calls a “life extension venture” and which this year raised a further $130 million to explore methods to reprogram old cells into an embryonic-like state. He started that company with Blake Byers, an investor who has said a significant portion of global GDP should be spent on “immortality” research, including biotech approaches and ways of uploading human minds to computers. Then, starting late last year, Armstrong began publicly telegraphing his interest in exploring a new venture, this time connected to assisted reproduction. In December, he announced on X that he and Byers were ready to meet with entrepreneurs working on “artificial wombs,” “embryo editing,” and “next-gen IVF.” What does that mean for the future of our species? Harrington says a venture group he helps run, called SciFounders, is also considering starting an embryo-editing company. “We share an interest in there being a company to empirically evaluate whether embryo editing can be done safely, and are actively exploring incubating a company to undertake this,” Harrington said in an email. Because of how rapidly gene editing is advancing, Harrington has also criticized bans and moratoria on the technology. By contrast, Armstrong's public declaration on X represents a more transparent approach. They want to put something together,” says Egli, who hopes the Coinbase CEO might fund some research at his lab. Two years later, in 2017, a report from Oregon claimed successful correction of a dangerous DNA mutation present in lab embryos made from patients' egg and sperm cells. More careful testing by Egli and others showed that CRISPR technology actually can cause havoc in a cell, often deleting large chunks of chromosomes. What looked at first like precise DNA editing was in fact a dangerous process causing unseen damage. While the public debate turned on the ethics of CRISPR babies—especially after three edited children were born in China—researchers were discussing basic scientific problems and how to solve them. That method causes fewer unexpected effects and, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change. Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it's done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change. Still, gene editing isn't quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong's company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out. Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing. The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical. Montana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the crypto and blockchain industry continues to evolve, institutional adoption has become a crucial driving force behind its growth. Despite a tumultuous first quarter for both traditional finance and crypto, the trend towards increased adoption shows no signs of slowing down. However, crypto and blockchain adoption continued to gain momentum, with institutions and investors increasingly recognizing the potential of these technologies to transform the financial landscape. The value of holding Bitcoin over the long term became undeniable, while companies that focused on financial services related to crypto found sustainable annual growth. As regulatory clarity begins to emerge, institutions are seeking trusted partners that can provide a secure and compliant environment for their investments. Hong Kong's HKMA and SFC guidance on crypto regulation is a prime example of this trend, demonstrating a growing recognition of the need for clear and consistent regulatory frameworks. With licenses across the world covering a wide range of activities, this provides a full spectrum of services and products to better align with the borderless nature of blockchain and crypto technology while mitigating risks and remaining compliant. A licensed provider has a deep understanding of both the TradFi and crypto spaces, allowing them to navigate the complex regulatory landscape with ease. This expertise is invaluable in ensuring that institutions are able to invest in crypto with confidence, knowing that their partner is fully compliant with all relevant regulations. Licensed crypto businesses offer institutions a heightened level of operational efficiency, as they are able to leverage established processes and protocols to streamline transactions and minimize risk. By partnering with a licensed provider, institutions can also benefit from enhanced reputation and credibility, as they are seen to be working with a trusted and regulated entity. Furthermore, licensed businesses provide institutions with access to a broader range of financial products and services, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and maximize returns in the crypto market. As regulatory clarity continues to emerge, institutions will increasingly demand higher standards of compliance from their partners. So it is essential to have a global license setup to position providers at the forefront of this trend, as institutions can rely on a trusted and reliable partner for their investments. Institutions will increasingly seek to integrate crypto into their existing investment strategies, and providers that can offer a reliable and compliant experience will be best positioned to capitalize on this trend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors who have managed to enter the top 10% on the XRP rich list could see some impressive gains when XRP finally reaches a two-digit price. Notably, the crypto market recently entered another consolidation phase, and XRP followed suit, dropping to again retest the $2.2 price level. This comes after the altcoin failed to capitalize on the earlier Bitcoin (BTC) upsurge that pushed its price to new all-time highs last month. However, analysts believe an imminent drop in Bitcoin dominance is on the horizon. With the market expecting the altcoin season to take shape soon, several market watches have projected price targets for assets such as XRP. For instance, analyst DK64Trades suggested last month that he is sure XRP will eventually break above $10. For context, a $10 price would represent a 354% increase from the current price, and while most proponents believe this target is conservative, the consensus is that XRP could claim it soon. At this price, investors could witness impressive gains depending on the amount of XRP they hold. Community commentators like Edoardo Farina have consistently charged investors to accumulate at least 10,000 XRP tokens. In previous instances, Farina also suggested that investors amass enough XRP tokens to at least enter the top 10% on the XRP rich list. Notably, these tokens are currently worth $5,456 at XRP's current price of $2.2. If prices surge to $10, these 2,480 XRP tokens will be worth $24,800, a yield of $19,344. However, it bears mentioning that not all investors within the top 10% on XRP rich list hold exactly 2,480 XRP, as this is merely the least amount to hold to enter this elite group. If XRP hits $10, this investment will hit $87,700, a profit of over $68,000. DisClamier: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain that verify ownership and authenticity—essentially, a way to prove that a digital item is truly one-of-a-kind. Between January and July 2020, five digital sports cards sold for $36,000 or more. Unlike traditional digital files, NFTs can't be duplicated in a meaningful way—even if someone takes a screenshot, they don't own the underlying asset. At the time, the concept was still new to many, often met with skepticism and confusion. Questions like, “If I screenshot your NFT, doesn't that make it mine?” were common. But as the world began returning to normal, the hype seemed to fade. While not disappearing entirely, sports card NFTs quickly became more of an afterthought than the next big thing. Fast forward to March 2025, and the sports card NFT market seems to have a pulse—one that's gone largely unnoticed by most. Panini, a major player in the trading card world, now runs a blockchain-based NFT marketplace featuring exclusive digital pack drops. Collectors can buy, rip, and resell cards instantly on the platform. In fact, three of the top five NFT sales were LeBron cards, totaling nearly $40,000 combined. A Victor Wembanyama Gold Kaboom /10 that went for $6,000 and a Jayden Daniels Gold Kaboom /10 that sold for $3,500. Just this morning, Panini launched its 2024 Obsidian Football digital packs—and they sold out within minutes. The rapid sellout has sparked debate once again: is this just another hype-driven fad, or is the digital card space here to stay? These Obsidian packs are loaded with sought-after case hits like Kabooms, Colorblasts, Stained Glass, Downtowns, and more. Many of these rare pulls have already started hitting the NFT marketplace. A Caleb Williams Green Horizontal Kaboom 1/1 recently sold for $3,500, while a Jayden Daniels Blue Obsidian Rookie /25 went for $175, and a Brock Bowers Kaboom /25 changed hands for just $60. As the dust settles, it'll be interesting to see how these exclusive digital cards are valued over time. The bigger question looms: is this surge in digital pack demand a healthy evolution of the hobby—or just another flash-in-the-pan get-rich-quick scheme? Your collection deserves a community.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yes, while the document gave way to Bitcoin's launch later that year, it wasn't until 2010 that Bitcoin was first used for a real life transaction. In a recent interview, Binance CEO Richard Teng reflected on how much crypto has evolved, noting that “Fifteen years ago, crypto was about buying a pizza. Today, it's about building robust payment systems, stablecoins, and real-life use cases that change lives.” Adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies also continues to grow as well. However, as the 2010s progressed, crypto's user base began to steadily widen. For one, access, availability, and education about cryptocurrencies increased significantly during this time frame. The rise of user-friendly crypto exchanges like Binance played a major role with this factor. The community of active cryptocurrency users also expanded demographically during this time. Yet even as blockchain economy participants grew from just a handful at the onset, to hundreds of millions of users worldwide by 2020, by-and-large mainstream financial institutions and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines, due to the space's underdeveloped regulatory framework. It wasn't until starting last year, when regulatory clarity in markets like the U.S. and Europe, started to emerge. Once this happened, crypto made a full leap into the financial mainstream. Crypto usage has come a long way from the famed pizza order that first demonstrated its real-world utility. Today, scores of large and small businesses worldwide accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Some countries, most notably El Salvador, have even officially made Bitcoin legal tender. As usability increases so has the value of Bitcoin at each Pizza Day. Demand for the availability of crypto-based payment options among consumers continues to rise as well. With this, the number of retailers accepting crypto as a payment method is expected to increase dramatically going forward. Take, for example, the experience of Sergio, a Mexican Binance user who detailed his experience using crypto for the first time to pay a restaurant bill. According to Codi, not only was his payment via stablecoin USDT “incredibly convenient;” the exchange rate using this method was more favorable than what his local bank offered. In the case of Vietnamese crypto user Andy, we can see that not only are crypto-based payments anything but complicated, they can be a useful solution in a jam. If not for his crypto account, Andy wouldn't have been able to make an urgent cross-border payment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among the minority, SPX6900 (SPX), DeXe Protocol (DEXE), and PancakeSwap (CAKE) record mild gains as Coinbase adds CAKE to the asset roadmap, increasing the listing chances, and DEXE announces a writer's guild program to incentivize its promotion. On the 4-hour timeframe, the lows on May 12, May 31, and June 2 compose a support trendline, while the lower high trend in Bitcoin after its reversal from its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 shapes a declining trendline. The indicator shows significant room for growth but an indecisive trend in motion. Conversely, an upside reversal closing above the trendline (Wednesday's high at $106,000) could move BTC to $108,797. This warns of an early reversal before reaching the most immediate resistance level as trend momentum declines. The price action shows an upside turnaround from the weekly low at $2.21 on Saturday from a long-standing support trendline (formed by connecting the lows on March 11, April 6, and May 4). An upside continuation could challenge the $2.82 resistance level that has resulted in four bearish turnarounds so far in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Foundation Sets Treasury Strategy to Back DeFi, Cut Spending Over Time The Ethereum Foundation has published a new treasury policy that aims to reshape how its reserves are held and invested, seeking to rewrite the playbook in a way better suited to the on-chain world it helped create. Those prospects are projected to "earn acceptable returns on treasury assets" while staying "consistent with Ethereum's underlying principles," Hsiao-Wei Wang, co-executive director at the foundation, wrote Wednesday. The new policies formalize a lower spending trajectory and a rule-based approach for converting the foundation's Ethereum reserves into cash. It plans to achieve this by committing to reduced annual operating expenses and creating a predictable "glide path and baseline" toward spending, Wang explained. The foundation "expects to remain a long-term steward, but envisions its scope gradually narrowing," Wang claimed. For every quarter, the Ethereum Foundation will sell a portion of its Ethereum reserves based on the amount of cash required, converting the Ethereum to fiat through exchanges or on-chain swaps. Decrypt approached the Ethereum Foundation to learn more. The term is derived from and borrows core ideas in the Cypherpunk Manifesto, written by American programmer and mathematician Eric Hughes in 1993. In the manifesto, Hughes argues that privacy is essential for a free and open society. To keep it, individuals need to build practical defenses through cryptography and code, rather than relying on the authority of governments or corporations. The Ethereum Foundation echoes this, with Wang noting that privacy has "inherent network effects,” and yet has received "very little attention so far."
