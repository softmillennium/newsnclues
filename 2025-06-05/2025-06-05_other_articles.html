                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prosthetic bumps, secret surrogates and fake births – the Duchess's latest video has reignited wild speculation among social media sleuths Meghan writes: “Both of our children were a week past their due dates... so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn't work – there was only one thing left to do!” Some commentators – including The Telegraph's own Camilla Tominey – have weighed in to say that, in labour, dropping it “down down low” probably isn't the only thing left to do. For most women, in fact, the 40th week of a pregnancy is the point in their lives at which they'd be least likely to countenance such a move. The video, meanwhile, has only fuelled cruel rumours circulating on X, YouTube and Reddit: that Meghan was never really pregnant. According to these claims, she wore a “Moonbump” – a brand of prosthetic baby bump – for photo opportunities, and hired a surrogate to carry her two children, now aged six and four, who are sixth and seventh in line to the throne respectively. It should go without saying that these theories are both baseless and bonkers. Social media sleuths, however, claim to have analysed the video of Meghan and Harry dancing and taken it as further evidence that she was never pregnant at all. For instance, they cite the lumpen shape under her black dress as proof of a prosthetic belly. This is easily debunked when I ask a midwife: “This is likely to be cardiotocography [CTG] equipment, which continuously monitors the baby's heart rate and the mother's contractions,” she says. “We use it in higher risk labours [Meghan has spoken about how she has preeclampsia].” Two sensors are placed on the mother's abdomen and secured round her bump with a strap. One claims that if Meghan had truly been pregnant, she wouldn't have been wearing a cannula in what they call “a very weird place.” In reality, the Duchess's cannula, placed halfway up her arm, is standard practice. Another false claim insists that the Baby Mama Dance didn't become a trend until 2023 or 2024, despite online examples dating back to 2018. “Unless Harry & Meghan can predict the future, how were they doing a dance in 2021 when it didn't exist as a trend?” one social media user wrote. But Meghan wouldn't be the first pregnant woman whose weight gain appeared confined to her bump. It may not occur to most heavily pregnant women to film themselves twerking but, then, who can say they made it through an overdue pregnancy without behaviour that was at least a little out of character? “When you're that pregnant you don't care about looking bizarre.” Perhaps it seems odder still to have filmed this private moment – but Meghan was apparently partaking in an online trend in which thousands of other women posted similar videos. By posting a video with more “proof,” Meghan has inadvertently added fuel to the fire. There are some exceptions, where people can successfully dismiss conspiracy theories with humour and sarcasm, which is maybe what [Meghan] was attempting to do here.” “In an age where all videos are suspect in terms of being AI-manipulated, it creates an extra cloud of confusion,” van der Linden says. “It provides lots of material for people to cling onto, saying, ‘Look, she's wearing a prosthetic bump,' or suggesting videos are deepfakes.” For a woman who has spoken candidly about the devastating impact online trolling has had, these rumours must be particularly hard for Meghan to take. These, too, were extensively analysed, with anonymous users claiming her stomach was too “shiny” and looked like a prosthetic, and that the ultrasound picture, which did not have a date or name on it, was faked. Trolls pored over videos of Meghan on official royal duties for any slips, folds or odd movements as proof. The conspiracy theory initially appeared “on some obscure social media platform where people were congregating who hated Meghan and then made its way into the mainstream,” says van der Linden. You see the same with Beyoncé, for example [who was subject to similar trolling]. When they did have a photoshoot at Windsor two days after Archie's birth, some went so far as to claim the newborn shots were faked using a hyper-realistic doll, and that Kensington Palace posted a hastily deleted tweet announcing he was born via surrogate. Meghan later revealed that this pregnancy was marked by mental health struggles, making the cruel rumours an especially bitter pill to swallow. When it comes to wild theories about their family life, the couple's quest for privacy has become a double-edged sword. When they uploaded Meghan's twerking video, even if it wasn't meant as a response to the bizarre rumours, the couple must have known social media vigilantes would comb through it for clues.</p>

As Millar says, "When I was 7 we had Star Wars cards and Luke posing with a big smile, Han and Chewie pointing their weapons at us.

He's also been doing the Comicsgate YouTube guest circuit pushing the book to the vice signallers, and also had Rob Liefeld on his own Millar Time podcast last week. And Mark Millar reiterates that you can find him on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, "but I don't bother with the other ones, which seemed to become the Phantom Zone for all the craziest mofos who left Twitter!" Is that what you call Blue Sky thinking? He must get some angry click-throughs from that one. "SAM NICOLETTI hears a voice in his head the day before something bad happens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, scientists are calling for long-term investment in monitoring capability, so that they can make informed predictions about climate change. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Earth's energy imbalance is growing faster than anyone expected — and scientists don't understand why. To complicate matters several NASA satellites that provide the highest-resolution picture of this imbalance are nearing the end of their lives, and researchers fear their lone replacement isn't sufficient. "What we get from [these] satellites is roughly one decade faster data, so that's why it's so critical," Thorsten Mauritsen, a professor in the department of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden and the lead author of a commentary on the issue, told Live Science. Satellite data suggest Earth's energy imbalance has more than doubled over the past two decades, massively exceeding the increase predicted by climate models. In 2023, the imbalance reached 1.8 watts per square meter (0.16 watts per square foot), which was twice what models estimated based on rising greenhouse gas emissions, according to the commentary, which was published May 10 in the journal AGU Advances — but scientists still aren't sure why there has been such an increase in the imbalance recently. Related: 2 billion people could face chaotic and 'irreversible' shift in rainfall patterns if warming continues "We were starting to see this large trend in the last few years, and it just grew and grew," Mauritsen said. "We were both worried about the big trend, and then on the other hand that we are possibly about to lose capability to observe this." Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. For several years, researchers have puzzled over satellite readings of Earth's energy imbalance. But as the imbalance continued to grow faster than climate models could account for, scientists began to suspect that something bigger was happening. "When it just continued afterwards, I started to get worried," Mauritsen said. Earth's inflated energy imbalance is likely due to a decline in Earth's solar reflectivity — that is, in the amount of energy the planet radiates to space. This decline could be due to a number of reasons, Mauritsen said, including a reduction of reflective surfaces like ice sheets and a decrease in the quantity of reflective particles, or aerosols, from activities like shipping. Regardless of why Earth's energy imbalance is growing so rapidly, the implications are alarming. Earth's energy imbalance is also an important indicator of how far humans have pushed the climate system already, and of what it will take to balance it again. Satellite readings from 2024 indicate that the rate at which Earth's energy imbalance is growing has returned to levels predicted by climate models — but there's no telling what will happen in 2025 and beyond. "It may be in the coming years that we stay at these more expected levels," Mauritsen said. "If it does bounce up to those high levels [again], then I'm not sure where we're heading." To measure Earth's energy imbalance, scientists need satellites equipped with the right instruments. Four such satellites are currently operational and form part of NASA's CERES mission, and these are scheduled to be replaced in 2027 by the follow-on Libera mission, according to the new commentary. But Libera has only one satellite, and scientists worry that instrument failures could introduce gaps in the data, Mauritsen said — and without continuous and overlapping readings from different satellites, it will be much harder to piece together the evolution of Earth's energy imbalance. —Climate wars are approaching — and they will redefine global conflict —Kids born today are going to grow up in a hellscape, grim climate study finds Ocean temperature data give some indication of Earth's energy imbalance, but these records only reveal trends a decade after they have happened, and give a much less spatially-refined picture of the imbalance, Mauritsen said. For example, NASA scientists recently came up with a "really cool" idea to measure Earth's energy imbalance with spherical satellites, Mauritsen said. These satellites would carry accelerometers capable of measuring radiation from all angles, and then integrating the different sources to calculate the energy imbalance. "It tells us how far we are from stabilizing Earth's climate, and that's why we need to measure it," Mauritsen said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany's Wendelstein 7-X stellarator has set a new benchmark for fusion reactors, bringing commercial, near-limitless clean energy one step closer to reality. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A recently concluded experimental campaign at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, Germany has smashed previous fusion records and set a new benchmark for reactor performances. Nuclear fusion offers a tantalizing promise of unlimited clean energy. By smashing together isotopes (or different versions) of hydrogen at incredibly high temperatures, the resulting superheated plasma of electrons and ions fuses into heavier atoms, releasing a phenomenal amount of energy in the process. However, while this fusion reaction is self-sustaining under the extraordinary temperatures and pressures within stars, recreating these conditions on Earth is a huge technical challenge — and current reactor concepts still consume more energy than they are able to produce. Stellarators are one of the most promising reactor designs, so named for their mimicry of reactions in the sun. They use powerful external magnets to control the high-energy plasma within a ring-shaped vacuum chamber and maintain a stable, high pressure. A certain minimum value called the Lawson criterion marks the point at which the reaction produces more energy than it uses and becomes self-sustaining, so a higher triple product indicates a more efficient reaction. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. "The new record is a tremendous achievement by the international team," said Thomas Klinger, Head of Operations at Wendelstein 7-X and Head of Stellarator Dynamics and Transport at IPP in a statement. "Elevating the triple product to tokamak levels during long plasma pulses marks another important milestone on the way toward a power-plant-capable stellarator." Over a 43-second period, 90 frozen hydrogen pellets were fired into the plasma at up to 2,600 feet (800 metres) per second, roughly the speed of a bullet. It is therefore another crucial parameter for future power plant operation. "The records of this experimental campaign are much more than mere numbers. They represent a significant step forward in validating the stellarator concept—made possible through outstanding international collaboration," summarized Robert Wolf, Head of Stellarator Heating and Optimization at IPP in statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - News - Lithium deposits are of «extraterrestrial» origin — scientists analyze chemical composition Scientists from Duke University in the United States have found that lithium-rich brine solutions contain a high concentration of boron. This chemical composition distinguishes lithium salt brines from other saline waters, such as ocean water. In these regions, lithium is extracted from underground salt pools. «We found that the pH of the brines in these regions is almost entirely determined by boron, unlike seawater and other conventional saline waters. It's a completely different geochemical landscape, as if you were studying an extraterrestrial planet», — says study leader professor Avner Vengosh. However, scientists have discovered that in a large salt lake Salar de Uyuni on the plateau in Bolivia, under which the world's largest lithium-rich salt solutions are located, completely different chemical reactions take place. Lithium mining typically involves pumping natural brine from the ground to a series of shallow above-ground ponds. The liquid evaporates from these ponds, leaving a concentrated brine containing lithium and boron. However, the brine samples from evaporation ponds had very high acidity levels. To support their findings, the researchers collected data from more than 300 analyses of lithium-rich solutions from various salt basins, including those in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and the Tibetan Plateau. «In addition to our new data, we have compiled a geochemical database of lithium brines from around the world and have consistently found that boron is often a key component of brine alkalinity and controls its pH, confirming the results obtained at the Uyuni salt marsh in Bolivia», — Gordon Williams added. The results may provide information on future lithium mining technologies as the world explores ways to extract lithium more efficiently and safely waste water management.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Better communication is essential to counter misconceptions, biases and lack of accurate information. Drawing on expertise of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Horizon 2020 projects, the European Policy Centre and the European University Institute, a new JRC report on navigating migration narratives provides communication professionals with evidence-based recommendations, insights and tools to navigate the complex and often polarised discourse on migration. The report and its five case studies provide a valuable resource for promoting a more informed and balanced public debate on migration. Specifically, it offers a comprehensive analysis of migration narratives and their impact on public opinion, as well as evidence-based recommendations for improving communication on migration. The report shows that the public discussion around migration in Europe is shaped by simplified and biased narratives, which are often used to serve political purposes. Both perspectives, whether positive or negative, tend to focus on the problems associated with migration. Emotions play a significant role in shaping people's perceptions and behaviours, making it difficult to change people's understanding and reasoning of an issue once negative emotions are triggered. The report also includes a social media analysis which finds that the most common narrative systematically promoted by populists in migration-related social media posts is one that pits the messenger, their party and their supporters against a perceived political elite, which is depicted as out-of-touch, ineffective and failing to act in the interest of citizens. In this narrative, not only are national political rivals condemned, but the European Commission and the European Union as a whole are portrayed as incapable of managing migration. The report notes that the rise of populism is making more moderate politicians wary of appearing weak and losing public support. As a result, many politicians feel compelled to choose between capitalising on the same fears that populists are exploiting, or advocate for rational, technocratic solutions, which often contribute to a mixed narrative. Within this narrative, migrants are recognised as victims, but there is a persistent emphasis on keeping them away. The report argues that in the EU, populist movements have successfully framed migration as a crisis, evoking fear and insecurity by portraying immigration as being “out of control” and the EU's borders as insecure and "wide open" to unchecked immigration, thereby mobilising public support and shaping policy debates. The Great Replacement theory, which portrays immigration as an "invasion", has increasingly infiltrated mainstream, conservative and right-wing political discourse. This narrative, which suggests that native populations are being intentionally replaced by immigrants, has gained significant traction in mainstream and conservative discourse. These narratives tap into deep-seated fears about losing cultural, ethnic and national identity, triggering a defensive response. By offering a simplistic explanation for complex events, conspiracy theories give people a sense of agency and belonging, allowing them to make sense of their circumstances. The authors note that this type of divisive narrative often exploits the confusion over migration terminology and people's scarce understanding of asylum procedures. It emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach to better inform citizens, address concerns about migration and counter disinformation. The JRC and its partners are working to ensure that the public discussion can take place based on facts and evidenced based data, to provide all sides of the debate with clarity. This factually accurate, evidence-based approach is essential for developing effective policies to manage the risks as well as the opportunities posed by migration. This JRC Science for Policy Report is published in conjunction with a JRC Technical Report on Public perceptions of fairness in the European migration and asylum system, which describes the results and findings of a survey conducted by the JRC in eight EU Member States, and an independent expert report on Mis- and disinformation on migration, which both feed into this Science for Policy report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of physicists from the University at Albany has proposed scientifically rigorous methods for documenting and analyzing Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) building upon the work of numerous past and present researchers in the field. UAP is the term used by government agencies like NASA to refer to "observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena." Utilizing a diverse set of devices to capture different types of data on many channels, UAlbany authors Matthew Szydagis, Kevin Knuth and Cecilia Levy, along with Ben Kugielsky of UAPx, a non-profit scientific research organization, collected observable-light and infrared images during a field expedition in 2021 to Laguna Beach, California. "As this process moves forward, it's critical that future study of UAPs follows a rigorous, repeatable method that can be tested and confirmed by other researchers. We aim to establish a roadmap for these efforts with this paper." Szydagis noted the combination of tools and data sets his team relied on during the study included the first use of National Weather Service public Doppler weather radar data to corroborate observations from other instruments, the introduction of coincidence timing between detectors to determine whether potential anomalies were simultaneously recorded by multiple instruments, and a radiation-detection tool known as the Cosmic Watch to determine whether anomalies observed on infrared cameras were accompanied by detectable ionizing radiation. To help analyze the data from the infrared cameras, Szydagis developed new software, Custom Target Analysis Protocol (C-TAP), which combines artificial intelligence with human verification to do a pixel-by-pixel analysis of successive camera frames to study differences and distinguish actual observations from digital noise in the camera images—similar to an approach used by physicists like him and Levy to look for direct evidence of dark matter. "While we did not find evidence indicating that UAP have anything to do with non-human intelligence, we still cannot fully explain our one remaining ambiguity, or potential anomaly, which was a collection of bright white dots within a dark spot seen in multiple videos," Szydagis said. The special edition of Progress in Aerospace Sciences includes a comprehensive review of studies conducted on UAPs from 1933 to the present, including more than 20 historical government and privately funded projects, as well as recent scientific research efforts in Ireland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States. That article, "The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP)," aims to clarify the current and historical scientific narrative around UAP and highlight that UAP/UFOs are longstanding global phenomena that have been observed and recorded for well over 150 years, that UAP/UFOs have been observed and studied by astronomers, scientists, and engineers, and that there are currently several serious academic efforts in multiple countries working to collect hard scientific data on UAP using modern instrumentation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, Apai's team introduces a more comprehensive model that considers various factors, including temperature and metabolic viability, to determine if known or hypothetical organisms could survive on distant worlds. By moving beyond the simplistic criteria of water presence, the model aims to provide a more accurate assessment of a planet's habitability. This interdisciplinary initiative seeks to identify and characterize potentially habitable planets around nearby stars, guiding future missions in the search for life beyond Earth. "Even on Earth, organisms require different conditions to survive - there are no camels in Antarctica. By talking about specific organisms, we made the question easier to answer." "Second, the quantitative habitability framework does not insist on black-or-white answers. Apai's team developed a model to assess habitability by evaluating an organism's needs beyond water. For example, camels require hot, dry climates, so the model correctly rates icy Antarctica as unsuitable. Testing the model on TRAPPIST-1e-like exoplanets, they assessed methanogens-ancient microbes-and found a 69% habitat suitability. This indicates such planets may support simple life forms and are strong candidates for further study.</p>
