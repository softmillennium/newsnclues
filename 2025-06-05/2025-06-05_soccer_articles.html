                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a compliment to Sullivan and Harriel's talents, but it might also be a reflection of the national team's bigger issues. Dest joins a long list of stars who are injured or out for other reasons. It's a nice compliment to their talents, but it might also be a reflection of the national team's bigger issues. A slew of key players are injured, some are committed to the Club World Cup this summer, and others have fallen out of favor with manager Mauricio Pochettino. Just this week, the injured list grew by two notable names. Then on Thursday, U.S. Soccer announced that right back Sergiño Dest was judged not fit enough for the summer's slate, following his return from a torn ACL. He suffered the injury in April of last year and returned in March to his club team, the Netherlands' PSV Eindhoven. “The technical, medical and high performance staffs have done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp,” Pochettino said in a statement. Harriel's odds of making his senior national team debut this summer go up with Dest's absence, though this isn't the way anyone would ask for it. He already was a late addition to camp because of other injuries, and now the 24-year-old is one of two right backs on the Gold Cup team. The other is Orlando City's 20-year-old Alex Freeman — the son of former Eagles and Green Bay Packers wide receiver Antonio Freeman. Union fans know Harriel also can play other defensive positions in a pinch. The centerbacks include Union alumnus Mark McKenzie, a potential starter next to starting lock Chris Richards. This squad's winger class also includes Union alumni Brenden and Paxten Aaronson, Damion Downs of Germany's FC Köln, and Haji Wright of England's Coventry City. The Aaronsons have their own versatility: Brenden is listed as a midfielder but can play as a winger, and Paxten is listed as a forward but can play in many spots. Wright also can play at striker or out wide. Brenden Aaronson gave Sullivan a nice endorsement this week in an interview with The Inquirer. “I've seen him grow over the last years from afar,” Aaronson said. It's seven assists and two goals so far this year, to be precise. But he was at Subaru Park when the Union hosted Lionel Messi's Inter Miami a few weeks ago, and Sullivan scored a great goal that night just after being named to the U.S. training camp squad. Eight players in all across the 26-player squad have ties to the Union, whether as former players or former academy prospects: the two Aaronsons, Harriel, McKenzie, Sullivan, goalkeeper Matt Freese, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Brian White. (That last game could see Sullivan and Harriel playing against Union teammate Danley Jean Jacques.) Defenders (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Union), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse, France), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace, England), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel, Germany), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC) Midfielders (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United, England), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis, Spain), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Quinn Sullivan (Union); Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven, Netherlands) FORWARDS (5): Paxten Aaronson (Eintracht Frankfurt, Germany), Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC), Damion Downs (FC Köln, Germany), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps), Haji Wright (Coventry City, England) » READ MORE: Brenden Aaronson and Quinn Sullivan are in, but Christian Pulisic is out of the USMNT Gold Cup picture</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday night, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a travel ban against 12 countries in a move he described as “protecting the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.” The ban goes into effect on Monday, and it entails a ban against travel into the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar (Burma), Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. This ban relates to the entry of both immigrants and non-immigrants. Trump also imposed partial restrictions and limits on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Iran has already qualified for the tournament, while several countries facing travel bans are in contention to qualify. There are also players from Sudan, Venezuela and Iran due to compete in the Club World Cup. The good news for FIFA is that the executive order contains an exemption for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.” This would appear to suggest, therefore, that Iran, whose qualification has already been assured for the World Cup in 2026, will be able to send a team and support staff to compete at the tournament. However, players will not be able to bring friends and family who are Iranian nationals beyond “immediate relatives.” Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” adding that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.” In Africa, Libya has an outside chance of making the World Cup, currently placed third in a group of six after six matches. Among the nations with partial travel bans, Venezuela is currently placed seventh in the South America qualification table, which would enter them into an intercontinental playoff. The Gold Cup begins June 14 and ends July 6, with all matches except one due to be played in the United States. The exemption listed by Trump's executive order refers to athletes and teams being allowed to “travel for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.” The Gold Cup is not specified and therefore it must be determined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump's executive order cited overstay percentages on visas by Haitian citizens within the U.S. and claimed “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.” The order claimed that this “harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.” While exemptions appear to have been made for athletes, teams and immediate relatives, further-reaching exemptions for supporters do not appear to be present in the executive order. Exemptions are made for nationals of designated countries who are traveling on government business, NATO business or those who are lawful permanent residents of the United States, as well as those who are dual citizens and traveling with a passport from the non-designated country. There will also be entry granted to Iranians on immigrant visas owing to ethnic or religious persecution in their home country. These exemptions aside, however, it appears that entry will be limited for nationals from those countries who face partial and full travel bans. Venezuela and Cuba, for example, have had temporary tourist visa access forbidden. A State Department spokesperson did not directly respond when asked about the tournaments' status, saying only: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.” A quick browse of the squads offers up potential challenges. At the Abu Dhabi club Al-Ain, for example, is the Sudanese player Mohamed Awadalla, and his country has seen all visas blocked — meaning he may require an exemption — while Inter Milan Iranian forward Mehdi Taremi may also be in the same position. This is used when an athlete seeks to come to the U.S. as part of a team at an internationally recognized level of performance. However, ordinarily this would only be used if they have contracts with teams in the United States. On Wednesday, as part of our report tracking FIFA's difficulties in filling stadiums for the Club World Cup, FIFA told The Athletic that supporters from more than 130 countries had acquired tickets for this summer's tournament. We have now approached FIFA to ask whether any nationals from countries impacted by the travel ban have acquired tickets for the tournament, as well as if any exemptions will be made to enable them to enter the country, or if these supporters can otherwise expect refunds. Back in 2017, before the U.S. secured the World Cup a year later, FIFA President Gianni Infantino told reporters: “It's obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.” Additionally, as part of the United States' joint bid with Canada and Mexico to host the World Cup — dated May 2, 2018 — Trump wrote to Infantino and said he was confident that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” Earlier this year, Infantino said: “America will welcome the world. The question, however, is whether repeated news cycles about a more stringent approach to entering the U.S. may dissuade global travelers from attending both the tournament this summer and next year's World Cup, leaving FIFA more reliant on a domestic audience and host cities at risk of falling short of their economic impact, as tourists are likelier to spend more money. Vance last month said during a meeting of the White House's World Cup task force: “Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not after second-placed Australia established an unassailable buffer between them earlier in the evening with a stirring 1-0 win over Group C winners Japan. Nonetheless, Indonesia's lofty dream of qualifying for the World Cup -- for the first time since 1938 when they were still known as the Dutch East Indies -- remains very much alive after a 1-0 victory over China on Thursday. Continuing his red-hot form on the international stage, Ole Romeny converted from the penalty spot in the 45th minute -- his third goal in as many caps -- to secure a crucial three points for his side. For now, there is still one more match day in the third round next Tuesday -- and there are not too many better positions that Indonesia could wish to be in. Considering the uproar in some quarters that greeted a shock parting of ways with former coach Shin Tae-Yong in January, the fact that Indonesia have since notched two wins in three outings under his successor Patrick Kluivert has gone some way in vindicating the huge call made by PSSI, the country's football governing body. It was a night to forget as the Indonesians were comprehensively beaten 5-1 by Australia, but Romeny did provide the Timnas faithful something to smile about with a debut goal. Despite their remarkable rise over the past couple of years, if there was an area of Indonesia that was particularly glaring, it was probably the lack of a formidable threat leading the line. For all his admirable endeavour, Rafael Struick only has one goal in 26 caps while others such as Ramadhan Sananta and Hokky Caraka remain prospects for the future. He clearly has an eye for goal but it is not his only strength. Again, against the Chinese, Romeny was ever-mobile and constantly looked to move out wide or drop deep to provide a link-up option, displaying a savviness in finding pockets of space. The 24-year-old was also unafraid to pull the trigger whenever a half-chance presented itself, and might even have added to his tally on another night. He was far from Indonesia's only hero on Thursday. Captain Jay Idzes was once again an authoritative figure in the heart of defence, aided resolutely by Calvin Verdonk and Rizky Ridho. Ricky Kambuaya and Yakob Sayuri, part of a surprisingly-noticeable Indonesian born-and-bred presence in the starting XI given the ever-increasing number of naturalised heritage imports in the ranks, were industrious both when defending and attacking. Making his long-awaited debut having flirted with the idea of switching his allegiance to Indonesia for several years now, Emil Audero overcame a few early nerves to be a reliable presence in goal -- suggesting there could be an intriguing duel once the incumbent Maarten Paes returns from suspension. Even Egy, who was once the next great hope for Indonesian football but has not managed to reach his full potential, produced a lively showing. Indonesia are certainly going to need as many if, or rather when, they get to the next stage of their World Cup dream.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Franco Mastantuono is edging closer to becoming a Real Madrid player, but fans hoping to see him in Spain this summer will need to wait a bit longer. According to a new report from Marca, Real Madrid have all but secured an agreement with the 16-year-old Argentine prodigy — but his transfer won't be finalized until after River Plate's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup. It's a scenario that suits all parties: Mastantuono gets a major opportunity to shine on a global stage with his boyhood club, while Real Madrid secure one of the most exciting young talents in world football. Negotiations between Real Madrid and River Plate are ongoing, and Juni Calafat — the club's chief scout and key figure behind recent South American signings — personally traveled to Buenos Aires to move talks forward. Reports in Spain say the framework of an agreement is now clear: Madrid are ready to pay Mastantuono's €45 million release clause, likely in six structured instalments, as River have been unwilling to lower their valuation. While the paperwork isn't signed just yet, Mastantuono's move to Madrid is described as a matter of “when,” not “if.” The player's agent and Calafat are expected to fly to Spain next to finalize the final terms. Importantly, according to SER, Mastantuono has already spoken directly with Real Madrid representatives — including manager-in-waiting Xabi Alonso — and is reportedly enthusiastic about the role he'll play in the team's long-term project. Barring any surprises, Mastantuono is expected to join up with Madrid in late July, after the Club World Cup concludes. This development also explains why Paris Saint-Germain, who had been monitoring the situation, backed out of the race after refusing to match the €45 million clause.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOUSTON (June 5, 2025) – Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Jack McGlynn has been confirmed as a member of the U.S. Men's National Team's (USMNT) 26-man roster for two upcoming friendlies and the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. Below is the team's group play schedule: McGlynn returns to the national team after most recently earning a roster spot for the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League Finals, making an appearance in the Semifinals versus Panama on March 20. McGlynn made his first start for the senior USMNT on Jan. 18, 2025, when the midfielder recorded his debut goal and assist in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. His standout January camp under head coach Mauricio Pochettino also featured 45 minutes of action versus Costa Rica, while his senior debut came in January 2024 in a friendly versus Slovenia. The midfielder also made his mark in Paris with the U.S. Men's Olympic Soccer Team where he featured in all four matches as they advanced to the Quarterfinals. McGlynn registered an assist in the Group A finale against Guinea. McGlynn has made an immediate impact on the Dynamo roster this year, already scoring three goals and recording five assists across all competitions. He opened his goal tally in a 1-0 victory over LAFC on April 5, then added two more stunning goals, one in the U.S. Open Cup Round of 32 match versus Phoenix Rising FC and the other in the most recent Texas Derby against FC Dallas. Notably, McGlynn ranks third in MLS with 47 key passes and is second in the team with five assists.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charlotte FC are one of four MLS clubs to have two players called into the Gold Cup roster CHARLOTTE, NC (Thursday, June 5, 2025) – Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang and defender Tim Ream made the final 26-player U.S. Men's National Team roster for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. The USMNT opens Group D play on June 15 when they take on Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. (6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT). Four days later, the U.S. faces Saudi Arabia at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET/8:15 p.m. CT) and concludes the group stage against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET/6 p.m. CT). Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special place in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS NEXT Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. Agyemang had a strong showing in his first national team camp and competition to kick off 2025. The East Hartford, Connecticut, native began his national team tenure with goals in back-to-back January Camp games against Venezuela and Costa Rica. For Charlotte this season, Agyemang has tallied eight goals and two assists across all competitions, three in MLS play and two in U.S. Open Cup competition. The St. Louis native most recently featured with the USMNT during Concacaf Nations League Final match against Panama in March, where Ream served as captain. The USMNT will seek its eighth confederation championship trophy, having won the inaugural tournament in 1991 before being crowned regional champion again in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2021. The 18th edition of the Concacaf Gold Cup is set to take place this summer across 14 stadiums in 11 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada. The tournament will feature 16 men's national teams, including 15 from Concacaf and Saudi Arabia (guest nation).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tar Heels appear to remain a part of the US national team for years to come. With the amount of success the North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer team has had over its history, that's led to plenty of Heels also having success in the sport. The history of the US women's national soccer team is deeply intertwined with UNC, as many greats, from Mia Hamm to recent stars like Crystal Dunn, have come from Carolina. Pretty much every USWNT roster features at least Heel. With UNC still regular contenders for the NCAA Tournament championship and current reigning champions, that's likely to stay the case in the future. On Tuesday night, we saw some of new Tar Heel faces lead the way for the USWNT. Over the last week or so, the US national team played in some friendly matches, which included a 4-0 win over Jamaica on Tuesday night. In the roster for those matches was five former Tar Heels, most of which are very much in the newest generation of national teamers. Fox has plenty of experience at the international level already, now up to 67 appearances for the USWNT since debuting in 2018. The other three Tar Heels who were in the roster for the recent friendlies were goalkeeper Claudia Dickey (25), defender Avery Patterson (22), and forward Ally Sentnor (21). Beyond them, 20-year old former Heel Savy King has also been part of US training camps in recent month, although she may not be appearing a game of any kind for a while after a very scary recent health incident. Beyond just being part of coach Emma Hayes' recent rosters, some of the Tar Heels have also made impressive showings. There's no major international tournament until the next Women's World Cup in 2027, and no true tournaments of consequence until they play in the CONCACAF W Championship next November. (That tournament will decide who qualifies for said World Cup and also the next Olympic tournaments.) Rest assured that when those tournaments happen, there's a very good chance there will be Tar Heels playing crucial roles in them. 21+ (18+ D.C.) and present in select states (for KS, in affiliation with Kansas Star Casino).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get Recruited Faster with a Player Profile on SoccerWire.com The U.S. roster for this trip featured 15 players under 23 years of age, and, per an agreement with Germany, this is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe. Each squad had five “overage players,” none of whom were born before January 1, 1999. Chelsea FC forward Mia Fishel, who has three senior team caps of her own, dummied the ball, and it skidded through to outside back Lilly Reale, who knocked the ball off a German defender and in from close range. It was Reale's first goal at the U-23 international level. She has one goal this season for Gotham FC in the NWSL. The USA looked to be cruising to a win, but the Germans – who featured San Diego Wave attacker Gia Corley in its starting lineup – equalized in the 86th minute as Mara Alber latched onto a cross from the right wing that flew through the U.S. goal mouth and smashed home her shot from a very tight angle on the left side of the penalty area. With the match seemingly headed for a draw, five minutes of stoppage time were added, and the USA won it with 29 seconds left on the clock. She whirled toward goal, avoided a few defenders with a nice dribble and was able to poke the ball back to Seattle Reign center back Jordyn Bugg, who floated a perfect cross to the far post. She won an NCAA title last year at North Carolina and now has netted her first goal at the U-23 international level. USA: 1-Angelina Anderson; 7-Makenna Morris (2-Emily Mason, 82), 4-Jordan Bugg, 5-Kennedy Wesley (19-Lauren Flynn, 75), 3-Lilly Reale; 20-Samantha Meza, 6-Riley Jackson (16-Sarah Schupansky, 63), 8-Korbin Albert (18-Evelyn Shores, 75); 10-Jaedyn Shaw (14-Riley Tiernan, 63), 9-Mia Fishel (Capt.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa declined to comment on recently signed ban Donald Trump's newly signed travel ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with clubs participating in the 2025 Club World Cup, the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Olympics. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partly restricted. There is an exemption, however, outlined in section 4 of the order, which states that “any ­athlete or member of an athletic team, ­including coaches, persons ­performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, travelling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state” are not subject to the ban. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has gone out of his way to appear publicly with Trump in recent months, taking a seat next to the president at the first public meeting of his World Cup taskforce and arriving late to the Fifa Congress in order to meet with Trump during his tour of the Middle East. Venezuela, for example, have three players on its squad who play in Major League Soccer. They are scheduled to play two World Cup qualifiers: one against Bolivia on Friday night and another against Uruguay on Tuesday. Trump's travel ban is set to come into action on Monday 9 June. Venezuela are ­seventh in South American qualifying, five points behind Colombia for an automatic World Cup place but still in the picture to qualify via an inter-confederation playoff. Sudan are third in their World Cup qualifying group, just one point from automatic qualification. Haiti look good to reach the next round of Concacaf World Cup qualification.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jack Grealish has bit back at critics on social media and defended his recent record after being left out of Manchester City's Club World Cup squad. The latest stub will allow the 29-year-old and his representatives to instead be focused on finding him a move away from the Etihad Stadium, as he seeks to force himself into England's World Cup plans. Grealish started only seven times in what was a poor season for City by their own standards. While he has two years remaining on his £300,000-a-week contract, a repeat would do neither City nor the player any favours. Following reports of the omission, accounts on social media were keen to voice their opinion on the former Aston Villa star's situation - with messages of support as well criticism directed his way. Responding to a post from talkSPORT which claimed that Villa favourite Gabby Agbonlahor is 'not happy' with Guardiola for unfairly treating Grealish, the winger wrote: 'What u want me to do score a [hat-trick] in 20 [minutes]?' He also waded into a discussion between two users discussing his form for City this term. 'Dude, Jack has been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that,' wrote one user on X. The England international chimed in with a defense of his recent displays, adding: 'Haha, I've been bad lately? Score 3 goals in my last 3 appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x'. Clubs in England and Europe are expected to be interested in the playmaker, although the fact that many are grappling with profit and sustainability issues may point to the likelihood of a loan deal, rather than a permanent move for a man who cost City £100m when he signed from Aston Villa for a British record fee in 2021. After Grealish was left out of City's final Premier League fixture at Fulham, Guardiola said that officials would work with Grealish and his representatives to find a solution that suited both sides.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's been a surge of border crackdowns, new visa restrictions and an overall sense of fear over being detained amid multiple reports of foreigners being locked up for weeks in the five months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. The U.S. will co-host next year's World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Of the 16 host cities, 11 are on American soil. FIFA president Gianni Infantino, an ally of Trump, has promised that international fans will be welcome at the World Cup. But Trump's immigration stance has raised questions about potential challenges for the numerous international fans expected to travel to the U.S. Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have raised "grave concerns" about the matches being held in the U.S. And at the same time that excitement has started to build for the tournament — and Toronto and Vancouver have started preparing for a deluge of soccer fans — there have been calls to boycott the U.S. as a host. The current political climate in the U.S., if it continues, could be a considerable deterrent, especially for fans from countries that are at odds with America, according to Vijay Setlur, an expert in sport marketing and sport business in the Schulich School of Business at York University. Even though they're there to watch soccer, they could be accused of espionage or something like that," Setlur told CBC News. Iran for instance, was one of the first teams to qualify for the World Cup, but the two countries are engaged in a decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday night, Trump signed an order that would ban people from a dozen countries, including Iran, from entering the United States. It's set to go into effect on Monday. The ban makes exceptions for athletes, coaches and immediate relatives travelling for the World Cup, but doesn't mention fans. "Immediate action is needed to address policies that directly contradict FIFA's stated values of human rights, inclusion and global participation," the advocacy group wrote in the May 5 letter. ‘That place breaks you': Canadian woman describes 11 days in ICE custody Amnesty International, an international human rights NGO, has also voiced concerns for the players and fans travelling to the U.S. He also noted that routine border crosses "have turned into harassment," especially for 2SLGBTQ+ people, religious minorities and people of colour. "It's hard to know who the Trump administration will target next," Cockburn said. "With no sign of the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants and crackdown on freedom of expression slowing down, travellers may unfortunately find their human rights under threat while in the U.S." Human Rights Watch also noted that when FIFA awarded the bid to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the decision was celebrated as one that would unite positive change. At the time, in 2018, rifts created by tariffs and a proposed border wall were glossed over because of the neighbours' longstanding political and economic alliances. And it was a smart decision at the time, said Setlur, not only for FIFA to grow its revenue, but because it was also an opportunity to elevate the sport of soccer in North America's very crowded sports market. Canada wins bid to co-host FIFA World Cup in 2026 Regardless of where it's held, the month-long World Cup is often considered the biggest sporting event in terms of its magnitude and global appeal. FIFA says 1.5 billion people tuned into the 2022 final match between Argentina and France live on television (the 2025 Super Bowl, by comparison, netted about 127. "A lot of this is government-to-government," Rothenberg said. "A passionate soccer fan is not going to be held up by that." And as travel groups have raised concerns that wait times mean fans from some of the 48 nations set to compete will not be able to secure a U.S. visa before the FIFA tournament, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the administration is considering putting consular officers on double shifts and employing artificial intelligence to help manage the processing. Vice-President JD Vance has warned that visitors must "go home" after attending matches. "Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem," he said with a laugh as Trump smiled beside him, referring to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, while speaking to media during the first World Cup task force meeting in early May.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A stunning smash-and-grab 1-0 victory over Japan has put the Socceroos on the brink of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after Aziz Behich's stoppage-time winner. Having been dominated by Japan for the full 90 minutes, a moment of magic from Riley McGree and a phenomenal finish by Behich earned the Socceroos a stunning backs-against-the-wall victory. McGree turned on the edge of the area before racing to the by-line, cutting back towards Behich to finish with his right foot and score his first Socceroos goal in 13 years and earn Australia's first win over Japan in 16. "It hasn't quite sunk in just yet," Behich said. "But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we will get our opportunity if we get to it.' "Fortunately enough it fell to me and my right foot. "It has been a long campaign and we have worked so hard … the group we have in this change room and the boys that come in every camp, the mentality is second to none. For so long it seemed the very best the Socceroos could be able to hope for was to escape from Perth with a draw after a turgid display. Japan were utterly dominant, displaying an ease of possession that made a mockery of their second-string personnel and had their hosts chasing shadows throughout. Yet for all their possession, 69 per cent of it at full time, there was very little in the way of clear cut chances created — and the Socceroos made them pay for that profligacy. Daniel Arzani, a 80th-minute substitute, created the spark to help the Socceroos advance down field and, tellingly, keep possession there without the swarming Japanese defence clearing their lines. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines. He fashioned a ball towards McGree, whose stunning turn prised open the firmly locked Japanese defence. His cut back missed the first wave of Socceroos strikers, but Behich was alert to the lose ball and curled a delightful effort past Kōsei Tani into the far corner. Credit must be given to Tony Popovic for his changes, all of whom made an impact after a dire first half showing. The Socceroos were more lively in the second half but still second best, right up until Behich's stunner. Given the Socceroos far superior goal difference, only a catastrophic defeat against Saudi Arabia — who must also beat Bahrain later on Friday morning — in Jeddah on Wednesday morning (AEST) will deny Tony Popovic's side a spot in North America. Look back on how all the action unfolded in our live blog. Don't forget to join us on Wednesday morning over your breakfast cereal for the still important but nowhere near as important as before clash against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning, we'll be blogging that one too for you from 4:15am AEST. But for now, let's leave you with the image of happy Socceroos - because is there anything better? Good night, and thanks for being with me. "Look, we stayed in the game," he says. "It was a great goal at the end, we're getting our left wing back coming in, 90th minute to finish off a chance. And I believe there's more to come from them." Popovic says that Australia seemed second to the ball in the first half and paid credit to his subs. "Nothing against the boys that came off, we just seemed second to the ball," he says. "We didn't win our challenges and the duels. We tried to get more strength in there. All the players that came on made an impact. So we're very happy with the win." He says Australia still want to finish with a win. "Beating Japan, doing it at home and the last minute, you couldn't have scripted it any better," he says. "We still have got a game to go. We're very proud at the moment. And everyone in here and I'm sure every Australian that has seen this game is a proud Australian tonight. We don't want to deny anyone of that joy. "We still have a job to do in Saudi Arabia and we want to finish well." Here's Alessandro Circati, who grew up in Perth and is letting the tears flow, playing his first match for the Socceroos since an ACL injury. It is a bit emotional as well," he says. "Obviously growing up here for so long, after an injury that I had, coming back here and playing and, we are not exactly qualified but ... It is like a dream come true. "It's been probably seven very hard months, when vu an injury like this. Some people come back, you know, not the same. "It  hasn't quite sunk in just yet," he says. "But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we  will get our opportunity if we get to it.' "It has been a long  campaign and we have worked so hard over this campaign. We've had a  change of coach, never easy, the  group we have in this changeroom and the boys that come in every camp,  the mentality is second to none. "I think we more than deserve of going to a World Cup again." Behich says that the rope a dope tactic was definitely not planned, but the result is all important. Japan is a quality side, that's for sure. Obviously we've had better games,  but that's football,"  he says. 60,000 here on  home soil and we get to win against an opponent we haven't beaten in a while." "I  honestly thought the cutback was too far back and no-one was going to get on it," he says. "No-one was defending on  the other end, but he ended up  getting on it and I look up and it hits the net. He says that he's getting goosebumps getting asked about the goal, even though it was only scored 10 minutes ago. He also says that the Socceroos deserved to win... "Japan is a quality side and at stages we had to weather the storm and with  the quality we have, it will only  take one opportunity and we were  fortunate to get that opportunity  and the way we took it, we deserved to win." Thanks Simon - from where I'm sitting it sounds like we've won.... Japan sharper all night, created so many chances, dominated possession. Substitutes Geria, Arzani, McGree combining for the goal. And what a finish Aziz Behich Popovic got his subs right, that's for sure. Now, even if Saudi Arabia wins against Bahrain in the early hours of the morning, they will need to mount a monumental assault on their goal difference to have any chance of pipping the Socceroos to second spot on the ladder. It means the match in Jeddah is important, but only a monumental catastrophe there would mean Saudi Arabia could overhaul them. The Socceroos have one foot and four toes in the FIFA World Cup finals after the latest of smash and grab wins against Japan in Perth! Aziz Behich told 10 Sport before the match that he'd had a good five days after winning the A-League grand final with Melbourne City - how about now? Japan absolutely battered Australia in that match but lacked the end product and it cost them dear. It's their first World Cup qualifier defeat in their last 20 matches and could yet see Australia make the finals. That's a nasty head clash right on the edge of the Socceroos penalty area and he's down and will need treatment. A rare lapse from Japan's defence, a rare passage of more than five passes without an error by the Socceroos and it nets them the winner that could send them to the World Cup! It's his first Socceroos goal in 13 years, and could give the Socceroos their first win over Japan in 16 years, to get Australia to the World Cup next year. Suzuki swings a ball in from the right side, but despite a charge of Japanese runners, none can get a touch at the back post and Australia can sigh their relief. In Japan earlier in the qualification tournament Australia managed a 1-1 draw without having a shot on goal, so there's always hope...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea have confirmed what number Liam Delap has selected to wear after he completed his transfer to Stamford Bridge. Delap, 22, has joined Chelsea on a six-year contract until June 2031 after his £30m release clause was triggered by Enzo Maresca's side. The England Under-21 international bolsters the Chelsea attack for the 2025/26 season, which will see him compete with Nicolas Jackson for a starting role, with Christopher Nkunku expected to depart on a permanent basis. Delap is set to play in Chelsea colours for the first time later this month when Chelsea feature in the Club World Cup in the United States. Delap follows the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Fernando Torres, Tammy Abraham, Gonzalo Higuain and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to wear the no.9 shirt for Chelsea. The new Chelsea arrival is eager to rekindle his relationship with Cole Palmer, who he played with at youth level for Manchester City. "Cole is incredible in everything he does," Delap told Chelsea's in-house media team. "I can't wait to be in front of him again and receive his passes!" He added: "I spent a lot of time with them both (Palmer and Romeo Lavia) at City. We grew up and played some incredible football together.
