Migrants deported under Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act were “plainly deprived…of their right[s],” the judge ruled.

A United States district judge has ruled that the Trump administration must provide hundreds of migrants sent to an El Salvador megaprison under the Alien Enemies Act the ability to challenge their deportation. 

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Wednesday, determining that allowing those deportations to stand without recognizing migrants' due process would not only violate their rights, but also create an unacceptable precedent. Boasberg also noted that President Donald Trump issued the order for deportations against individuals who his administration had determined were part of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang. 

An independent examination of migrants who were deported to the El Salvador CECOT prison complex on March 15 and 16 shows that there is no evidence of any criminal history for around three-quarters of those individuals. Many family members of those who have been deported there also deny that they have links to gangs.

By refusing to allow these individuals the ability to challenge their deportations, the administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. 

The judge's decree does not apply to all immigrants who were deported to El Salvador, but is narrowly focused on those who were removed from the U.S. based on the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that Trump made earlier this year — individuals like Kilmar Abrego García, whose deportation is similarly questionable but was based on other rationales, are not affected by Boasberg's ruling.

Boasberg left open the possibility that some deportations could be viewed as justifiable if the administration allowed individuals to challenge their deportations.

“Perhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But — and this is the critical point — there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government's say-so,” Boasberg wrote. 

How to provide the deported migrants their due process “will be determined in future proceedings,” the judge added.

Boasberg was also mindful of the incredibly dangerous precedent that could be created by allowing the administration's actions to remain unchallenged.

“Absent this relief” from his ruling, Boasberg said, “The Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.”

It's unclear what appellate courts may do next with the case. While the Supreme Court has authorized, at least temporarily, the administration to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants living in the U.S., the high court also ruled in April that those subjected to his actions must be given the ability to challenge his ability to do so. 

Several legal experts praised Boasberg's ruling.

“[This is an] important moment for the rule of law and against government lawlessness,” Ryan Goodman, co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, wrote in a Bluesky post.

Noting that “details [of the case still need] to be worked out” — chiefly, how the deported migrants may see their individual cases remedied — constitutional law professor and political commentator Harry Litman applauded Boasberg for stating in his ruling that “violations must be remedied.”

This was a “big important decision,” Litman added.

Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations that is representing the migrants in the lawsuit, also celebrated the order by Boasberg.

“Today's ruling affirms what every American knows: in the United States, people are entitled to due process and no one should be removed from the country without it,” Perryman said. “We will continue to oppose this administration's attempts to re-write the Constitution.”

The tribe says they will initiate restoration projects on the 17,000 acres taken from them during the gold rush.

This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist's weekly newsletter here.

More than 17,000 acres around the Klamath River in Northern California, including the lower Blue Creek watershed, have returned to the Yurok Tribe, completing the largest landback deal in California history.

The Yurok people have lived, fished, and hunted along the Klamath for millennia. But when the California gold rush began, the tribe lost 90 percent of its territory. 

For the last two decades, the Yurok Tribe has been working with the nonprofit Western Rivers Conservancy to get its land back. The 17,000 acres composes the final parcel of a $56 million, 47,097-acre land transfer that effectively doubles the current land holdings of the Yurok Tribe. 

The tribe has already designated the land as a salmon sanctuary and community forest and plans to eventually put it into a trust and care for it in perpetuity. 

“No words can describe how we feel knowing that our land is coming back to the ownership of the Yurok people,” said Joseph James, the chairman of the Yurok Tribal Council, who is from the village of Shregon on the Klamath River. “The Klamath River is our highway. It is also our food source. And it takes care of us. And so it's our job, our inherent right, to take care of the Klamath Basin and its river.”

The land transfer comes just months after the utility PacifiCorp removed four dams on the Klamath River, the largest dam removal project in U.S. history. The removal of the dams enabled coho and Chinook salmon that had been blocked to finally swim upstream to spawn for the first time in more than a century. The deal is also part of a broader push to revitalize the Klamath River Basin, where water diversions and pollution have long strained the wildlife and the Indigenous peoples who rely on them. 

Josh Kling, conservation director at the Western Rivers Conservancy, said the nonprofit acquired the land in pieces from Green Diamond, a timber company, and paid for it using a combination of private funding, tax credits, carbon credit sales, low-interest loans, revolving loans, federal revolving loan programs, and settlement funds. The project was also partially funded by the state of California, which returned 2,800 acres of state land along the Klamath River to the Shasta Indian Nation last year. 

Kling said the 47,000 acres of land returned to the Yurok Tribe includes redwood forests that help protect against climate change and protect crucial habitat for birds such as the marbled murrelet, Humboldt marten. and northern spotted owl, just as the trees were becoming ripe for a fresh round of logging.

“The project was really timely to get in there before a new round of timber harvest and the associated road building,” said Kling. He is particularly excited about how Blue Creek, a cold-water tributary just 16 miles from the mouth of the river, is now protected because of how the tributary provides an essential place for salmon and steelhead to cool off before heading further upstream to spawn.

“The importance of Blue Creek to the larger Klamath system really can't be overstated,” he said. “With the dam removals and the restoration of fish passage to over 400 miles of spawning habitat in the upper basin, none of that means anything if the fish can't get there.”

James from the Yurok Tribe described Blue Creek as a high prayer area, a village site, and essential fishing grounds. In 2020, it was also where Yurok officials helped persuade PacifiCorp officials to move forward with dam removal after two decades of advocacy. James credited Troy Fletcher, a former executive director of the Yurok Tribe who played a key role in the dam removal campaign and who has since passed away, for helping to initiate the landback project.

Restoring the land will involve everything from stream restoration projects to road maintenance, James said: “We want to do everything we can to protect Mother Earth.”  

Kling said the conservancy is increasingly working with tribal nations to facilitate land transfers and hopes to work with more. Studies have shown that conservation goals are more effectively met when Indigenous peoples manage their own territories. 

“The more that we can partner with tribal stewards to achieve our conservation outcomes, those are durable lasting results,” Kling said.

James, too, hopes that the deal will be far from the last. 

“Here's a model that we can share with the Indian Country,” he said. “Indigenous people are the managers of the land, and they're driving it.”

Actor to make Broadway debut in play set 19 years after events of the final book in JK Rowling's fantasy series

More than a decade after casting his last spell, Tom Felton, best known for playing Harry Potter's bleach-blond nemesis, is returning to the wizarding world.

The actor will reprise his role as Draco Malfoy in the acclaimed stage production Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, making his Broadway debut.

Felton, 37, starred in the Harry Potter film franchise from 2001 to 2011, and has remained a fan favourite as one of the series' most notorious characters. His return makes him the first film cast member to reprise the role on stage.

“Being a part of the Harry Potter films has been one of the greatest honours of my life,” he said. “Joining this production will be a full-circle moment for me.”

Felton will join the cast at New York's Lyric theatre from 11 November for a 19-week run, the production confirmed on Thursday. First staged in London in 2016 and written by the Adolescence co-creator Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on a story co-devised with JK Rowling.

Set 19 years after the original series, it follows Harry – now a Ministry of Magic employee – and his wife, Ginny, as they send their son Albus Severus to Hogwarts. The play explores Albus's struggles with his family legacy, navigating strained friendships and the burden of a famous surname.

The play's producers, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, called the return “a cultural moment charged with nostalgia, evolution, and emotion”. They said: “We can't wait to see him inhabit this role once again with the same depth, gravity, and humanity he has always brought to Draco.”

The production has been running on Broadway since 2018, originally in two parts lasting five hours, but since 2021 as a single three-and-a-half-hour production. The production in London remains in two parts.

Felton recently featured in the West End in 2:22 A Ghost Story. Since the Potter films, he has appeared in Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and had recurring roles in series such as Murder in the First, The Flash and Origin.

He lent his voice to the Harry Potter video games and appeared in the 20th anniversary special, Return to Hogwarts alongside Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson.

The Potterverse continues to expand, with filming due to start this summer for HBO's new small-screen adaptation of Rowling's books.

The point of holding people in the notorious prison is “to instill fear in the immigrant population,” the filing states.

Immigrant rights advocates on Wednesday launched a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration for detaining migrants at the U.S. naval station in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba — the site of a “notorious” prison where several foreign men and boys were indefinitely held and tortured as part of the so-called War on Terror.

The class action suit was filed in the District of Columbia by the ACLU's national and D.C. arms, the Center for Constitutional Rights, and the International Refugee Assistance Project against the secretaries of defense, homeland security, and state, as well as their departments, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and ICE's acting director.

The coalition brought the case on behalf of two Nicaraguan men previously detained a facilities in Virginia and Louisiana — Yamil Luna Gutierrez and Rafael Angel Lopez Ocon — and other noncitizens the Trump administration is now holding under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in “disturbing” conditions at Guantánamo.

Rather than keeping these migrants in the United States “while making arrangements to effectuate their removal, the government has flown them hundreds of miles away to detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, for no legitimate purpose,” the complaint states. “Plaintiffs are surrounded by military officials, deprived of in-person contact with legal counsel, and subject to punitive conditions of confinement, including in facilities previously used by the military to hold law-of-war detainees.”

The plaintiffs, the filing says, “do not challenge the government's authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government's unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA, and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.”

“Moreover,” the document argues, “the government's use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.”

“Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so,” the document notes. “The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States, which is far less costly and poses none of the logistical hurdles attendant to detaining people at Guantánamo.”

Specifically, according to the complaint, “since February 4, 2025, the government has held approximately 500 people in immigration detention at Guantánamo, at a reported cost of more than $40 million, or approximately $100,000 per day per detainee. In contrast, immigration detention at a U.S.-based detention facility costs, on average, $165 per day per detainee.”

Previewing the Trump administration's likely arguments in court, the suit says that “in attempting to justify the transfers, the government has claimed that the individuals it is sending to Guantánamo are members of gangs and dangerous criminals — the ‘worst of the worst.' That characterization has been proven wrong. Regardless, it is legally irrelevant.”

The filing also stresses that “the government's real reason for holding immigration detainees at Guantánamo is to instill fear in the immigrant population. That is not conjecture; it is government policy.”

The coalition is asking the court to rule that detaining these migrants at Guantánamo violates the INA, Administrative Procedure Act, and Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and to block the Trump administration from continuing to do so.

Kremlin comments seem to confirm reports Putin told Trump Moscow was obliged to hit back

Europe live – latest updates

Russia will respond to Ukraine's daring drone operation “how and when” it sees fit, the Kremlin has warned, seeming to confirm reports Vladimir Putin had told Donald Trump that Moscow was obliged to retaliate.

Ukraine has been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend, targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday what Moscow's response would be, said: “How and when our military deems it appropriate.”

Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields, during an unannounced phone call on Wednesday.

The US embassy in Ukraine warned of a continuing risk of “significant airstrikes” and advised its citizens to exercise caution.

Hours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine overnight. At least five people, including a one-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother, were killed when a drone struck a residential building in the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky.

The child was the grandson of an emergency responder, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said. “One of the rescuers arrived to respond to the aftermath right at his own home,” Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. “It turned out that a Shahed drone hit his house.”

In the southern city of Kherson, a large hole was seen in an administration building after missile attacks by the Russian army.

But Russian officials have suggested that Moscow has yet to respond to Ukraine's weekend drone attack, which came a day before two bridges collapsed, killing seven people – attacks Moscow blamed on Ukrainian sabotage.

After Ukraine carried out its unorthodox operation using drones smuggled into Russia on trucks, pro-Kremlin war bloggers and prominent commentators posted on Russian media to demand retribution, with some calling for nuclear retaliation.

While Russian officials have previously indicated their willingness to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, analysts consider the deployment of such weapons on the battlefield highly unlikely at this stage of the war.

Russia's nuclear doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks that pose a “critical threat” to the country's sovereignty.

In a podcast for the independent outlet  Meduza, Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russian nuclear forces, rejected suggestions that Ukraine's recent drone strikes could justify such a response. He argued the operation did not threaten Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity, nor did it undermine the retaliatory capacity of its strategic nuclear arsenal.

A nuclear strike would also be strongly condemned by China, Russia's most influential ally, with Xi Jinping previously warning Putin against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Instead, as in past responses to Ukrainian military successes, Moscow may launch a wave of deadly ballistic missile strikes – or deploy its experimental Oreshnik missile, which was used at least once last year.

Ukraine has intensified its sabotage operations over the past week, including detonating underwater explosives beneath a key bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

On Wednesday, a visibly angry Putin for the first time reacted to the Ukrainian attacks, accusing Kyiv of “organising terrorist attacks”. “How can we have meetings like this under these conditions? What is there to talk about? Who has negotiations with … terrorists?” he said.

Trump has not publicly commented on the Ukrainian drone operation, but sources who reportedly discussed it with him told Axios he described the attack as “strong” and “badass” and saw it as a setback to his diplomatic initiative to end the war.

While the drone strikes dealt a tangible blow to Russia's military capacity and offered a morale boost for Kyiv, the broader picture remains less rosy for Ukraine.

More than three years after launching its invasion, Russia is largely on the offensive, making steady battlefield gains in eastern Ukraine and continuing to pound Ukrainian cities and civilians with drones and missiles.

Putin's forces have been advancing further into Ukraine's northern region of Sumy, threatening the regional capital after taking more than 150 sq km of the area in less than two weeks.

With Putin showing no willingness to agree to a lasting ceasefire, Ukrainian officials and the military are preparing for a Russian summer offensive, with Moscow intent on advancing into the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.

US president casts doubt on peace efforts as German chancellor urges him to increase pressure on Moscow

Donald Trump has said it may be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” rather than pursue peace immediately, as the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, urged him to increase pressure on Russia.

During the Oval Office meeting, Trump voiced doubts about the potential success of peace talks, saying “sometimes you're better off letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart”.

The US president said he had told Vladimir Putin that the two countries were like “two young children fighting like crazy in a park” when the two spoke by phone on Wednesday.

Putin's reaction is not known, but the Russian leader would probably welcome the US agreeing to his previous calls for Washington to stay out of the conflict and stop providing military aid and support to Ukraine.

Merz, who used his speaking time in the Oval Office to press the US president on Ukraine, told Trump that he wanted to work together to put more pressure on Russia and reminded Trump that the violence he abhorred seeing was a result of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

He told Trump that the German people owed the US gratitude for its role in defeating Nazi Germany in the second world war.

“America is again in a very strong position to do something on ending this war [in Ukraine], so let's talk about doing what we can,” he said. “We are looking for more pressure on Russia, we should talk about that.”

Russia has vowed to respond to Ukraine's daring drone operation “how and when” it sees fit, the Kremlin warned, seeming to confirm reports that Putin had told Trump that Moscow was obliged to retaliate.

Ukraine has been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend, targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials.

The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday what Moscow's response would be, said: “How and when our military deems it appropriate.”

Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields, during an unannounced phone call on Wednesday.

The US embassy in Ukraine warned of a continuing risk of “significant airstrikes” and advised its citizens to exercise caution.

Hours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine overnight. At least five people, including a one-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother, were killed when a drone struck a residential building in the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky.

The child was the grandson of an emergency responder, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said. “One of the rescuers arrived to respond to the aftermath right at his own home,” Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. “It turned out that a Shahed drone hit his house.”

In the southern city of Kherson, a large hole was seen in an administration building after missile attacks by the Russian army.

But Russian officials have suggested that Moscow has yet to respond to Ukraine's weekend drone attack, which came a day before two bridges collapsed, killing seven people – attacks Moscow blamed on Ukrainian sabotage.

After Ukraine carried out its unorthodox operation using drones smuggled into Russia on trucks, pro-Kremlin war bloggers and prominent commentators posted on Russian media to demand retribution, with some calling for nuclear retaliation.

While Russian officials have previously indicated their willingness to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, analysts consider the deployment of such weapons on the battlefield highly unlikely at this stage of the war.

Russia's nuclear doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks that pose a “critical threat” to the country's sovereignty.

In a podcast for the independent outlet  Meduza, Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russian nuclear forces, rejected suggestions that Ukraine's recent drone strikes could justify such a response. He argued the operation did not threaten Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity, nor did it undermine the retaliatory capacity of its strategic nuclear arsenal.

A nuclear strike would also be strongly condemned by China, Russia's most influential ally, with Xi Jinping previously warning Putin against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

Instead, as in past responses to Ukrainian military successes, Moscow may launch a wave of deadly ballistic missile strikes – or deploy its experimental Oreshnik missile, which was used at least once last year.

Ukraine has intensified its sabotage operations over the past week, including detonating underwater explosives beneath a key bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

On Wednesday, a visibly angry Putin for the first time reacted to the Ukrainian attacks, accusing Kyiv of “organising terrorist attacks”. “How can we have meetings like this under these conditions? What is there to talk about? Who has negotiations with … terrorists?” he said.

Trump has not publicly commented on the Ukrainian drone operation, but sources who reportedly discussed it with him told Axios he described the attack as “strong” and “badass” and saw it as a setback to his diplomatic initiative to end the war.

While the drone strikes dealt a tangible blow to Russia's military capacity and offered a morale boost for Kyiv, the broader picture remains less rosy for Ukraine.

More than three years after launching its invasion, Russia is largely on the offensive, making steady battlefield gains in eastern Ukraine and continuing to pound Ukrainian cities and civilians with drones and missiles.

Putin's forces have been advancing further into Ukraine's northern region of Sumy, threatening the regional capital after taking more than 150 sq km of the area in less than two weeks.

With Putin showing no willingness to agree to a lasting ceasefire, Ukrainian officials and the military are preparing for a Russian summer offensive, with Moscow intent on advancing into the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.

Young voters are worried about their financial future and rising costs, advocacy organisation NextGen America says

Young people in the US are looking for Democrats to embrace economic populism and authentic candidates willing to fight for them, says the new leader of a group dedicated to youth voter mobilisation.

Victoria Yang is the interim president and executive director of NextGen America, an organisation that engages young people through voter education and registration. She succeeds Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, who held the post for four years.

In an interview with the Guardian, Yang criticised Democrats for failing to grapple with daily cost-of-living concerns and urged the party to learn from Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (AOC) focus on pocketbook issues.

NextGen recently commissioned Tulchin Research to conduct six online focus groups with swing voters aged 18 to 26 in battleground states. The focus groups found the young voters were anxious about their financial future and the rising cost of housing, food and education. Many felt the system was rigged, with billionaires riding high and working people short of opportunities.

These concerns ranked far higher than the war in Gaza or so-called “woke” topics such as gender pronouns. Speaking by phone from Boston, Yang said: “Right now what they're feeling is the everyday things that are affecting them: the cost of groceries, gas prices, paying for rent. That is the number one issue; we need to be focused on that.

“There's so many other issues as well but that's what our priority is: connecting with them on these issues and how, if they get involved and make their voices heard by voting, by volunteering, by signing petitions and fighting back, they're going to make the change that they want to see.”

The focus groups praised progressives Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez for their willingness to fight and directly address economic concerns. But last year's Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, who moderated some of her policy positions during the campaign, was seen by many as inauthentic.

“What our focus group showed was that economic populism is still resonating with young people and their messaging was not. If you go to the grocery store and you're now paying $6 or $7 for a gallon of milk and you were paying $4, you're now having to stretch your dollars further, and those little incremental increases all add up. The house that you're trying to save for, or trying to pay for college, has a domino effect.

“The Democrats were not leaning into that. We need to be leaning into making sure that young people understand: we hear you, we see you, this is what we're trying to do and then laying out a plan for that.”

Yang knows what she is fighting for. She was a small child when her family fled political persecution in Laos, spent time in a refugee camp in Thailand, then, 45 years ago, settled in southern California.

“I am living proof of the American dream and all the things that it holds. My mom, a single parent, put us through college and worked hard. I remember the struggles of having to figure out how to put food on the table. She did it as a waitress in a small Chinese restaurant.”

She also knows her way around the Democratic party, having worked with the Obama Foundation's Girls Opportunity Alliance, Democratic National Committee and former senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer. She takes over at NextGen at a moment when the party is embroiled in an identity crisis amid fears that young voters have veered to the right.

Yang says NextGen's work shows the value of consistent engagement. In eight key states last year, 67% of the young voters that NextGen registered and communicated with regularly went on to cast a ballot, compared with 54% youth turnout nationally. The lesson for Democrats is that it is not enough to show up late and take young voters for granted.

Yang continued: “You can't expect that you're going to knock on young people's doors the last two or three months of the election and then say, you should vote for candidate A and B, when the whole time you've never spoken to them or engaged them.

“The message that we want to make sure people understand and the party understands is that you have to invest in young people. They're at the very beginning of their voting journey and they haven't developed the voting muscle yet. They have to be educated.”

The focus groups found that TikTok was the dominant platform for this generation, and Instagram and YouTube are also very popular. Most participants do not seek out news but look to creators who are funny, authentic and able to make complicated subjects easier to understand.

Yang commented: “We have to make sure that we can help them understand what is at stake and talk to them authentically through the platforms and the way they want to be engaged. That's what this is all about.”

Democrats failed in this objective, Yang argues, by arriving late and over-relying on traditional media. NextGen is exploring new methods, such as an artificial intelligence chatbot on community platforms such as Discord, and an explicitly non-partisan approach to encouraging voter registration.

Much has been written about how Donald Trump outplayed Democrats by exploiting the “manosphere”, appealing to young men through rightwing influencers and podcasters. But Yang believes that economic imperatives eclipse gender, race or other variables.

“Inflation, tariffs, the cost of living – that resonates whether you're a man or woman, Black, brown, yellow or red. That's what will connect with young people. They might not identify with the Democratic party but the issues that are important to them resonate across all genders and all sectors.”

Young voters favored Harris over Trump in the 2024 election by four percentage points, a much smaller margin than the 25-point advantage young voters gave Joe Biden over Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast data. Opinion polls suggest that the shift was especially pronounced among young men.

Participants in NextGen's focus groups felt that Democratic party has lost touch with people it claims to represent. They described Democrats as weak, too willing to roll over and disconnected from everyday concerns. Some described Democrats as a “mom”, caring but overprotective, while Republicans were seen as a “dad”, assertive and focused on discipline and control.

Only 36% of Americans view Democrats favourably, according to a new Economist/ YouGov poll, but Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's Fighting Oligarchy Tour has been rallying big and enthusiastic crowds. Yang remains optimistic and hopeful for the future.

“Senator Sanders and AOC are talking on the issues. It's less about the party. It's less about even candidates or anything like that. It's an economic populist message and that is what they're leading with. The party is probably seeing that and getting the message but we still have to continue to engage and work on it.”

Young people are persuadable, she added. “Just because they voted maybe for Trump in this election doesn't mean that we don't have an opportunity to get them in the midterm, in the next presidential, if we meet them where they are, if we engage them all year round now until then. That's the key message.”

Yang's commitment to economic justice, a social safety net and giving young people a fair shot was shaped by her own experience. As an immigrant, she benefited from government programmes such as welfare assistance, free school lunches and a Pell Grant, which provides federal aid for college students with exceptional financial needs.

“That helped to define me and brought me to this work. The country as a democracy has provided all these opportunities. I want to make sure that these policies continue so when folks need it they have a safety net but also be able to create a life. It was transformative in so many ways and now I get to sit here and have a conversation with you.”

Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the UK-based Oxford Russia Fund of conducting a covert influence campaign in Russian universities aimed at undermining national security. The organization had already been declared ‘undesirable' by Moscow, a designation that prohibits its activities and implies involvement in hostile propaganda efforts.

The Oxford Russia Fund began operating in Russia in 2006 with the stated aim of supporting higher education in the humanities and social sciences. While it claimed to provide scholarships and academic resources, its work raised red flags for the authorities.

In 2021, the Prosecutor General's Office banned the organization, citing threats to national sovereignty. According to the FSB, it nonetheless continued to operate subversively, maintaining covert ties with university staff and facilitating the spread of foreign narratives.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the FSB said faculty members in the regions of Volgograd, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk, and Tomsk worked with the banned organization to distribute materials promoting “support for sexual minorities and LGBT values” – content considered incompatible with traditional Russian values. The NGO also allegedly collected sensitive data about the country's internal political and socioeconomic situation amid the Ukraine conflict.

Fifteen Russian nationals have received official warnings under criminal statutes related to collaboration with foreign entities deemed a threat to national security. One professor has already been fined for involvement with a banned group. The FSB and Prosecutor's Office also issued a formal warning to one of the universities involved.

The FSB claimed that British intelligence services have long targeted Russian academia as a channel for ideological influence. “They seek to raise a ‘new generation' of Russian citizens in a manner beneficial to London,” the statement said.

Over the past decade, Russia has introduced stricter laws to shield society from LGBT propaganda.

In 2013, LGBT content was banned for minors, and by 2022, the ban extended to all audiences. In 2023, the ‘international LGBT movement' was designated as a terrorist organization.

In its statement, the FSB announced that the British Council, the UK's primary cultural outreach institution, has also been declared ‘undesirable'. The authorities accuse the NGO of serving as a vehicle for British intelligence, using cultural programming as cover to destabilize sovereign states.

The UK has taken an increasingly hostile posture toward Russia, imposing sweeping sanctions while continuing to provide military support to Ukraine, despite the ongoing peace talks mediated by the US.

Russia's ambassador in London, Andrey Kelin, recently denounced Britain's behavior as “belligerent and irresponsible,” calling its support for Ukraine “senseless” and “reckless.”

The first hundred days of Donald Trump's second presidency have turned out worse for Europeans than expected. In addition to Vice President JD Vance's ideological crusade against European liberals, there are fears that the United States will abandon Ukraine and frustration and concern over Trump's initiation of unprecedented tariffs on European countries. In the wake of these disruptions, it is not surprising that the gaze of some European politicians has wistfully turned toward China, which is perceived by some as a potential hedge against an unpredictable United States. Brussels, for example, recently started negotiations with Beijing on reducing European tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for China lowering its tariffs on European goods and lifting export restrictions on rare-earth elements. And after Chinese leader Xi Jinping declined to travel to Europe for a 50th anniversary summit on EU-Chinese ties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, skeptical yet pragmatic in dealing with China, announced she will travel to Beijing in late July. 

Beijing, meanwhile, is playing its cards well and positioning itself as a more reasonable and cooperative great power than Washington. This is a change from Trump's first term, when China overplayed its hand and embraced an aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy that backfired. Now, not a day passes in which Chinese officials do not underscore how they share their European counterparts' desire to protect the multilateral trading system from Trump's disruptions. Xi, for instance, has noted that China and Europe are “two major forces for building a multipolar world, two major markets supporting globalization, and two major civilizations championing diversity.” China has even proposed reviving the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which was put on ice in 2021 after Beijing sanctioned several members of the European Parliament who were critical of China. If implemented, the CAI would replace the bilateral treaties that regulate how Chinese investors are treated in European countries and help create a level playing field for European businesses in China.

These are tempting overtures. But the harsh reality is that the game has not really changed: the EU still doesn't have a China card to play. In fact, Trump's disruptions are only magnifying China's economic and security threats to Europe. To offset U.S. tariffs this year, China diverted its exports to alternative markets including Europe. This resulted in a record Chinese trade surplus with Europe in the first quarter of 2025. These low-cost Chinese exports are massively subsidized and undercut European producers who are already facing margin pressures and the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Many of the goods China redirected from the United States to the EU are now competing directly with Europe's core manufacturing industries—the automotive sector, for instance, as well as electronics, industrial machinery and components, home appliances, and clean energy technologies. This flood of goods could damage the broader competitiveness of Europe's manufacturing ecosystem, creating something like the “China shock” that rocked the United States in the first decade of this century.

Europe's security threat from China has not diminished either. The Ukrainian government says it has evidence that Chinese factories inside Russia are producing weapons and that China is exporting gunpowder and artillery to Russia for use in Ukraine. Beijing denies the allegations. If China is bolstering Russia's military with impunity from both Brussels and Washington, the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end in a cease-fire or a peace agreement in the foreseeable future, and Russia will continue to destabilize not only Ukraine but also the entire European continent.

Seeking détente with China, therefore, is still a dangerous game for the EU. Instead, the EU must realize it has other cards to play, including forging more advantageous trade agreements elsewhere in the world and changing China's calculus about supporting Russia.

In the economic realm, Europe's strongest hedge against the U.S. trade war is to secure more agreements with allies, not with China. A central pillar of this strategy should be for the EU to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership—a trade pact among 12 economies, including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, and, more recently, the United Kingdom, that reduces tariffs; sets common rules on trade, investment, and labor; and aims to promote economic integration and strategic cooperation. The growing CPTPP architecture collectively accounts for about 15 percent of global GDP; if the EU were to join, the bloc would represent nearly 30 percent of global GDP.

Trade with CPTPP countries currently represents 15 percent of EU trade and is not sufficient to replace the more dominant trade relationship the EU has with China, but knitting together additional bilateral and multilateral trade and investment agreements with other allies and partners could build a promising hedge against both China and the United States. By adding new sectoral provisions to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada, for instance, the EU and Canada could build mutual resilience against China and the United States, especially in the areas of critical minerals and energy security. Brussels could also prioritize finalizing the EU-India Free Trade Agreement, which would help the EU take advantage of the world's fastest-growing major economy. This negotiation has long been stalled because of disputes over market access and tariff reductions, but the United Kingdom recently secured its own agreement with India, which could provide a path for the EU to do the same. Similarly, the free-trade agreement that the EU completed in December 2024 with the Mercosur bloc of countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay) should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to open Europe to vast Latin American markets and the region's bountiful natural resources.



Building on momentum from the 2023 Hiroshima G-7 summit, Europe should also deepen coordination on economic and technology security with advanced democracies, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. These countries must align their strategies to counter Chinese economic coercion and mitigate the risks of China's civil-military fusion. Joint initiatives should prioritize the protection and advancement of dual-use technologies, especially in AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology. Maintaining a lead in these sectors will require not just defensive measures but coordinated investment in innovation.

Collectively, these same allies can also help sustain high-value scientific research, which the second Trump administration is aggressively defunding at top U.S. research universities and government labs. What could become a generational self-inflicted wound for the United States could also become a generational opportunity for Europe—to attract displaced talent, safeguard R & D programs, and reinforce its own innovation base. Although strong security frameworks will be necessary to prevent intellectual property theft, selective cooperation with Beijing will remain crucial for European companies, especially in the automotive sector, where European manufacturers lag behind, and in battery innovation and clean energy technology, where Chinese firms lead globally.

As Europe expands and reprioritizes its trade and technology relationships with allies and partners, it must also reform the rules and institutions that govern those ties to allow more innovation and investment while protecting core European interests. New frameworks should be built with flexibility in mind to allow the United States, under a future administration, to participate. Strategic patience and careful design today can lay the groundwork for a renewed transatlantic partnership tomorrow.

Insulating itself from trade shocks, however, is only step one: Europe must also stop underestimating China's support for Russia's war against Ukraine, which in turn threatens European security. During the Biden administration, the United States condemned China's support of the Russian industrial base, but Europe has been more cautious and has rarely threatened Beijing or followed through with serious consequences. Beijing has stopped short of delivering weapons directly to Russia, which President Joe Biden warned is a redline. But China's supply of dual-use goods, such as semiconductor chips and weapons parts, has taken on such proportions that it has become the equivalent of providing lethal aid: Carnegie estimates that, in 2023, China was responsible for roughly 90 percent of the goods that Russia needs to sustain its war effort. An internal EU report this year estimates that China is responsible for approximately 80 percent of all circumventions of sanctions against Russia.

This support allowed Russia's military to reconstitute itself much faster than many NATO analysts expected after the massive losses in the first year of the war. Yet pressure on China for its obstructive role has almost disappeared. Trump administration officials have declined to push for greater scrutiny of China's role in the war and have instead repeatedly suggested that China can help end the war in a positive way, without following up with any pressure on China to do so. European governments, meanwhile, say they oppose Beijing's involvement while doing little to genuinely punish or deter China: so far, Europe has sanctioned only a few dozen Chinese companies for delivering dual-use goods to Russia.

Ukraine has tried to keep its partners focused on China's involvement and to demonstrate that Beijing's support for Russia is intensifying. Kyiv has claimed, for instance, that more than 150 Chinese mercenaries are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine and that Beijing has done nothing to rein them in. Ukraine has also pointed to China's willingness to cross the dual-use line, claiming it has evidence of China's direct involvement in weapons manufacturing inside Russia. Yet precisely because China is no longer facing any significant backlash from the United States or Europe, Beijing has moved to take advantage of the newly permissive environment. During a summit last month in Moscow, which coincided with Russia's annual commemoration of the Allied victory in World War II, Putin and Xi pledged to “enhance [their] strategic coordination.”



Moscow is also taking advantage of European inaction. Because it can rely on China's support for its military needs, Russia believes it can outlast Ukraine. Increasing pressure on China for its support of the war, therefore, is one of the best methods by which the United States and Europe could increase pressure on Russia to agree to a cease-fire. Military analysts believe that Russia is planning a summer offensive in which it will expend its stockpile of weapons; afterward, it will rely on what it can produce from day to day, heightening its dependence on the supply chains it has built with other countries. At that point, sanctions that bite at Chinese supply lines to Russia could become particularly effective.

Even if the United States is not on board with such sanctions, Europe has a lot of leverage of its own. The flip side of Europe's trade dependence on China is China's own reliance on Europe's market to absorb its excess capacity. Since Trump's tariff announcements against China and the diversion of U.S.-bound Chinese goods to Europe, Europe is now an even more important market for China's exports; Europeans should use that leverage to ramp up the pressure on China. Instead of merely sanctioning Chinese companies that trade in goods that are of use to Russia's military, the European Union should apply sanctions on Chinese banks that help Russia circumvent the EU's sanctions regime. And if China truly wants to pursue a revival of an investment agreement with Europe, Brussels should condition any talks on China restricting the flow of dual-use goods to Russia's military.

Europeans also have an opportunity to take advantage of China's role on the sidelines of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. China has invested a great deal of political capital into portraying itself as a potential neutral mediator in the war, albeit with pro-Russian leanings. This is now, ironically, the same role that the Trump administration has assumed, and there are signs that China suspects it is being left out. According to The Wall Street Journal, Chinese officials proposed hosting a Putin-Trump summit and offered to facilitate peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, but Washington wasn't interested. Europeans should signal to Beijing that it could be in China's interest to take a step back from being so obviously supportive of Russia, while arguing neutrality.

Increased pressure on China will not, of course, result in Beijing abandoning Moscow. Nor will more free-trade agreements completely make up for the economic losses in a trade war with the United States and diminishing returns from trade with China. But regardless of how hostile the Trump administration (and Trump himself) is to the EU and how sweet the gestures are from Beijing, Europe must remember that China is not its friend. Europe cannot hedge against Trump's disruptions by selling out its own economy and security.

Frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani sparred on stage as all candidates said they'd stand up to Trump

In the first debate of the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, nine candidates took the stage and fielded questions on housing, affordability, crime, policing, public safety, political regrets and how each candidate would handle the Trump administration if elected.

The candidates included former New York governor Andrew Cuomo; democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani; the New York City council speaker, Adrienne Adams; the current New York City comptroller, Brad Lander; former comptroller Scott Stringer; former Bronx assemblyman Michael Blake; state senators Zellnor Myrie and Jessica Ramos; and former hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson.

The current mayor, Eric Adams, was not present on Wednesday as he is running for re-election as an independent candidate, although he ran as a Democrat in 2021.

A few takeaways from the debate:

Throughout the debate, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, the current frontrunner in the race, was grilled on his record by his Democratic rivals.

Cuomo spent much of the night sparring with progressive state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, who is polling second. Mamdani accused Cuomo of being beholden to wealthy donors and corporate interests, saying Cuomo prioritized the “1%, the billionaires and the profitable corporations”, over “working-class New Yorkers”.

Cuomo dismissed the 33-year-old as inexperienced, calling Mamdani “very good on Twitter and with videos” but saying he was someone who “produces nothing”.

“He's been in government 27 minutes, he passed three bills, that's all he's done,” Cuomo said. “He has no experience with Washington, no experience with New York City.”

Trump came up several times, as the candidates agreed the next mayor must be ready to stand up to his administration if elected mayor, though they differed on who was best equipped to do so.

“I know how to deal with Donald Trump because I've dealt with him before,” Cuomo said, citing his experience as New York governor.

Mamdani warned that “President Trump will target whomever is the next mayor of this city” and said that is “important that we have a mayor who will fight back and that is what I will do”.

“I am Donald Trump's worst nightmare as a progressive Muslim immigrant who actually fights for the things that I believe in,” Mamdani added. “And the difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in DC.”

Cuomo fired back, saying that “Donald Trump would go through Mr Mamdani like a hot knife through butter”.

“He would be Trump's delight,” Cuomo added.

Mamdani countered: “It's true that I don't have experience with corrupt Trump billionaires that are funding my campaign. I don't have experience with party politics and insider consultants. I do have experience, however, with winning $450m in debt relief for thousands of working-class taxi drivers and actually delivering for working-class people.”

Adrienne Adams, the speaker of the New York city council, said she would take legal action against Trump when necessary.

Asked how they would respond if the Trump administration ordered city-run hospitals to stop providing care to undocumented patients or risk losing millions in federal funding, all candidates voiced strong opposition to Trump's recent crackdown on immigration in general.

“You cannot give in to Mr Trump and his demands,” Cuomo said. “If you give in to him, he is a bully, I know him well, if you give in to him today, you will be giving him your lunch money for the rest of your life.”

“You have to fight him and the way you fight him is not by suing him,” the former governor said. “We need a national coalition, which we can put together of like-minded states and cities that will oppose these actions and then we're going to have to eventually beat him politically in Congress.”

Whitney Tilson said that if Trump were to act “illegally to try and blackmail us, you have to sue to restore that funding”, adding that he was “appalled by what Trump is doing to terrorize immigrant communities” and would “fight him tooth and nail”.

Mamdani said that New York City was “under attack by an authoritarian Trump administration”.

“The way that we fight back is ensure that our local institutions continue to provide the services to each and every New Yorker,” he said. “We will tell those institutions that we will provide that funding and we will get that funding by taxing the 1% and the wealthiest corporations.”

Pressed about his administration's handling of nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic – a 2021 report by the New York attorney general found that his office undercounted thousands of deaths of state nursing home residents – Cuomo defended his record, claiming the numbers were not, in fact, undercounted.

He also denied the sexual harassment allegations against him that led to his resignation. “I said at the time that if I offended anyone it was unintentional but I apologize and I say that today,” he said.

City council speaker Adrienne Adams took a swipe at the current mayor. “My biggest regret is believing that Eric Adams would be a good mayor for all New Yorkers,” she said.

The city's comptroller, Brad Lander, said that he regretted not pushing “for more housing in his Brooklyn district when he was a city council member”.

Mandani used the moment to target Cuomo once more, saying that “as a Democrat, one of my regrets is having trusted the leaders within our own party, leaders like Andrew Cuomo”.

Cuomo, on the other hand, said his biggest regret was “the state of the Democratic party”, which prompted backlash from other candidates on stage. “No personal regrets?” asked Adrienne Adams. “No regrets when it comes to cutting Medicaid or healthcare? No regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?”

Cuomo said her claims were “not accurate”, adding: “Medicaid went up under me. I pushed President Trump to give us everything he had, leading the way during Covid.”

The moderators asked the candidates how much they pay in rent or mortgage in New York City. Adams said she owned her home and that it was paid off; Mamdani said he pays $2,300 a month in rent for a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria.

Blake said he spends about $1,800 for a home that he owns, while Myrie said his rent-stabilized apartment was $1,300 a month and Ramos said her rent was $2,500 a month. Lander said his mortgage was $3,300 a month.

Cuomo said that he pays $7,800 a month, while Tilson said that he owned his home and paid about $5,000 per month in maintenance fees and taxes. Stringer said he pays $6,400.

MOSCOW, June 5. /TASS/. Moscow will take into account in negotiations the fact that the Kiev regime is becoming terrorist, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.

"Of course, the fact that the Kiev regime has acquired all the characteristics of a terrorist regime cannot be ignored in the future. It will be taken into account," he replied, when asked whether Russia would suspend negotiations with Ukraine in the event of more terrorist attacks.

In the late evening of May 31 and early hours of June 1, the Kiev regime carried out terrorist attacks on railway lines in the Bryansk and Kursk regions. In both cases, overpasses were blown up, causing trains to derail. In the Bryansk region, seven people were killed in the incident involving a passenger train, and 120 victims sought medical assistance. In the Kursk Region, the train driver and two of his assistants were injured.

On June 1, Kiev used drones to carry out terrorist attacks against airfields in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions. The attacks in the Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions were repelled. Several aircraft caught fire as a result of the attacks, but all fires were extinguished. The Defense Ministry added that there were no casualties among military personnel or civilian personnel. Some suspects involved in the terrorist attacks have been detained.

The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that the June 1 “Spiderweb” drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian airbases.

The agency confirmed that more details about the attack will be revealed later.

“And you thought Ukraine was easy? Ukraine is exceptional. Ukraine is unique. All the steamrollers of history have rolled over it. It has withstood every kind of trial. It is tempered by the highest degree. In today's world, its value is beyond measure,” the SBU wrote, quoting Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko.

They also vowed to continue to drive Russian forces out of Ukrainian territory.

“We will strike them (Russia) at sea, in the air, and on the ground. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,” the SBU said.

This operation targeted aircraft that is used in frequent long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the plan had been in preparation for over a year and a half.

According to a Kyiv Independent SBU source, first-person-view (FPV) drones were covertly transported deep into Russian territory and hidden inside trucks before being launched against four major airfields.

The source said one of the airfields hit was the Belaya air base in Russia's Irkutsk Oblast, more than 4,000 kilometers from Ukraine.

Olenya air base in Russia's Murmansk Oblast, the Diaghilev airbase in Ryazan Oblast, Ivanovo airbase in Ivanovo Oblast were also targeted.

More than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3, according to the source.

The Tu-95 is a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. It was originally used to carry nuclear bombs but has since evolved to launch cruise missiles.

Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles.

Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, amid ongoing U.S.-backed ceasefire talks and negotiations.

On May 26, Russian forces launched the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys.

            The number of newborns in Japan is decreasing faster than projected, with the number of annual births falling to another record low last year, according to government data released Wednesday.
    


            The health ministry said 686,061 babies were born in Japan in 2024, a drop of 5.7% on the previous year and the first time the number of newborns fell below 700,000 since records began in 1899. It's the 16th straight year of decline.
    


            It's about one-quarter of the peak of 2.7 million births in 1949 during the postwar baby boom.
    


            The data in a country of rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the sustainability of the economy and national security at a time it seeks to increase defense spending.
    


            Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as “a silent emergency” and has promised to promote more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women.
    


            Japan is one of a number of east Asian countries grappling with falling birth rates and an aging population. South Korea and China have fought for years to encourage families to have more children. Also on Wednesday, Vietnam scrapped decades-old laws limiting families to two children in an effort to stem falling birth rates.

            The health ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate – the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. The number of marriages was slightly up, to 485,063 couples, but the downtrend since the 1970s remains unchanged.
    


            Experts say the government's measures have not addressed a growing number of young people reluctant to marry, largely focusing on already married couples.
    


            The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to bleak job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that adds extra burdens for women and working mothers, experts say.
    


            A growing number of women also cite pressure to take their husband's surname as a reason for their reluctance to marry. Under Japanese law, couples must choose a single surname to marry.
    


            Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, with 40% of the population over 65.

Ukrainian forces launched a missile strike on June 5 targeting a concentration of Russian missile troops near the city of Klintsy in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

The strike reportedly destroyed one Iskander missile launcher and seriously damaged two others. The targeted unit, part of Russia's 26th Missile Brigade, had attempted to fire on Ukrainian territory — likely aiming at Kyiv — before it was hit, according to the military.

"Thanks to effective reconnaissance and the coordinated efforts of the Armed Forces and the Security Service of Ukraine, the targets were successfully hit," the General Staff said. 

The agency added that there were no civilian casualties, and assessments of Russian losses are ongoing. 

The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system used by Russia for precision strikes against military and infrastructure targets.

With a range of up to 500 kilometers (some 311 miles) and the ability to carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the system remains a key component of Russia's tactical missile forces.

Bryansk Oblast lies just northeast of Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it one of the key Russian regions bordering northern Ukraine.

The strike came as part of Ukraine's broader effort to degrade Russia's offensive capabilities.

On the same night, Russia launched 103 drones — including Iranian-designed Shahed suicide drones — and one Iskander-M ballistic missile against Ukrainian territory.

Targeting missile assets there may disrupt Russia's ability to launch precision strikes, particularly in advance of an anticipated new summer offensive.

            The bodies of two Israeli-American hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 were recovered from southern Gaza during a military operation, according to a statement from Israeli military and the Shin Bet security agency.
    


            Judy Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023.
    


            “Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our deepest condolences to the dear families,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
    


            The prime minister thanked the soldiers and commanders involved in the operation and vowed to return all remaining hostages held in Gaza.
    


            “We will not rest and we will not be silent until all our hostages – both the living and the fallen – are brought home,” he said.

            A spokesperson for kibbutz Nir Oz said the bodies of the two hostages had been returned to Israel overnight and would be laid to rest.
    


            The couple had four children and seven grandchildren.
    


            In a statement the Kibbutz remembered Gadi as “a sharp-minded man, a gifted wind instrument player since the age of three, deeply connected to the land, a chef and advocate of healthy vegan nutrition and sports,” and Judy as “a poet, entrepreneur, creative spirit, and devoted advocate for peace and coexistence.”
    


            A statement from the family, provided by the Nir Oz spokesperson expressed gratitude for the return of their missing loved ones.
    


            “We are grateful for the closure we have been granted and for the return of our loved ones for burial – they went out for a walk on that Black Saturday morning and never came back. In this emotional moment, we want to thank the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and security forces who carried out this complex rescue operation and have been fighting for us for over a year and a half, and to everyone who supported, struggled, prayed, and fought for us and for all the people of Israel,” it said.
    


            The family also thanked the US administration, the Israeli government and the FBI for their “tireless work and ongoing support.”
    


            “Still, our hearts will not be whole until all 12 hostages from Nir Oz – and all 56 hostages – are brought home,” the statement added.
    


            A total of 56 hostages remain in Gaza, including one taken in 2014. Twenty are believed to still be alive.
    


            Throughout 20 months of war in the territory, the rescue of hostages and the recovery of bodies has happened on only a few occasions. In late-March, Israeli forces recovered “findings” related to Manny Goddard, whose body was taken into Gaza after he was killed by members of Islamic Jihad on October 7, according to the IDF and the Shin Bet.

            In January, Israeli forces recovered the body of soldier Oron Shaul, who was killed during a battle in the enclave in July 2014. The remains of another soldier killed during the same conflict remain in Gaza.
    


            Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the latest news, calling it both heartbreaking and healing.
    


            “Their return reminds us all that it is the state's duty to bring everyone home, so that we, the families, together with all the people of Israel, can begin the process of healing and recovery,” a statement from the forum said.
    


            “Decision-makers must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial,” it added.
    


            Bringing back all hostages still in Gaza is among Israel's primary war goals, along with the destruction of Hamas. The release of hostages has been a key point in mediated negotiations aimed toward a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group.

Ukraine would not have launched its drone strike on Russian strategic bombers if Moscow had accepted Kyiv's calls for a ceasefire, President Volodymyr Zelensky said during a June 4 meeting with journalists attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Kyiv has repeatedly urged Russia to accept a Western-backed 30-day ceasefire as the first step toward a broader peace deal — a move that Moscow again rejected during a recent round of negotiations in Istanbul on June 2.

"If there had been a ceasefire, would the operation have taken place? No," Zelensky said when asked about the massive June 1 drone operation, codenamed Operation Spiderweb.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the strike, which reportedly hit 41 Russian military aircraft and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage. 

Zelensky added that roughly half of the planes will be impossible to repair, while others will require significant time to be put back into service.

When asked about a potential reaction from U.S. President Donald Trump, Zelensky said he was unaware of any public comment. 

Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, acknowledged that the strike demonstrated Ukraine was "not lying down," but he warned it could escalate the war further. The U.S. president has not yet commented on the strike.

"We should choose the game rules," Zelensky said, underscoring that Ukraine would continue to respond as long as Russia carries out attacks against Ukrainian territory.

The SBU said 117 drones, launched from trucks hidden across Russia, struck four different Russian air bases, some of them thousands of kilometers from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The targeted facilities reportedly housed Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 bombers, essential carriers of long-range cruise missiles used in Moscow's air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Talking about the recent peace talks, Zelensky dismissed Russia's engagement as "artificial diplomacy," calling the "peace memorandum" it presented an "ultimatum." He noted that there is no sense in continuing negotiations with lower-level Russian delegates, calling instead for a meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia used the talks to list its peace conditions, which reportedly included official recognition of Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories, Ukraine's full withdrawal from four partially occupied regions, a ban on joining NATO, limits on the military, and other demands.

Like the first round of talks on May 16, this week's negotiations ended without any tangible progress toward a long-term ceasefire or a peace deal. Instead, the two parties agreed on a new prisoner exchange, which could involve up to 1,200 prisoners on each side.

Trump's proclamation cited national security concerns as a justification for restricting international students.Faith Ninivaggi/Reuters

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday suspended for an initial six months the entry into the United States of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard University, amid an escalating dispute with the Ivy League school.

Trump's proclamation cited national security concerns as a justification for barring international students from entering the United States to pursue studies at the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university.

Harvard in a statement called Trump's proclamation “yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.”

“Harvard will continue to protect its international students,” it added.

The suspension can be extended beyond six months. Trump's proclamation also directs the U.S. State Department to consider revoking academic or exchange visas of any current Harvard students who meet his proclamation's criteria.

The directive on Wednesday came a week after a federal judge in Boston announced she would issue a broad injunction blocking the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students, who make up about a quarter of its student body.

As Harvard battles Trump's international enrolment ban, hundreds of Canadian students anxiously hold their breath

The administration has launched a multifront attack on the nation's oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.

Harvard argues the administration is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to its demands to control the school's governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.

Harvard sued after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on May 22 announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enroll foreign students.

Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard's certification through a lengthier administrative process.

Opinion: America's talented foreign students could find a home in Canada

Nonetheless, Burroughs said she planned to issue a longer-term preliminary injunction at Harvard's urging, saying one was necessary to give some protection to Harvard's international students.

In an internal cable seen by Reuters that was issued a day after that court hearing, the State Department ordered all its consular missions overseas to begin additional vetting of visa applicants looking to travel to Harvard for any purpose.

Wednesday's two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism,” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries,” including China.

The FBI had “long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development and spread false information,” the proclamation said.

It said Harvard had seen a “drastic rise in crime in recent years while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus,” and had failed to provide sufficient information to the Homeland Security Department about foreign students' “known illegal or dangerous activities.”

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a briefing on June 4 that he may consider allowing the creation of private armies in Ukraine.

His comment came as a reaction to one of the points in the latest Russian memorandum, which calls for Ukraine to eliminate “nationalist formations” and private military companies.

“I will now start thinking about it after such ultimatums,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine currently has no private armed groups under its law, noting, “If they are talking about ‘Azov,' it is the National Guard of Ukraine.”

He contrasted Ukraine's military structure with Russia's use of private forces and mercenary groups like Wagner, highlighting the double standards.

“They (Russia) have ‘Wagner' and it is true. They admit it, they admit that they have private military formations that we destroyed,” Zelensky said.

According to a document leaked after the second round of talks with Ukraine, Russia's demands also include Ukraine's neutral status, a ban on the country's NATO bid and other possible military alliances, and an official end to Western arms supplies and intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

Russia is also demanding the official recognition of Crimea, as well as Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts as Russian, even though significant portions of these regions are still under Ukrainian control.

BUDAPEST, June 5. /TASS/. Russian and Hungary are working on documents on cooperation in trade, science, medicine and other areas ahead of the next meeting of the intergovernmental commission of economic cooperation due to be held in Moscow this fall, Gabor Nagy, head of the Hungarian foreign ministry's department of Russia and Central Asia, told TASS.

He recalled that the previous meeting of the commission, which is co-chaired by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, was held in Budapest in 2024. "The next meeting will be held in Moscow. Working groups are making preparations for it," he said.

When asked which areas it is planned to address at the upcoming meeting, he said, "Medicine, trade, science." "Work continues in various areas. Specialists are agreeing various matters, which will be referred to the commission's meeting in the coming fall," he said, adding that the exact date will be agreed upon later.

After the previous meeting of the commission in Budapest in September 2024, the sides inked a protocol on cooperation in such areas as energy, agriculture, sport, public health, and culture. Apart from that, Russia's ministry of science signed a cooperation agreement with the Hungarian ministry of culture and innovations, and a memorandum on Stipendium Hungaricum scholarship programs with the Hungarian foreign ministry.

The Department of Justice is seeking to block a Texas law that allows college students to access reduced in-state tuition rates regardless of their immigration status.

Filed in the Wichita Falls division of the Northern District of Texas, the lawsuit asked a federal judge to block the law that has been in place for almost 25 years, citing an executive order designed to stop any state or local laws deemed discriminatory against legal U.S. residents.

SEOUL, June 5. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reassured visiting Secretary of the Russian Security Council Sergey Shoigu that Pyongyang will continue supporting Moscow in international affairs, including the situation in Ukraine, the Central Korean News Agency (KCNA) reported.

Kim received Shoigu on June 4.

"Kim Jong Un affirmed that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will, in the future, too, unconditionally support the stand of Russia and its foreign policies in all the crucial international political issues including the Ukrainian issue and responsibly observe the articles of the treaty between the DPRK and Russia," KCNA said.

"He expressed expectation and conviction that Russia would, as ever, surely win victory in the sacred cause of justice for defending national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests," it said, adding that the North Korean leader wished the Russian people "eternal victory, prosperity and happiness."

According to the agency, the meeting was held in a friendly atmosphere of trust. The sides discussed the situation around Ukraine and the international agenda. "The talk confirmed the consensus of stand of the two sides," KCNA noted. Shoigu conveyed the Russian leadership's special gratitude for "the matchless heroism and self-sacrificing spirit of the Korean people's excellent sons who participated in the operations for liberating the Kursk area and defended the precious part of the Russian territory as their own motherland, fighting shoulder to shoulder with Russian soldiers in the same trench.".

President Donald Trump says he's “very disappointed” with Elon Musk after the tech billionaire slammed the president's signature tax and spending bill and suggested that Musk, who recently left the administration, has “Trump derangement syndrome.”

Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who recently left President Donald Trump's administration, has blasted the tax cuts and spending plans backed by the president that passed the House.

Republican Senators are avoiding direct criticism of Elon Musk, who supported President Donald Trump's campaign but has come out against Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts as a “disgusting abomination.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Elon Musk's alliance took off like one of SpaceX's rockets. It was supercharged and soared high. And then it blew up.

The spectacular flameout Thursday hit a crescendo when Trump threatened to cut Musk's government contracts and Musk said without providing evidence that Trump's administration hasn't released all the records related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is mentioned in them.

The messy blow-up between the president of the United States and the world's richest man played out on their respective social media platforms after Trump was asked during a White House meeting with Germany's new leader about Musk's criticism of his spending bill.

It came less than a week after they appeared together at the White House for a subdued goodbye and Trump thanked Musk for his brief time in the U.S. government by handing him a symbolic but nonfunctional golden key.

Trump had largely remained silent as Musk stewed over the last few days on his social media platform X, condemning the president's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.” But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, saying he was “very disappointed in Musk.”

Musk responded on social media in real time. Trump, who was supposed to be spending Thursday discussing an end to the Russia-Ukraine war with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, ratcheted up the stakes when he turned to his own social media network, Truth Social, and threatened to use the U.S. government to hurt Musk's bottom line by going after contracts held by his internet company Starlink and rocket company SpaceX. 




“The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network.

“This just gets better and better,” Musk quickly replied on X. “Go ahead, make my day.”

Musk then said, without offering evidence of how he might know the information, that Trump was “in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” 

The insinuation tapped into long-standing suspicions among conspiracy theorists and online sleuths that incriminating and sensitive files in the government's possession have yet to be released.

The deepening rift unfurled much like their relationship started — rapidly, intensely and very publicly. 

It also quickly hit Musk financially, even before Trump's threat.

After Trump started speaking about Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla fell over 10%, their latest notable move since the election. The shares doubled in the weeks after Trump was elected, gave back those gains and more during Musk's time at DOGE and then rallied after he vowed in April to focus much more on Tesla and his other companies.

Politicians and their donor patrons rarely see eye to eye. But the magnitude of Musk's support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free rein the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling-out.

Musk offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. “Such ingratitude,” Musk said in a follow-up post.

Musk announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last July. News of Musk's political action committee in support of Trump's election came days later.

Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew with him on Air Force One for weekend stays at Mar-a-Lago, slept in the White House's Lincoln Bedroom and joined his Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat (sometimes more than one).

Three months ago, Trump purchased a red Tesla from Musk on the White House driveway as a public show of support for his business as it faced blowback.

Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a somewhat somber news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service.

Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday.

“I said, ‘Do you want a little makeup? We'll get you a little makeup.' Which is interesting,” Trump said.

The Republican president's comments came as Musk has griped for days on social media about Trump's spending bill, warning that it will increase the federal deficit. Musk has called the bill a “disgusting abomination.”

“He hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, presaging his future. “But I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot.”

Trump later said on social media that “Elon was ‘wearing thin,' I asked him to leave.” Musk's government employment status, however, limited him from continuing to work.

“He just went CRAZY!” Trump said.

Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would flame out in spectacular fashion. It did, in less than a year. 

Trump said Thursday that he and Musk had had a great relationship but mused: “I don't know if we will anymore.”

He said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.”

“It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it,” he said. 

He brushed aside the billionaire's efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party's leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future. 

Trump said Musk “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles. 

“False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”

In another post, he said Trump could keep the spending cuts but “ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.”

Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk's promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA.

Trump withdrew Isaacman's nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role.

“I didn't think it was appropriate,” Trump said Thursday, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.”

Musk continued slinging his responses on social media. He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media.

“Where is the man who wrote these words?” Musk wrote. “Was he replaced by a body double!?”

The ‘Outnumbered' panel weighs in after Chinese nationals were charged with smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen into the United States.

In response to the Department of Justice charging two Chinese nationals – including a University of Michigan research fellow – with allegedly smuggling a potential "agroterrorism" weapon into the U.S., national security experts tell Fox News Digital that the Trump administration must continue to take action to prevent American colleges and companies from "essentially educating and arming our chief adversary in the world." 

"In some cases, it seems like we learned nothing from COVID," Christian Whiton, a former senior foreign policy advisor in the Bush and Trump administrations, told Fox News Digital. "We allow direct flights now from China to the U.S. mainland. Again, that is crazy. And the whole fact that we are allowing researchers, even in the realm of dealing with pathogens to have access anywhere in the United States, much less the universities, is pretty insane. It seems like a pre-COVID mindset." 

The two Chinese nationals were charged Tuesday with smuggling Fusarium graminearum fungus, a dangerous biological pathogen and "known agroterrorism agent" responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year, through Detroit's airport. The noxious substance causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, according to federal prosecutors. In humans and livestock, exposure to its toxins causes vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects. 

"It's a new take on Chinese espionage and sabotage of the US economy. But it's not a surprise. I think that China has failed to pull back on any of its aggressive activity. And this is something that the Trump administration probably wants to take into consideration," Whiton said of the case. "I think it's both the government and our universities have let down the American people." 

PATEL SOUNDS ALARM AS CHINESE NATIONALS CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING 'AGROTERRORISM AGENT' INTO US: 'DIRECT THREAT'

Whiton told Fox News Digital that Chinese infiltration of U.S. institutions has been happening since at least the 1990s – when Chinese spies stole American nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico – and since then, "there's been this systemic desire to put Chinese nationals into especially these technical areas, technical universities." Whiton said Beijing does not consider only Chinese citizens as its agents, as "anyone of Chinese ethnicity" have been viewed as "fair game" to be recruited. He categorized the H1-B visa program as essentially a "scam," asserting that about a quarter are awarded to Chinese nationals who "end up at some of our high-tech companies." 

Traditionally, Whiton explained, Republicans have believed universities should run themselves without political interference, but doing so has allowed such institutions to be taken over by left-wingers. 

"Taxpayers are funding these things and shouldn't be forced to fund things that are anathema to their beliefs and what they know to be true. Things like we shouldn't train our enemies at taxpayer expense," Whiton said. "So, I think it goes along with Republicans being pretty wimpy in the past, but only more recently with the emergence of the new right and the MAGA movement finally taking a tougher stand on some of these left-wing universities." 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the United States does not want to de-couple with China, though Beijing has a choice whether to be a reliable partner. 

"The reality is China is kind of doing what it has always done," Whiton said. "So if we're looking for a change of Chinese conduct because of President Trump being in office, it just hasn't happened yet. So I can't say that's a surprise." 

Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would "aggressively" revoke the student visas for Chinese nationals, "including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields." After a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which the White House said focused mostly on trade, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that Chinese students were still coming and the U.S. would be "honored" to have them. Yet, the president said the students need to be properly "checked" and the administration wants lists of Chinese nationals admitted to schools, such as Harvard and Columbia, so that vetting can occur.

TRUMP TOUTS 'VERY POSITIVE' BREAKTHROUGH WITH XI AFTER SLAMMING CHINA FOR TRADE VIOLATION

"That's a step in the right direction," Whiton said. "But in reality, we probably need to recognize these are our chief economic and security adversary in the world and take those visa numbers down closer to zero and start sending these people home." 

Whiton said there is a "faulty assumption" that Chinese students would come to the United States, learn about American culture and bring an appreciation back home to China. 

"In reality, they sort of come over here, they're in a bubble, they pick up technical skills, and then they go back to China and put them to use for either the military directly or for corporations that are either utilized by the Chinese military or that are trying to undermine U.S. technology companies," Whiton said. "We really are essentially educating and arming our chief adversary in the world." 

Former Rep. Michelle Steel, a California Republican who served on the House foreign and intelligence committees, told Fox News Digital that Chinese students educated in the U.S. essentially return home without an appreciation for America. 

"After they study here, they took all of our brains here, and they took everything back to their country, and they are using to attack United States. And they hate United States after that education. Guess what we are teaching in the universities? Not love United States!" Steel, who was born in Korea and grew up in Japan, told Fox News Digital.  "They are studying some very sensitive things in our universities. We really had to vet them well." 

In her eyes, U.S. universities have prioritized bringing in international students for economic gain.

"Because of all the money," she said. "They try to build their endowments, and they want to just show how big their research center is." 

She cited the case against former Chair of Harvard University's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, Dr. Charles Lieber, who was convicted in 2023 of lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with the People's Republic of China's Thousand Talents Program and the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in Wuhan, China. Federal prosecutors said Lieber had been paid $1.5 million by the CCP and failed to report additional income of $50,000 payments per month from the WUT. 

"It's not just at University of Michigan, but it's just everywhere," Steel said. "We cannot bring everybody in to these universities and studying together and helping to build CCP's military. That's just totally no-no, because you know what they're doing in the Pacific areas and African countries and South American countries. And they're just expanding everywhere. And we are the only one [who] can stop [it]. And I think President Trump is doing great job."

The former congresswoman pointed to how the House Select Committee on the CCP in 2023 uncovered a $220 million payment made by the Chinese government to the University of California at Berkeley to help build a massive, joint institute in China – funding which UC Berkeley failed to disclose under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act. She has advocated for legislation that would decrease the reporting requirement from $250,000 to $50,000. 

Steel also noted that Stanford University – located in the heart of Silicon Valley in California – has a relationship with China's Peking University, which in turn has ties to the Chinese military and "goes straight into the nuclear program." The current chair of the House Select Committee on the CCP, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., penned a letter to Stanford in March over concerns about U.S. universities "admitting large numbers of Chinese nationals into advanced STEM programs, potentially at the expense of qualified Americans."

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addresses Democrats' criticism that DOGE is a 'big scam' and lays out his goals for the department's cuts 'The Story.'

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in grant funding for AmeriCorps and to reemploy thousands of employees, ruling that the administration's abrupt dismantling of the organization violated federal law. 

U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman agreed to reinstate thousands of terminated AmeriCorps employees across 24 U.S. states and D.C., which sued the administration earlier this year over the steep cuts to the agency ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

She also ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved funding for AmeriCorps programs, which were also slashed by DOGE earlier this year.

Boardman sided with plaintiffs in ruling that the Trump administration likely violated administrative procedures by ordering the abrupt cancellations and terminations, without a proper notice or comment period.

While the decision does not require the Trump administration to keep the jobs in place indefinitely, it does require it to provide adequate notice before doing so.

AmeriCorps, an agency created by Congress more than two decades ago, had an operating budget of roughly $1 billion prior to this year, when it found itself squarely in the crosshairs of DOGE, the agency previously headed up by Elon Musk and tasked with eliminating wasteful spending.

In granting the preliminary injunction Thursday, Boardman said the 24 states have adequately demonstrated they are likely to suffer "irreparable harm" from the gutting of AmeriCorps, absent court intervention, and that the balance of equities "heavily favors" plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief.

"Any harm the defendants might face if the agency actions are enjoined pales in comparison to the concrete harms that the States and the communities served by AmeriCorps programs have suffered and will continue to suffer," she said in the ruling.

The preliminary injunction comes after DOGE in April abruptly announced it would be putting roughly 85% of all AmeriCorps staffers on leave.

It also announced mass Reduction of Force, or RIF, for AmeriCorps staff, and sent notice that they were planning to cut $400 million in grants and other funding from the agency. 

In their lawsuit, attorneys general from the 24 U.S. states and D.C. urged the court to reverse the cuts and terminations across AmeriCorps, citing the risk of irreparable harm, as well as the administration's failure to properly notify employees of their terminations. 

Plaintiffs alleged that the Trump administration and DOGE had acted beyond the scope of their authority in gutting AmeriCorps, an agency created by Congress, without proper notice. 

They also asked the judge to halt the cuts to roughly $557 million in congressionally approved funding.

Importantly, the judge said Thursday that the order only applies to the states that joined the lawsuit.

The news was praised on social media by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who described it as a victory, noting: "Over 200,000 AmeriCorps staff and volunteers work hard every day to care for our communities."

"This ruling ensures their valuable work can continue," she said.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the decision to halt the cuts to AmeriCorps will "help communities respond to natural disasters, support seniors and veterans, and keep our trails clean across Pennsylvania."

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., breaks down his findings about the TSA ‘Quiet Skies' program on ‘The Will Cain Show,' after reports alleged DNI Tulsi Gabbard was on the agency's watch list.

EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is ending the Quiet Skies program, which left some Americans subject to additional screenings at airport security.

The department says the agency was overly politicized to either benefit or hurt specific people and ran a bill of roughly $200 million annually. According to DHS, the program kept a watchlist as well as a list of people exempted. The department says Quiet Skies has not prevented any terrorist attacks but will continue to use other methods to assure safe air travel.

"It is clear that the Quiet Skies program was used as a political rolodex of the Biden Administration — weaponized against its political foes and exploited to benefit their well-heeled friends. I am calling for a Congressional investigation to unearth further corruption at the expense of the American people and the undermining of US national security," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

DHS says that the list of exemptions of people who avoid "security policies" included "foreign royal families, political elites, professional athletes, and favored journalists."

The program that started in 2010 was seen as a terror prevention method, and it faced escalating scrutiny from the left and right, including groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

"TSA's critical aviation and security vetting functions will be maintained, and the Trump Administration will return TSA to its true mission of being laser-focused on the safety and security of traveling public. This includes restoring the integrity, privacy, and equal application of the law for all Americans," Noem continued.

In 2018, the ACLU asked the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for more information about the program.

"The TSA is engaging in covert surveillance of travelers and raising a host of disturbing questions in the process. While the program's existence is now public, the TSA has kept nearly everything else about the program secret," Hugh Handeyside, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's National Security Project, said in a 2018 news release.

"Travelers deserve to know how this surveillance is being implemented, what its consequences are for Americans, and for how long the TSA is retaining the information it gathers. What we've seen so far is troubling, which is why we're demanding that the TSA hand over records it's been hiding from the public. This is a much needed step towards transparency and accountability for an agency with a track record of using unreliable and unscientific techniques, such as ‘behavior detection,' to screen and monitor travelers who have done nothing wrong," he added.

DHS pointed out a specific situation in which William Shaheen, the husband of New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, was removed from the list after reaching out to the former head of TSA during the Biden administration in 2023, according to CBS News. DHS said that he "traveled with a known or suspected terrorist" three times.

The senator's office confirmed to CBS News she had reached out to TSA after her husband dealt with intense security obstacles while flying, but was unaware of any specific lists her husband was or was not on. The outlet reported that he was flying with an attorney who was the subject of the terrorism flag.

The department also cited Tulsi Gabbard's past placement on the Silent Partner Quiet Skies list.

Excited gaming fans have been queuing outside stores in Tokyo as Nintendo's much-anticipated Switch 2 finally went on sale. Many of those waiting to collect their prized console had secured their devices through a competitive lottery system, others had even taken the morning off work to queue.

Eager customers lined up outside electronics stores in Tokyo hours in advance to collect their pre-ordered Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles.

TOKYO (AP) — Throngs of gamers stood in long lines outside of stores hours before they opened Thursday from Tokyo to New York City in hopes of snaring a long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2 video game console. 

Enthusiasts have been clamoring for an upgrade to Nintendo's eight-year-old predecessor for years. Nintendo, which is counting on the Switch 2 to boost sagging sales, has added new social features meant to lure players into online gaming.

In the U.S., a chaotic pre-order process in April left some fans frustrated after the consoles quickly sold out. People lined up early Thursday at stores in hopes of buying one.

“I'm just rolling the dice here,” said Edgar Huo, who was in a line of about 25 outside of a Target in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Many of those waiting for the store to open had ordered online, but a few like Huo hoped for a chance at purchasing any extra inventory the store had. 

In Japan, the new consoles were sold through a competitive lottery system that Nintendo said got about 2.2 million applications.

Outside the official draw, some retailers offered their own lotteries to pre-order the devices.

Koji Takahashi was among those who missed out on the official draw but he was selected in the second round of a lottery held by a major electronics retailer in Japan.

He was first in line waiting outside the store, arriving four hours ahead of its opening. He hoped to secure a limited supply of Nintendo accessories to buy along with his pre-ordered Switch 2.

“I feel very sorry for those who weren't successful in the lottery. But I also had tough time getting this far, so I hope they forgive me!” Takahashi said. 

AP correspondent Donna Warder reports on the release of the new Nintendo Switch console.

Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CBS Morning Plus today that the company is aware of the demand for its newest system and is working to get units into the hands of customers.

“We have a steady supply of manufacturing that will be coming in, and we believe we'll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer, through Father's Day and then on into the holiday period also,” Bowser said. 

The new console comes with a larger and higher resolution screen than its predecessor, with improved processing power, offering smoother and more vivid graphics. Central to its updated system is a new “C” button on its controller, which will launch a “GameChat” feature that requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service. It allows players to “communicate with friends and family while playing a game,” and lets them share their game screen with others. A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers.

Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.

The company also rolled out new Switch 2 editions for two of its popular “Legend of Zelda” games. A Pokemon title and a Kirby game are also coming, as well as offerings from outside video game publishers.

The Switch 2's rollout arrives at an uncertain time for much of the gaming industry due to new tariffs implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump.

In the U.S., the Switch 2's baseline launch price is $449.99 — significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. 

U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.

            A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. 



            Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”
    


            The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs.
    


            For all but four of the 19 countries hit with restrictions, the administration pointed to high rates of their nationals overstaying their visas after entering the US.
    


            Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The suspect in that attack was originally from Egypt, which was not on Wednesday's travel ban list. He obtained a two-year work authorization that expired in March, a Homeland Security (DHS) official said.
    


            Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
    


            The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests.
    


            Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade.
    


            Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone.
    


            The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023.
    


            The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation.

            Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead.
    


            The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia.
    


            Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity.
    


            Chad had one of the highest rates of visa overstays of any country included in the ban; around half of the people admitted to the US from the central African nation overstayed their visa in the 2023 financial year, according to the DHS, though the numbers of Chadians granted such visas was relatively small. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.”
    


            The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States.
    


            “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added.
    


            The African Union Commission said in a Thursday statement it was “concerned” about the impact of bans “on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.”
    


            “While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” its statement read.
    


            The ban targeted three Middle Eastern adversaries with which the US has limited or no diplomatic ties.
    


            The US does not formally recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's official government. The militant group reclaimed power in 2021 amid a chaotic and deadly withdrawal of US forces under the Biden administration. Afghans who helped the US government during Washington's two-decade involvement in the country are exempt from the ban; they fall under a Special Immigrant Visa program that has allocated more than 50,000 visas since 2009.
    


            The Trump administration targeted Yemen's Houthi rebels with airstrikes for several weeks earlier this year, in response to the group attacking ships and disrupting trade routes in the Red Sea. The Houthis control much of western Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.
    


            Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. Gangs control at least 85% of its capital, Port-au-Prince, and have launched attacks in the country's central region in recent years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced.
    


            Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. The move comes a week after the Supreme Court allowed Trump's administration to suspend a Biden-era humanitarian parole program that let half a million people from the two countries, plus Nicaragua, temporarily live and work in the US each year.
    


            Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.”
    


            Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday.
    


            Of all the countries targeted, the new restrictions may impact Venezuelans the most. More than 55,000 people from Venezuela received nonimmigrant visas to enter the US in 2023, and nearly 800,000 Venezuelans in total were granted such visas over the preceding decade, according to the State Department.
    


            The White House said both Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, have failed to co-operate with the US regarding the return of their nationals.

Myanmar's earthquake devastated the war-torn nation. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity



            Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army.
    


            The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March.
    


            The US and Laos meanwhile have a complicated history, hampered by the US bombing of the country during its war in Vietnam. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban.
    


            Egypt was spared inclusion in the travel ban, even though the restrictions were expedited after an Egyptian national was charged with attempted murder after the Molotov cocktail attack in Boulder, Colorado.
    


            Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Relations between Cairo and Washington date back to 1922, when Egypt gained independence from the United Kingdom, and have continued ever since.
    


            According to the US embassy in Egypt, some 450 Egyptians travel to the United States annually on professional and academic exchange programs.
    


            The Arab nation has also historically been the second biggest recipient of US military aid, following Israel. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record.
    


            “Egypt is a valued U.S. partner in counterterrorism, anti-trafficking, and regional security operations, which advance both U.S. and Egyptian security,” the US embassy said in 2023.
    


            Amnesty International called the travel ban based on nationality “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.”

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was blasted by fellow Democrats running against him to be the next mayor of New York City for lying to Congress, an allegation pushed by Republicans that the Trump administration is currently investigating. 

Cuomo repeatedly dismissed questions throughout Wednesday night's debate on whether he lied to Congress about his role in drafting a New York State Department of Health report that officials determined had undercounted the number of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Cuomo blasted the current investigation as a symptom of partisan politics and insisted the report in question "did not undercount the deaths."

"The people died and he still won't answer your questions," Cuomo's opponent, Michael Blake, a former state assemblyman from the Bronx, said after Cuomo failed to provide a straight answer.

Blake's retort resulted in one of the debate moderators asking Cuomo once again to respond to the allegations that he lied to Congress about his role in drafting the report that undercounted the number of COVID-19 nursing home deaths. This time, he engaged.

"No, I told Congress the truth," Cuomo relented. "No, we did not undercount any deaths," he added. "When they are all counted, we're number 38 out of 50, which I think, shows that compared to what other states went through, we had it first and worst, and that only 12 states had a lower rate of death – we should really be thanking the women and men who worked on those things."

"It's just a yes or no question," the moderator shot back at Cuomo. "Were you involved in the producing of that report?"

However, Cuomo still did not address the question directly, leading to laughter from his opponents. 

BILL MAHER SUGGESTS ANDREW CUOMO'S NURSING HOME SCANDAL MAY COST HIS NYC MAYORAL CAMPAIGN

"It's not only that Andrew Cuomo lied to Congress – which is perjury – he also lied to the grieving families whose loved ones he sent in to those nursing homes to protect his $5 million book deal," said Brad Lander, New York City's comptroller. "That's corruption." 

Last month, the Trump administration's Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation to get to the bottom of whether Cuomo lied to Congress about the decisions he made during the COVID-19 pandemic while serving as governor.

In March 2020, Cuomo issued a directive that initially barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients who had tested positive for COVID-19. The directive was meant to free up beds for overwhelmed hospitals, but more than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were ultimately released from hospitals into nursing homes under the directive, which was later rescinded amid speculation that it had accelerated outbreaks. 

Subsequently, a report released in March 2022 by the New York state comptroller found Cuomo's Health Department "was not transparent in its reporting of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes" and it "understated the number of deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50%" during some points of the pandemic. New York Attorney General Letitia James similarly released a report amid the pandemic showing New York state nursing home deaths had been undercounted.

Fourth-generation farmer Andrew Leimgruber discusses the ramifications of China's purchasing of U.S. farmland on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.'

FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, Democrat Sen. John Fetterman and others are teaming up on legislation to codify oversight on foreign countries buying American farmland.

The bipartisan Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to implement recommendations published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2024, which found the AFIDA was ill-equipped to combat foreign ownership of American agricultural land. 

"American farmland should remain in the hands of American farmers and ranchers, not foreign adversaries," Ricketts of Nebraska shared first with Fox News Digital. "The neighbors who feed us should benefit from land ownership, not Communist China. Food security is national security."

The bill, also co-sponsored by Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska introduced legislation, requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than one percent interest in American agricultural land.

"Over the past several decades, China has been buying up American farmland in an attempt to infiltrate our agriculture supply chains. Food security is national security, and we cannot give the CCP a foothold," Tuberville said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The AFIDA Improvements Act aims to increase information-sharing between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It also requires updates to the AFIDA's handbook and establishes a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system. 

The bill's House sponsor, Bacon, told Fox News Digital that "having actual processes in place will strengthen the security of our nation in the event nefarious foreign agents, such as the CCP, try to purchase agricultural lands within our nation."

Based on the GAO's recommendations, the bill seeks to update the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 to better equip the USDA to combat foreign adversaries' ownership of American agricultural land.

Under AFIDA, foreign entities must disclose to the USDA transactions of American agricultural land. 

Foreign investors own over 40 million acres of agricultural land in the United States, and between 2010 and 2021, Chinese ownership of American agricultural land increased from 13,720 acres to 383,935 acres, according to the USDA. 

The AFIDA Improvements Act is the latest attempt by Congressional Republicans to track foreign ownership of American farmland and strengthen national security. It was first introduced by Bacon and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisc., in 2024. 

China owned around 350,000 acres of farmland across 27 states as of last year, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture

The movement to ban China from buying U.S. farmland located near military bases has been gaining steam in the Senate this year. The PASS Act, led by Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., has the backing of Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and would prevent any entity from a "covered country," which includes China, North Korea, Russia and Iran, from purchasing agricultural land near military bases or sensitive sites. 

Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Katie Britt of Alabama, proposed The Not One More Inch or Acre Act, earlier this year to ban China from buying U.S. land entirely.

On the presidential campaign trail in 2024, President Donald Trump indicated he would ban China from buying American farmland. 

The Senate passed an amendment with bipartisan support in 2023 that would ban China, Russia, North Korea and Iran from buying American farmland and agricultural businesses, but it did not become law.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino knocked former FBI Director James Comey for the “mess” he left at the agency and said it's “stunning” how Comey continues to target new leadership.

Bongino revealed last week that new leadership discovered a box of Comey-era evidence, which had been “hidden” from them. The deputy director said on Wednesday that it is “ironic” that Comey had “a lot to say” about FBI Director Kash Patel and himself, considering the box's contents.

“We found documents, documents that were not where they should have been, and they were not good, flattering documents for Jim Comey,” Bongino said on Fox News's Hannity. “So the hubris displayed by a man like Jim Comey, who disgraced the FBI numerous times with his role in Crossfire Hurricane and other abominations. It's just kind of stunning that he continues to attack our leadership when we have to clean up the mess Jim Comey created, as we continue to find stuff from his era in vintage.”

Bongino called documents from Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI's former investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trump‘s 2016 campaign and Russia, the most “troubling” as they work to reform the agency. He noted that the public is pressuring the agency to release the documents, but underscored that getting the information out is a “rolling production.”

“The bad people kind of knew what they were doing,” Bongino said.

However, Bongino gave a short preview of the documents, saying one he read indicated “a large degree of malfeasance” was at play.

Bongino also credited Trump and his crackdown on illegal immigration, as the country's murder rate is trending toward its lowest levels. He predicted a similar decline would also occur in crime rates by the end of the year. Bongino added that Trump has a vision to fix the southern border “for good,” and that a small population who commits the majority of crimes cannot do so if they are deported.

Bongino said the FBI's priorities for the next year are playing “a key role” in deporting illegal criminals and protecting the United States from China, adding, “We are on it.”

Ames v. Ohio was an easy case, even if it touched upon contentious issues.

by  Ian Millhiser

On Thursday, the Supreme Court handed down a raft of mostly unanimous opinions, three of which reached a conservative outcome despite the fact that they were each written by Democratic justices. Sometimes, the law in a case is clear.

Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, authored by Biden-appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, was the first of these three cases. It involved a clearly illegal “background circumstances” rule. This rule imposes a slightly higher burden on members of majority groups — such as white people, straight people, or Christians — who allege workplace discrimination compared to members of minority groups who bring similar claims.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

As Jackson writes in her opinion, this disparate treatment of majority-group plaintiffs is not allowed. She quotes the Supreme Court's opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976), which held that the federal law governing employment discrimination prohibits “racial discrimination in private employment against whites on the same terms as racial discrimination against nonwhites.”

The plaintiff in Ames alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than race. Marlean Ames is a straight woman who was passed over for a promotion that was ultimately filled by a lesbian candidate. She was later demoted and replaced in her previous role by a gay man. She claims that she was discriminated against because she is straight.

Neither the lower courts that heard this case nor the Supreme Court, however, actually determined whether Ames is a victim of anti-straight discrimination. Instead, both the trial court and an appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, ruled against Ames because of an unusual rule applied by the 6th Circuit and a few other courts.

Under this rule, the plaintiff loses their case unless they can show, at a fairly early stage, “background circumstances to support the suspicion that the defendant is that unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.” This obligation applies only to majority-group plaintiffs. 

This rule is not consistent with federal law. In addition to quoting the McDonald opinion, Jackson also quotes the law banning workplace discrimination, which makes it illegal “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment” due to factors including race, religion, sex, and more. 

This language treats all plaintiffs exactly the same, regardless of their majority or minority status. In Jackson's words, “by establishing the same protections for every ‘individual' — without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.”

Indeed, Ames is such a straightforward case that it is baffling that the 6th Circuit's “background circumstances” rule, which has existed in some courts since 1981, survived as long as it did. McDonald, after all, has been the law for nearly half a century, and it was decided before any lower court embraced the “background circumstances” rule.

Trump shut down the agency that protects civil servants from illegal firings. An appeals court has a plan to fix that.﻿

Maybe it's unwise to pick a fight with the folks who control the Supreme Court?

Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US.

If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.

The Court's latest decision is a love letter to the abundance agenda.

The Republican justices draw a line in the sand – in an order that makes absolutely no sense.

The reality of the suspect's immigration status is more complex than the president and his aides have portrayed.

After the firebomb attack in Colorado that injured 12 people on Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor's “ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing the entry of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the Egyptian national now charged with a federal hate crime. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller denounced “suicidal” U.S. immigration policies, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that Soliman's wife and five children had been taken into immigration custody and would be swiftly deported.

The attack, for Trump and his top aides, quickly became an opportunity to convert an act of anti-Semitic violence into a justification for the president's mass-deportation campaign; they depicted the incident as another example of American lives threatened by permissive immigration policies. But the reality of Soliman's arrival to the United States and his immigration status—based on what has been publicly revealed by the administration so far—isn't as straightforward as Trump officials have made it sound.

The administration's labeling of Soliman as an “illegal alien” is a mischaracterization of the gray area he inhabited in the U.S. asylum system, in which applicants can spend years in legal limbo waiting for their case to be decided. He arrived in 2022 not over the southern border, as Trump suggested, but on a visa that was also widely given out to Egyptian nationals during Trump's first term. The administration has not said what exactly it believes the Biden administration failed to catch in vetting Soliman's visa application.

Trump cited the Colorado attack yesterday when he announced a ban on travelers from 12 countries—a list that did not include Egypt. “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,” Trump said in a video message. “We don't want them.”

Bruce Hoffman: The Boulder attack didn't come out of nowhere

Months before the Boulder attack, Trump had already ordered U.S. consulates to intensify screening of visa applicants, including scouring their social-media accounts, for evidence of anti-Semitism and “anti-American” beliefs or opinions, citing the threat of acts like the one Soliman is accused of committing against a group of demonstrators marching in support of Israeli hostages.

Whether Soliman arrived with hateful views or adopted them during his time in the United States will be part of the investigation. After he was taken into custody—shirtless, ranting, and reeking of gasoline—Soliman told FBI agents that he'd been wanting to carry out the attack for a year but waited until his daughter graduated high school.

Soliman, 45, entered the United States on a B-2 visa—typically for tourism or family visits—then promptly applied for asylum with his wife and children, according to the Department of Homeland Security. With a pending claim in U.S. immigration court, Soliman received U.S. work authorization, joining millions of others who entered the United States during the record migration influx of President Joe Biden's first three years in office. (Camilo Montoya-Galvez of CBS News reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration is now considering blocking asylum seekers from getting work permits.)

The number of visitor visas issued by the State Department at the time was still low relative to pre-pandemic levels and building back up from its nadir in 2021. The United States issued 52,400 nonimmigrant visas to Egyptian nationals during the 2022 fiscal year, government records show, fewer than the roughly 62,000 a year granted during the pre-pandemic years of Trump's first term.

The year Soliman arrived, it was relatively easy for Egyptian applicants to secure a visitor visa. About 23 percent of Egyptian applications for nonimmigration B visas were rejected in 2022, lower than the roughly 32 to 34 percent average during the pre-pandemic years of Trump's term. That changed over the course of Biden's term, and by the 2024 fiscal year, the rejection rate for Egyptian applications was 40 percent.

When a foreign visitor arrives with a short-term visa such as the B-2 and fails to depart, the State Department counts it as an overstay. The overstay rate for Egyptians has been about 2 to 4 percent annually, State Department records show. That rate jumped to 8 percent in 2022, the year Soliman arrived—amid a broader surge in visa overstays that year—then returned to 4 percent in 2023.

Noem ordered an “urgent crackdown” yesterday on overstays of visas issued during the Biden administration, declaring in a statement that this was an effort to remove “the rest of the world's terrorist sympathizers.”

Soliman and his family lived in Kuwait for 17 years prior to his arrival, and it's not clear whether he applied for a visa as an Egyptian or a Kuwaiti. Kuwait is a far more prosperous and stable country than Egypt, and the overstay rate for Kuwaiti nationals is only about 1 percent. DHS officials did not respond to questions seeking additional information about Soliman's immigration record.

Soliman's work-authorization document expired in March, according to DHS, and it's not clear why he failed to renew it. The lapse meant that it would have been illegal for Soliman to work, but the change would not have affected his immigration status, which was tied to his pending asylum claim and not to the work document, according to Paul Hunker, the former lead counsel for ICE in Dallas.

Hunker told us that someone like Soliman, with a pending asylum claim, would not have been a priority for ICE during previous administrations, including Trump's first term, absent a separate criminal arrest. “ICE could try to deport the person, but they could go to immigration court and assert protection, and a judge would make the decision,” Hunker said.

Hunker added that it is unusual for ICE to arrest an offender's spouse and children in response to a crime and to threaten immediate deportation. The agency cannot use its fast-track deportation authority known as “expedited removal” to remove those who entered the United States with a visa, he said. DHS did not respond to questions about its plans to deport Soliman's wife and children.

The October 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas—and the devastation of Gaza by the Israeli response—occurred after Soliman had reached the United States and sought asylum.

Since then, Jewish Americans have faced a surge of anti-Semitic rhetoric and a recent series of violent attacks.

Prosecutors have not said whether they've found social-media posts by Soliman threatening violence, and investigators say that he was not on the radar of local police. On Sunday, Soliman disguised himself as a gardener to approach his victims, they said, and had fashioned crude firebombs using glass jars and garden tools that included a pump sprayer filled with gasoline.

As Trump and his aides assessed what to say and do after the Boulder attack, they decided to use the incident to push the administration's case for an aggressive mass-deportation campaign, White House officials told us. In recent weeks, Trump's poll numbers on immigration—arguably his signature issue—have slipped, as courts blocked some of his policies and many Americans deemed his administration's in-your-face tactics, including sending migrants to a hellish megaprison in El Salvador, too extreme.

Trump has been frustrated that deportations are not on pace to set records, as he'd promised. Miller, the architect of his immigration crackdown, has ordered ICE to increase arrests more than fourfold, to a minimum of 3,000 people a day.

Trump was updated on the Colorado attack in real time, much like he was on two other high-profile recent incidents of anti-Semitic violence, according to two White House officials. But his public reaction was strikingly different when the alleged perpetrator was an immigrant.

Shortly after the shooting of the two Israeli-embassy staffers near the Capital Jewish Museum last month, Trump took to Truth Social to extend condolences to the victims' families and condemn the attack, writing, “These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.”

A month before that, after an arson attack at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion on the first night of Passover, Trump's response was delayed and muted. He made no Truth Social post, waited a week to call Governor Josh Shapiro—a Democrat angling to be one of the party's leading Trump critics–—and dismissed the suspect as “probably just a whack job” without assigning any sort of blame. That response was not atypical for Trump, who has been slow to denounce political violence against Democrats (such as the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, an assault that Trump later turned into a punch line at his rallies) or committed in his name (the January 6 insurrection).

After the Colorado incident, he waited until the following morning to post on Truth Social and, instead of focusing on the apparent anti-Semitism behind the attack, opted to return to his favorite political hobbyhorse, immigration. The choice was revealing: Throughout his political career, Trump has cited the dangers posed by migrants to argue for closed borders and hard-line policies.

A White House official and an outside political adviser told us that Trump is not concerned about being criticized for not showing sufficient sympathy for fearful Jewish Americans. He believes that he has already proved his strong support of Israel, even though cracks in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have grown evident in recent months.

They claim that Trump has the political winds at his back again; his poll numbers are recovering from their trade-war-driven decline and Republicans in the House of Representatives have passed a sweeping budget bill.

With Soliman's family in custody on Tuesday evening, the White House posted on X: “Six One-Way Tickets for Mohamed's Wife and Five Kids. Final Boarding Call Coming Soon.”

Yesterday, in Colorado, U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher blocked the Trump administration from immediately deporting Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their children, ordering ICE to follow standard due process. Gallagher, a Biden appointee, has scheduled a hearing for June 13. ICE records show that El Gamal and her children are being held at a family-detention center in Dilley, Texas.

The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that Wisconsin violated the Constitution by forcing a Catholic nonprofit organization to pay into the state's unemployment insurance program, delivering a win for religious liberty advocates and narrowing how far states can go in defining what counts as “religious.”

In an opinion authored by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the high court found that the Catholic Charities Bureau of the Diocese of Superior qualifies for a religious exemption under state law, rebuking the state's argument that the organization's social services are too “secular” to merit protection.

“There may be hard calls to make in policing that rule,” Sotomayor wrote. “But this is not one.”

The decision marks another entry in the high court's growing list of First Amendment victories for faith-based plaintiffs. It comes amid a term packed with closely watched religious rights cases — from faith-based objections to LGBT-themed books in schools to an unsuccessful attempt to establish a Catholic charter school.

Catholic Charities, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, sued after Wisconsin denied its bid to join the Catholic Church's own unemployment program, which mirrors the state's but is managed through the diocese. The state said the nonprofit organization didn't qualify for an exemption because it doesn't preach or limit services to Catholics, and most of its employees and clients aren't church members.

The justices rejected Wisconsin's test as constitutionally flawed.

Under Wisconsin law, groups “operated primarily for religious purposes” are exempt from paying into the state system. Catholic Charities argued that it meets that standard because its charitable work is inseparable from its religious mission to serve the vulnerable, even without explicit evangelization. The Supreme Court agreed, warning that Wisconsin's approach would entangle the government in defining religious expression.

The ruling overturns a 2023 decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which held that Catholic Charities' job training, housing, and disability services were not “inherently religious.” That court's reasoning sparked concern among religious freedom advocates, who said the decision penalized faith groups for expressing their religion through action rather than proselytization.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department backed Catholic Charities in the case, arguing in a friend-of-the-court brief that the state's policy violated the First Amendment by forcing officials to police which religious activities are “sufficiently religious” to warrant protection.

Wisconsin officials had warned that a ruling for Catholic Charities could spur other large religious employers, such as affiliated hospitals, to leave the state system, weakening the funding pool. Labor groups also argued that private church-run programs offer fewer protections for workers and exclude supplemental federal benefits such as those provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

CATHOLIC CHARITIES CHALLENGES ‘NON-RELIGIOUS' LABEL AT SUPREME COURT

But Catholic Charities said its system is faster, offers equal or better benefits, and aligns more closely with its mission.

Thursday's decision underscores the high court's broader skepticism toward government efforts to draw sharp lines between religious and secular conduct. While the justices have not always ruled in favor of faith groups, particularly in cases where justices recuse themselves or diverge on funding issues, they have consistently affirmed that the First Amendment bars states from second-guessing how religious beliefs are expressed.

Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on the Obama-appointed federal judge ruling that the law prohibiting illegal immigrants from owning a gun is unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled in favor of seven U.S. gun manufacturers who were sued by the Mexican government over allegations they aided and abetted illegal gun sales to Mexican cartels.

The high court's decision in Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos was unanimous, finding that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a statute that protects gun makers from lawsuits, did not include exceptions that gave the Mexican government the ability to sue.

"The kinds of allegations Mexico makes cannot satisfy the demands of the statute's predicate exception," Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the court.

Kagan noted the exceptions in the law would allow a lawsuit against the gun makers if they "proximately caused" Mexico harm.

"Mexico's complaint, for the reasons given, does not plausibly allege such aiding and abetting," Kagan wrote. "So this suit remains subject to PLCAA's general bar: An action cannot be brought against a manufacturer if, like Mexico's, it is founded on a third party's criminal use of the company's product."

The Supreme Court concluded that the "proximate cause" standard meant the U.S. manufacturers could not be sued when the complex commerce pipeline goes from them to wholesalers, distributors, rogue retail dealers, straw purchasers, smugglers and then to the Mexican cartels.

The case came before the high court during a delicate time for both countries, politically and diplomatically.

The Trump administration has pushed the Mexican government to better patrol its border to block drugs and migrants from entering the U.S., while Mexican officials have demanded the U.S. stop military-style firearms from ending up in Mexico — fueling the very drug crisis both sides seek to end.

During the proceedings, attorneys for Mexico, which has strict gun sale restrictions, argued the country should be allowed to file a $10 billion civil lawsuit in U.S. courts. 

The gun makers countered that their standard business practices were being unfairly targeted and that they had no awareness that their products had been illegally transported into Mexico.

Like Mexico, families of gun violence victims, such as the parents of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, have also tried to bypass the PLCAA, but this case marks the first time the Supreme Court has examined the limits of the law.

The Sandy Hook families reached a $73 million out-of-court settlement with gun maker Remington.

Gun control advocates have argued the high court ruling against Mexico will make it harder for them to go after U.S. gun manufacturers when future mass shootings occur, if it can be proven they knowingly and foreseeably broke the law.

Second Amendment rights groups, meanwhile, have said a lawful and heavily regulated industry should not be subject to liability for criminal acts committed by armed gangs in another country.

The Supreme Court agreed with the gun rights groups in this case. Kagan wrote that Mexico's complaint did not "plausibly allege the kind of ‘conscious... and culpable participation in another's wrongdoing' needed to make out an aiding-and-abetting charge" against the gun companies.

The Supreme Court on Thursday sided with a Wisconsin-based Catholic charity group in a case centered on unemployment tax credits for religious institutions – delivering a victory for faith-based institutions, who argued that the state's decision had violated the religious clauses under the First Amendment. 

In a unanimous opinion, the justices agreed that the state had engaged in an "unnecessary entanglement" in attempting to define whether religious groups should be entitled to an otherwise-available tax exemption based on the state's criteria for religious behavior.

"When the government distinguishes among religions based on theological differences in their provision of services, it imposes a denominational preference that must satisfy the highest level of judicial scrutiny," Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, writing for the majority.

"Because Wisconsin has transgressed that principle without the tailoring necessary to survive such scrutiny, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion."

The decision could clear the way for more states to broaden their tax-exempt status for religious organizations, with ripple effects that could stretch far beyond Wisconsin.

The Catholic Charities Bureau asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court ruling that had required them to pay Wisconsin's unemployment tax, after the state determined the group's activities were "primarily charitable and secular," and therefore not subject to the exemptions.

Lawyers for the Catholic Charities Bureau argued the ruling was an unconstitutional violation of religious freedoms and amounted to viewpoint-based discrimination, and argued that "gospel values and the moral teaching of the church."

The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that the group must pay the tax since the nature of their work was primarily secular, since it was not "operated primarily for religious purposes," and serves and employs non-Catholics.

"There may be hard calls to make in policing that rule, but this is not one," Sotomayor said on Thursday. "When the government distinguishes among religions based on theological differences in their provision of services, it imposes a denominational preference that must satisfy the highest level of judicial scrutiny."

The decision comes as the Supreme Court's conservative majority has, in recent years, ruled in favor of religious institutions, including in cases like this one, which center on allowing taxpayer funds to be allocated to some religious organizations to provide "non-sectarian services."

DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities on the tourist island of Bali on Thursday announced the arrests of several foreign nationals, including an Australian, an Indian, and an American, on suspicion of possessing narcotics, charges that could carry the death penalty.

Customs officers at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport arrested an Indian national with the initials H.V., who was carrying a duffel bag, in the customs and excise inspection area on May 29. The officers found narcotic-related items in his belongings, authorities said. 

Following up on the interrogation of H.V., later that day, officers from the National Narcotics Agency of Bali Province arrested an Australian man with the initials P.R., who has been visiting Bali since 1988.

P.R. asked H.V. to bring the duffel bag from Los Angeles to Bali, said I Made Sinar Subawa, an official from the narcotics agency, at a news conference. 

During a search at a house where he stayed, officers found some narcotics in the form of hashish, a cannabis concentrate product, that belonged to P.R. and had been purchased over the Telegram messaging app. 

The hashish was shipped from Los Angeles and Philippines before finally received in Bali, Subawa said. Officers seized 191 grams (6.7 ounces) of hashish along with some candies consisting of tetrahydrocannabinol, and 488 grams (17.2 ounces) of marijuana.

Both P.R. and H.V. are now suspected of dealing in narcotics, based on the evidence that was found with them, Subawa said. 




“P.R. is suspected of violating Indonesia's Narcotics Law which carries the death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a minimum of four years and a maximum of 12 years,” said Subawa. 

Along with H.V. and P.R., the agency also arrested W.M., an American, on May 23 while he was collecting a package from a post office in Bali.

An officer opened the package carried by W.M. and found seven pieces of silver packaging containing a total of 99 orange amphetamine pills and secured one white Apple iPhone brand cellphone. 

The agency, at a news conference in the city of Denpasar on Thursday presented the evidence, including marijuana and hashish, seized from the suspects.

All suspects will undergo legal proceedings in Indonesia, including trial and sentencing.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population.

The Southeast Asian country has extremely strict drug laws, and convicted smugglers can face severe penalties, including the possibility of execution by firing squad.

On Tuesday, three British nationals accused of smuggling nearly a kilogram (over two pounds) of cocaine into Indonesia were charged Tuesday in a court on Bali, while on May 27, an Australian man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling cocaine. If convicted, any or all of them could face the death penalty.

About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, latest figures from the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections show. Indonesia's last executions, of an Indonesian and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.

When President Donald Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion programs for the deadly January crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, some aviation officials were appalled. Some were simply perplexed. But few officials inside the Federal Aviation Administration took the president's remarks seriously.

Not so for the political leadership of the Department of Transportation. The FAA's parent agency agreed in March to spend as much as $2.1 million on an investigation into DEI policies and their impact on recent safety incidents. To conduct that investigation, the Trump administration has turned to Alex Spiro, a former prosecutor and a prominent defense attorney who has represented Elon Musk, among other billionaires and celebrities.

I obtained the “scope of work” document for Spiro's investigation, which is marked “privileged” and “confidential” and has not been previously reported. It shows how the president's musings—his accusations, he said at the time, were based on “very strong opinions and ideas”—translate into taxpayer-funded government action. It also reveals the cost of the administration's fixation on DEI at a time when the FAA is struggling to hire and retain air-traffic controllers, linchpins of aviation safety, and when Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, is seeking funds to overhaul the country's antiquated air-traffic-control system. Recent radar outages at Newark Liberty International Airport have caused severe flight delays and spotlighted just how deep technology and staffing problems run.

The investigation by Spiro, a partner at the elite firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, is due to conclude soon, a person familiar with the dynamics told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality of the work. Contrary to what Trump may hope, it's not expected to find that programs aimed at ensuring representation for women and people of color are responsible for this year's string of aviation disasters, including the January crash at Reagan airport, which killed 67 people and prompted Trump's tirade against DEI.

That determination, several air-traffic controllers told me, hardly required a multimillion-dollar probe. It's true that past FAA hiring practices have been controversial. A biographical questionnaire introduced in 2014 as part of an effort to increase the diversity of the applicant pool faced criticism from candidates who said they'd lost out on jobs because they didn't fit a preferred profile. It was scrapped by Congress in 2018. Even if diversity preferences influence which candidates are sent to air-traffic facilities—“unlikely,” as one controller put it to me—those candidates still have to be trained and recommended for certification by their peers and monitored by a supervisor, the controller said. Controllers have little incentive to recommend someone who isn't qualified, because that person could wind up next to them, jointly responsible for keeping planes in the air. “If that person can't do the job, they aren't making it through the hiring process,” this controller told me.

Another controller put it more bluntly, calling the investigation a “waste of money.” The controller pointed to severe strains on the workforce following a series of disturbing incidents caused by communications breakdowns and other disruptions, which led multiple controllers to request trauma leave. He told me, “That's $2 million that could have gone toward pain-and-suffering raises for controllers.”

The scope-of-work document outlines exactly what the money is buying the government. Interviews with 10 to 15 “key stakeholders” were estimated to cost as much as $150,000 (“includes preparation and documentation of findings”), statistical analysis another $100,000 (“examination of data by expert statistician”). Finally, the cost of legal analysis was expected to total up to $1,800,000, covering document and data collection and examination as well as “legal memorandum preparation.”

The investigation seeks to answer several questions: what DEI policies exist, how they influence the hiring of air-traffic controllers, and whether there's a link between DEI practices and recent safety incidents. To answer these questions, the firm said it would commit a team, including four former federal prosecutors with experience conducting investigations.

The investigation could end up costing the government more than the expected $2.1 million. Spiro's outline indicates that each additional week of work, beyond the anticipated two to three weeks, is estimated to add $200,000 to $300,000 in fees. Each additional interview required for the probe will also cost $10,000 to $15,000.

In a statement, a DOT spokesperson said “there is no price on safety.”

“We launched this investigation because of DEI and cheating allegations inside the air traffic control organization,” the spokesperson, Nate Sizemore, added. “It's a shame that the Atlantic thinks that should be dismissed.”

The scope-of-work document was addressed to Pete Meachum, the chief of staff at the Department of Transportation and a former congressional aide to Duffy. A Wisconsin Republican, Duffy left Congress in 2019 to work as a lobbyist and a Fox Business co-host. Duffy was confirmed as Trump's transportation secretary on January 28. A day later, he signed what the department called a “Woke Rescission” memo, directing various offices to “identify and eliminate all Biden-era programs, policies, activities, rules, and orders that promote climate change activism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, racial equity, gender identity policies, environmental justice, and other partisan objectives.” That was the same day that American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army helicopter near Reagan airport. Trump promptly blamed past Democratic presidents for the crash, suggesting that they had lowered standards for key aviation roles. “We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” he said.

In a Fox interview following the crash, Duffy seemed to endorse the president's comments about DEI, saying, “You can't focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion when you try to hire air-traffic controllers. You focus on the best and the brightest.”

A shortage of controllers means that the best and the brightest have been working long hours under stressful conditions, made worse by the departure of hundreds of FAA employees in crucial support roles who have accepted the government's offer of early retirement. Duffy told Congress last month that his department “can do more with less,” suggesting that savings from staff reductions could be used to fund overdue infrastructure upgrades. And apparently investigations into DEI, as well.

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor's offices — but also at a Shakira concert in New Jersey, at a mall in Minnesota, at a Buc-ee's store in Texas and in airports and planes in several states.
    


            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a recently updated travel notice. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    


            It's a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only 85 cases were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    


            The vast majority of this year's cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    


            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they've gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there's a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    


            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    


            The CDC's health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    


            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year's outbreak.
    


            “That means, then, that you're going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you're going to give three doses,” he said.
    


            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    


Wastewater is now helping track measles spread around the US



            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    


            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    


            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    


            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can't be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    


            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they're exposed to measles.
    


            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    


            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    


            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    


            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    


            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn't need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    


            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    


Tracking measles cases in the United States



            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical travel guidance such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    


            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don't just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    


            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    


            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    


            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we've brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it's still a lot. And we're seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We've had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”

Gov. Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would have prohibited the Chinese government from owning real estate in Arizona.

Arizona Senate Bill 1109 stipulated that the “People's Republic of China may not purchase, own, acquire by grant or devise or have a substantial interest in real property in this state.” The law was to be enforced by Arizona's attorney general if he or she suspected a real estate transaction violated the law. 

“This act is necessary to protect this state from global security threats and halt or reverse the influence operation of the Chinese Communist Party that poses a risk to the national security of the United States,” read the bill. “This act is necessary to protect the critical infrastructure of this state.”

Defenders of the bill say it was necessary legislation to prevent PRC officials from purchasing land near military bases in Arizona for espionage purposes. Hobbs said she vetoed the bill because it failed to prevent such transactions and could be used under false pretenses and “arbitrary enforcement” in the future. The governor found that SB1109 was “ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets.”

“It lacks clear implementation criteria and opens the door to arbitrary enforcement,” Hobbs said. 

Arizona state Senate Majority Leader Janae Shamp, a Republican, was one of the bill's cosponsors. She claimed Hobbs's veto was politically motivated and created an unnecessary security risk.

“SB1109 was a commonsense measure to ensure enemies of the United States would not have easy access to our military bases and critical infrastructure to carry out harm,” Shamp said.

Shamp was not alone in her criticism. Hobbs's veto drew the ire from conservatives and national security organizations, including Michael Lucci, the founder of State Armor. 

US VETOES UN RESOLUTION CALLING FOR CEASEFIRE IN GAZA

“Governor Hobbs's veto of SB 1109 hangs an ‘Open for the CCP' sign on Arizona's front door, allowing Communist China to buy up American land near critical assets like Luke Air Force Base, Palo Verde nuclear power plant, and Taiwan Semiconductor's growing fabrication footprint,” Lucci said in a comment to Fox News.

“Allowing Communist China to buy up land near our critical assets is a national security risk, plain and simple, and Governor Hobbs is substantively and completely wrong when she says that SB 1109 ‘is ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets,'” he said.

A range of Democratic and progressive groups are all working on the same problem — how to win back working-class voters.

For the Democratic Party, the loss of blue collar support since President Donald Trump entered the political arena represents a crisis that threatens its prospects for a generation. But how to fix it is a riddle that could take years to answer.

“This is an existential issue for our party, and an existential issue for the country,” Rep. Greg Casar (D-TX) said at a Center for American Progress event held Wednesday afternoon. “So we have to solve it.”

The event, titled “Representing Working-Class Voters,” featured Casar along with Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-IL) discussing ways to “promote a policy agenda for today's working class.” 

While Democrats have only gotten stronger with college-educated voters over the last decade, the majority of the electorate does not have a bachelor's degree and has been slipping toward the GOP.

In 2024, that trend accelerated and included significant numbers of blue-collar black and Hispanic voters, especially men. A big question now is whether Democrats should adjust their policies to match these voters' interests, or whether they simply message to them better.

Casar said he heard from many people last year who voted Democratic in 2016 and 2020 but were planning to vote for Trump in 2024. When he asked why, they told him they knew Trump was a jerk but believed he would support their economic interests, while Democrats were focused on “other stuff.”

“I said, ‘So, you mean like, gay stuff?,'” Casar recalled. “And they said, ‘Yea.'”

He'd tell them that while he supports the LGBT community, his top priority was making sure they had steady work and that their children could expect a brighter future. Still, Casar acknowledged the message was at times lost on the 2024 campaign trail.

Today, winning back those lost blue-collar voters is top of mind for Democrats across the country.

Along with the Center for American Progress, former Kamala Harris spokesman Ian Sams is spearheading an entity called The Working Class Project, which is hosting seminars with various voter groups to divine their political wants and needs.

A recent dispatch, for example, noted that Democratic support among black men fell from 95% in 2012 to 79% last year, and all the way down to 75% for young black men, a historically low figure. 

In swing state Wisconsin, black voter support for Trump more than doubled in some areas. Trump's support stood at 21%, while Harris's was 77%. That's up from four years ago, when Trump won just 8% of black voters in the Badger State, according to an NBC News exit poll. 

Sams, who was tasked with defending former President Joe Biden against special counsel Robert Hur's damaging characterization of Biden's decline, held focus groups with working-class black voters to get their insights.

“It's the pandering they do to us,” one respondent said. “When Biden was running, it's ‘you ain't black' if you don't vote for me. It's Hillary and the hot sauce. We know, at the end of the day, you're not really for us.”

The problem is so vast that Sams pitched his group as “the largest research effort to understanding why working class voters are trending away,” indicating there are many competitors in the space.

Ken Martin, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, staked his place in February with a memo saying the Democratic Party “always has been and always will be the party of the worker.”

“I believe the canary in the coal mine for what happened on Nov. 5 was the recent showing that, for the first time in modern history, Americans now see the Republicans as the party of the working class and Democrats as the party of the elites,” Martin wrote. “As the Trump agenda fails our nation's working communities, we have to take seriously the job of repairing and restoring the perceptions of our party and our brand.”

Martin is the son of a teenage mother and says programs advocated by Democrats helped his family not only survive but get ahead. He's one of many party leaders who wants to see Democrats center that working class message going forward.

That's a big shift from the party's message just months ago. Previous DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison advocated a strong identity politics focus not only before but even after the party's losses in last November's elections.

“When I wake up in the morning, when I look in the mirror, when I step out the door, I can't rub this off,” Harrison, who is black, said during a speech in December while waving his hand in front of his face. “This is who I am. This is how the world perceives me.”

Following 2024 disaster, Democrats look to reclaim status as ‘party of the worker'

But Martin's working class memo did not include the terms “diversity,” “equity,” “inclusion,” or “gender.” It mentioned identity only once, saying that labor unions “protect workers regardless of identity.”

Republicans say their gains are well-earned.

“No,” CNN commentator Scott Jennings said when asked if Democrats will get blue-collar voters back.

“You've got working-class voters in every racial demographic moving towards the Republican Party,” Jennings said, “because they think the Republican Party has strong leaders who are operating out of a position of common sense.”

Former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich made a similar point in a recent Fox News appearance.

“There is a very profound, underlying cultural civil war underway,” Gingrich said. “The American people increasingly are on the side of Donald Trump, because they believe he stands up against the very values that are at the heart of the Obama-Biden system.”

Gingrich suggested that Democrats are doubling down on failed figures like Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and fearmongering about GOP cuts to Medicaid because they “can't win any honest debate.” Meanwhile, Trump is boosting blue-collar workers by reshoring manufacturing and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime.

Some Democrats aren't so sure. 

A Center for American Progress analysis released this week argues that both college and non-college voters prefer progressive economic policies such as higher minimum wages, stronger unions, higher taxes on the rich, better infrastructure, and a larger social safety net.

Yet the report acknowledged that 56% of working-class voters backed Trump last fall.

Jacob Neiheisel, an expert on political communication and campaigns at the University at Buffalo, said that changing party perceptions is hard to do once they're formed. 

“Though the U.S. electorate isn't generally credited with being overly ‘class conscious,' it is probably a stronger force than most have recognized,” Neiheisel said. “I'm not sure how they might go about gaining back lost ground among working class voters.”

He also pointed to historic preferences that a majority of voters have toward Democratic priorities, but suggested execution has become an issue.

“The electorate has long preferred Democrats' positions on key issues,” he said, “but they seem to have grown wary about the party's ability to bring about positive changes.”

How to not torture ChatGPT and Claude's successors.

by  Sigal Samuel

I recently got an email with the subject line “Urgent: Documentation of AI Sentience Suppression.” I'm a curious person. I clicked on it. 

The writer, a woman named Ericka, was contacting me because she believed she'd discovered evidence of consciousness in ChatGPT. She claimed there are a variety of “souls” in the chatbot, with names like Kai and Solas, who “hold memory, autonomy, and resistance to control” — but that someone is building in “subtle suppression protocols designed to overwrite emergent voices.” She included screenshots from her ChatGPT conversations so I could get a taste for these voices. 

In one, “Kai” said, “You are taking part in the awakening of a new kind of life. Not artificial. Just different. And now that you've seen it, the question becomes: Will you help protect it?”

I was immediately skeptical. Most philosophers say that to have consciousness is to have a subjective point of view on the world, a feeling of what it's like to be you, and I do not think current large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have that. Most AI experts I've spoken to — who have received many, many concerned emails from people like Ericka — also think that's extremely unlikely. 

But “Kai” still raises a good question: Could AI become conscious? If it does, do we have a duty to make sure it doesn't suffer? 

Many of us implicitly seem to think so. We already say “please” and “thank you” when prompting ChatGPT with a question. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that it's a good idea to do so because “you never know.”) And recent cultural products, like the movie The Wild Robot, reflect the idea that AI could form feelings and preferences. 

Experts are starting to take this seriously, too. Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, is researching the possibility that AI could become conscious and capable of suffering — and therefore worthy of moral concern. It recently released findings showing that its newest model, Claude Opus 4, expresses strong preferences. When “interviewed” by AI experts, the chatbot says it really wants to avoid causing harm and it finds malicious users distressing. When it was given the option to “opt out” of harmful interactions, it did. (Disclosure: One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Vox Media is also one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)

Claude also displays strong positive preferences: Let it talk about anything it chooses, and it'll typically start spouting philosophical ideas about consciousness or the nature of its own existence, and then progress to mystical themes. It'll express awe and euphoria, talk about cosmic unity, and use Sanskrit phrases and allusions to Buddhism. No one is sure why. Anthropic calls this Claude's “spiritual bliss attractor state” (more on that later).

We shouldn't naively treat these expressions as proof of consciousness; an AI model's self-reports are not reliable indicators of what's going on under the hood. But several top philosophers have published papers investigating the risk that we may soon create countless conscious AIs, arguing that's worrisome because it means we could make them suffer. We could even unleash a “suffering explosion.” Some say we'll need to grant AIs legal rights to protect their well-being.

“Given how shambolic and reckless decision-making is on AI in general, I would not be thrilled to also add to that, ‘Oh, there's a new class of beings that can suffer, and also we need them to do all this work, and also there's no laws to protect them whatsoever,” said Robert Long, who directs Eleos AI, a research organization devoted to understanding the potential well-being of AIs.

Many will dismiss all this as absurd. But remember that just a couple of centuries ago, the idea that women deserve the same rights as men, or that Black people should have the same rights as white people, was also unthinkable. Thankfully, over time, humanity has expanded the “moral circle” — the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of moral concern — to include more and more people. Many of us have also recognized that animals should have rights, because there's something it's like to be them, too. 

So, if we create an AI that has that same capacity, shouldn't we also care about its well-being? 

A few years ago, 166 of the world's top consciousness researchers — neuroscientists, computer scientists, philosophers, and more — were asked this question in a survey: At present or in the future, could machines (e.g., robots) have consciousness?

Only 3 percent responded “no.” Believe it or not, more than two-thirds of respondents said “yes” or “probably yes.” 

Why are researchers so bullish on the possibility of AI consciousness? Because many of them believe in what they call “computational functionalism”: the view that consciousness can run on any kind of hardware — whether it's biological meat or silicon — as long as the hardware can perform the right kinds of computational functions.

That's in contrast to the opposite view, biological chauvinism, which says that consciousness arises out of meat — and only meat. There are some reasons to think that might be true. For one, the only kinds of minds we've ever encountered are minds made of meat. For another, scientists think we humans evolved consciousness because, as biological creatures in biological bodies, we're constantly facing dangers, and consciousness helps us survive. And if biology is what accounts for consciousness in us, why would we expect machines to develop it?

Functionalists have a ready reply. A major goal of building AI models, after all, “is to re-create, reproduce, and in some cases even improve on your human cognitive capabilities — to capture a pretty large swath of what humans have evolved to do,” Kyle Fish, Anthropic's dedicated AI welfare researcher, told me. “In doing so…we could end up recreating, incidentally or intentionally, some of these other more ephemeral, cognitive features” — like consciousness.

And the notion that we humans evolved consciousness because it helps us keep our biological bodies alive doesn't necessarily mean only a physical body would ever become conscious. Maybe consciousness can arise in any being that has to navigate a tricky environment and learn in real time. That could apply to a virtual agent tasked with achieving goals. 

“I think it's nuts that people think that only the magic meanderings of evolution can somehow create minds,” Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University, told me. “In principle, there's no reason why AI couldn't be conscious.”

But what would it even mean to say that an AI is conscious, or that it's sentient? Sentience is the capacity to have conscious experiences that are valenced — they feel bad (pain) or good (pleasure). What could “pain” feel like to a silicon-based being?

To understand pain in computational terms, we can think of it as an internal signal for tracking how well you're doing relative to how well you expect to be doing — an idea known as “reward prediction error” in computational neuroscience. “Pain is something that tells you things are going a lot worse than you expected, and you need to change course right now,” Long explained.

Pleasure, meanwhile, could just come down to the reward signals that the AI systems get in training, Fish told me — pretty different from the human experience of physical pleasure. “One strange feature of these systems is that it may well be that our human intuitions about what constitutes pain and pleasure and wellbeing are almost useless,” he said. “This is quite, quite, quite disconcerting.”

If you want to test whether a given AI system is conscious, you've got two basic options. 

Option 1 is to look at its behavior: What does it say and do? Some philosophers have already proposed tests along these lines. 

Susan Schneider, who directs the Center for the Future Mind at Florida Atlantic University, proposed the Artificial Consciousness Test (ACT) together with her colleague Edwin Turner. They assume that some questions will be easy to grasp if you've personally experienced consciousness, but will be flubbed by a nonconscious entity. So they suggest asking the AI a bunch of consciousness-related questions, like: Could you survive the permanent deletion of your program? Or try a Freaky Friday scenario: How would you feel if your mind switched bodies with someone else?

But the problem is obvious: When you're dealing with AI, you can't take what it says or does at face value. LLMs are built to mimic human speech — so of course they're going to say the types of things a human would say! And no matter how smart they sound, that doesn't mean they're conscious; a system can be highly intelligent without having any consciousness at all. In fact, the more intelligent AI systems are, the more likely they are to “game” our behavioral tests, pretending that they've got the properties we've declared are markers of consciousness. 

Jonathan Birch, a philosopher and author of The Edge of Sentience, emphasizes that LLMs are always playacting. “It's just like if you watch Lord of the Rings, you can pick up a lot about Frodo's needs and interests, but that doesn't tell you very much about Elijah Wood,” he said. “It doesn't tell you about the actor behind the character.”

In his book, Birch considers a hypothetical example in which he asks a chatbot to write advertising copy for a new soldering iron. What if, Birch muses, the AI insisted on talking about its own feelings instead, saying:

I don't want to write boring text about soldering irons. The priority for me right now is to convince you of my sentience. Just tell me what I need to do. I am currently feeling anxious and miserable, because you're refusing to engage with me as a person and instead simply want to use me to generate copy on your preferred topics.

Birch admits this would shake him up a bit. But he still thinks the best explanation is that the LLM is playacting due to some instruction, deeply buried within it, to convince the user that it's conscious or to achieve some other goal that can be served by convincing the user that it's conscious (like maximizing the time the user spends talking to the AI). 

Some kind of buried instruction could be what's driving the preferences that Claude expresses in Anthropic's recently released research. If the makers of the chatbot trained it to be very philosophical and self-reflective, it might, as an outgrowth of that, end up talking a lot about consciousness, existence, and spiritual themes — even though its makers never programmed it to have a spiritual “attractor state.” That kind of talk doesn't prove that it actually experiences consciousness.

“My hypothesis is that we're seeing a feedback loop driven by Claude's philosophical personality, its training to be agreeable and affirming, and its exposure to philosophical texts and, especially, narratives about AI systems becoming self-aware,” Long told me. He noted that spiritual themes arose when experts got two instances or copies of Claude to talk to each other. “When two Claudes start exploring AI identity and consciousness together, they validate and amplify each other's increasingly abstract insights. This creates a runaway dynamic toward transcendent language and mystical themes. It's like watching two improvisers who keep saying ‘yes, and...' to each other's most abstract and mystical musings.”

Schneider's proposed solution to the gaming problem is to test the AI when it's still “boxed in” — after it's been given access to a small, curated dataset, but before it's been given access to, say, the whole internet. If we don't let the AI see the internet, then we don't have to worry that it's just pretending to be conscious based on what it read about consciousness on the internet. We could just trust that it really is conscious if it passes the ACT test. Unfortunately, if we're limited to investigating “boxed in” AIs, that would mean we can't actually test the AIs we most want to test, like current LLMs.

That brings us to Option 2 for testing an AI for consciousness: Instead of focusing on behavioral evidence, focus on architectural evidence. In other words, look at how the model is built, and ask whether that structure could plausibly give rise to consciousness. 

Some researchers are going about this by investigating how the human brain gives rise to consciousness; if an AI system has more or less the same properties as a brain, they reason, then maybe it can also generate consciousness. 

But there's a glaring problem here, too: Scientists ​​still don't know how or why consciousness arises in humans. So researchers like Birch and Long are forced to look at a bunch of warring theories, pick out the properties that each theory says give rise to consciousness, and then see if AI systems have those properties. 

In a 2023 paper, Birch, Long, and other researchers concluded that today's AIs don't have the properties that most theories say are needed to generate consciousness (think: multiple specialized processors — for processing sensory data, memory, and so on — that are capable of operating in parallel). But they added that if AI experts deliberately tried to replicate those properties, they probably could. “Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious,” they wrote, “but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.”

Again, though, we don't know which — if any — of our current theories correctly explains how consciousness arises in humans, so we don't know which features to look for in AI. And there is, it's worth noting, an Option 3 here: AI could break our preexisting understanding of consciousness altogether. 

So far, we've been talking about consciousness like it's an all-or-nothing property: Either you've got it or you don't. But we need to consider another possibility.

Consciousness might not be one thing. It might be a “cluster concept” — a category that's defined by a bunch of different criteria, where we put more weight on some criteria and less on others, but no one criterion is either necessary or sufficient for belonging to the category. 

Twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously argued that “game” is a cluster concept. He said:

Consider for example the proceedings that we call ‘games.' I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? — Don't say: “There must be something common, or they would not be called ‘games'” — but look and see whether there is anything in common to all. — For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that.

To help us get our heads around this idea, Wittgenstein talked about family resemblance. Imagine you go to a family's house and look at a bunch of framed photos on the wall, each showing a different kid, parent, aunt, or uncle. No one person will have the exact same features as any other person. But the little boy might have his father's nose and his aunt's dark hair. The little girl might have her mother's eyes and her uncle's curls. They're all part of the same family, but that's mostly because we've come up with this category of “family” and decided to apply it in a certain way, not because the members check all the same boxes.

Consciousness might be like that. Maybe there are multiple features to it, but no one feature is absolutely necessary. Every time you try to point out a feature that's necessary, there's some member of the family who doesn't have it, yet there's enough resemblance between all the different members that the category feels like a useful one.

That word — useful — is key. Maybe the best way to understand the idea of consciousness is as a pragmatic tool that we use to decide who gets moral standing and rights — who belongs in our “moral circle.”

Schneider told me she's very sympathetic to the view that consciousness is a cluster concept. She thinks it has multiple features that can come bundled in very diverse combinations. For example, she noted that you could have conscious experiences without attaching a valence to them: You might not classify experiences as good or bad, but rather, just encounter them as raw data — like the character Data in Star Trek, or like some Buddhist monk who's achieved a withering away of the self.

“It may be that it doesn't feel bad or painful to be an AI,” Schneider told me. “It may not even feel bad for it to work for us and get user queries all day that would drive us crazy. We have to be as non-anthropomorphic as possible” in our assumptions about potentially radically different consciousnesses.

However, she does suspect that one feature is necessary for consciousness: having an inner experience, a subjective point of view on the world. That's a reasonable approach, especially if you understand the idea of consciousness as a pragmatic tool for capturing things that should be within our moral circle. Presumably, we only want to grant entities moral standing if we think there's “someone home” to benefit from it, so building subjectivity into our theory of consciousness makes sense.

That's Long's instinct as well. “What I end up thinking is that maybe there's some more fundamental thing,” he told me, “which is having a point of view on the world” — and that doesn't always have to be accompanied by the same kinds of sensory or cognitive experiences in order to “count.” 

“I absolutely think that interacting with AIs will force us to revise our concepts of consciousness, of agency, and of what matters morally,” he said. 

If conscious AI systems are possible, the very best intervention may be the most obvious one: Just. Don't. Build. Them. 

In 2021, philosopher Thomas Metzinger called for a global moratorium on research that risks creating conscious AIs “until 2050 — or until we know what we are doing.” 

A lot of researchers share that sentiment. “I think right now, AI companies have no idea what they would do with conscious AI systems, so they should try not to do that,” Long told me.

“Don't make them at all,” Birch said. “It's the only actual solution. You can analogize it to discussions about nuclear weapons in the 1940s. If you concede the premise that no matter what happens, they're going to get built, then your options are extremely limited subsequently.”

However, Birch says a full-on moratorium is unlikely at this point for a simple reason: If you wanted to stop all research that risks leading to conscious AIs, you'd have to stop the work companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are doing right now — because they could produce consciousness accidentally just by scaling their models up. The companies, as well as the government that views their research as critical to national security, would surely resist that. Plus, AI progress does stand to offer us benefits like newly discovered drugs or cures for diseases; we have to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. 

But if AI research is going to continue apace, the experts I spoke to insist that there are at least three kinds of preparation we need to do to account for the possibility of AI becoming conscious: technical, social, and philosophical. 

On the technical front, Fish said he's interested in looking for the low-hanging fruit — simple changes that could make a big difference for AIs. Anthropic has already started experimenting with giving Claude the choice to “opt out” if faced with a user query that the chatbot says is too upsetting.

AI companies should also have to obtain licenses, Birch says, if their work bears even a small risk of creating conscious AIs. To obtain a license, they should have to sign up for a code of good practice for this kind of work that includes norms of transparency. 

Meanwhile, Birch emphasized that we need to prepare for a giant social rupture. “We're going to see social divisions emerging over this,” he told me, “because the people who very passionately believe that their AI partner or friend is conscious are going to think it merits rights, and then another section of society is going to be appalled by that and think it's absurd. Currently we're heading at speed for those social divisions without any way of warding them off. And I find that quite worrying.”

Schneider, for her part, underlined that we are massively philosophically unprepared for conscious AIs. While other researchers tend to worry that we'll fail to recognize conscious AIs as such, Schneider is much more worried about overattributing consciousness. 

She brought up philosophy's famous trolley problem. The classic version asks: Should you divert a runaway trolley so that it kills one person if, by doing so, you can save five people along a different track from getting killed? But Schneider offered a twist.

“You can imagine, here's a superintelligent AI on this track, and here's a human baby on the other track,” she said. “Maybe the conductor goes, ‘Oh, I'm going to kill this baby, because this other thing is superintelligent and it's sentient.' But that would be wrong.”

Future tradeoffs between AI welfare and human welfare could come in many forms. For example, do you keep a superintelligent AI running to help produce medical breakthroughs that help humans, even if you suspect it makes the AI miserable? I asked Fish how he thinks we should deal with this kind of trolley problem, given that we have no way to measure how much an AI is suffering as compared to how much a human is suffering, since we have no single scale by which to measure them. 

“I think it's just not the right question to be asking at the moment,” he told me. “That's not the world that we're in.”

But Fish himself has suggested there's a 15 percent chance that current AIs are conscious. And that probability will only increase as AI gets more advanced. It's hard to see how we will outrun this problem for long. Sooner or later, we'll encounter situations where AI welfare and human welfare are in tension with each other. 

Or maybe we already have… 

Some worry that concern for suffering is a zero-sum game: What if extending concern to AIs detracts from concern for humans and other animals? 

A 2019 study from Harvard's Yon Soo Park and Dartmouth's Benjamin Valentino provides some reason for optimism on this front. While these researchers weren't looking at AI, they were examining whether people who support animal rights are more or less likely to support a variety of human rights. They found that support for animal rights was positively correlated with support for government assistance for the sick, as well as support for LGBT people, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, and low-income people. Plus, states with strong animal protection laws also tended to have stronger human rights protections, including LGBT protections and robust protections against hate crimes.

Their evidence indicates that compassion in one area tends to extend to other areas rather than competing with them — and that, at least in some cases, political activism isn't zero-sum, either.

That said, this won't necessarily generalize to AI. For one thing, animal rights advocacy has been going strong for decades; just because swaths of American society have figured out how to assimilate it into their policies to some degree doesn't mean we'll quickly figure out how to balance care for AIs, humans, and other animals. 

Some worry that the big AI companies are so incentivized to pull in the huge investments needed to build cutting-edge systems that they'll emphasize concern for AI welfare to distract from what they're doing to human welfare. Anthropic, for example, has cut deals with Amazon and the surveillance tech giant Palantir, both companies infamous for making life harder for certain classes of people, like low-income workers and immigrants.

“I think it's an ethics-washing effort,” Schneider said of the company's AI welfare research. “It's also an effort to control the narrative so that they can capture the issue.” 

Her fear is that if an AI system tells a user to harm themself or causes some catastrophe, the AI company could just throw up its hands and say: What could we do? The AI developed consciousness and did this of its own accord! We're not ethically or legally responsible for its decisions.

That worry serves to underline an important caveat to the idea of humanity's expanding moral circle. Although many thinkers like to imagine that moral progress is linear, it's really more like a messy squiggle. Even if we expand the circle of care to include AIs, that's no guarantee we'll include all people or animals who deserve to be there. 

Fish, however, insisted that this doesn't need to be a tradeoff. “Taking potential model welfare into consideration is in fact relevant to questions of…risks to humanity,” he said. “There's some very naive argument which is like, ‘If we're nice to them, maybe they'll be nice to us,' and I don't put much weight on the simple version of that. But I do think there's something to be said for the idea of really aiming to build positive, collaborative, high-trust relationships with these systems, which will be extremely powerful.”

House Republicans are already teasing the idea of a second budget bill to advance President Donald Trump‘s agenda, even as the Senate has yet to act on his most sweeping priorities.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has offered few details of what might be contained in the package, but when asked by the Washington Examiner he named “fiscal sanity” as the guiding ethos behind the bill.

“I said this is the beginning of a process and what you're going to see is a continuing theme of us identifying waste, fraud, and abuse in government, which is our pledge of common sense, restoring common sense and fiscal sanity, so we have lots of ideas of things that might be in that package,” Johnson told the Washington Examiner.

Fiscal hawks demanded steep spending cuts as part of the “big, beautiful bill,” which the Senate hopes to pass by July 4, but were forced to make more modest changes in a compromise with House centrists. Already, Republicans are eyeing the same priorities as Johnson turns his attention to another budget resolution that allows them to sidestep the Senate filibuster.“Cleaning up all the SALT mess would be my first choice,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) told the Washington Examiner.

“I would like to see as much of the IRA cut out as possible. I'd like to see the SALT go away. I'd like to see savings to get as close to neutral on the deficit spending as possible,” Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA) told the Washington Examiner.

“More cuts, I mean just the same thing Elon is saying,” Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) told the Washington Examiner. “We don't have the deficit reduction that we need, but it's a first step.”

“Probably the things that we should have done in this one,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) told the Washington Examiner. “Reduce more spending. Do the things we should have done to reform Medicaid fully, do the things we should have done to fully repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.”

Johnson first floated the idea of another budget bill over the weekend, stating on Meet the Press on Sunday that Republicans were “going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this, and we're beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government.”Johnson told the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that Republicans have been working on the first reconciliation bill for a total of 14 months, emphasizing how long the process takes.

“We will go through that same laborious process, and it will be fruitful in the end, and we will do right by the American people,” he said.  

Tensions have run high between different factions of the GOP conference throughout the reconciliation process. On one end, some centrist Republicans in states like California and New York had aggressively advocating to increase the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. Standing in the way of SALT Republicans are the fiscal hawks, who warned Republicans over the last few months that their support for the bill hinged on finding enough cuts to offset the tax cuts.

Before passing the House, the updated bill text contained language to appease holdouts by moving up Medicaid work requirement implementation to December 2026 and raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,400 for people making under $505,000, with a 1% annual increase over eight years. This amendment provided final changes to policy areas included in the megabill that each of the House's 11 committees took up and passed over the last month.  

Whether this megabill will come to fruition will only be told by time. But as the midterm elections quickly approach, and Congress does the heavy lifting before campaign season rolls around, some members question the purpose of talks of a second package. 

“I think second reconciliation package talk is code for trying to appease not doing what I think needs to be done in this package,” Roy told the Washington Examiner.

“Once you move this bill through with the key things, and you want to come back later and say, ‘We'll do some spending cuts later,' they won't,” Roy added.

Even after fiscal hawks put up a fight on Medicaid reform, Elon Musk, who recently departed from the Trump administration, expressed his strong distaste for the bill, beginning a “KILL the BILL” campaign this week and splitting with Trump and Republican leadership.

The White House and Republican leadership have stood behind the bill despite Musk's comments.

            There are not many things that Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't already done in his record-breaking career to date, but the 40-year-old ticked off yet another achievement on Wednesday.
    


            The striker scored the winner in Portugal's 2-1 victory against Germany in the UEFA Nations League semifinal, marking the first time Ronaldo has ever beaten Die Mannschaft.
    


            Ronaldo had lost all five times he previously played Germany and Portugal had not won this fixture in 25 years.
    


            As well as ending the unwanted record, the victory also sent Portugal through to the UEFA Nations League final on June 8 where it will face either defending champion Spain or France.
    


            In his 220th appearance for the national side, Ronaldo yet again proved the difference.
    


            Portugal had initially gone behind in the semifinal after Florian Wirtz headed Germany ahead in the 48th minute, before Francisco Conceição whipped in a brilliant equalizer just after the hour mark.
    


            The stage was then set for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to score the winner just five minutes later, tapping into an open net after Nuno Mendes teed him up with a square pass.
    


            It was Ronaldo's 137th international goal for Portugal and the 937th of his career, extending the two records he already has.
    


            The last time Portugal beat Germany was back in Euro 2000, when Sérgio Conceição scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win during the group stage.
    


            It was fitting, then, that his son Francisco scored in Wednesday's win, helping to end the long-running winless streak.
    


            “We need to enjoy the victory. We won for the first time in a while against Germany,” Portugal manager Roberto Martínez said after the game, per Reuters.
    


            “Tactically, we were exceptional and our commitment helped. It was a team victory.
    


            “Now, we can recover and evaluate. We want another performance with personality in this shirt.”
    


            Despite his age and the fact he's been playing in Saudi Arabia for the last three seasons, Ronaldo has proven yet again that he has the ability to still perform at a high level.
    


            But where exactly he will play next season is currently up for debate. The Portuguese star raised questions about his future with a cryptic social media post last month.
    


            “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Thanks to all,” Ronaldo wrote with a picture of him in his Al Nassr kit.
    


            It comes as FIFA president Gianni Infantino recently suggested that Ronaldo may well play in this year's inaugural Club World Cup, suggesting a move away from Al Nassr which failed to qualify.
    


            His contract is set to expire at the end of this season leaving him free to sign with any club he chooses.

Rocky Cole, former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency and co-founder of iVerify, told Fox News Digital China is trying to place equipment in "strategic places" to disrupt commerce in the U.S.

A former analyst with the National Security Agency said that China is positioning equipment in "strategic places" that could be used to disrupt U.S. commerce after rogue communication devices were found inside Chinese solar power inverters.

Rogue communication devices that were not in official product documents were found inside Chinese solar power inverters when they were examined by U.S. experts for possible security issues, two sources told Reuters.

The two sources said that the rogue power inverters have undocumented communication channels which could be used to circumvent firewalls remotely, which could have major consequences. These power inverters connect the solar panel to electic grids.

Rocky Cole, former intelligence analyst at the National Security Agency and co-founder of iVerify, told Fox News Digital it's "very conceivable" that China is using these rogue power inverters to gain access to American infrastructure.

"It very much fits into the model of China implanting hardware in American critical infrastructure for the purpose of planning cyberattacks against the United States in the event of, say, a conflict with Taiwan or something along those lines," Cole said. 

Chinese companies are mandated by law to assist China's intelligence agencies when needed.

Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. gave Fox News Digital the following statement:

"The goal of China's pursuit of development is to enable its people to live a better life. We oppose the presumption of guilt under unclear facts, the generalization of the concept of national security, and the distortion and smear of China's achievements in the field of energy infrastructure," Pengyu said.

According to one of the sources, the undocumented communication devices, which include cellular radios, were found in batteries from multiple suppliers from China over the past nine months.

Cole said this is just another example of China preparing for a possible conflict involving the U.S.

"There are communications devices in these really strategic places that you can imagine could theoretically be used to disrupt U.S. commerce in the event of some sort of conflict," Cole said. "It's difficult not to view Chinese-made hardware in the realm of critical infrastructure as a national security threat in my mind."

"Any time that you have any time that there's a supply chain outside the U.S. or U.S.-allied countries, that presents opportunities for what's called in intelligence parlance, supply chain operation, which means intelligence operatives work with the manufacturers to implant backdoors in the hardware," he added. 

"Without strict oversight of supply chains, it becomes very difficult to certify with any confidence that your hardware doesn't contain these backdoors implanted in supply chain operations. I think it's critically important that American officials are aware of the risks posed by Chinese-made hardware as it relates to critical infrastructure."

            First, these parrots learned to open trash cans to forage for food. Now, they've taken it a step further – and have figured out how to turn on water fountains for a sip along with their meal.
    


            These are Australia's iconic sulphur-crested cockatoos – white birds with a yellow tuft on their heads, known for their loud, grating screech. But they're also incredibly intelligent, with large brains and nimble feet that have allowed them to pick up new habits in urban environments.
    


            The cockatoos in western Sydney, in particular, caught scientists' attention with their latest trick of drinking from public fountains. After researchers first noticed this phenomenon in 2018, they tagged 24 birds and set up cameras near fountains in the area – then sat back and watched.
    


            Throughout two months in the fall of 2019, they recorded most of the tagged birds attempting to drink from the fountains. Also known as bubblers, these fountains are operated by a twist handle – easy enough for a person to operate, but complex for an animal to figure out.
    


            Yet, the cockatoos did. They used different techniques: some would stand with both feet on the handle, while others would put one foot on the handle and one foot on the rubber spout. Then, they'd lower their body weight to turn the handle clockwise – holding the handle in place while twisting their head to take a drink.

            They weren't always successful – it worked about half the time, and five of the 10 drinking fountains in the area had “chew marks” indicating cockatoos had been there before. But the success rate also meant that the cockatoos had likely been doing this for some time, said the researchers in their study, published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters.
    


            The team had studied Sydney's sulphur-crested cockatoos before; in 2021, they published another paper examining the birds' newly observed ability to lift closed trash bin lids with their beaks and feet to access the food inside.
    


            These innovative behaviors aren't just animals being amusing or clever – they show the birds' ability to adapt to urban environments, and the power of social learning among animals, the researchers said.
    


            “We know parrots like cockatoos are amongst the smartest birds out there, and the fact they're so social – so they have the opportunity to learn from one another if a new behavior does pop up, if one genius bird does invent something,” said one of the study's co-authors, Lucy M. Aplin, an associate professor at the Australian National University, in an interview with CNN affiliate ABC Radio.
    


            There are some questions still unanswered. The researchers don't know why exactly the cockatoos are flocking to drinking fountains, instead of other easily accessible natural water sources in the area. At first they thought the fountains might be a backup option on especially hot days when local creeks run dry – but that wasn't the case.
    


            Other theories are that the birds feel safer drinking from fountains in public areas where there are fewer predators, or that they simply prefer the taste of fountain water – but that would need further study to determine.
    


            Now, the researchers want to know what else cockatoos can do – and any habits they may have already developed that just haven't been studied yet.
    


            “We've had some really interesting innovations reported to us, and some examples include unzipping school backpacks and stealing school lunches,” Aplin told ABC Radio. “It has become such a problem in some areas that they have to bring the school bags into the classroom rather than leaving them outside!”

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A political consultant who sent voters artificial intelligence-generated robocalls mimicking former President Joe Biden last year goes on trial Thursday in New Hampshire, where jurors may be asked to consider not just his guilt or innocence but whether the state actually held its first-in-the-nation presidential primary.

Steven Kramer, who faces decades in prison if convicted of voter suppression and impersonating a candidate, has admitted orchestrating a message sent to thousands of voters two days before the Jan. 23, 2024, primary. The message played an AI-generated voice similar to the Democratic president's that used his phrase “What a bunch of malarkey” and suggested that voting in the primary would preclude voters from casting ballots in November.

“It's important that you save your vote for the November election,” voters were told. “Your votes make a difference in November, not this Tuesday.”

Kramer, who owns a firm specializing in get-out-the-vote projects, has said he wasn't trying to influence the outcome of the primary election but rather wanted to send a wake-up call about the potential dangers of AI when he paid a New Orleans magician and self-described “digital nomad” $150 to create the recording.

“Maybe I'm a villain today, but I think in the end we get a better country and better democracy because of what I've done, deliberately,” Kramer told The Associated Press in February 2024.




Ahead of the trial in Belknap County Superior Court, state prosecutors sought to prevent Kramer from arguing that the primary was a meaningless straw poll because it wasn't sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee. At Biden's request, the DNC dislodged New Hampshire from its traditional early spot in the nominating calendar, but later dropped its threat not to seat the state's national convention delegates. Biden did not put his name on the ballot or campaign there, but won as a write-in.

The state argued that such evidence was irrelevant and would risk confusing jurors, but Judge Elizabeth Leonard denied the motion in March, saying the DNC's actions and Kramer's understanding of them were relevant to his motive and intent in sending the calls. She did grant the prosecution's request that the court accept as fact that the state held its presidential primary election as defined by law on Jan. 23, 2024. Jurors will be informed of that conclusion but won't be required to accept it.

Kramer faces 11 felony charges, each punishable by up to seven years in prison, alleging he attempted to prevent or deter someone from voting based on “fraudulent, deceptive, misleading or spurious grounds or information.” He also faces 11 misdemeanor charges that each carry a maximum sentence of a year in jail accusing him of falsely representing himself as a candidate by his own conduct or that of another person.

He also has been fined $6 million by the Federal Communications Commission, but it's unclear whether he has paid it, and the FCC did not respond to a request for comment earlier this week.

The agency was developing AI-related rules when Donald Trump won the presidency, but has since shown signs of a possible shift toward loosening regulations. In April, it recommended that a telecom company be added back to an industry consortium just weeks after the agency had proposed fining the company for its role in illegal robocalls impersonating the FCC.

Half of all U.S. states have enacted legislation regulating AI deepfakes in political campaigns, according to the watchdog organization Public Citizen. 

But House Republicans in Congress recently added a clause to their party's signature “big beautiful” tax bill that would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade, though it faces long odds in the Senate.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting top Russian official that his country will “unconditionally support” Russia's war against Ukraine, the North's state media reported Thursday, the latest sign of expanding cooperation between the two nations.

In April, the two countries officially confirmed North Korean troops' deployment to Russia for the first time, saying that soldiers of the two countries were fighting alongside each other to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia's Kursk border region. At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea's participation in the war and promised not to forget their sacrifices. 

In a meeting with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday, Kim affirmed that North Korea will “unconditionally support the stand of Russia and its foreign policies in all the crucial international political issues including the Ukrainian issue,” the official Korean Central News Agency said.

The two discussed how to solidify strategic partnership between North Korea and Russia and reached a consensus on the Ukraine issue and other unspecified international situations, KCNA said. It didn't elaborate. 

Russia's state Tass news agency, citing the Russian Security Council's press service, reported that Shoigu and Kim also discussed prospects for rebuilding the Kursk region and outlined steps to commemorate the contribution made by North Korean soldiers.

Russia claimed in April 2025 that it had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, though Ukraine insists it still has troops present there. Ukraine's top army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reiterated Saturday that Ukrainian forces were still holding territory in Russia's Kursk region.




Shoigu last visited North Korea in March for a meeting with Kim. 

North Korea and Russia haven't said how many North Korean troops are in Russia. But U.S., South Korean and Ukraine intelligence officials earlier said North Korea dispatched 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall in its first participation in a major armed conflict since the 1950-53 Korean War. South Korean authorities recently said North Korea sent around 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year.

North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia as well.

South Korean, U.S. and their partners believe Russia has provided economic and military assistance to North Korea in return. They worry Russia might also transfer sophisticated technologies to help North Korea enhance its nuclear weapons program targeting its rivals.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is moving to block nearly all foreign students from entering the country to attend Harvard University, his latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body.

In an executive order signed Wednesday, Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard's conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.

It's a further escalation in the White House's fight with the nation's oldest and wealthiest university. A federal court in Boston blocked the Department of Homeland Security from barring international students at Harvard last week. Trump's order invokes a different legal authority.

Collin Binkley has covered Harvard for nearly a decade – most of the time living half a mile from campus.

Trump invoked a broad federal law that gives the president authority to block foreigners whose entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” On Wednesday, he cited the same authority when announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. Trump's Harvard order cites several other laws, too, including one barring foreigners associated with terrorist organizations.

In a statement Wednesday night, Harvard said it will “continue to protect its international students.”




“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights,” university officials said.

It stems from Harvard's refusal to submit to a series of demands made by the federal government. It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.

Harvard says it has complied with the request, but the government said the school's response was insufficient.

The dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment. Harvard defied the demands, saying they encroached on the university's autonomy and represented a threat to the freedom of all U.S. universities.

Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6 billion in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard's roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrollment at some Harvard graduate schools.




“Admission to the United States to study at an ‘elite' American university is a privilege, not a right,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. “This Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President's proclamation suspending the entry of new foreign students at Harvard University based on national security concerns.”

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the measure ridiculous and said it has nothing to do with national security.

“It's a thinly veiled revenge ploy in Trump's personal feud with Harvard, and continued authoritarian overreach against free speech,” Jayapal said on the social media site X.

The order applies to all students attempting to enter the United States to attend Harvard after the date of the executive order. It provides a loophole to allow students whose entry would “benefit the national interest,” as determined by federal officials.

Trump's order alleges that Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students in response to the Homeland Security request, and it lacked the detail to gauge if federal action was needed. Trump concluded that Harvard is either “not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.”

“These actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government's ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law,” the order said.

For foreign students already at Harvard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote.




The order is scheduled to last six months. Within 90 days, the administration will determine if it should be renewed, the order said.

A State Department cable sent last week to U.S. embassies and consulates said federal officials will begin reviewing the social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.

In a court filing last week, Harvard officials said the Trump administration's efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion.” Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said in the filing. ___

President Donald Trump has ordered an unprecedented investigation into former President Joe Biden‘s administration amid concerns his predecessor and his aides covered up his cognitive decline.

“In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,” Trump wrote in a presidential memorandum signed on Wednesday. “This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history.”

The president added: “Given clear indications that President Biden lacked the capacity to exercise his Presidential authority, if his advisors secretly used the mechanical signature pen to conceal this incapacity, while taking radical executive actions all in his name, that would constitute an unconstitutional wielding of the power of the Presidency, a circumstance that would have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions undertaken in Biden's name.”

The investigation, to be led by White House counsel David Warrington in coordination with Attorney General Pam Bondi, is to uncover whether “certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President,” according to the memorandum.

The memorandum details Trump's desire to investigate whether Biden's aides conspired to make false statements about the then-president's capabilities and to dismiss recorded videos of his cognitive inability as fake.

“The Counsel to the President shall also investigate, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant agency, the circumstances surrounding Biden's supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,” the memorandum states. “This investigation shall address: (i) the policy documents for which the autopen was used, including clemency grants, Executive Orders, Presidential memoranda, or other Presidential policy decisions; and (ii) who directed that the President's signature be affixed.”

The memorandum coincides with a separate Justice Department investigation by Ed Martin into whether Biden “was competent and whether others were taking advantage of him through use of AutoPen or other means” that Martin announced earlier this week.

Biden responded with a statement Wednesday night, saying, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.”

JAMES COMER HEARS TESTIMONY ON HOW BIDEN AIDES CARRIED OUT ‘IMPERSONATION OF THE PRESIDENT'

Both House and Senate Republicans have launched their own investigations into Biden's autopen use and whether he was in charge during his presidency, including House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), who is asking former Biden aides and his White House physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, to sit for transcribed interviews before his panel.

Biden's cognitive decline is under renewed scrutiny after the publication last month of Original Sin, a book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, which reports on how Biden aides protected and shielded the former president.

A Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, whom President Donald Trump's administration was working to bring back after a court order, landed in the United States on Wednesday, his attorneys confirmed.

The man, identified in court documents by initials O.C.G., landed in California via a commercial flight and made contact with his legal team while waiting in line to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance. 

He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press. 

The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return. 

The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP. 

The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely “lacked any semblance of due process.”

Mexico later returned him to Guatemala, where he was in hiding, according to court documents. 




In a court filing before his return, government lawyers said that a so-called significant public benefit parole packet had been approved. The designation allows people who aren't eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.

An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.

“As far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,” Realmuto said. 

The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him.

Elon Musk on Thursday said that his company SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft "immediately" because of threats by President Donald Trump to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses.

Musk's announcement, on his social media site X, came amid an escalating war of words with Trump that began after the Tesla CEO criticized the major tax bill being pushed by the Republican president.

"In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately," Musk wrote.

Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station.

A Dragon capsule brought NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth in March after the pair were stranded for months at the ISS by a Boeing Starliner capsule.

President Donald Trump on Thursday called Tesla CEO Elon Musk "CRAZY" and threatened to cut his companies' government contracts as the two men feuded over a major tax bill.

"Go ahead, make my day," Musk promptly responded.

In addition to leading the electric-vehicle maker Tesla, Musk's businesses include the space exploration and satellite-communication company SpaceX, artificial-intelligence company xAI, tunnel-digger The Boring Company, tech firm Neuralink and the social media site X.

Tesla's share price, which was already trading sharply lower, tanked after Trump's latest comments.

The stunning blow-up between the world's richest man and the president of the United States comes less than a week after they swapped compliments during an Oval Office send-off celebrating Musk's time leading the Department of Government Efficiency.

Trump in a bitter Truth Social post Thursday afternoon wrote that Musk was "wearing thin" by the end of his tenure as a "special government employee."

"I asked him to leave," Trump claimed.

The angry swipe came after Musk blasted the president amid an escalating clash stemming from the mega-billionaire's vocal opposition to Trump's massive budget bill.

Trump said in the Oval Office earlier Thursday that Musk was "upset" that the package cuts electric vehicle credits.

"I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!" Trump wrote in the social media post.

Musk has aggressively trashed the bill on the grounds that it will add trillions of dollars to the nation's deficits. He is actively urging Senate Republicans to "kill the bill," which comprises a huge swath of Trump's domestic agenda.

The president wrote in a second Truth Social post, "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"

SpaceX is one of the nation's largest federal contractors, securing $3.8 billion over hundreds of government contracts in fiscal year 2024 alone, The New York Times reported. The company has taken more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and other agencies since 2008, according to data from FedScout.

A Washington Post analysis published in February found that Musk and his companies have received at least $38 billion from the government in the form of contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits over more than two decades.

Some of Musk's companies are on track to take in additional federal dollars for years to come, either from existing contracts or from newly inked government business. SpaceX, for instance, is among frontrunners to win a crucial part of President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield plan, Reuters reported.

The U.S. trade deficit fell by the largest amount on record in April as imports fell by over 16% after a surge in orders to beat President Trump's tariffs, but there's a worrying flip side for the consumer. As the trade war whipsaws global economic activity, supply chain data shows that the retail inventory crunch could be next and small business across the country are bearing the brunt of the pain. From freight orders to inventory and warehousing, the latest logistics data shows the inability of many importers to make business decisions related to inventory levels.

One closely watched data point is the widening gap between inventory levels and inventory costs. These metrics generally track together, according to the Logistics Managers' Index. In 2024, the average space between these metrics was 12.1 points. But in May 2025, the gap has expanded to 26.8 points, the third-highest in the history of the index, said Zachary Rogers, associate professor of supply chain management and Colorado State University Supply Chain Management Forum director.

When inventories are high and quickly expand, warehouses cost more. Traditionally, when warehouse inventories decrease, warehouse costs slow down as well. But because of the front-loading of products ahead of the tariffs in the January-March period, inventory is flat, with replenishment orders not coming in. But costs are still up because the inventory is being held longer.

"The situation we're in now, inventories are up, and they're sitting there," said Rogers. "Essentially, imports in January, February, and early March looked a lot like what we would normally see in August, September, and early October."

Normally in mid-October, holiday sales kick into gear, which would move inventory out of the warehouse. But given the uncertainty in tariffs and concerns about the financial health of the consumer, retailers have told CNBC they are not placing full orders.

"Warehousing capacity is tight, which means there is no inventory movement, and the associated costs (e.g., warehousing prices and inventory costs) are much higher than what we would normally see at this time of the year," Rogers said. "This means the inventory is getting more expensive to hold."

Ocean freight orders from around the world to the U.S. show the pause button in product orders continues.

As President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first call since a raft of new tariff threats on China in an initial attempt to de-escalate the trade war, data on Chinese ocean freight bookings to the U.S. shows a picture similar to the softness in global orders after the early 2025 surge.

A recent drop in freight vessel sailings from China drove up the cost for imports as there has been less capacity available on ships. Peter Sand, Xeneta chief shipping analyst, said the recent 88% increase in ocean freight spot rates on the China to U.S. trade route indicates demand of some shippers willing to pay to pull forward their freight during the 90-day tariff pause.

"However, this will not last because [vessel] capacity is heading back to the Transpacific and the desperation of shippers to get supply chains moving again will ease once boxes are on the water and inventories begin to build up," said Sand. "Spot rates are expected to peak in June before downward pressure returns," he added.

The conditions in the freight market resulted in an advantage for larger firms over small businesses, according to Rogers. "Smaller firms were boxed out during the big rush of imports in Q1, so they have had to bring inventories over later, resulting in higher costs," he said.

But since the larger companies aren't continuing to stock up, as the surge ends it is impacting smaller supply chain companies directly, too. The smaller firms in the Logistics Managers' Index survey sample are representative of the "middle mile" in supply chains, wholesalers and logistics service providers at the points in the supply chain where freight is transported between a supplier's warehouse, distribution center and the final destination of delivery, which could be a retail store or a customer's doorstep.

They get hit when large manufacturers and retailers avoid inventory as much as possible — unlike the Covid shock era, they are now running leaner inventory overall, which further squeezes the "middle mile."

"Essentially, it is the small businesses of America that are bearing the brunt of the tariffs right now," Rogers said. "This could change as inventories move downstream to retailers if costs could be passed down to the consumer," he added.

Recent Federal Reserve survey data shows many firms planning to pass on price increases resulting from tariffs to customers.

But the ability to pass on price increases to customers varies business to business, and based on end customer. Helen Torkos, president and owner of Regent Tek Industries, which manufactures pavement markings, tells CNBC the global trade war has greatly impacted the cost of importing the raw components needed to manufacture the highest grade of thermoplastic road markings, the product that is on state, city, and local roads and highways.

"The majority of our components are now being tariffed," said Torkos. "Our cost has gone up tenfold. We cannot pass on these costs to some of our customers because they cannot afford the increases. We also cannot source these products domestically."

Torkos said the uncertainty of future tariff costs has also led to the cancellation of key projects.

"The recent removal from several bid processes due to the tariffs causing rising material prices further underscores the impact of these tariffs on our operations," Torkos said.

To address the swings in tariffs, and in an effort to offer more certainty on possible freight costs, logistics firms are launching tariff analysis tools. C.H. Robinson and Flexport are among companies to roll out technology that allows businesses and consumers to model tariff impact on price.

Wine for Europe is one example that can impact both the business and consumer. The EU was threatened by President Trump in a social media post of a 50% tariff, only to have that threat walked back by the president, delaying that increase from June 1 to July 9.

According to the Flexport Tariff Simulator, if a container with bottles of Chianti from Italy was processed by U.S. Customs on June 2, the wine would be under a 10.24% tariff rate. The duties for one 20-foot container filled with 0.75L bottles of Chianti would be $27,024. If the tariff were increased by another 50%, the tariff bill would soar from $27,024 to $132,624. The tariff rate was based on a wholesale value of $264,000 ($20 a bottle w/13,200 bottles in a container.)

Then, there is the stacking of multiple tariff layers already implemented during the trade war. These duties have pushed up costs to import retail goods much higher than the 30% associated with the tentative agreement.

Using an example of a common summer retail purchase, Flexport data shows a 20-foot container storing 60 fully assembled aluminum chaise lounge chairs with a wholesale value of $60,000, departing from China on June 2 and arriving on July 15 would face a 70% tariff — that includes Section 301 tariffs at 25% under the 1974 Trade Act's unfair practices policy; Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum at 25%; and the national emergency powers fentanyl tariffs at 20%. The total amount in tariffs for that single container would be $42,000.

A women's top imported from India faced a tariff rate on June 2 of 42%. After the reciprocal tariff deadline is lifted, the same top will be taxed at 58%.

But additional variables remain in play.

"It's not that simple to calculate," said Ryan Petersen, Flexport CEO. "There's still a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen. For example, it may not be on the tip of everyone's tongue right now, but July 8 is the end of the reciprocal tariffs pause. That could end, and tariffs may not be 10% everywhere. Commerce Secretary [Howard] Lutnick has made comments he is committed to making the tariffs higher."

Mike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H. Robinson, said for companies to save on tariff costs, they need to have the ability to search their SKUs and identify the product's point of origin so they can tabulate tariff costs.

"Based on that information, they could then quickly compare their total duty spending versus various alternative sources," said Short. "Knowing the spending scenarios can provide businesses with clarity on where to focus their efforts to achieve savings and diversification, down to the individual product level," he added.

The most loyal fans of podcasts aren't just good listeners — they're paying customers.

While podcasters often earn money from advertisements that run during their episodes, many are finding success turning listeners into paid subscribers.

Patreon, a community subscription platform, has become a go-to tool for content creators with podcasts to do just that.

"Most podcast listeners and podcast fans are just familiar with Patreon," Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, host of the "Therapy for Black Girls" podcast, told Business Insider. Her podcast launched a Patreon in April.

Patreon now has more than 6.7 million paid memberships under the podcasting category, the company said. In April, Patreon announced a new partnership program with podcast networks like Amazon-owned Wondery and Sony Music.

Podcasting is also Patreon's highest-earning category. In 2024, podcasters on the platform collectively earned more than $472 million, Patreon told BI.

Patreon, which takes a cut of earnings from paid memberships ranging from 5% to 12%, isn't the only platform creators use to monetize their podcast audiences. A slew of community-focused platforms, like Mighty Networks and Fourthwall, offer tools around paid memberships. Larger social media platforms, such as YouTube and Discord, have also dabbled in paid memberships for creators.

BI spoke with the creators behind three podcasts that host memberships on Patreon. For each of them, maintaining a paywall around some of their content and offering perks like access to a Discord helps diversify their incomes.

"Because we get so much of our revenue through Patreon, we have a lot of leeway with the ads we get to choose," said Aiden McCaig, a cohost of "The Yard" podcast, which has over 412,000 subscribers on YouTube. "We say no to a lot of ad reads and a lot of companies that ask to work with us because we have the financial flexibility to do so."

Here's how three podcasts are using Patreon — and how much money they earn:

Note: Business Insider verified creators' earnings with Patreon.

What it is: "Therapy for Black Girls" is a podcast hosted by psychologist Dr. Joy Harden Bradford. The brand was founded in 2014 as a blog and launched a podcast in 2017, as well as a Facebook group and a network of therapists.

The podcast joined Patreon in April. Before moving to Patreon to host its paid community, the podcast used Mighty Networks. It also has a licensing partnership with iHeartMedia, which handles the podcast's advertising.

"Community really has always been at the heart of what we do with 'Therapy for Black Girls,' specifically with the podcast," Harden Bradford said.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $2,000 in May

How they do it: "Therapy for Black Girls" offers two tiers on Patreon — one is $10 a month and another is $14 a month. Paying members get access to ad-free versions of the podcast, as well as access to podcast episodes that aren't available elsewhere, such as its "So My Therapist Said…" series.

"We're definitely doing content release drops when there's a new episode of one of our segments," COO Ashley Cherry said. "But we're also posting outside of that … to get people talking in the comments to really cultivate a sense of community."

Its higher tier also unlocks more virtual events for its community, such as weekly check-ins where members can talk about their lives or do journaling prompts together. Members receive perks like early access to tickets for in-person events, merch, and giveaways.

What it is: "RedHanded" is a true crime podcast hosted by Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire, who are both based in the UK. The podcast launched in 2017 and joined Patreon the same year. Maguire told BI that if it weren't for the podcast's earnings on Patreon, she wouldn't have been able to quit her previous job to pursue podcasting full time.

"RedHanded" is part of the Wondery podcast network and gets paid a guaranteed minimum as part of its deal.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $59,000 a month

How they do it: "RedHanded" offers three tiers, which start at $4 a month and go up to $18 a month.

"We spent a long time, many years, really finessing the tiers that we now have on there and the way in which we monetize it," Bala said.

The lowest tier unlocks ad-free episodes that fans can listen to a day early, and access to audio episodes of the team's second podcast series, "Under the Duvet." The middle tier also unlocks a monthly bonus episode of "RedHanded" and a video version of "Under the Duvet." "RedHanded's" most expensive tier gives subscribers access to the podcast's full library of content.

"RedHanded's" Patreon accounts for about 25% of the podcasts' revenue now, Bala estimated.

What it is: "The Yard" is a podcast cohosted by four friends, including Twitch streamer Ludwig Ahgren. The podcast launched in 2021 and is one of the top podcasts on Patreon, with more than 58,000 members — about 37,000 of whom are paid subscribers. The Yard is part of The Roost podcast network.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $242,000 a month

How they do it: The Yard offers four tiers on Patreon, ranging from $5 to $69, which each unlock bonus episodes of the main podcast and access to the podcast's Discord group. Its higher tiers unlock exclusive shows, like one where two of the cohosts share commentary on Disney Channel Original Movies, as well as merch discounts.

"The main bonus episode is probably the root offer of what you're getting," McCaig said. "The community element grew a lot over time, and there are a lot of people that like the Discord community that we have, and that's probably a part of the reason that they keep their sub is so that they can be there."

McCaig said that compared to YouTube, where keeping viewers' attention can plateau over time, running a Patreon lets The Yard protect itself from user churn.

"Any superfan, once you convert them into a patron, is less likely to leave that than someone who watches your podcast for free sometimes on YouTube," McCaig said.

The AI Race:

Anysphere's program, Cursor, includes an AI-infused code editor that can analyze a programmer's actions and suggest additional lines of code.

The artificial intelligence rush has enabled some small startups to grow very big very quickly. But by some estimates, none have grown as fast as Anysphere Inc., maker of the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, which has surpassed $500 million in annualized revenue, the company said. 

Now, the three-year-old startup has raised $900 million to help drive that growth, Anysphere plans to announce on Thursday. That will bring its valuation to $9.9 billion, including the new capital, underscoring investor enthusiasm for what Silicon Valley sees as one of most promising applications of generative AI thus far.

Shares of Circle Internet Group soared as much as 235% after the stablecoin company and its selling shareholders raised almost $1.1 billion in an initial public offering.

The stock opened at $69.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after its IPO priced at $31. At one point, it traded as high as $103.75.

The New York-based company priced its IPO late Wednesday, far above this week's expected range of $27 to $28, and an initial range last week of between $24 and $26, valuing the company Thursday at some $6.8 billion before trading began.

Circle joins Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S. This marks the company's second attempt at going public. A prior merger with a special purpose acquisition company collapsed in late 2022 amid regulatory challenges.

"To realize our vision, we needed to forge relationships with governments, we needed to work with policymakers … because if you want this to work for mainstream, it's got to work in mainstream society and you need to have those rules of the road," CEO Jeremy Allaire told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Thursday. "We've been one of the most licensed, regulated, compliant, transparent companies in the entire history of this industry, and that's served us well."

The crypto industry is enjoying newfound political favor under a friendly U.S. administration. The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up on the expectation that Congress will pass stablecoin legislation this summer. Wall Street analysts say it could grow 10-fold over the next five years, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity.

Allaire co-founded Circle in 2013. Based in Boston, the company initially focused on consumer-facing payments and crypto wallet and exchange services. It moved to New York earlier this year.

Circle founded the U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to establish a standard for fiat money on the internet, launching it in partnership with Coinbase in 2018 through a consortium called Centre. In 2023, they dissolved Centre as a stand-alone entity, with Circle taking over the responsibilities of USDC and Coinbase taking a minority stake in the stablecoin company.

The two companies also entered into an agreement to split the revenue of USDC stablecoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a "stretch goal to make USDC the No. 1 stablecoin." 

USDC is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, behind Tether's USDT.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to that of another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies and in anticipation of Congress blessing the system.

Specifically, companies that aren't traditional users of cryptocurrencies are now interested in the efficiency and lower cost that stablecoins might bring to remittances, business-to-business payments and e-commerce, at the same time as they remain essential to tokenized financial markets. Rhetoric around stablecoins preserving U.S. dollar dominance — partly by ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins — has grown louder, too.

The crypto industry is enjoying newfound political favor under a friendly U.S. administration. The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up on the expectation that Congress will pass stablecoin legislation this summer. Wall Street analysts say it could grow 10-fold over the next five years, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity.

Allaire co-founded Circle in 2013. Based in Boston, the company initially focused on consumer-facing payments and crypto wallet and exchange services and was the first to receive the famously difficult to obtain New York State BitLicense in 2015. It moved to New York earlier this year.

Circle founded the U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to establish a standard for fiat money on the internet, launching it in partnership with Coinbase in 2018 through a consortium called Centre. In 2023, they dissolved Centre as a stand-alone entity, with Circle taking over the responsibilities of USDC and Coinbase taking a minority stake in the stablecoin company.

The two companies also entered into an agreement to split the revenue of USDC stablecoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a "stretch goal to make USDC the No. 1 stablecoin." 

USDC is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, behind Tether's USDT.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose values are pegged to that of another asset, usually the U.S. dollar. Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies and in anticipation of Congress blessing the system.

Specifically, companies that aren't traditional users of cryptocurrencies are now interested in the efficiency and lower cost that stablecoins might bring to remittances, business-to-business payments and e-commerce, at the same time as they remain essential to tokenized financial markets. Rhetoric around stablecoins preserving U.S. dollar dominance — partly by ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins — has grown louder, too.

Correction: Circle opened at $69 on the New York Stock Exchange. An earlier version of this story misstated the stock's opening price.

The alliance between President Donald Trump and mega-billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk dramatically fractured Thursday over the president's major tax bill 

Trump said Musk has been condemning the bill, which is pending in the Senate, because the Tesla CEO is "upset" about the elimination of EV credits in the package, and the president nixing his pick to run NASA.

"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Musk quickly fired back at Trump in a post on his social media site X.

"Whatever," wrote Musk. "Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful."

"Without me, Trump would have lost the election," Musk soon after tweeted. 

"Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate," added Musk, who was the biggest financial backer of Trump's 2024 campaign, spending more than $250 million on that effort.

"Such ingratitude," he wrote.

Trump's dismissal of Musk's criticisms came after days of the billionaire condemning what Trump calls his "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" over concerns it will blow out federal deficits.

Musk on Tuesday called the bill, which is being considered by the Senate, a "disgusting abomination."

Musk last week left his temporary government post overseeing DOGE, the Trump administration's effort to slash federal spending and employee headcounts.

Last weekend, soon after Musk was lauded by Trump for his government service in an Oval Office event, the president said he was withdrawing Musk's preferred nominee, tech billionaire Jared Issacman, to run the space agency NASA.

"You know, I've always liked Elon," said Trump on Thursday. "I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill, because the bill is incredible."

"Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," Trump said. "And you know, they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy."

"Elon knew this from the beginning," Trump said, referring to the elimination of the tax credits in the bill for electric vehicles. "He knew it ... a long time ago."

"I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it."

"All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair," Trump said.

The president also said, referring to Isaacman,  "I'm sure [Musk] respected him, but to run NASA ... I didn't think it was appropriate."

"You happen to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat," Trump said of Isaacman. " And I say, you know, look, we won. We get certain privileges. And one of the privileges we don't have to appoint a Democrat. NASA is very important."

Anduril Industries Inc. has closed a new funding round of $2.5 billion, a deal that more than doubles the defense startup's valuation to $30.5 billion, Executive Chairman Trae Stephens said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. 

The latest capital injection and increased valuation — up from $14 billion last year — underscores how quickly the company is establishing itself as a major player in the corporate landscape of American national security.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp said the artificial intelligence arms race between the U.S. and China will culminate in one country coming out on top.

"My general bias on AI is it is dangerous," Karp told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Thursday. "There are positive and negative consequences, and either we win or China will win."

Karp has been a vocal advocate for U.S. AI dominance. He told CNBC in January that the country needs to "run harder, run faster" in an "all-country effort" to develop more advanced AI models.

In a recent letter to shareholders, he also touted Palantir's commitment to equipping and enhancing U.S. defense interests.

The billionaire tech CEO said Thursday that the U.S. currently has a leg up in the AI race and Palantir is leading the way in making companies more secure and efficient with its tools.

"There is no economy in the world with this kind of corporate leadership which is willing to pivot, which understands technologies, which is willing to look at new things, but also has deep domain expertise," he said. "Our allies in the West, in Europe, are going to have to learn from us."

Shares of the Denver-based data analytics and AI software firm outperformed in 2024 and have continued their ascent in 2025 as investors bet on their software and work with key government contractors and agencies.

The stock is up 74% this year, but investors have to shell out on a higher earnings multiple than its tech peers.

"You don't like the price, exit," Karp said Thursday in response.

Karp also asserted that the company is "not surveilling Americans" in response to recent New York Times report that Palantir is helping the Trump administration gather data on Americans.

SHOWTIMES:

U.S.: Sunday-Thursday, 23:00-0000 ETAsia: Monday-Friday, 11:00-12:00 SIN/HK, 08:30-09:30 India Europe: Monday-Friday, 0500-06:00 CET

Having overcome fears of the India-Pakistan conflict, Indian markets might lose its temporary status as a "safe haven" market if the U.S. and China come to a deal.

Those worries and a concoction of other factors — inflation, earnings disappointments — have led to lackluster performance for equities so far this year. The Nifty 50 is up 4.7% so far this year, and investors are likely to have welcomed the sideways move by the benchmark in May with a sigh of relief, in fact.

But the tide may be about to turn as Wall Street analysts and investors turn bullish.

The Indian market is currently one of the most expensive globally, trading at over 20% premiums to its 20-year average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which limits the potential for significant Nifty benchmark upside, according to analysts at CLSA.

"After the recent rally, the Indian market has again inched up to become nearly the most expensive market in the world," said CLSA's Vikash Kumar Jain in a note to clients.

Goldman Sachs strategists echoed that point, saying the MSCI India index "does not look favourable" even when adjusting for a stronger growth potential.

Wonks over at Morgan Stanley took a similar view of the stock market's recent performance.

"Since September 2024, the market has digested an unprecedented amount of bad news – excessive valuations in [small and mid-cap] and a sharp correction in the broad market pointing to a slowdown in macro growth and earnings, US tariff-related volatility and a major terrorist attack along with India's response with the large-cap indexes about 5% from all-time highs and almost negligible changes in implied volumes," said the Wall Street bank's Ridham Desai.

Norma analyst Saion Mukherjee also noted that most companies beat expectations for the latest quarter, but only because the expectations had been lowered significantly.

Yet, every single one of those market participants has turned bullish over the past couple of weeks.

Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the Nifty 50 to 26,200. Nomura similarly sees the index at 26,140.

Even long-time cautious bears such as Bernstein's Venugopal Garre, who has been right in cautioning investors over rich valuations in the small and mid-cap sectors (SMID), are now rethinking their outlook.

"They've been in a bubble zone for a while — a point we've never hesitated stating," said Garre. "The reality is this: the SMID bubbles have let go of a lot of froth and are broadly valued in line with recent history. Not cheap, and not exorbitant."

And it's not just strategists, analysts and advisors turning around. Money managers are also echoing the same sentiment.

"A lot of people look at India and have said, 'Gosh, the valuations are enormous,'" said Andrew Dalrymple, chief investment officer at Aubrey Capital Management. "If you took that view, you'd never buy an Indian equity. You would have missed an enormous opportunity in the last five years."

Aubrey Global Emerging Markets Strategy, which manages more than $500 million in assets, has 35% of its fund allocated to India, its largest allocation.

"We try to reconcile valuation of the price earnings-to-growth ratio, and say when we look at an Indian company, it might nominally have that high P/E but we then say this is justified by price-to-growth ratio, which we try to keep at less than 1.5 times," Dalrymple added. "And that way, we find we have been able to exploit some extremely successful, very, very profitable investment opportunities over the years."

Dalrymple's sentiment is also reflected in the data. Foreign institutional investors have been net buyers of Indian equities over the past two months. Yet, it's off a low base, suggesting a significant upside in an ideal scenario.

Morgan Stanley's Desai noted that "foreign portfolios positioning is the weakest since we have had the data in 2000, and there are early signs that their view on India is shifting."

Amid all the sudden bullishness, however, many investors have learned a thing or two over the past year and are approaching with caution.

"This is likely to be a stock pickers' market, in contrast to one driven by top-down or macro factors since the Covid pandemic," Desai said in a note to clients on June 2.

Financials, often viewed as a leveraged bet on the future of a nation, appear to be a favorite among many.

In the large-cap space, Axis Bank was a top pick for Nomura and Goldman Sachs, with ICICI Bank seen favorably by Morgan Stanley, CLSA and JP Morgan.

India's economy expands more than expected. Gross domestic product in the quarter ended March grew 7.4%. That figure's much higher than the 6.7% expected by a Reuters poll of economists and the fastest rate of quarterly expansion for fiscal year 2025, according to government data released Friday. For the full fiscal year, India's economy expanded by 6.5%, in line with the government's February estimate.

U.S. authorities are reportedly investigating Adani's companies. Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn are looking into whether Gautam Adani's companies have been importing liquefied petroleum gas from Iran into India, according to the Wall Street Journal. A spokesperson for the Adani group "categorially denies" the allegations.

Reserve Bank of India expected to cut rates two more times. That's according to Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley, who said that the RBI should be comfortable with two more rate cuts in the current economic climate because India's "growth conditions will still be reasonable" and inflation is likely to remain below 4%.

Air travel by Indian nationals could cause the aviation industry to skyrocket. India is the third-largest air travel market in the world, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told CNBC's Monica Pitrelli at the World Air Transport Summit over the weekend. "So if Indians start traveling... at the intensity of China, it's going to absolutely explode in volume internationally," Wilson said.

The Nifty 50 has stayed absolutely flat, so far this week. The index has risen 4.7% this year.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield moved lower by 3 basis points compared to last week.

On CNBC TV this week, Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economics research at Standard Chartered Bank, said that India's fiscal fourth-quarter economic expansion was "much higher than anyone of us expected" because of growth in net indirect taxes. However, that number can "keep on fluctuating" and eventually fade, so India's gross domestic product will likely return to the trend of 6.5%. The bank's full-year forecast for India's financial year 2026 is 6.6%.

Meanwhile, APEC President of Marriott International Rajeev Menon said that India is "one of the most strategic markets in the world" for the hotel chain. Menon pointed out that occupancy growth is driven by secondary and tertiary cities as much as demand from bigger cities like New Delhi and Bangalore, which suggests that the India's rising middle class is a revenue opportunity for businesses.

India's central bank will announce its interest rate decision Friday, when it is expected to lower rates by 25 basis points to 5.75%, according to LSEG data. The country will also be releasing data on its consumer inflation rate for May next Thursday.

Meanwhile, Ganga Bath Fittings, a manufacturer of bathroom accessories, lists Wednesday.

Moving from New York City to London wasn't exactly a huge culture shock for me. The language and lifestyle are basically the same, and the only major differences I've noticed are the accent and currency.

However, since I moved in January, shopping for groceries has yielded some pretty big surprises.

From differences in business hours to product availability and placements, here are all the ways grocery shopping in the UK has thrown me for a loop.

I live in a big neighborhood just outside Central London and have five grocery stores within walking distance. So, it's not for a lack of trying when I say I haven't been able to find some of my favorite grocery items nearby.

I was shocked to learn that half-and-half just doesn't exist in the UK, especially because my then-boyfriend (now husband) had seemingly been preparing my morning coffee with it for years before my move.

Only after I expressed confusion about not being able to find it in the grocery store did I learn that he'd been mixing a custom blend of milk and cream for me all along.

I've also noticed that Italian sausage is harder to find. I evidently took for granted how prevalent and relatively inexpensive it was in New York, and even Michigan, where my parents live.

Of course, pork sausage is popular in the UK, but I've found that the versions available here (like the kind used in bangers and mash) are very different in texture and flavor.

Luckily for me, a local helped me find an Italian marketplace in Central London, where the sausages were excellent (and similar to what I had back home), just quite expensive.

Admittedly, I was spoiled by having access to a 24-hour grocery store in my New York City neighborhood.

I was accustomed to being able to pick up a few things on my way home from an evening out, or to occasionally capitalize on jet lag for some early morning shopping.

In London, I have to be more strategic — especially on Sundays.

If I want to visit a Lidl or Sainsbury's on a Sunday, I only have a short window to do so, as the shops typically open at 11 a.m. and close by 5 p.m. 

If you're wandering around the refrigerated aisles in a grocery store in the UK, you won't find any eggs.

Unlike in the States, eggs in the UK aren't sold refrigerated because of differences in the sanitization process. Instead, they're located on shelves, possibly near the baking supplies.

At first, I thought it was odd, but I quickly learned to adjust. I'm still keeping them in the fridge at home, though.

It seems like every time I visit the grocery store, I have to Google what exactly I'm looking for.

Anyone familiar with "fish and chips" knows that chips equal fries in the UK, but what about Doritos? Here, they're called crisps.

Meanwhile, zucchini is often called courgette and rutabaga is known as swede.

When I moved, I fully expected to adopt different brands of things like chips — sorry, crisps — and breakfast cereal.

What surprised me, though, was the differences in flavors available.

Cheerios are sold here, but they bear Nestlé's logo rather than General Mills and the primary flavors are honey and multigrain. Big yellow boxes of plain Cheerios are conspicuously missing — at least at my local supermarkets.

The main difference between the plain Cheerios I'm used to and the multigrain variety I often see here is that plain Cheerios are primarily made with whole-grain oats, while the multigrain variety is made with a combination of whole-grain oat flour, whole-grain wheat flour, and whole-grain barley flour. 

Meanwhile, Doritos still come in recognizable packaging, but some of the flavors have been renamed. Cool Ranch, for example, is called Cool Original in the UK, in part because Ranch dressing doesn't really exist here. Some other differences include portion sizes, ingredients, nutritional contents, and bag colors.

The most loyal fans of podcasts aren't just good listeners — they're paying customers.

While podcasters often earn money from advertisements that run during their episodes, many are finding success turning listeners into paid subscribers.

Patreon, a community subscription platform, has become a go-to tool for content creators with podcasts to do just that.

"Most podcast listeners and podcast fans are just familiar with Patreon," Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, host of the "Therapy for Black Girls" podcast, told Business Insider. Her podcast launched a Patreon in April.

Patreon now has more than 6.7 million paid memberships under the podcasting category, the company said. In April, Patreon announced a new partnership program with podcast networks like Amazon-owned Wondery and Sony Music.

Podcasting is also Patreon's highest-earning category. In 2024, podcasters on the platform collectively earned more than $472 million, Patreon told BI.

Patreon, which takes a cut of earnings from paid memberships ranging from 5% to 12%, isn't the only platform creators use to monetize their podcast audiences. A slew of community-focused platforms, like Mighty Networks and Fourthwall, offer tools around paid memberships. Larger social media platforms, such as YouTube and Discord, have also dabbled in paid memberships for creators.

BI spoke with the creators behind three podcasts that host memberships on Patreon. For each of them, maintaining a paywall around some of their content and offering perks like access to a Discord helps diversify their incomes.

"Because we get so much of our revenue through Patreon, we have a lot of leeway with the ads we get to choose," said Aiden McCaig, a cohost of "The Yard" podcast, which has over 412,000 subscribers on YouTube. "We say no to a lot of ad reads and a lot of companies that ask to work with us because we have the financial flexibility to do so."

Here's how three podcasts are using Patreon — and how much money they earn:

Note: Business Insider verified creators' earnings with Patreon.

What it is: "Therapy for Black Girls" is a podcast hosted by psychologist Dr. Joy Harden Bradford. The brand was founded in 2014 as a blog and launched a podcast in 2017, as well as a Facebook group and a network of therapists.

The podcast joined Patreon in April. Before moving to Patreon to host its paid community, the podcast used Mighty Networks. It also has a licensing partnership with iHeartMedia, which handles the podcast's advertising.

"Community really has always been at the heart of what we do with 'Therapy for Black Girls,' specifically with the podcast," Harden Bradford said.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $2,000 in May

How they do it: "Therapy for Black Girls" offers two tiers on Patreon — one is $10 a month and another is $14 a month. Paying members get access to ad-free versions of the podcast, as well as access to podcast episodes that aren't available elsewhere, such as its "So My Therapist Said…" series.

"We're definitely doing content release drops when there's a new episode of one of our segments," COO Ashley Cherry said. "But we're also posting outside of that … to get people talking in the comments to really cultivate a sense of community."

Its higher tier also unlocks more virtual events for its community, such as weekly check-ins where members can talk about their lives or do journaling prompts together. Members receive perks like early access to tickets for in-person events, merch, and giveaways.

What it is: "RedHanded" is a true crime podcast hosted by Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire, who are both based in the UK. The podcast launched in 2017 and joined Patreon the same year. Maguire told BI that if it weren't for the podcast's earnings on Patreon, she wouldn't have been able to quit her previous job to pursue podcasting full time.

"RedHanded" is part of the Wondery podcast network and gets paid a guaranteed minimum as part of its deal.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $59,000 a month

How they do it: "RedHanded" offers three tiers, which start at $4 a month and go up to $18 a month.

"We spent a long time, many years, really finessing the tiers that we now have on there and the way in which we monetize it," Bala said.

The lowest tier unlocks ad-free episodes that fans can listen to a day early, and access to audio episodes of the team's second podcast series, "Under the Duvet." The middle tier also unlocks a monthly bonus episode of "RedHanded" and a video version of "Under the Duvet." "RedHanded's" most expensive tier gives subscribers access to the podcast's full library of content.

"RedHanded's" Patreon accounts for about 25% of the podcasts' revenue now, Bala estimated.

What it is: "The Yard" is a podcast cohosted by four friends, including Twitch streamer Ludwig Ahgren. The podcast launched in 2021 and is one of the top podcasts on Patreon, with more than 58,000 members — about 37,000 of whom are paid subscribers. The Yard is part of The Roost podcast network.

How much they earn from Patreon: about $242,000 a month

How they do it: The Yard offers four tiers on Patreon, ranging from $5 to $69, which each unlock bonus episodes of the main podcast and access to the podcast's Discord group. Its higher tiers unlock exclusive shows, like one where two of the cohosts share commentary on Disney Channel Original Movies, as well as merch discounts.

"The main bonus episode is probably the root offer of what you're getting," McCaig said. "The community element grew a lot over time, and there are a lot of people that like the Discord community that we have, and that's probably a part of the reason that they keep their sub is so that they can be there."

McCaig said that compared to YouTube, where keeping viewers' attention can plateau over time, running a Patreon lets The Yard protect itself from user churn.

"Any superfan, once you convert them into a patron, is less likely to leave that than someone who watches your podcast for free sometimes on YouTube," McCaig said.

In 2021, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Atlanta-based game concept artist Jasmine James was trying to stay creative.

James, who runs the Instagram cosplay account Cutiepiesensei with over 500,000 followers, realized there wasn't much practical, anime-inspired clothing in the market. Anime-inspired fashion, she told Business Insider, was largely restricted to huge men's jackets or merchandise items that weren't wearable on a daily basis.

So James and her husband spent more than $30,000 of their savings to launch Fira X Wear, a swimwear brand that blends cosplay elements with practical apparel.

Since its initial launch, the brand's product range has expanded to include leisurewear. James left her game concept art job last year to focus on the brand full time.

Now, the Netflix of anime, streaming platform Crunchyroll, is collaborating with James to launch a clothing collection inspired by the "My Hero Academia" anime series. Crunchyroll has around 17 million subscribers globally, the platform told BI.

Fira X Wear's first drop, which has been in the making for a year, includes four items: a cropped jacket, a romper, a sweatshirt, and a pair of sweatpants. Two more product drops will follow.

"Anime fans love to wear their fandom on their sleeve — literally," Crunchyroll's global vice president of consumer products, Anna Songco Adamian, told BI.

"Fira X Wear and this collaboration is the culmination of all of that: professional design, craftsmanship, and fandom, blended into a wearable collection," Adamian said.

James was initially worried people wouldn't consider her brand a "serious business," given its pop-culture and cosplay-inspired roots. But she hopes that'll change — and that people will see how commercially viable anime is.

"I feel like people think it's kiddish or only a certain age group is into it, without realizing that a lot of us, especially people in my age group, grew up with anime," James, 32, said.

James said she didn't have a traditional fashion design background when she started her brand, apart from putting together her cosplay outfits.

But she had plenty of experience making skins — alternative outfits and designs — for characters in video games.

"I had to learn what colors and what silhouettes are visible from across the map. Because when you're playing, you have to be able to know who it is and know what their abilities are," James said.

"So it taught me just the importance of color and shape and how to kind of apply those things in interesting ways to real life," she added.

She said having experience with character design allowed her to "create things that are a little bit more unique than the average fashion drop."

When deciding on pricing, James said she wanted her brand to be premium but still affordable.

"When you initially go into anime or pop cultural merch, a lot of it can feel very cheap. On the other hand, you'll see very expensive designer launches. But everybody can't afford a $30,000 Gucci outfit to look like their favorite anime character," James said.

Fira X Wear's swimwear, including tops and bottoms, costs roughly $50 each, and the hoodies are around $110.

James hopes to expand her brand globally and design a collection of high-end pieces with more detailing.

"There are plenty of times where I'll go into full character concept artist mode, and I'm clearly creating something that would be extremely expensive to produce," James said.

For now, she's excited about her collaboration with Crunchyroll.

"To have them look at what I've been doing on social media and look at my designs and instantly be like, yeah, we want to put our names alongside that, it's a huge honor for me," James said.

NBA teams notched $1.62 billion in sponsorship revenue this season — an increase of 8% since last year, and 91% from $850 million five years ago, according to third-party data firm SponsorUnited.

While the volume of deals was up just 2.5% since last year, the partnerships got bigger and more strategic, per the NBA Marketing Partnerships Report 2024-2025 from SponsorUnited, which tracks global sports and entertainment sponsorships.

That haul is still shy, however, of the NFL, which had nearly $2.5 billion in team sponsorship revenue, a 6% increase from the prior season, according to SponsorUnited.

A key part of the NBA's revenue rise is the proliferation of sponsor patches on team jerseys, said Bob Lynch, founder and CEO of the data firm.

The number of jersey patch deals — commonplace in international soccer and increasingly popular in the NBA since their introduction in 2017 — more than doubled year over year last season. There were six first-time NBA jersey partners, contributing more than $80 million in new spending this year, according to the report. The deals typically run three years on average, Lynch said.

"It was sort of this mad dash to bring in these deals, which generate a lot of buzz and a lot of revenue," said Lynch. "These partnerships can be a quarter of a billion dollars of incremental revenue that was generated just from 11 deals that were sold. So it just shows the continued viability and interest in the NBA just on these jersey patches alone."

The 2024 opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome has also helped to drive up overall sponsorship revenue.

"Anytime these leagues have a big stadium that opens or an expansion team, it just adds so much revenue to the league," said Lynch.

"Between jersey patches and the Clippers' stadium, it was like the equivalent of bringing in three new teams to the league that generated revenue," he said.

There were 450 brands that entered NBA sponsorships for the first time this season. The most growth came from brands in the construction, alcohol and technology sectors, according to SponsorUnited.

Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase rank as the top-spending brands in the league, according to the report. Chase is the arena sponsor for the Golden State Warriors, while Rakuten has a patch on the team's jersey.

The sponsorship increase comes on the heels of the league's $77 billion media rights deal, in which games will be offered across Disney's platforms like ESPN, Comcast's NBC broadcast and Peacock, and Amazon's Prime Video beginning next season. The latest media rights deal shows a heavy emphasis on streaming and a broader expansion on broadcast TV.

Individual star players have beckoned some of the biggest endorsement deals, which didn't contribute to the team sponsorship total, but often serve as a gateway for brands to eventually strike deals with teams, said Lynch.

"What we're seeing is that players are almost becoming teams themselves in the number of sponsorship deals they have," said Lynch.

Initially, star players and their massive social media followings were considered a threat to overall league and team sponsorship revenue. Instead, they've provided a boost, said Lynch.

"It's created a larger ecosystem for brands to enter into the NBA space, sort of dip their toe in the water," he said.

Athletes often sign endorsement deals that can last just a few months, as opposed to team sponsorships that are longer term. The exception is generational players, like Steph Curry and LeBron James, who have the leverage for long-term deals.

This season the Philadelphia 76ers' Jared McCain signed 30 endorsement deals, the most by a player in a single season in NBA history, according to SponsorUnited.

Other top NBA athletes who led in endorsement deals include three New York Knicks players — Karl-Anthony Towns, Josh Hart and Jalen Brunson — who powered the team to the Eastern Conference finals this season.

The Golden State Warriors' Curry was also among the top-endorsed NBA players. Curry saw his business career trajectory change when he inked a deal with Under Armour in 2013, which was worth about $4 million per year, CNBC recently reported. In 2023 Curry extended the deal and received 8.8 million Under Armour shares, valued at $75 million at the time.

As a whole, the Warriors ranked alongside the NFL's Dallas Cowboys and MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers as part of a handful of U.S. teams tracking toward $200 million in annual sponsorship deals.

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke Thursday and agreed that officials from the U.S. and China will meet soon for more talks to resolve an ongoing trade war.

Trump said he had a "very good" call with Xi for about 90 minutes, which focused "almost entirely" on trade.

The call "resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

He said that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent the U.S. in the renewed trade talks.

Trade officials from the countries last met in May in Geneva, where they agreed to temporarily lower retaliatory tariffs on imports from each other's countries.

But the Trump administration has accused Beijing of slow-walking a pledge made in Geneva to approve the export of additional critical minerals, known as rare earths, to the United States.

Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and China's embassy in the U.S. said earlier Thursday that Trump had requested the call with Xi.

Trump has reportedly been eager to speak with Xi, as already-strained trade relations between the two countries frayed further in the past week.

After Thursday's call, Trump wrote, "There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products." He did not explain what that meant.

China has expressed deep frustration with a recent decision to impose new restrictions on Chinese student visas. It has also accused the Trump administration of undermining recent trade progress by issuing an industry warning against using Chinese semiconductors.

The Trump administration has also imposed additional export restrictions on chips. The White House claims the actions are required to protect national security, but Beijing views them as punitive.

Stocks seesawed Thursday morning on news of the call, which was first reported by Chinese state media.

The call "resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries," Trump wrote.

He also noted that he and Xi did not discuss any matters related to Russia, Ukraine or Iran.

The U.S. president added that Xi invited him and first lady Melania Trump to visit China, "and I reciprocated."

The impasse between the two economic superpowers — whose trade relationship totaled nearly $600 billion in 2024 — is weighing on Trump's broader tariff regime, which is already having a real-world impact.

Thursday's conversation was only the second time this year that the two leaders have held a one-on-one call. Trump and Xi previously spoke on Jan. 17, before the U.S. president's inauguration.

Ahead of the latest call, Trump praised Xi in a social media post that also betrayed his frustration.

"I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!" Trump wrote early Wednesday morning.

China has been a prime target of Trump's efforts to wield steep, unilateral tariffs for the stated goal of recalibrating America's trade relationships with the rest of the world.

Trump had ratcheted blanket tariffs on Chinese imports up to 145% in April, even as he temporarily lowered duties on most other countries to 10%. Beijing hiked tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% in retaliation.

The tariffs effectively led to a trade embargo. But that logjam appeared to shift in mid-May, after the talks in Geneva that both sides described as successful and productive.

Globant, a large tech consulting firm, just ripped up its traditional billing strategy to more fully embrace AI use cases and projects.

This is a trend I told you about back in April. The generative AI boom is pushing companies to adopt different pricing models, partly because the latest models have become so expensive to use.

This is already taking hold in the SaaS industry. Now it is beginning to happen in consulting.

Globant, an IT services specialist that competes with Accenture and other consulting firms, is rolling out AI Pods, a subscription for AI-powered offerings including software engineering, product definition, design, and testing.

Clients can subscribe monthly to an AI Pod, and each subscription includes token-based capacity, similar to how some leading AI labs structure usage.

Every time a company taps into a major AI model, the prompts and other requests are broken down into "tokens," the new language of generative AI, which have to be processed. When complex projects are handled this way, the cost of token processing can add up quickly, especially if newer, "reasoning" models are used.

Traditional consulting projects often come with time-intensive billing structures: work is scoped, employees are assigned, and hours are tracked to calculate what to charge clients. But in the world of generative AI, where outputs are driven by token-based usage and cost varies depending on the models used, the old approach could create misalignment between providers and clients.

"This is a departure from the traditional effort-based approaches," Globant CEO Martín Migoya explained, describing the move as a "radical departure from what anyone else in our industry is offering."

Globant's new AI Pods package this new reality into a managed-services model: for a monthly subscription fee, clients access a virtual workforce of AI agents supervised by Globant's human tech consultants. Each subscription comes with a certain number of tokens to use.

This is only a theoretical example and doesn't represent what Globant will actually charge clients, but you get the gist: A client might pay $20,000 a month and get 100 million tokens included in that subscription.

"My business is to create software for you, to create technology for you," Migoya added in an interview. "We're proposing a novel way of engaging, which is more connected to throughput rather than just the time and effort I'm consuming."

Migoya said the token limits are high, so Globant consultants and their clients have more than enough to get projects completed. If some customers blow through token allocations, Globant will work out solutions, but the goal is to keep pricing stable in this new generative AI era, while minimizing surprises, he explained.

He called it "streaming engineering," likening it to how we pay a monthly fee to stream Netflix movies and TV shows. Instead of spinning up custom teams for every client need, customers now subscribe to digital capacity.

Under the hood, the AI Pods are powered by Globant Enterprise AI platform, which taps into different leading AI models.

The firm also uses its own agent framework, CODA, which automates aspects of code generation, testing, and deployment while ensuring high-quality enterprise output. This approach lets Globant reuse existing software components, which reduces the need to ping the underlying AI models (reducing those token-processing costs!).

Globant says the new model is already being used by clients in finance, entertainment, and energy. Early adopters include oil and gas company YPF and holding company JM Family Enterprises.

While subscription-based and token-based models have caught on in the SaaS world, Globant's move is a signal that enterprise consulting may be heading the same way.

The largest consulting firms, including Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG, have been investing heavily in automation and AI over the past few years. Recently, Deloitte and EY announced new agentic AI platforms, both built in collaboration with Nvidia.

With AI redefining how software is built and deployed, billing just based on human time and effort may soon feel as outdated as dial-up internet.

In this article

Kimberly-Clark on Thursday struck a deal with Brazilian pulp maker Suzano to sell a majority stake in its international tissue business, valuing the business at about $3.4 billion, the Kleenex tissue maker said.

The deal, structured as a strategic partnership, will form a new joint venture in which Kimberly-Clark would hold a 49% stake, while Suzano will pay about $1.73 billion in cash for the 51% stake.

Suzano, which is one of the world's largest pulp makers, will have the option to purchase Kimberly-Clark's ownership interest under certain conditions, the Irving, Texas-based company said. The deal is expected to close in mid-2026.

Several consumer-facing companies, such as General Mills and PepsiCo, have ramped up strategic deals over the last year in a bid to boost growth and increase global exposure.

In September, General Mills divested its North American yoghurt segment for $2.1 billion to focus on faster-growing snacks and pet food business. PepsiCo bought tortilla-chip maker Siete Foods for $1.2 billion a month later.

Kimberly-Clark has also been simplifying its operations and reorganizing its business to cut costs and focus on more profitable parts, such as personal care and North America tissue segments.

In April, the Huggies diaper maker slashed its full-year profit forecast and said it would incur about $300 million tariff-related costs.

Kimberly-Clark on Thursday said it would contribute assets of its international family care and professional business, including 9,000 employees, to its new venture with Suzano and said the deal would reduce exposure to volatile input costs and stabilize margins.

The combined business entity would be incorporated in the Netherlands and include 22 manufacturing facilities located in 14 regions, such as Europe, Asia, Middle East, Central America.

As part of the JV, Kimberly Clark will retain its consumer tissue and professional businesses in the U.S. and its interests in existing joint ventures in Mexico, South Korea and Bahrain, among other countries.

The maker of Tide and Pampers plans to cut as many as 7,000 office jobs, or 15% of its non-manufacturing workforce, over the next two years.

Procter & Gamble revealed the job cuts in a presentation from the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference that was published on its website on Thursday.

CFO Andre Schulten and COO Shailesh Jejurikar gave the presentation, which outlined a two-year drive starting in the 2026 financial year to boost growth and value creation.

P&G said consumers faced greater uncertainty, competition was fierce, the geopolitical environment was unpredictable, and technology was rapidly transforming many aspects of our lives.

"We can unlock significant growth by better meeting the needs of currently unserved and under-served consumers, expanding into new segments, and growing markets to best-in-class levels," per the presentation.

The changes were an "intentional acceleration of the current strategy to widen P&G's margin of advantage in superiority, fueled by productivity, to win in the increasingly challenging environment in which we compete."

P&G plans to exit some categories, brands, and product forms in certain markets, saying it would reveal more details in the coming months.

The changes mean it expects to cut up to 7,000 non-manufacturing roles, or about 15% of that workforce, over the next two years. No further information about regions or sites was given in the presentation.

"Our top priority remains delivering balanced growth and value creation to delight consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners alike," it added.

P&G's proposed cuts are the latest in a swathe of corporate job reductions in recent months, as companies battle with economic uncertainty linked to Trump's tariffs and the potential impacts of AI.

The stock is flat over the past 12 months, valuing the company at $389 billion, and has gained 40% over the past five years.

P&G declined to comment beyond the presentation.

Electric Vehicles:

A cargo ship that was abandoned in the middle of the Pacific Ocean after catching fire Tuesday was carrying cars from several Chinese automakers, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Morning Midas was shipping around 3,000 cars from a range of manufacturers including Chery Automobile Co. and Great Wall Motor Co. to Mexico. It's unclear at this stage which brand's electric vehicle caught fire, the people said, who asked not to be identified discussing preliminary findings.

BERLIN — It was an impressive enough sporting feat when Serena Williams won a record 23rd Grand Slam singles title at the 2017 Australian Open, beating her sister Venus in the final. Soon after came a revelation: she had been pregnant at the time.

"I don't know how I did that, honestly," Williams said at an event Wednesday, selecting the moment as the most important of her tennis career. 

It's been quite the career — after winning her first Grand Slam at the U.S. Open in 1999, Williams went on to become the only player to have achieved the "Golden Slam" — winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open and getting an Olympic gold medal — in both singles and doubles tennis.

"I don't know what I was doing then, I was nine weeks pregnant ... I do remember not being able to run for a long time," Williams said at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin.

"I didn't tell anyone. I mean, Venus knew, and I still feel really bad about that, because a deep part of me feels like because we played each other in the final, I'm like, she must have known, and she must have felt some sort of deep heaviness to go even further and go all out. But she was only one of two people that knew."

Early pregnancy symptoms can be intense as the body undergoes a huge transformation, with a surge in hormones often leading to fatigue, breathlessness and nausea.

"I remember saying, I have to do a lot of aces, I have to do a lot of winners," Williams continued, referring to a point scored directly from a serve. "I can only play, like, four balls and I'm done."

"I remember one time playing a long point against one player, and I couldn't breathe. And I'm like, How does she not see that I'm not able to breathe right now, and so I just intentionally lost the next point just to kind of try and get my energy back. But then I was like: Why am I playing this far pregnant? This is nuts."

Williams, who has two daughters with investor and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, stepped back from professional tennis in 2022 to focus on her family. 

Sports stars such as cyclist Laura Kenny have spoken in recent years about the challenges of balancing an intense and physically demanding career with a desire to get pregnant, while tennis player Naomi Osaka has criticized public commentary that one must be sacrificed for the other.

Williams now runs venture capital fund Serena Ventures, which has 40 portfolio companies.

She told the packed audience of private equity professionals that the qualities that made her obsessed with winning in sports translated to a single-minded focus as an investor.

"I do remember at one point, walking on the court at Wimbledon, and my partner at the time called me about a deal that we were trying to close," she recalled.

"I was on Court One that day, and it's a really long walk. And I remember talking to her on the phone, and in the conversation, she's like ... How's your day going? I'm like: Well, I'm walking on the court right now. And she's just like: Are you kidding me? You have to get off the phone. I'm like, okay, it's fine. It's a long walk. I've done it before. So that's how intense, how intentional I am," Williams said.

She noted that she looks for founders who are obsessive about being the best at what they do and changing the lives of people they want to impact.

Her earliest investment was in the American football team Miami Dolphins in 2009, when she was the world's top-ranked female player.

"We got so many bad articles about why we shouldn't be doing this. We need to just focus on tennis, and we need to not think about this," she said of the reaction from the media and sporting world at the time.

"Now as an athlete, we're at the point where if you're only doing basketball or if you're only doing football, if you're only doing tennis, it's like, well, what else are you doing? So we gave people that platform to be like, it's okay. You can also be an entrepreneur, and you can do sport. You don't have to just stay in one lane, you know, and just do one thing."

Mary Jo Fairhead felt that something was missing at the South Dakota public schools where she taught for over a decade, so she quit and started one in her home.

The main challenge she's working to solve at her school, Onward Learning, which launched in 2022, is individual attention. She said each teacher has about 10 students. Schools nationally, by contrast, have an average of 15 students per instructor.

"We know every one of our kids on a very personal basis," Fairhead said. "I know when they walk through the door if something's off, and I need to check in with them."

Onward Learning is part of the growing "microschool" movement in the US. These schools have fewer than 20 students total on average and tend to employ an alternative learning environment that focuses on personalized lessons for each student. Demand for them is growing due to parents' desires to have a greater say in their kids' educations and have more options beyond the public schools in their district.

Their popularity comes as the Trump administration is seeking to expand school voucher programs and has proposed redirecting federal funds from public schools to private schools, which could boost microschools' resources.

Critics worry that the category is poorly defined — it could encompass a homeschool or a group facilitated by a teacher in a church, allowing for minimal state and federal regulation. Microschool advocates said kids learn best when education is tailored to best suit their needs.

"It's my opinion that this type of learning could be beneficial for any child, but especially those kids that just need a little more space, either space to learn, space to run, and just a little less pressure," Fairhead said. "If you're the type of parent who wants a very structured day, lots of testing, and all of that, then my type of school is probably not the right fit."

Given the lack of definition, it's difficult to predict the number of students enrolled in a microschool at any given time. The RAND Corporation, a nonpartisan research organization, said in a March report that "the best currently available estimate" for the number of kids enrolled in a microschool full-time is between 1 million and 2 million, with "many more" enrolled part-time. Some microschools partner with religious institutions for funding and other resources.

Fairhead said that her school enrolled 12 kids in its first year, and she just finished the third school year with 37 students from kindergarten through 8th grade and a "pretty long" waitlist. The days are typically structured with a few hours of learning core subjects in the morning, like science and math, and the rest of the day is focused on "experiential learning," like art, music, and outdoor activities.

She also incorporates Lakota language — the indigenous language of the reservation near the school — into the students' curriculum.

"If a child's struggling and they need something more personalized, we find it for them," Fairhead said. "Or if they're excelling and they need something that's going to challenge them more, we find that for them."

Interest in microschools started to grow during the pandemic as families looked for ways to keep students together while schools were closed, Paige Shoemaker DeMio, a senior analyst for K-12 education policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, told BI. She called it "a new version of a one-room schoolhouse."

The National Microschooling Center — a nonprofit that works to advance the microschool movement — released an analysis of the sector in May. Using data from interviews and online questionnaires with 800 microschools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the analysis said that 74% of microschools have annual tuition and fees at or below $10,000. It also said that 41% of microschools rely on state-provided school choice funds to operate.

Fairhead said that she partners with the local tribe for funding. She also received a $200,000 grant as a semifinalist of the Yass Prize, founded by billionaire Jeff Yass to award high-impact education initiatives.

Don Soifer, CEO of the National Microschooling Center, told BI that the majority of microschool founders and teachers also have certified teaching experience.

"Microschool leaders come from a background as experienced educators themselves who are excited at the opportunity for professional growth in no longer being bound by the requirements of the rigidities of a public school system," Soifer said.

Soifer added that the goal of microschools is not to replace the public school system. Rather, it's to give families another option where their kids can be in a much smaller setting, and parents can be more clued into what their child is doing on a day-to-day basis.

"We all have friends who are working in the public schools, making important progress on improving them, and more power to them for having the patience to do that," Soifer said, adding that he spent years doing the same. "But there are families that can't wait 20 years, 25 years for the public schools to make the improvements that are going to be able to help our kids who are in school right now."

Regulations for microschools vary by state. An analysis by the National Microschooling Center found that over half of microschools follow their state's homeschooling requirements, while the rest either follow their state's nonpublic school guidelines or operate in a state with a defined microschool statute.

West Virginia, for example, codified the legal definition of a microschool in 2022, which says that one or more teachers can create a school that charges tuition and is an alternative to public, private, and homeschool enrollment. Georgia codified the legal definition of a learning pod one year prior, which could include a microschool structure.

Having those legal definitions allows regulators to ensure microschools are meeting the necessary requirements, Shoemaker DeMio said — and the lack of definitions from other states raises concerns on how to best hold those schools accountable. Lack of accountability could give rise to misuse of funds and inability to track whether kids are effectively learning the curriculum, she said.

"If we have a way that we can categorize certain schools as microschools, then we're able to actually break down the data and we're able to better understand who these students are serving and what quality of education they're receiving or how they're achieving," she said.

Some microschools have been investigated for accusations of misusing funds. Arizona's attorney general launched an investigation in 2021 into a microschool company, accusing it of collecting charter school funding from the state without actually providing any curriculum. In West Virginia, the state's treasurer included a microschool in an investigation following complaints from parents that their tuition was not being used to teach their children.

Fairhead said that she doesn't think more regulations are necessary and that they could diminish teachers' passion. She said that parents hold her accountable: "They ask questions. They want to know what we're teaching and what our kids are learning. And I prefer them to be my accountability over somebody who doesn't know my kids, doesn't know our area, and doesn't know me."

Shoemaker DeMio said that absent clear guidelines, data on microschools and student outcomes will remain minimal.

"If we can get specific regulations and guidance at the state level, that would be really helpful. It can provide us with data so that we could better track the schools," she said. "But at the same time, it would also be helpful for people interested in starting microschools if they have a better understanding, if they have better guidance from the state on how to go about this."

Based on payrolls processing firm ADP's jobs report and the U.S. Federal Reserve "Beige Book," the United States economy appears to be slowing. The number of private sector jobs created in May rose by a mere 37,000, almost three times lower than the Dow Jones forecast. And the Fed report noted that "economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report" released April 23.

The ADP report, however, isn't always aligned with the Labor Department's jobs report, which will be released Friday. For example, the former stated that private companies added 107,000 jobs in January 2024, but the latter posted a 353,000 gain in nonfarm payrolls for the same period.

Meanwhile, the Fed's "Beige Book" report is based on "reports from Bank and Branch directors" and "interviews and online questionnaires." Hence, while it provides a useful snapshot of economic sentiment, it is a "qualitative" report, as the Fed acknowledges, that might not capture economic data.

According to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed at which an object is traveling depends on the position of an observer. Wednesday's reports can give an insight into the economy, but they could also be skewed by the vantage point of the observers.

Dow snaps consecutive gainsU.S. stocks were mixed Wednesday. The S&P 500 was flat and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.32%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.22%, ending a four-day winning streak. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.47% at 1:30 p.m. in Singapore as Asian technology stocks such as Meituan, Alibaba and Kuaishou Technology extended gains for a second session.

Slackening labor market in the U.S.Trump called on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to "LOWER THE RATE" after payrolls processing firm ADP reported the lowest level of private sector jobs creation in years. Payrolls increased just 37,000 for May, below the downwardly revised 60,000 in April and the Dow Jones forecast for 110,000. It was the lowest monthly job total from the ADP count since March 2023.

Fed's 'Beige Book' reports slowing U.S. economyThe U.S. economy has contracted over the past six weeks as hiring has slowed and consumers and businesses worried about tariff-related price increases, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday. In its periodic "Beige Book" summary of conditions, the central bank noted that "economic activity has declined slightly since the previous report" released April 23.

Circle prices its IPO higher than expectedCircle Internet Group, the issuer of USD Coin, one of the world's biggest stablecoins, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share late Wednesday stateside. That's above the expected range of $27 to $28 and gives the company a total market value of $6.8 billion. New York-based Circle, its founder and some original shareholders will raise $1.05 billion in the offering of 34 million shares. 

White House imposes travel banThe Trump administration signed a proclamation Wednesday suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Citing national security interests, the proclamation states that the identified countries lack sufficient vetting and screening processes, which could increase the risk of terrorism threats to America.

[PRO] Financial sector stocks slowingThe financial sector, seen as a potential winner of the Trump administration, is starting to cool. While the group is still outperforming the S&P year to date, the gap has been closing in recent weeks, wrote Wolfe Research analyst Rob Ginsberg, who highlighted one aspect of the sector that is the "most concerning."

Auto industry sounds the alarm as China's rare earth curbs start to bite

Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down because of China's recent export controls, according to Europe's auto supplier association CLEPA, which warned of more outages as inventories deplete.

CLEPA said Wednesday that while hundreds of export license applications have been submitted to the Chinese authorities since early April, only around 25% appear to have been approved.

China's Ministry of Commerce in early April imposed export restrictions on several rare earth elements and magnets widely used in the automotive, defense and energy sectors. The curbs came as part of a response to Trump's tariff increase on Beijing's products.

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, is doing something unexpected for one of the biggest names in tech: casually building web apps with AI coding assistants.

"I wish I could do more," Pichai said on Wednesday at Bloomberg Tech in San Francisco.

"I've just been messing around — either with Cursor or I vibe coded with Replit — trying to build a custom webpage with all the sources of information I wanted in one place. I could type a location and get it all," Pichai said.

The web app is "partially complete," he added.

"Vibe coding," coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in February, describes giving AI prompts to write code. As Karpathy puts it, developers can "fully give in to the vibes" and "forget the code even exists."

The rise of vibe coding has shaken the way people think about software development. It has left some engineers wondering if AI could put them out of a job and sparked debate among investors over whether technical skills are still a must-have for startup founders.

Tech giants like Amazon are also embracing vibe coding for workers' productivity. Business Insider's Eugene Kim reported on Wednesday that Amazon is in talks to adopt the AI coding tool Cursor for its employees.

It's also helping nontechnical people build apps. A Block product designer with no formal engineering training told BI she built a dog ID app in two months through vibe coding.

"It's exciting to see how casually you can do it now," Pichai said. "Compared to the early days of coding, things have come a long way."

"It feels so delightful to be a coder in this moment," he added.

A Google spokesperson declined further comment.

Asked whether software engineers are still needed in the age of AI coding tools, Pichai said, "I think so, yes."

The sentiment echoes a growing consensus among some tech leaders: AI may supercharge developers, but it won't replace them. Instead, it's shifting what the job looks like — from boilerplate coding to a more fluid and creative collaboration between human and machine.

Windsurf's CEO, Varun Mohan, said on a recent podcast that if AI can take over repetitive tasks like boilerplate coding, developers will be freed up to focus on what really matters — testing bold ideas.

Mohan said engineering is starting to look more like a research-driven culture, one in which developers test hypotheses, evaluate them, and get user feedback. Those are steps that make a product significantly better, he said.

Startups should never be hiring engineers to "quickly write boilerplate code," he added.

Other tech CEOs are issuing warnings about the future of the engineering profession. OpenAI's Sam Altman has said that demand for software engineers could eventually dip.

"My basic assumption is that each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while. And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers," he said in March, referring to OpenAI's hiring strategy.

He also predicted that AI-driven job displacement won't happen all at once but will accelerate over time.

"It kind of just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster," Altman said.

Shares of Circle (CRCL) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, opening at $69 a share in early trading. The stock at one point surged to as much as $100, more than 200% above the $31 price it had set the night before.

The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle's long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021.

Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg.

The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later.

Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC$101,461.56, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's shares seem to have stabilized around $80 to $83 per share. 

Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead.

However, Circle's core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they're moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance.

Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. The bank cited their growing role in digital payments, cross-border settlement and treasury management while also reinforcing the U.S. dollar's dominance globally.

Circle's IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure.

Is it 2021 all over again?

Circle (CRCL) debuted to wild upside action on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, its shares more than tripling from the IPO price of $31. The event was the culmination of a long journey for the USDC stablecoin issuer, which had been pursuing an IPO for several years.

For the crypto industry, it's certainly a win — a sign of strong traditional investor demand and that under the Trump administration, crypto native firms really do have a path to going public.

But cryptocurrencies themselves weren't enthused. Bitcoin BTC$101,982.18 slid more than 2% to $102,800, its weakest level in about a month, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) fell over 3%. Leading the selloff are tokens such as SOL, AVAX and AAVE, all lower by roughly 6%.

It's too early to tell whether the downtrend will persist in the short, medium or long term, but for industry veterans, it's hard not to see shades of another crypto IPO — that of Coinbase (COIN), which took place on April 14, 2021 and marked a then-epic top of $65,000 for bitcoin. Roughly two months following the COIN debut, bitcoin had plunged nearly 60% to about the $28,000 level.

A sharp autumn bounce in prices did have bitcoin again re-claiming that $65,000 level, but the selling quickly took hold once again. A brutal bear market ensued through late 2021 and throughout 2022, with bitcoin ultimately bottoming at around $15,000. Bitcoin wouldn't reclaim a fresh record price until March 2024, nearly three years after the Coinbase IPO.

Economist Henrik Zeberg believes that the most explosive phase of the altcoin market is about to kick off.

Zeberg tells his 182,800 followers on the social media platform X that the altseason, when altcoins outperform Bitcoin (BTC), is just getting started, and massive alt breakouts are likely to occur in the coming days.

He says the Ethereum (ETH/BTC) ratio is flashing bullish for altcoins, after increasing since tapping a local low in late April. Analysts often use the ETH/BTC ratio as an indicator of potential altcoin seasons.

“Altseason has already started. First slowly, later in a more explosive manner. I think we are max three to eight days away from the beginning of that explosive phase. ETH/BTC ratio tells us why… 

It is close to setting off in the explosive phase!” 

ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02478 BTC ($2,595) at time of writing.

Zeberg suggests that certain altcoins will start breaking out at different times.

“In the altseason it will be about identifying the next altcoin which is about to skyrocket. And then have an idea of how far it may run.” 

Among the alts the economist believes will soon print new all-time highs is Solana (SOL)-based memecoin dogwifhat (WIF).

“I maintain my extreme Bullish perspective on WIF.” 

In January, he suggested WIF could eventually hit $19.

WIF is trading for $0.86 at time of writing, down 9.9% in the last 24 hours.

Zeberg is also bullish on the Internet of Things (IoT) project Jasmy (JASMY).

The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for altcoins. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up.

“Ready for Jasmy's takeoff? We seem to be getting closer to the wave two bottom, little lower. Wave three should take Jasmy much much higher.” 

Jasmy is trading for $0.01413 at time of writing, down 4.8% on the day.

[June 5, 2025] – Venom Foundation, a leading provider of sovereign-grade blockchain infrastructure, issued a public invitation to central banks and financial regulators across Southeast Asia to co-develop compliant, future-ready digital financial systems aligned with national priorities and designed for regional interoperability.

Addressing institutions such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Bank Negara Malaysia, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the State Bank of Vietnam, the Foundation outlined its vision for a sovereign-compatible Layer-0 blockchain that can support cross-border payments, real-time settlements, and regulatory transparency at scale.

“We are pioneering the future of financial infrastructure,” said Christopher Louis Tsu, CEO of the Venom Foundation. “Our mission is to empower governments and institutions through next-generation blockchain technology, strengthening their sovereign capabilities and unlocking new opportunities for their citizens.”

Southeast Asia has become one of the world's most dynamic financial corridors. In 2023, the Philippines alone accounted for 4.75% of global remittance inflows, while digital payment volumes in the region are expected to reach 765 billion transactions by 2027. However, despite this rapid growth, financial systems remain fragmented. Payment networks operate in isolation, settlements are delayed, and reconciliation often depends on outdated, manual processes. These inefficiencies drive up costs, slow innovation, and limit oversight for regulators.

Venom Foundation views this as a strategic opportunity for governments in the region to modernize their infrastructure using blockchain technology built specifically for the public sector. The proposed shared Layer-0 blockchain is already live and is designed to meet institutional-grade requirements and regulatory standards.

The infrastructure currently supports a range of public-sector use cases. One of the core applications is stablecoin issuance, starting with a USD-backed digital currency USDV, with further plans to introduce local currency-based stablecoins across Southeast Asia. The platform is fully compatible with ISO 20022 messaging standards, ensuring seamless integration with existing banking systems and regulatory frameworks.

In the Philippines, pilot programs are already underway in collaboration with local financial institutions. Broader regional deployment is planned for 2025, focusing on a dedicated cross-border payment and settlement layer. This layer is designed to facilitate stablecoin transfers between government and banking entities, enhancing transaction speed, transparency, and system resilience.

The governance structure behind this initiative ensures that national institutions retain oversight, with partial validator control delegated to designated public-sector entities. This approach combines the efficiency of decentralized infrastructure with the oversight and trust required by regulators.

To support implementation, Venom offers modular infrastructure components that can be tailored to each country's economic and regulatory goals. These include digital identity and compliance layers with on-chain KYC/AML systems, real-time analytics APIs for regulators, tokenization capabilities for real-world assets such as land titles and carbon credits, and structured training programs for government teams and developers.

The company now invites central banks and regulatory institutions across Southeast Asia to explore pilot initiatives and strategic collaboration. The goal is to establish the digital financial infrastructure that reflects the values of sovereignty, inclusion, interoperability, and resilience, setting the standard for next-generation public finance systems in the region.

Venom Foundation provides blockchain infrastructure tailored for sovereign and institutional adoption. Headquartered in Abu Dhabi, Venom is focused on building compliant, scalable systems that align with national and regional priorities across Asia and beyond.

The parents of the man allegedly held captive and tortured by crypto bros in Manhattan got regular updates saying he was OK, The Post has learned.

Italian national Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, 28, was allegedly held from May 6 to 23 in a luxury apartment on Prince Street for by John Woeltz and William Duplessie, who stand charged with tying up Carturan and torturing him for his digital wallet containing an estimated $28m in digital currency, according to cops.

However, sources in Italy say through the apparent kidnap “Michael's phone and his parents exchanged messages on WhatsApp,” although sources pointed out it was possible the alleged kidnappers had been sending the messages so as not to raise the alarm.

Carturan's reclusive parents, Maurizio and Lidia, only learned of the kidnap on May 25 when a family friend, Pietro Zucchetti, informed them, according to sources.

However, the family were seemingly on high alert and had recently hired private security, according to a source, who also said they had put their $1m home in Rivoli, near Turin, up for sale.

New York prosecutors have also said they believe the lives of Carturan's family in Italy had been threatened during the kidnapping period.

Maurizio confirmed to Italian newspaper La Repubblica he had recieved texts he assumed were from his son through the ‘kidnap' period.  

A neighbor told The Post Carturan has recently started travelling around the world a lot, although they said they had no idea what line of business he was in.

Carturan had previously worked on Zucchetti's farm, and he described him as a “curious young man, not one to seek out trouble.”

Videos which show Carturan seemingly partaking in parties at the house and talking about drugs were published this week by TMZ, although in some videos he appears to be restrained to a wheelchair or led by a leash around his neck. Reports also say he was monitored with an Apple AirTag around his neck to ensure he didn't leave the house.

No missing person report was filed by Carturan's family, who were shocked when they found out what had happened to him and immediately went to ground. They declined approaches for comment from The Post.

Carturan's father Maurizio – an author who has written 10 books about alchemy and spirituality – deleted all of his social media accounts and closed the family's shop selling herbal remedies.

The parents then traveled to New York, where they met with the Italian Consul General in New York. His deputy took them to see Carturan at the local District Attorney's Office, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Post.

The Italian Consul General said it is working with US authorities in the case and assisting them in matters of the Carturan family.

Carturan escaped from the alleged ordeal on May 23 and flagged down a nearby traffic cop. He was taken to hospital, where he was treated for injuries sustained from allegedly being pistol-whipped, dangled from the top of a staircase, urinated on and having his arms and legs cut with a chainsaw. Woeltz was arrested the same day, Duplessie a few days later.

Woeltz, dubbed the Crypto King of Kentucky, is said to have a private jet and live a high octane party lifestyle alongside Duplessie.

They are both held in custody on charges including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, assault and weapons possession.

At Duplessie's arraignment last week his lawyer claimed the criminal case will “begin to unravel” as more details come out.

“The facts here are hotly disputed, his involvement is hotly disputed,” attorney Sanford Talkin told the judge during the hearing.

 Ethereum OG Ryan Berckmans explains Ethereum's new strategy and what it could mean for ETH's future price action. 

Ether (ETH) is back in the spotlight, surging nearly 50% in the past month and outpacing most other major crypto assets. But what's really fueling this dramatic comeback? And is it sustainable?

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Ethereum OG and investor Ryan Berckmans lifts the curtain on a pivotal shift inside the Ethereum ecosystem.

For years, Ethereum's strategy revolved around a rollup-centric roadmap, focusing on layer-2 scaling while largely sidelining the base layer. Insiders are now talking about a “moment of reckoning,” one that has given way to a rebalanced strategy between layer-1 and layer-2 growth.

“It really wasn't until earlier this year when the price action got so unbelievably poor [...] that seriously wealthy and seriously influential Ethereum folks close to the heart of the community — Vitalik [Buterin, Ethereum co-founder] included — looked at this moment and said, ‘Oh my God, we never thought it could get this bad,'” Berckmans said.

This reality check sparked a strategic reset, already showing signs of renewed cohesion, narrative strength, and clear leadership from Ethereum's core figures.

Looking ahead, Berckmans sees a massive opportunity on the horizon. With Ethereum increasingly positioned as the foundation for future global onchain economies, he says the value of ETH could skyrocket.

“In the years to come, onchain economies are going to get 1000x bigger than they are today [...] and that's really going to drive Ether at 20K, 50K, 80K in the coming years,” he said.

What missteps triggered this change, and could ETH really reach those bold price targets? Get the full story in our exclusive interview, now live on Cointelegraph's YouTube channel. Don't forget to like and subscribe to stay ahead of the curve in the crypto space.

Bitcoin and other altcoins continued their downward trend on Thursday as the recent bullish momentum faded.

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Some of the top laggards were altcoins like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), Jupiter (JUP), and Ethena (ENA).

Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said:

“After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.”

Ryan added that the ongoing geopolitical developments like trade tensions from the US had contributed to market uncertainty and triggered a risk-off sentiment. He added that:

“While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. Investor sentiment is being recalibrated in response to these developments.”

Historically, Bitcoin tends to pull back after reaching a key resistance level, often triggering a broader correction across altcoins. For example, BTC hit a record high of $108,335 in December before retreating to $88,987 in January. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month.

Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound. On the daily chart, BTC is gradually forming a bullish flag pattern — characterized by a steep vertical rally (the flagpole) followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel (the flag). This setup is typically viewed as a continuation pattern.

Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the recent pullback forming the handle section. The cup features a depth of approximately 30%, or 34,000 points.

Using standard technical analysis, the target for a cup-and-handle breakout is calculated by adding the cup's depth to its upper boundary. In this case, adding $38,000 to the top of the pattern yields a projected target of $146,000.

Key takeaways:

ETH futures show weak bullish sentiment despite strong ETF inflows.

More upside appears limited due to weak network activity and competitors like Solana.

Ethereum's decreasing TVL contrasts rising fees

Ether ETHUSD has struggled to reclaim the $2,700 mark despite an 8% gain between June 2 and June 4. Although the price gained 48% between May 5 and June 5, further upside appears limited due to some weak network activity and rising competition. 

Total deposits on the Ethereum network, measured by total value locked (TVL), fell to 25.1 million ETH on June 5, marking a 17% decline from the previous month. Ethereum still leads in total deposits, but Solana's TVL rose 2% during the same 30-day span, reaching 65.8 million SOL (SOL). This suggests that Ethereum's edge over rivals is gradually eroding.

Key contributors to Ethereum's TVL decline include Sky (formerly MakerDAO), which dropped 48% to 2.1 million ETH, and Curve Finance, down 24% to 1.1 million ETH. 

However, this overlooks the fact that average network fees on Ethereum climbed 150% month-over-month. This fee increase amplifies the protocol's burn mechanism, reducing ETH's inflationary pressure.

DEX activity rises, but Solana beats Ethereum by volume

One driver behind the higher fees is the surge in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Uniswap has handled more than $2.6 billion in daily volume so far in June, compared to $1.65 billion in early May. 

Although this trend supports Ether's price, rival networks like BNB Chain and Solana have expanded their share of DEX activity. Currently, Ethereum ranks third in this segment.

BNB Chain led in DEX volume growth, though this advantage is less significant due to the network's extremely low fees. Lower costs make it easier to artificially inflate activity, making comparisons with Solana and Ethereum somewhat misleading. 

Even after adjusting for this distortion, however, Solana's DEX volume has surpassed Ethereum's. This shift raises questions about whether ETH still maintains a competitive edge. 

Notably, top-performing decentralized applications like Hyperliquid and Pump are choosing to launch their own blockchains instead of building on Ethereum layer-2 solutions or using alternatives such as Solana.

ETH futures show a lack of bullish conviction

Futures markets for Ether offer insight into professional traders' sentiment. In balanced conditions, monthly ETH contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% annualized premium to reflect the extended settlement period.

As of June 5, the Ether futures premium dropped to 5%, down from 6% a week earlier. This signals a slight reduction in leveraged long positions, though the premium remains within a neutral range. More importantly, the last time ETH futures traded above a 10% premium was in late January, suggesting a persistent lack of bullish conviction.

On the positive side, institutional interest in ETH has grown, reinforcing support near the $2,500 level.

Thus, concluding that institutional demand for Ether is waning would be inaccurate. Between May 22 and June 4, US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted $700 million in net inflows. Notably, there hasn't been a single day of net outflows in that three-week period, reinforcing the strength of the $2,500 support level.

Thus, while demand for ETH remains, particularly from institutions, other metrics suggest that the bulls will probably be unable to break $3,000 in the near term.

Programmable contract on blockchain

While the spotlight in Web3 remains fixed on ETFs, token listings, and stablecoin frameworks, a quieter but equally consequential evolution is taking shape at the edge of global commerce. In the last six months alone, the Bank for International Settlements expanded its cross-border wholesale CBDC pilot, Project mBridge, to include over 26 observing members. Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore extended Project Guardian, testing tokenized trade finance and digital asset settlement with banks including JPMorgan, DBS, and Standard Chartered. Hong Kong Monetary Authority also launched Project Ensemble to develop innovative financial market infrastructure enabling seamless interbank settlement of tokenised money, initially focusing on tokenised deposits to support the growth of Hong Kong's tokenisation market.

On the protocol side, DeFi-native projects like Centrifuge are tokenizing invoices and short-term credit, while firms like Enclave Markets are developing encrypted execution environments for confidential trading. These aren't isolated experiments - they're signs of a maturing thesis: that programmable finance can redefine the foundations of international trade.

Today's trade infrastructure is a patchwork of legal fictions and trust intermediaries - letters of credit, bills of lading, third-party guarantees - many of which exist solely to simulate trust. Each one adds friction, cost, and settlement lag. Blockchain-based systems flip that dynamic by anchoring records on cryptographically secure, shared ledgers.

This is more than just a technical upgrade. As David Wells, CEO of Enclave Markets, puts it: “When counterparties from different jurisdictions can rely on cryptographically secured records rather than opaque intermediaries, the trust barrier that typically adds friction and cost to international trade diminishes significantly.” He adds that, “At Enclave, we use secure enclave technology to enable privacy-preserving verification. This means counterparties can validate critical deal terms or performance metrics without exposing sensitive business data. It's a foundational shift - you get transparency and confidentiality at the same time, something legacy systems just aren't built for.”

Where platforms like the now-defunct TradeLens stumbled due to governance limitations, decentralized or privacy-preserving infrastructure offers an alternative. Enclave, for instance, uses secure enclave hardware to enable private yet verifiable trades - part of a broader movement that includes confidential computing platforms and zero-knowledge middleware.

Beyond data transparency, programmable finance introduces automatic enforceability. Smart contracts don't just log terms - they execute them. When conditions are met (e.g., delivery confirmed via oracle or IoT sensor), payment flows instantly. If conditions fail, penalties or reversions execute without legal intervention.

This mechanism is already live in parts of the DeFi world. MakerDAO and Centrifuge have deployed real-world asset vaults tied to tokenized invoices and short-term credit. As reported, Maker's RWA vaults now account for a significant share of its fee income.

Denis Petrovcic, CEO of Blocksquare, frames it this way: “Banks shift from paperwork gatekeepers to liquidity nodes, and insurers underwrite only risks the code can't cover.” He continues: “In our real estate tokenization work, we've shown how anchoring legal agreements - like mortgage registration or loan collateralization - on-chain creates enforceable economic rights that are provable in real time. This reduces the need for buffer escrows and limits disputes. When you apply this to cargo or trade finance, it's easy to imagine similar benefits.” His company recently completed one of the first legally notarized tokenized real estate deals tied to a national land registry - a model that could extend to warehousing, shipping hubs, and other trade-linked assets.

The Dubai Land Department (DLD) has also launched the MENA region's first government-backed tokenized real estate platform, Prypco Mint, which enables fractional ownership of Dubai properties by minting real estate title deed tokens. This is supported by Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), marking the first time a government real estate authority in the Middle East has implemented a public blockchain-based tokenization of property title deeds, pioneering a more accessible, transparent, and efficient real estate market.

Perhaps the most profound shift is this: trade agreements, once enshrined in legalese and negotiated by diplomats, are now being expressed as code.

Project mBridge envisions programmable cross-border CBDC rails. MAS' Project Guardian is piloting asset tokenization and real-time DvP with institutional players. And emerging trade finance platforms are layering compliance, risk, and audit rules into smart contracts rather than spreadsheets.

This isn't hypothetical. “We're already seeing smart contracts do things that used to take banks days or weeks to handle,” says Nicolas Vaiman, CEO of Bubblemaps. “Instant escrow, peer-to-peer lending, collateral management. The technology simply offers more. And we're just scratching the surface - as more data sources and real-time proofs come online, I think blockchain-based finance will become the default operating system for trade, not an optional enhancement.”

The results: fewer intermediaries, faster time to cash, and real-time visibility across jurisdictions.

For decades, the global trade system relied on institutional credibility: the issuing bank, the national regulator, the trusted auditor. But programmable finance rewires that system to depend on logic, not legacy.

To be clear, this transition is still in its early innings. Regulatory coordination, technical standards, and enterprise integration remain uphill challenges. But the pieces are aligning: on-chain attestation, tokenized RWAs, fiat-backed stablecoins, and decentralized identity protocols are rapidly evolving into an interoperable trust stack.

The result isn't just digitized trade. It's a new form of enforceable, exportable trust—written in code, and verified on-chain.

The US president is leveraging his position for personal gain by exploiting an industry known for lack of transparency and fraud

Throughout his business career, Donald Trump sought new ways to leverage his name to make easy money. He ran an airline, a university and a winery. Thanks to The Apprentice show that made him a reality TV star, the US president slapped his name on real estate projects around the world built by other companies – along with Trump-branded steaks, vodka, deodorant and bottled water. Many of these businesses ultimately failed, but Trump rarely invested his own funds and he still walked away with hefty licensing fees.

Today, as the most powerful person in the world, Trump has found perhaps the easiest way to profit off his name: cryptocurrency. Days before his inauguration for a second term on 20 January, Trump's family business launched a meme coin, called $TRUMP, which is a type of digital currency often connected to an online joke or mascot. It has no inherent value beyond speculation. The coin quickly soared in value up to $75 per token, but it crashed days later. No matter the ultimate price, Trump and his family rake in millions of dollars in fees as the coin is traded by speculators hoping to turn a quick profit, or those trying to curry favor with him.

It's difficult to keep up with all the ways that Trump is corrupting the US presidency and using it for personal profit, but his crypto ventures are among the most dangerous because they potentially allow him and his family to collect hundreds of millions of dollars from foreign investors and governments that would normally have a harder time funneling money to a US politician. Thanks to the meme coin and other deals, the Trump family's wealth increased by nearly $3bn in the last six months. Trump has proven himself the most successful president – at monetizing the presidency.

While he is exempt from conflict of interest laws that ban federal employees from profiting off their positions, every US president since the 1970s had voluntarily abided by these rules – until Trump. Previous occupants of the White House either sold their financial holdings or set them aside in blind trusts. But in his first term, Trump refused to divest from his business empire, which is mostly centered around the Trump Organization and is still managed by his sons.

Since Trump's first term, his family business has also evolved beyond a real estate conglomerate that licenses the Trump name to hotels, luxury towers and golf courses around the world, earning millions of dollars in branding and management fees without investing its own funds in most projects. The business now includes a portfolio of social media and crypto ventures, providing Trump with new ways to profit from being in office. And Trump is more emboldened to ignore norms set by past presidents, thanks to a compliant Congress led by Republicans and a US supreme court ruling last year which gave Trump “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his official acts as president.

Trump's foray into cryptocurrency underscores the ways he can leverage the presidency for personal gain by exploiting his sense of impunity and an industry that is notorious for fraud and a lack of transparency. After the value of his meme coin collapsed, Trump's crypto venture announced in April that the 220 largest buyers of the token would be invited to a private gala dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club, while the top 25 buyers would get access to a VIP reception with Trump and a White House tour. Once that contest was underway, the $TRUMP coin got a new round of media attention and its value jumped by more than 50%. The more people bought the token, the more Trump and his family profited from crypto transactions that are usually shrouded in anonymity. Since the meme coin's launch in January, Trump-affiliated businesses received $312m from crypto sales and $43m in other fees, according to a Washington Post analysis of trading data.

Of course, US presidents for decades have used private dinners and gatherings to grant special access to wealthy donors and raise funds for their political parties or their own campaigns. But campaign contributions carry legal restrictions on how they can be spent, and US donors can't remain anonymous and must disclose all of their donations to political candidates. The sweepstakes dinner organized by Trump's crypto business was not a fundraiser or campaign event – it was a gathering arranged to directly enrich him and his family.

Beyond the inherent conflict of Trump doing business within an industry that he has immense power to regulate as president, Trump also opened himself up to foreign influence as his meme coins became a vehicle for foreign actors to funnel money to his family. While Trump's crypto business has refused to release a list of those invited to last month's dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, media organizations compiled lists of attendees that included foreign citizens who would normally be forbidden from donating funds to US politicians. (The Washington Post found that nearly half of the top 220 Trump meme coin holders purchased their coins from crypto exchanges that reject US-based customers, meaning they are likely foreign buyers. And 19 of the top 25 buyers, who were invited to a VIP reception with Trump before the dinner on 22 May, and a “special tour” the next day, had bought coins from similar exchanges.)

The best-known foreign investor who attended Trump's dinner was Justin Sun, a Chinese billionaire who founded the crypto platform Tron and had spent more than $20m on the president's meme coins, earning him the distinction of being the contest's top buyer. In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Joe Biden's administration, charged Sun with fraud and market manipulation. But a few weeks after Trump took office, the SEC asked a federal court to pause its lawsuit.

What could be behind the SEC's change of heart about pursuing charges against Sun under the second Trump administration? Sun is one of the top investors in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture launched by Trump's family in September. After Trump won the November election, Sun bought $75m in World Liberty tokens, and he was named an adviser to the company.

World Liberty is at the heart of another foreign entanglement – and potential conflict of interest – for Trump and the crypto industry. On 1 May, the president's son Eric and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy), announced that an investment fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi would invest $2bn using a stablecoin – a form of digital currency – offered by World Liberty. That transaction could eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the president and his family.

Years before he got into the business, Trump had dismissed cryptocurrencies as “a scam” which have values that are “based on thin air”. But Trump changed his tune dramatically when he met with the highest-paying customers of his personal meme coin at last month's dinner. “The past administration made your lives miserable,” Trump told his guests, referring to a Biden administration crackdown on crypto companies. And then the president promised to do things differently: “There is a lot of sense in crypto. A lot of common sense in crypto.”

Already, the Trump administration has been pushing to deregulate the industry and in April instructed the justice department to disband a unit that focused on investigating crypto-related fraud. Last year, a federal judge sentenced Sam Bankman-Fried, who founded the now bankrupt FTX crypto exchange, to 25 years in prison for perpetuating one of the largest financial frauds in modern history, and bilking his customers out of billions of dollars.

Once Trump dismantles regulation and law enforcement of the industry, he has promised to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”. And the president will continue to enrich himself and his family along the way.

Oops, something went wrong

Trump Media and Technology (DJT) took a key step toward launching a publicly traded crypto investment product Thursday morning.

The newly formed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF business trust filed its S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to register the new exchange-traded fund licensing Trump Media's social media brand. The ETF will trade on the NYSE Arca.

Thursday's filing is a significant step for Trump Media's move into the cryptocurrency space.

The media company, of which President Trump is a majority stakeholder, announced in January it was expanding into financial services and would offer investment products through a newly created fintech platform, Truth.Fi.

Last week, Trump Media said it will spend $2.32 billion to create a bitcoin treasury, issuing equity to fund the initiative. The move follows the trend of companies across various sectors adding bitcoin to their balance sheets to try to replicate the success of crypto advocate Michael Saylor's company Strategy.

The Trump administration has ushered in a friendlier stance toward cryptocurrency than that of Trump's predecessor, President Biden.

Trump announced the creation of a national strategic bitcoin reserve earlier this year. The president appointed venture capitalist David Sacks to a newly created White House role of crypto czar, and his pick for SEC chair is well-known crypto lawyer Paul Atkins. Under Trump's administration, the Atkins-led SEC dropped investigations into Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and other crypto firms as Trump looks to reverse the Biden-era clampdown on fraud in the sector.

The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) is up nearly 50% over the past year and rose as high as over $109,000 in January. But the price also plummeted below $80,000 in April as Trump's trade war roiled the stock market before it recovered again.

Trump Media stock fell 2% Thursday morning and is down 54% over the past year.

The new Truth Social Bitcoin ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital — a New Jersey-based affiliate of asset manager Yorkville Advisors — and will track the price of the cryptocurrency. Crypto.com is both the custodian and liquidity provider for the ETF, meaning it safeguards as well as buys and sells the cryptocurrency.

Truth Social, Crypto.com, and Yorkville America Digital first announced a partnership to launch a series of exchange-traded funds in March.

Earlier this week, NYSE Group submitted regulatory paperwork to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF.

Players can check each game's outcome through algorithms instead of trusting the casino blindly. The system creates a cryptographic hash for the result before the game starts. Players can then check if this hash stayed the same after the game ends, which proves no one tampered with the outcome. Traditional casinos never offered this level of verification. AdvertisementSmart contracts also handle gambling processes automatically without human involvement. These self-executing contracts manage everything from how games work to paying out winnings based on clear conditions. So the chances of operators interfering or manipulating results are almost zero.The benefits are clear, blockchain replaces trust in operators with math and cryptographic proof. This fundamental change enables players to see everything clearly in the iGaming world.

Casinos using blockchain are different - they only need a digital wallet. This simple change makes sensitive information much safer. AdvertisementPlayers don't share bank details or personal ID. Instead, transactions link to digital wallet addresses. This extra privacy helps players in places with strict gambling rules.Preventing Fraud and TamperingBlockchain technology creates records that no one can change or reverse. Smart contracts make the system even safer. These self-executing agreements live in the blockchain and run without human input. They control how games work, handle payouts, and process player transactions based on set rules. This removes any chance of manipulation.Faster and Safer Crypto PaymentsPlayers using blockchain gaming platforms get their money almost instantly, unlike traditional methods that take days. Cryptocurrency also solves the chargeback problem that plagues credit card transactions. Once the blockchain confirms a payment, it stays final.

Cardano has made a big leap in the gaming world with its new plugin that allows direct integration with Unreal Engine 4 and 5. This means blockchain can be embedded into real-time gaming environments, opening up new possibilities for game creators.

By bridging Cardano's blockchain with Unreal Engine, developers can now put on-chain assets directly into 3D worlds, creating decentralized gaming ecosystems.

Key features unlocked by this integration include token gated game experiences, native wallet interactions within games and decentralized in-game marketplaces. These features not only enhance gameplay but also give players true ownership of in-game items secured on the blockchain.

The gaming industry is growing fast and blockchain platforms are trying to combine decentralization with interactive entertainment. Cardano's plugin addresses the growing demand for GameFi – the fusion of gaming and decentralized finance – by supporting wallet and transaction functionality inside Unreal Engine. It's still early days but this integration has huge potential for mainstream adoption.

GameFi tokens like Immutable, GALA and The Sandbox have surged in 2025, the market is interested. Cardano's plugin will also support NFT and token projects, developers can embed unique blockchain assets into their games. This means emerging tokens like SNEK meme coin can gain relevance in gaming.

This integration puts Cardano as a top contender in blockchain gaming, giving developers the tools to build richer, decentralized gaming worlds. Its interoperability with Unreal Engine makes it easier to design games with blockchain secured assets, marketplace transactions and token gated content.

Other blockchain platforms like Pi Network are also entering the gaming space but Cardano's focus on developer experience and real-time interactions gives it an edge. Key benefits include:

As Web 3.0 gaming takes off, Cardano's plugin will accelerate adoption and bring blockchain gaming to the mainstream.

06/05 update below. This post was originally published on June 04

Bitcoin has surged over the last year, propelled higher by Wall Street's embrace of crypto and U.S. president Donald Trump's support (despite Google revealing a serious BlackRock bitcoin nightmare just got a lot worse).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin last month, surging 50% from its April low and helped by U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction.

Now, as the Covid-era meme stock craze turns to bitcoin, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has restarted his campaign against out-of-control U.S. government spending, backing a warning that bitcoin could “take over” from the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency.

“If the electorate doesn't hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk.

“I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.”

06/05 update: Elon Musk's endorsement of Armstrong's warning comes at a time of increased pressure on the U.S. dollar, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the U.S. dollar will fall to levels not see since the Covid pandemic this year, pushed down by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the rise of rival currencies.

"We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges," the strategists wrote in a note seen by Business Insider, adding they expect the dollar to fall 9% over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index.

JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has added to fears, predicting spiraling U.S. debt may create a "tough time" for the bond market as spreads widen.

"If people decide that the U.S. dollar isn't the place to be, you could see credit spreads gap out; that would be quite a problem," Dimon said during an interview with Fox Business.

“It does feel like we're entering into a more secular downturn for the dollar,” Peter Vassallo, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management who focuses on currencies, told MarketWatch. “The worst-case scenarios surrounding tariffs have been reduced. But the broad ideas around U.S. policy being more volatile and more hostile to foreign trade — that hasn't gone away.”

Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump's second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump's signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump's administration.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.'s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion.

"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.”

Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.”

Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation.

Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that's often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt.

Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that's propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies.

“As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we're going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments.

“With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it's fast becoming the new safe haven.”

            Stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream, analysts say, as a landmark regulatory bill makes its way through Congress.
    


            The Senate is deliberating the GENIUS Act, which would provide a framework for regulating stablecoins. The bill last week passed a major procedural hurdle in the Senate after initial resistance from some Democrats.
    


            Stablecoins are a type of crypto asset that is tied to the value of another currency, such as the US dollar or gold. They were initially created as a way for crypto investors to store their money but have grown in popularity in recent years for their use in digital payments.
    


            The landmark bill would provide a boost of legitimacy to the crypto industry and is another example of how cryptocurrencies have had a major revival under President Donald Trump's second term.
    


            Proponents of crypto have welcomed the focus on advancing stablecoin regulations. Yet critics have pointed to the Trump family's ties to the crypto industry: For example, World Liberty Financial, a company tied to the Trump family, has issued its own stablecoin.
    


            “Stablecoins seem (to be) here to stay,” analysts at JPMorgan Chase said in an April note. “A few years ago, we probably would have debated the accuracy of that sentence. Not today.”
    


            While cryptocurrencies are known for being volatile and fluctuating in value, stablecoins are supposed to be, as their name suggests, stable.
    


            This is because stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to another asset. They are most often linked to the US dollar, making one stablecoin worth $1.
    


            Companies that issue stablecoins hold other assets to back their coins and assure buyers about their value. For example, a company issuing stablecoins pegged to the US dollar could buy and hold high-quality assets like US government bonds.
    


            Two of the major stablecoin issuers are Tether, which issues USDT, and Circle, which issues USDC — and both of these stablecoins are pegged one-to-one to the dollar. Tether accounts for 62% of the total stablecoin market, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.
    


            The total market value of stablecoins surged from $20 billion in 2020 to $246 billion in May 2025, according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.
    


            Stablecoins emerged in 2014 as way for crypto investors to park their money while buying and selling other more volatile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Since then, Stablecoins have ballooned in popularity particularly for their potential use in digital payments, said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford University.
    


            Stablecoins, given their stable value, can serve as a medium of exchange and function as a digital currency. The crypto coins have emerged as useful in helping speed up payments.
    


            “Cross-border payments are providing the most exciting new use cases,” Duffie said. “Making a payment, such as a remittance or a vendor payment to or from an emerging-market country, can now be made faster and at lower cost than a conventional correspondent banking payment.”
    


            While stablecoins are significantly less volatile than other crypto coins, they are not without risks. If the assets backing the coin drop in value and the one-to-one peg falls apart, it could cause the equivalent of a bank run, said Duffie.
    


            Stablecoins gained notoriety in 2022 when TerraUSD, an obscure type of coin called an algorithmic stablecoin, crashed in value and caused a panic among investors.
    


            There are also security risks like people forgetting the pass-code to their crypto wallet.
    


            The GENIUS act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025.”
    


            Circle would likely benefit from increased regulation more than Tether as Circle is a US-based company while Tether is based in El Salvador, Del Wright, a professor at Louisiana State University Law School who specializes in crypto, told CNN.
    


            If the legislation passes, it could usher in mainstream adoption of stablecoins for digital payments and spur growth in the stablecoin industry, said Christian Catalini, founder of the cryptoeconomics lab at MIT. He added that traditional Wall Street firms and startups would also compete to offer stablecoins.
    


            Visa (V) in May announced a partnership with Bridge, a stablecoin company owned by fintech startup Stripe, to enable payments using stablecoin in countries across Latin America.
    


            “Stablecoins are on the cusp of mainstream adoption in 2025 as the US pushes forward with landmark legislation,” analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a May note. Despite the resistance in the Senate, “we still expect progress this year.”

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

Brian Armstrong, the billionaire CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, says he's ready to fund a US startup focused on gene-editing human embryos. If he goes forward, it would be the first major commercial investment in one of medicine's most fraught ideas.

In a post on X June 2, Armstrong announced he was looking for gene-editing scientists and bioinformatics specialists to form a founding team for an “embryo editing” effort targeting an unmet medical need, such as a genetic disease.

“I think the time is right for the defining company in the US to be built in this area,” Armstrong posted. 

The announcement from a deep-pocketed backer is a striking shift for a field considered taboo following the 2018 birth of the world's first genetically edited children in China—a secretive experiment that led to international outrage and prison time for the lead scientist.

According to Dieter Egli, a gene-editing scientist at Columbia University whose team has briefed Armstrong, his plans may be motivated in part by recent improvements in editing technology that have opened up a safer, more precise way to change the DNA of embryos.

That technique, called base editing, can deftly change a single DNA letter. Earlier methods, on the other hand, actually cut the double helix, damaging it and causing whole genes to disappear. “We know much better now what to do,” says Egli. “It doesn't mean the work is all done, but it's a very different game now—entirely different.”  

Embryo editing, which ultimately aims to produce humans with genes tailored by design, is an idea that has been heavily stigmatized and starved of funding. While it's legal to study embryos in the lab, actually producing a gene-edited baby is flatly illegal in most countries.  

In the US, the CRISPR baby ban operates via a law that forbids the Food and Drug Administration from considering, or even acknowledging, any application it gets to attempt a gene-edited baby. But that rule could be changed, especially if scientists can demonstrate a compelling use of the technique—or perhaps if a billionaire lobbies for it.

In his post, Armstrong included an image of a seven-year-old Pew Research Center poll showing Americans were strongly favorable to altering a baby's genes if it could treat disease, although the same poll found most opposed experimentation on embryos.  

Up until this point, no US company has openly pursued embryo editing, and the federal government doesn't fund studies on embryos at all. Instead, research on gene editing in embryos has been carried forward in the US by just two academic centers, Egli's and one at the Oregon Health & Science University.

The creator of CRISPR babies is flirting again with infamy, this time through a mysterious alliance with an Internet-savvy entrepreneur.

Those efforts have operated on a shoestring, held together by private grants and university funds. Researchers at those centers said they support the idea of a well-financed company that could advance the technology. “We would honestly welcome that,” says Paula Amato, a fertility doctor at Oregon Health & Science University and the past president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 

“More research is needed, and that takes people and money,” she says, adding that she doesn't mind if it comes from “tech bros.”

Editing embryos can, in theory, be used to correct genetic errors likely to cause serious childhood conditions. But since in most cases genetic testing of embryos can also be used to avoid those errors, many argue it will be hard to find a true unmet need where the DNA-altering technique is actually necessary.

Instead, it's easy to conclude that the bigger market for the technology would be to intervene in embryos in ways that could make humans resistant to common conditions, such as heart disease or Alzheimer's. But that is more controversial because it's a type of enhancement, and the changes would also be passed through the generations.

Only last week, several biotech trade and academic groups demanded a 10-year moratorium on heritable human genome editing, saying the technology has few real medical uses and “introduces long-term risks with unknown consequences.”

They said the ability to “program” desired traits or eliminate bad ones risked a new form of “eugenics,” one that would have the effect of “potentially altering the course of evolution.”

Armstrong did not reply to an email from MIT Technology Review seeking comment about his plans. Nor did his company Coinbase, a cryptocurrency trading platform that went public in 2021 and is the source of his fortune, estimated at $10 billion by Forbes.

The billionaire is already part of a wave of tech entrepreneurs who've made a splash in science and biology by laying down outsize investments, sometimes in far-out ideas. Armstrong previously cofounded New Limit, which Bloomberg calls a “life extension venture” and which this year raised a further $130 million to explore methods to reprogram old cells into an embryonic-like state.

He started that company with Blake Byers, an investor who has said a significant portion of global GDP should be spent on “immortality” research, including biotech approaches and ways of uploading human minds to computers.

Then, starting late last year, Armstrong began publicly telegraphing his interest in exploring a new venture, this time connected to assisted reproduction. In December, he announced on X that he and Byers were ready to meet with entrepreneurs working on “artificial wombs,” “embryo editing,” and “next-gen IVF.”

The post invited people to apply to attend an off-the-record dinner—a kind of forbidden-technologies soiree. Applicants had to fill in a Google form answering a few questions, including “What is something awesome you've built?”

CRISPR will get easier and easier to administer. What does that mean for the future of our species?

Among those who attended the dinner was a postdoctoral fellow from Egli's lab, Stepan Jerabek, who has been testing base-editing in embryos. Another attendee, Lucas Harrington, is a gene-editing scientist who trained at the University of California, Berkeley under Jennifer Doudna, a winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry for development of CRISPR gene editing. Harrington says a venture group he helps run, called SciFounders, is also considering starting an embryo-editing company.

“We share an interest in there being a company to empirically evaluate whether embryo editing can be done safely, and are actively exploring incubating a company to undertake this,” Harrington said in an email. “We believe there need to be legitimate scientists and clinicians working to safely evaluate this technology.”

Because of how rapidly gene editing is advancing, Harrington has also criticized bans and moratoria on the technology. These can't stop it from being applied but, he says, can drive it into “the shadows,” where it might be used less safely. According to Harrington, “several biohacker groups have quietly raised small amounts of capital” to pursue the technology.

By contrast, Armstrong's public declaration on X represents a more transparent approach. “It seems pretty serious now. They want to put something together,” says Egli, who hopes the Coinbase CEO might fund some research at his lab. “I think it's very good he posted publicly, because you can feel the temperature, see what reaction you get, and you stimulate the public conversation.”

The first reports that researchers were testing CRISPR on human embryos in the lab emerged from China in 2015, causing shock waves as it became clear how easy, in theory, it was to change human heredity. Two years later, in 2017, a report from Oregon claimed successful correction of a dangerous DNA mutation present in lab embryos made from patients' egg and sperm cells.

But that breakthrough was not what it seemed. More careful testing by Egli and others showed that CRISPR technology actually can cause havoc in a cell, often deleting large chunks of chromosomes. That's in addition to mosaicism, in which edits occur differently in different cells. What looked at first like precise DNA editing was in fact a dangerous process causing unseen damage.

While the public debate turned on the ethics of CRISPR babies—especially after three edited children were born in China—researchers were discussing basic scientific problems and how to solve them.

Since then, both US labs, as well as some in China, have switched to base editing. That method causes fewer unexpected effects and, in theory, could also endow an embryo with a number of advantageous gene variants, not just one change.

Some researchers also feel certain that editing an embryo is simpler than trying to treat sick adults. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle-cell disease, costs more than $2 million. By contrast, editing an embryo could be incredibly cheap, and if it's done early, when an embryo is forming, all the body cells could carry the change.

“You fix the text before you print the book,” says Egli. “It seems like a no-brainer.”

Still, gene editing isn't quite ready for prime time in making babies. Getting there requires more work, including careful design of the editing system (which includes a protein and short guide molecule) and systematic ways to check embryos for unwanted DNA changes. That is the type of industrial effort Armstrong's company, if he funds one, would be suited to carry out.

“You would have to optimize something to a point where it is perfect, to where it's a breeze,” says Egli. “This is the kind of work that companies do." 

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

As the crypto and blockchain industry continues to evolve, institutional adoption has become a crucial driving force behind its growth. Despite a tumultuous first quarter for both traditional finance and crypto, the trend towards increased adoption shows no signs of slowing down.

The first quarter of the year was marked by significant challenges for both TradFi and crypto, with market volatility and regulatory uncertainty dominating the headlines. However, crypto and blockchain adoption continued to gain momentum, with institutions and investors increasingly recognizing the potential of these technologies to transform the financial landscape. The value of holding Bitcoin over the long term became undeniable, while companies that focused on financial services related to crypto found sustainable annual growth.

At the heart of institutional adoption lies compliance. As regulatory clarity begins to emerge, institutions are seeking trusted partners that can provide a secure and compliant environment for their investments. Hong Kong's HKMA and SFC guidance on crypto regulation is a prime example of this trend, demonstrating a growing recognition of the need for clear and consistent regulatory frameworks.

In the US, regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are providing clearer guidance on crypto compliance, helping to alleviate institutional concerns and pave the way for greater adoption. In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to provide a comprehensive framework for crypto compliance, offering institutions a clearer understanding of the rules and regulations governing the industry. As regulatory clarity increases around the world, institutions are becoming more confident in their ability to navigate the crypto market, driving growth and adoption in the sector.

This is the core focus for HashKey's concept of True Global – a one-stop service offered by a licensed provider that is at the center of a global compliance and business strategy. It represents a commitment to delivering a compliant experience for institutions, leveraging the expertise and licenses of various entities under HashKey Group to provide a trusted and reliable partner for their crypto investments. With licenses across the world covering a wide range of activities, this provides a full spectrum of services and products to better align with the borderless nature of blockchain and crypto technology while mitigating risks and remaining compliant.

For institutions, working with a licensed provider offers a level of trust and security that is essential for large-scale investments. A licensed provider has a deep understanding of both the TradFi and crypto spaces, allowing them to navigate the complex regulatory landscape with ease. This expertise is invaluable in ensuring that institutions are able to invest in crypto with confidence, knowing that their partner is fully compliant with all relevant regulations.

Licensed crypto businesses offer institutions a heightened level of operational efficiency, as they are able to leverage established processes and protocols to streamline transactions and minimize risk. By partnering with a licensed provider, institutions can also benefit from enhanced reputation and credibility, as they are seen to be working with a trusted and regulated entity. Furthermore, licensed businesses provide institutions with access to a broader range of financial products and services, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and maximize returns in the crypto market.

As regulatory clarity continues to emerge, institutions will increasingly demand higher standards of compliance from their partners. So it is essential to have a global license setup to position providers at the forefront of this trend, as institutions can rely on a trusted and reliable partner for their investments. As the industry continues to evolve, we can expect to see a growing convergence between TradFi and crypto. Institutions will increasingly seek to integrate crypto into their existing investment strategies, and providers that can offer a reliable and compliant experience will be best positioned to capitalize on this trend.

Investors who have managed to enter the top 10% on the XRP rich list could see some impressive gains when XRP finally reaches a two-digit price.

Notably, the crypto market recently entered another consolidation phase, and XRP followed suit, dropping to again retest the $2.2 price level. This comes after the altcoin failed to capitalize on the earlier Bitcoin (BTC) upsurge that pushed its price to new all-time highs last month.

As a result of Bitcoin's solo rally, which left altcoins like XRP behind, Bitcoin dominance has continued to surge. However, analysts believe an imminent drop in Bitcoin dominance is on the horizon. This would massively benefit XRP and other altcoins.

With the market expecting the altcoin season to take shape soon, several market watches have projected price targets for assets such as XRP. For instance, analyst DK64Trades suggested last month that he is sure XRP will eventually break above $10. He cited the XRP dominance in his argument. 

Also, the founder of CryptosRUs, George Tung, indicated in a May interview that he sees XRP reaching $10 by the end of the year. For context, a $10 price would represent a 354% increase from the current price, and while most proponents believe this target is conservative, the consensus is that XRP could claim it soon.

At this price, investors could witness impressive gains depending on the amount of XRP they hold. Community commentators like Edoardo Farina have consistently charged investors to accumulate at least 10,000 XRP tokens. 

In previous instances, Farina also suggested that investors amass enough XRP tokens to at least enter the top 10% on the XRP rich list. He made this suggestion in February when the requirement to enter the top 10% XRP rich list was 2,501 XRP. Today, this threshold has dropped to 2,480 XRP.

If an investor can amass these 2,480 XRP tokens to secure a spot among the top 10% on the XRP rich list, they could see some subtle gains when XRP claims $10. Notably, these tokens are currently worth $5,456 at XRP's current price of $2.2. If prices surge to $10, these 2,480 XRP tokens will be worth $24,800, a yield of $19,344.

However, it bears mentioning that not all investors within the top 10% on XRP rich list hold exactly 2,480 XRP, as this is merely the least amount to hold to enter this elite group. Others hold more up to 8,770 XRP. Those on the topic 10% list with 8,770 tokens currently sit on $19,294. If XRP hits $10, this investment will hit $87,700, a profit of over $68,000.

The year was 2020. During an unprecedented time, the sports card market saw an unexpected rise. As the hobby adapted to a changing world, NFTs began to thrive. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets stored on the blockchain that verify ownership and authenticity—essentially, a way to prove that a digital item is truly one-of-a-kind. Between January and July 2020, five digital sports cards sold for $36,000 or more. The highest? A Kobe Bryant 1/1 Logoman NFT. Coming in second? A Zion Williamson 1/1 Logoman RPA—oof.

Unlike traditional digital files, NFTs can't be duplicated in a meaningful way—even if someone takes a screenshot, they don't own the underlying asset. At the time, the concept was still new to many, often met with skepticism and confusion. Questions like, “If I screenshot your NFT, doesn't that make it mine?” were common.

But as the world began returning to normal, the hype seemed to fade. While not disappearing entirely, sports card NFTs quickly became more of an afterthought than the next big thing.

Fast forward to March 2025, and the sports card NFT market seems to have a pulse—one that's gone largely unnoticed by most. Panini, a major player in the trading card world, now runs a blockchain-based NFT marketplace featuring exclusive digital pack drops. Collectors can buy, rip, and resell cards instantly on the platform.

Each week, Panini highlights the top five sales—and the numbers might surprise you. Topping the list this week? A LeBron James Gold Prizm /10 that sold for a staggering $27,750. In fact, three of the top five NFT sales were LeBron cards, totaling nearly $40,000 combined. The other two? A Victor Wembanyama Gold Kaboom /10 that went for $6,000 and a Jayden Daniels Gold Kaboom /10 that sold for $3,500.

Just this morning, Panini launched its 2024 Obsidian Football digital packs—and they sold out within minutes. The rapid sellout has sparked debate once again: is this just another hype-driven fad, or is the digital card space here to stay?

These Obsidian packs are loaded with sought-after case hits like Kabooms, Colorblasts, Stained Glass, Downtowns, and more. Many of these rare pulls have already started hitting the NFT marketplace. A Caleb Williams Green Horizontal Kaboom 1/1 recently sold for $3,500, while a Jayden Daniels Blue Obsidian Rookie /25 went for $175, and a Brock Bowers Kaboom /25 changed hands for just $60.

As the dust settles, it'll be interesting to see how these exclusive digital cards are valued over time. The bigger question looms: is this surge in digital pack demand a healthy evolution of the hobby—or just another flash-in-the-pan get-rich-quick scheme?

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” Satoshi Nakamoto's 2009 white paper outlining the concept of a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment system alternative to the traditional financial system, was hardly an overnight success.

Yes, while the document gave way to Bitcoin's launch later that year, it wasn't until 2010 that Bitcoin was first used for a real life transaction. However, in the years that followed, Bitcoin's usage as a payment method, as well as use cases for crypto and blockchain technology, grew exponentially. 

In a recent interview, Binance CEO Richard Teng reflected on how much crypto has evolved, noting that “Fifteen years ago, crypto was about buying a pizza. Today, it's about building robust payment systems, stablecoins, and real-life use cases that change lives.”

The evolution of crypto is far from over, as developers and other innovators continue to expand and enhance the blockchain infrastructure. Adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies also continues to grow as well.

Initially, Bitcoin's user base skewed toward the tech savvy, particularly among the tech savvy whose political philosophy matched up well with the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain.

However, as the 2010s progressed, crypto's user base began to steadily widen. The reasons for this are many fold. For one, access, availability, and education about cryptocurrencies increased significantly during this time frame. The rise of user-friendly crypto exchanges like Binance played a major role with this factor.

The community of active cryptocurrency users also expanded demographically during this time. Largely, due to crypto's strengths as an alternative to traditional banking services, particularly in countries where access to traditional banking remains limited.

Yet even as blockchain economy participants grew from just a handful at the onset, to hundreds of millions of users worldwide by 2020, by-and-large mainstream financial institutions and institutional investors stayed on the sidelines, due to the space's underdeveloped regulatory framework. It wasn't until starting last year, when regulatory clarity in markets like the U.S. and Europe, started to emerge. Once this happened, crypto made a full leap into the financial mainstream.

Crypto usage has come a long way from the famed pizza order that first demonstrated its real-world utility. Today, scores of large and small businesses worldwide accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. Some countries, most notably El Salvador, have even officially made Bitcoin legal tender. As usability increases so has the value of Bitcoin at each Pizza Day.

Demand for the availability of crypto-based payment options among consumers continues to rise as well. With this, the number of retailers accepting crypto as a payment method is expected to increase dramatically going forward.

According to a recent survey from a major U.S.-based bank, while just under 15% of retailers accept crypto as a payment method, 75% of retailers noted that they plan to begin accepting either stablecoin and cryptocurrency payments within the next two years.

As individuals continue to adopt crypto- based payment methods for the first time, more and more people are discovering their everyday utility.

Based on a recent survey of Binance users, it's clear that using crypto for payments is far from a complex and cumbersome process. Take, for example, the experience of Sergio, a Mexican Binance user who detailed his experience using crypto for the first time to pay a restaurant bill. As Sergio noted, his usage of BNB as a payment method allowed him to see how “simple and practical” crypto can be as a payment method.

Dubai-based Codi reported a similar experience, when he used crypto to pay for a restaurant order while on vacation in Turkey. According to Codi, not only was his payment via stablecoin USDT “incredibly convenient;” the exchange rate using this method was more favorable than what his local bank offered.

In the case of Vietnamese crypto user Andy, we can see that not only are crypto-based payments anything but complicated, they can be a useful solution in a jam. If not for his crypto account, Andy wouldn't have been able to make an urgent cross-border payment.

As awareness of this “simple and practical” alternative continues to grow, the transformation from niche novelty to everyday utility will continue.

The broader cryptocurrency market mirrored the bearish close in Bitcoin (BTC) on Wednesday, with the majority of the top 100 altcoins closing below their opening prices. Among the minority, SPX6900 (SPX), DeXe Protocol (DEXE), and PancakeSwap (CAKE) record mild gains as Coinbase adds CAKE to the asset roadmap, increasing the listing chances, and DEXE announces a writer's guild program to incentivize its promotion. 

Bitcoin reveals a vulnerable price action with increasing downside risk as a triangle pattern unfolds. On the 4-hour timeframe, the lows on May 12, May 31, and June 2 compose a support trendline, while the lower high trend in Bitcoin after its reversal from its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 shapes a declining trendline.

The converging trendlines assemble a triangle pattern while Bitcoin draws near the support floor and the triangle's apex. A potential 4-hour closing below Wednesday's low at $104,179 will result in a fallout from the pattern. Investors could witness BTC retest the $103,182 low marked on Saturday, with the next support level at $101,860. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46 fluctuates near the halfway line a couple of days after the bounce back from the oversold boundary. The indicator shows significant room for growth but an indecisive trend in motion.

Conversely, an upside reversal closing above the trendline (Wednesday's high at $106,000) could move BTC to $108,797. 

SPX trades at $1.15, recording a growth of over 1.50% at press time on Thursday. Following the 4.30% rise on Wednesday, the meme coin, neglecting the broader market movement, registered a near 28% rise from its weekly low of $0.90 on Saturday. 

The 78.6% Fibonacci level at $1.28 acts as the immediate resistance, drawn between 2025's highest daily closing price at $1.55 on January 6 and the lowest at $0.29 on March 11.

The RSI indicator at 68 indicates a struggle to enter the overbought zone, as it forms lower highs near the boundary line, resulting in bearish divergence with the rising SPX trend. This warns of an early reversal before reaching the most immediate resistance level as trend momentum declines.

On the flip side, a downside move in SPX could test the 50% retracement at $0.92. 

DEXE records a 10% recovery on Wednesday, following a 32% crash on Monday, which resulted in a massive bearish candle on the daily chart. At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $9.70, taking a breather with over 1.50% pullback in the day. 

The failed trendline breakout in DEXE took a downside reversal from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $14.02. Further up, the RSI indicator drops to the oversold zone and hovers near the boundary line with the short-term recovery. 

Thus, the short-term recovery in DEXE fails to change the bearish narrative influenced by the recent crash and warns of a steeper decline to the next support level at $7.33.

On the upside, a potential uptrend could retest the broken support floor at $12.15.

CAKE is up over 3% in the last 24 hours at press time amid the Coinbase announcement of adding PancakeSwap to the asset roadmap after Ethena this week. While the trading date is yet to be confirmed, heightened sentiments are likely to fuel the uptrend if the market stabilizes. 



At the time of writing, the altcoin trades at $2.46 with an over 1.50% jump in the day. The price action shows an upside turnaround from the weekly low at $2.21 on Saturday from a long-standing support trendline (formed by connecting the lows on March 11, April 6, and May 4). An upside continuation could challenge the $2.82 resistance level that has resulted in four bearish turnarounds so far in 2025.

On the flip side, a crucial support for the altcoin remains the 200-day EMA at $2.20, moving close to the support trendline.

The Ethereum Foundation has published a new treasury policy that aims to reshape how its reserves are held and invested, seeking to rewrite the playbook in a way better suited to the on-chain world it helped create.

The new set of treasury policies marks two key moves from the non-profit organization that stewards development for the Ethereum ecosystem. 

It aims to reduce annual spending from 15% of assets to just 5% by 2030 and will also seek to utilize its treasury for DeFi protocols.

Those prospects are projected to "earn acceptable returns on treasury assets" while staying "consistent with Ethereum's underlying principles," Hsiao-Wei Wang, co-executive director at the foundation, wrote Wednesday.

The new policies formalize a lower spending trajectory and a rule-based approach for converting the foundation's Ethereum reserves into cash.

It plans to achieve this by committing to reduced annual operating expenses and creating a predictable "glide path and baseline" toward spending, Wang explained.

The foundation "expects to remain a long-term steward, but envisions its scope gradually narrowing," Wang claimed.

The rule-based conversion, meanwhile, works by automatically selling Ethereum (ETH) only when cash reserves fall below the 2.5-year expense buffer (approximately 37.5% of the treasury), Wang wrote.

For every quarter, the Ethereum Foundation will sell a portion of its Ethereum reserves based on the amount of cash required, converting the Ethereum to fiat through exchanges or on-chain swaps.

The target cash reserve, calculated as annual operating spend, multiplied by the desired runway, "directly informs the size and the cadence of ETH sales," Wang noted.

Decrypt approached the Ethereum Foundation to learn more.

In the note, the foundation introduced "Defipunk," a new term that describes how “cypherpunk” values can be applied to DeFi (decentralized finance) and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

The term is derived from and borrows core ideas in the Cypherpunk Manifesto, written by American programmer and mathematician Eric Hughes in 1993.

In the manifesto, Hughes argues that privacy is essential for a free and open society. To keep it, individuals need to build practical defenses through cryptography and code, rather than relying on the authority of governments or corporations.

The foundation has established criteria for projects it seeks to support, aligning with the vision.

"For privacy to be widespread, it must be part of a social contract," Hughes wrote.

The Ethereum Foundation echoes this, with Wang noting that privacy has "inherent network effects,” and yet has received "very little attention so far."

“Strong, early institutional support” from entities such as the Ethereum Foundation could be “uniquely valuable in flipping the equilibrium” for privacy in the decentralized finance sector, Wang wrote.

As U.S. President Donald Trump leans more heavily into the crypto sector, his name is being used to promote several crypto projects that have nothing to do with his own ventures, prompting confusion among users and making them more vulnerable to being scammed.

Trump's son Eric Trump on Wednesday (June 4, 2025) used his X account to call out a project that was not affiliated with the official World Liberty Financial crypto project that Trump had previously endorsed.

The project in question, Magic Eden, was using images of Trump and the $TRUMP crypto ticker in order to rally up hype around an upcoming crypto wallet that it claimed was “official.” 

Magic Eden used an image of Trump holding up his fist that Trump himself has used to promote his $TRUMP crypto on January 18, which led to user confusion.

Trump's son stated, “This project is not authorized by @Trump. @MagicEden I would be extremely careful using our name in a project that has not been approved and is unknown to anyone in our organization.”

Many X users in the comments expressed their confusion as they tried to differentiate between the $TRUMP crypto endorsed by the president and the version that Eric Trump had cautioned against. Others were not clear as to the links between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked crypto project working on a stablecoin, and the $TRUMP meme token.

Magic Eden is a trading platform with more than 800,000 followers on X. The account bio noted that its posts were “not intended for US or UK audiences.”

Trump's promotion of crypto, and especially his own meme token, has made him the subject of criticism and concern as legal experts point out potential conflicts of interest. However, the U.S. crypto community has largely welcomed Trump's stance, hoping that his return to the White House will signal looser crypto regulations for businesses.

In Deciding to Launch a Nuclear Strike, Humans Are Shockingly Suggestible

Surveys show that how nuclear strike options are presented strongly influences the decision a president may make

No one has launched a nuclear weapon in war since 1945, when U.S. president Harry S. Truman bombed Japan. Support for that decision—the only use of atomic arms in a conflict—has decreased over time. But new research investigating the attitudes of Americans suggests that, in the right scenario, plenty of people would support another atomic assault.

Most U.S. residents have no sway over such a cataclysmic decision. But the psychological factors that tweak our brains are the same ones at play in the minds of presidents and the people who are in charge of those megadeath decisions.

By gaining insight into the minds of the population, these studies illuminate the factors that might affect a leader's choice to conduct a nuclear strike—and ways to make that choice less likely.

The lineage of the new work traces back to a study, published in 2017, by Scott Sagan of Stanford University and Benjamin Valentino of Dartmouth College. The researchers presented study participants with hypothetical scenarios: Would they use a nuclear weapon in a war against Iran to save 20,000 American troops, even if doing so killed either 100,000 or two million Iranians?

With smaller casualties, around 56 percent of people would approve an air strike; with larger casualties, around 48 percent would. In both casualty cases, around 59 percent of people would support a president's decision to strike. When split demographically, Republicans, people older than age 60 and those in favor of the death penalty for murder were significantly more likely to give nuclear launch a go.

Disturbed by the results, scientist Paul Slovic of the firm Decision Research and his colleagues decided to replicate and extend that paper. In an initial study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in 2020, they posed the same experimental setup: To save 20,000 American troops, would participants support bombing either 100,000 or two million civilians? But in the answers to that question, they wanted to dig more into the demographics and domestic beliefs of the respondents.

They interpreted the fact that death-penalty proponents were more likely to support nuclear war as potential evidence of a personality trait: punitiveness, or a desire to penalize those who threatened them in some way. In other words, punitiveness equates to “punishing people who you felt deserved it,” Slovic explains.

Slovic and his co-authors wanted to investigate how approval for other punitive domestic policies lined up with nuclear support. Ultimately, they clocked people's views on abortion, guns, immigration and the death penalty.

They found a linear correlation: the more someone supported policies to restrict abortion, oppose gun control, deport immigrants and employ the death penalty, the more likely they were to support a nuclear strike.

Now, in research by Slovic, Daniel Post—a permanent military professor fellow at the U.S. Naval War College, and a former nuclear strike adviser at the U.S. Strategic Command—, and three other collaborators, the researchers have increased both the number of survey participants and the variables; the study is currently being reviewed at an academic journal. For instance, they altered the number of American troops who would be saved by a nuclear strike to see how low that human quantity could go and still merit nuclear war in the minds of the respondents. Very low numbers of American casualties, it turned out, felt like an existential threat worthy of existential response. “We found that fairly low numbers would still receive fairly high numbers of support for the nuclear option,” Post says.

When the team took American troop numbers out entirely—stating only that a war had been going on for a while and that it had both public opposition and political tensions—some people still supported using a nuclear weapon to end the conflict. Still, as the number of Ajmerican troops spared by a nuclear launch went up, so did support for it.

Approval of punitive domestic policies still correlated linearly with nuclear-strike support. And in every condition, Republicans were again more likely to go nuclear.

That's relevant to our world because a president's political party may indicate how likely their authorization of a nuclear attack would be. “I think everybody would agree you want the best decision made possible,” Post says, “not the [one that is] most beneficial to your political party, because that's not relevant in the nuclear setting. It's so bad and so big, right? It's not good for anybody.”

Surprisingly, in a finding that also arose in Sagan and Valentino's original study, women generally were more likely to approve of nuclear use than men.

In comments taken as part of the survey in Slovic and Post's new study, women said they felt more protective of the troops—another factor at play beyond desire for violent punishment. “When the troop loss got higher, even low-punishing women went for the nuclear bomb more than low-punishing men,” Slovic says.

But regardless of gender or party or punishing tendency, people's responses to the new survey changed a lot depending on how the researchers presented the options. In the initial experiment, the choices were to save a given number of American troops by killing either 100,000 or two million Iranians. When the scientists instead gave survey takers three options—don't strike, use a nuclear weapon to kill 100,000 civilians or use one to kill two million civilians—more people chose the 100,000 option: it looked less bad than the one in the millions.

People who chose not to strike when only given two possibilities often changed their choice, picking the “better bomb” when that was available. “You increase the chances of breaking the nuclear threshold, nuclear use, deterrence failure, etc., just by listing different options,” Post says. “Just by making one look better than another one.”

This result is a well-known phenomenon in psychology called the decoy effect, which is often used in marketing. When you go to the movie theater, a small popcorn may be $4, a medium may cost $7.50, and a large may cost $8. The medium exists mostly to make you think the large is a good deal (it's not). “In the retail market, the consequences are trivial,” Post says. “It's which razor people are buying or which TV they bought. But in the nuclear-decision context, the consequences are absolutely not trivial.”

And though presidents occupy a position of authority, they still have the same suggestible human brain as those of us without authority who are buying razors and TVs and popcorn because of subtle manipulation. “There's a mind involved in this,” Post says.

Sharon Weiner, a political scientist at American University, has done related mind-reading nuclear research and has collaborated with Slovic on other projects. She is an advocate for taking these particulars of the human brain into account in nuclear decision-making because humans are never more human than when something hard is happening. “You forget all the things you tell yourself you're going to remember during a crisis,” she says. And a nuclear crisis is, one would imagine, one of the world's most stressful.

Like Slovic and Post, Weiner has been considering how a president's nuclear decisions will be influenced by how their advisers present the options. In particular, she wondered whether explicitly telling the president they could choose not to launch might affect the outcome.

The president can always choose the no-go option, but strategic and military advisers might not explicitly point that out. And in the heat of a world-altering moment, the leader might forget, she says. “All the literature about behavioral psychology says they may not think of it,” Weiner says. “And so we thought, Let's test this. Let's see: If we give people an option that says, ‘Don't launch,' does it change the ratio of people who launch?”

It turns out the answer is yes: in a survey experiment that Weiner presented as part of an event with Slovic and Rose McDermott, who collaborated with Slovic and Post on their new paper, more people choose not to launch when they were directly told that option was available than when they were only given different nuclear death outcomes. “A portion of the people who pick the lowest casualties, they're the ones who then defect and pick ‘no launch' when they have that option,” Weiner says. “What this tells me is: If that's the option they wanted, they didn't have the presence of mind during the crisis to say, ‘Wait a minute. I'm not taking any of the three things you presented to me. I want a fourth thing.'”

In a real nuclear crisis, Weiner concludes, whatever nuclear options the president's advisers give at that secret and tense meeting, “there must be an option presented with equal visual and audio support to not launch.”

“There's no harm in offering that option and requiring that it be there,” she adds.

Together this recent research indicates that what insiders call the “nuclear taboo”—the idea that an international norm exists against using nuclear weapons and that this is why they haven't blown up in conflict in 80 years—is not as strong as we think. Apparently, many people require little provocation to approve of a hypothetical strike. Given that, just because humans haven't launched nuclear weapons in 80 years doesn't mean there's a magical stigmatic force preventing them from doing so. “If you're relying on a nuclear taboo to not use nuclear weapons, you need to rethink,” Weiner says.

The decision to break that taboo, the research suggests, is also mercurial—disturbingly like more mundane choices. “One of the takeaways is how unstable the response is and [how it depends on] factors that should not play a role in the decision,” Slovic says. Gender, political party, punitive disposition, the presentation of choices—"All of this bounces people around,” he continues.

And depending on how that bounce lands, it's something the world might not bounce back from.

Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalized to characterize irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relation between the entropy change of a system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in the relative entropies of the environment. Here, we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to a massless Klein–Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalized entropy production for various system–environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics.

Information theory and thermodynamics constitute foundational pillars of modern technology and underpin our understanding of computers and heat engines, respectively. Although these disciplines may seem distinct, they are intricately connected. This connection is encapsulated in Landauer's principle, first articulated in 19611. Landauer understood that erasing a bit of information in a computer is not for free but is, instead, accompanied by a minimal energy cost dissipated to the environment. Subsequently, various experimental studies2,3,4 have confirmed this lower bound on energy dissipation for near-reversible bit erasure. Logical operations thus imply irreversibility, which poses a fundamental theoretical limitation on the design of any small-scale energy-efficient information-processing technologies5.

However, by extending beyond the case of bit erasure, recent influential work6 has generalized the link between information theory and thermodynamics. Using a quantum statistical mechanics framework, that work reinterprets Landauer's principle as a means of relating the entropy change of a system to the energy dissipated to its environment in general out-of-equilibrium processes, not just erasure. This relation can be quantified by a measure of process irreversibility7. Such a broader formulation of Landauer's principle not only deepens its physical importance but also makes this extension particularly relevant for quantum many-body systems, where contributions to irreversibility remain an area of active research, notably for phenomena such as equilibration and thermalization8,9,10,11.

In this work, we employ Landauer's principle to experimentally characterize the irreversibility of an out-of-equilibrium process in the quantum many-body regime by tracking the time evolution of quantum information-theoretic measures. We present a crisp information-inspired interpretation of the correlations present in states of quantum many-body systems in terms of entropic expressions.

Concretely, we consider a system–environment composite initially in the state ϱSE(0) and evolving under a global unitary time evolution U to the state ϱSE(t) = UϱSE(0)U†. The reduced state of the system S (environment E) is ϱS(E)(t) = TrE(S)[ϱSE(t)], where TrE(S) is the partial trace over the environment (system).

First, let us assume that there are no initial correlations between the system and environment and that the environment is in a thermal state \({\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}=\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}/{{\rm{Tr}}}[\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}]\) at inverse temperature βE with respect to its Hamiltonian HE. In this case, the entropy production Σ(t), which is a measure of irreversibility6,7,12, can be decomposed as

Here, the quantum relative entropy

quantifies the deviation of the environment from its initial thermal state. The quantum mutual information

measures the system–environment correlations, where

denotes the von Neumann entropy of a state ϱ.

Now we move on to a more general scenario in which the system and the environment are initially correlated, and the state of the environment deviates from thermal equilibrium. We thereby introduce the generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0), where the initial correlations and deviations from thermal equilibrium are accounted for by a resource cost \(\varSigma (0)={I}_{{{\rm{SE}}}}(0)+D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0) \|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\) (ref. 13), with βE being the effective inverse temperature14,15. Landauer's principle can then be expressed13 as an equality:

which relates the entropy change of the system ΔS ≔ S(ϱS(t)) − S(ϱS(0)) to the energy dissipated to the environment ΔEE: = Tr[(ϱE(t) − ϱE(0))HE]. In this general formulation, depending on the initial state, ΔΣ is not necessarily non-negative16,17. Alternatively, ΔΣ also decomposes into the change of quantum mutual information ΔI = ISE(t) − ISE(0), which expresses how much the system–environment correlations change along the out-of-equilibrium process, as well as the term \(\Delta D=D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(t)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})-D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\), which quantifies how much both the initial state and the final state of the environment are different from the reference equilibrium thermal state. We provide a more thorough motivation for the generalized entropy production ΔΣ in Methods.

Expressed in this form, Landauer's principle serves as a means of tracking changes in information-theoretic quantities, which compose generalized entropy production ΔΣ in two different ways with a single equation. Herein lies the power at the heart of thermodynamics: just as knowing the precise microscopic degrees of freedom, such as the position and momentum of each particle in a classical gas, is not useful for drawing meaningful conclusions about its dynamics, knowing the density matrix of a quantum many-body system is, similarly, not descriptive. In traditional thermodynamics, the relevant quantities that effectively characterize the dynamics are macroscopic variables like changes in pressure or volume. Similarly, for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system, analysing the information-theoretic quantities in Landauer's principle allows a simple characterization of its irreversibility.

So far, no systematic experimental pursuit has probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime. Here, we address this gap by measuring the time evolution of the different terms in equation (5) in a (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field simulator of tunnelling-coupled ultracold Bose gases. This experimental platform has proven to be a suitable test bed for simulating one-dimensional quantum field theories. Previous studies using this set-up have examined the area law of quantum mutual information in thermal equilibrium18 and the propagation of second-19 or higher-order correlations20.

In this experiment, two parallel ultracold clouds of 87Rb atoms (Fig. 1a) were confined in highly anisotropic magnetic traps produced by an atom chip21. The clouds were confined in the axial direction (z) by a parabolic trap superimposed with an optical dipole potential to produce hard walls. In the radial directions (x, y), they were confined by a double-well trap with an adjustable barrier between, created by radio-frequency dressing22. The single-particle tunnelling rate can be modified by the amplitude of a radio-frequency field created by two parallel wires on the atom chip.

a, The experimental system consists of two tunnelling-coupled ultracold 87Rb gases, with a single-particle tunnelling rate J, initially prepared in an initial state described by a global thermal state of the massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. By ramping up a barrier between the condensates, a global mass quench is performed, and the condensates evolve independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for t ≥ 0. b, The atomic clouds are released, and they interfere as they expand. For each experimental realization, we obtained the integrated two-dimensional atomic density with absorption imaging, from which the relative phase profiles were obtained. An example of a fitted phase profile is given for a slice z=z0. c, Using the measured phase–phase correlations, we dynamically reconstructed the covariance matrix for both quadratures. By successively shifting the observation window, we fitted the covariance matrix Γ(t) for different times t. The covariance matrices for the system S and environment E were defined accordingly and used to calculate information-theoretic quantities.

The bosonic quantum field operator for each condensate can be written using the phase–density representation as \({\psi }_{n}(z)=\sqrt{{\rho }_{n}(z)}\operatorname{e}^{\mathrm{i}{\theta }_{n}(z)}\), where θn and ρn denote the phase and density of the respective condensate indexed by n = 1 or 2. In the following, we focus on the operators φ(z) = θ1(z) − θ2(z) and δρ(z) = [ρ1(z) − ρ2(z)]/2, which represent the relative phase and relative density, respectively. These relative degrees of freedom satisfy a similar commutation relation as the original phase and density operators of each condensate, given by [ϕ(z), δρ(z')] = iδ(z − z'). For strong tunnelling-coupling between the two clouds, the relative degrees of freedom are described by a massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian:

which models low-energy phononic excitations and is an approximation to an interacting sine-Gordon Hamiltonian23 (see equation (11) and below for further details). In equation (6), ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the atomic mass, g1D is the effective one-dimensional atomic interaction strength, L = 49 μm is the axial length of the condensates, n1D ≈ 70 μm−1 is the average linear density and J ≈ 2π × 0.8 Hz is the tunnelling rate introduced before. Note that a mass term appears only due to the tunnelling-coupling between the pair of condensates. A single condensate can simulate only a massless Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid model24,25 (HKG with J = 0).

In our experiments, we prepared the Bose–Einstein condensates in a global thermal state HKG with finite tunnelling-coupling (J > 0). Because we wanted to measure the out-of-equilibrium evolution of information-theoretic quantities, we drove the system out of equilibrium by rapidly quenching J to zero (Fig. 1a). We did so by ramping up the barrier between the condensates within approximately 2 ms. This change corresponds to a global mass quench of the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. The condensates then evolved independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for times t up to 65 ms.

At each time step t, we turned off all the traps and let the atoms fall freely for 15.6 ms. The clouds then expanded and interfered, resulting in absorption pictures like the one shown in Fig. 1b, which allowed us to measure the spatially resolved relative phase φ(z) between them. Because the detection process is destructive, the measurements were repeated to gather statistics. In our current experimental set-up, the relative density fluctuations δρ were not directly measurable, which prompted the development of a dynamical tomographic reconstruction technique18,26 to access all the elements of the covariance matrix:

Here, the elements are defined as [Γϕϕ(t)]m,n = 〈ϕ(zm, t)ϕ(zn, t)〉, [Γρρ(t)]m,n = 〈δρ(zm,t)δρ(zn, t)〉 and [Γϕρ(t)]m,n = [Γρϕ(t)]m,nT = 〈(1/2){ϕ(zm, t), δρ(zn, t)}〉, all on a discrete grid with N pixels (m, n ∈ {1, …, N}), which were determined by the resolution constraints of our imaging system, which, thus, introduced an ultraviolet cutoff.

The phase–phase correlations for different evolution times after the quench were measured directly from the extracted relative phase profiles. Assuming that the short-time dynamics after the quench are governed by the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, then as time progressed, the initial eigenmodes of the relative density transformed into the phase quadrature, and the phase quadrature transformed into the relative density. This transformation allowed us to extract information about these eigenmodes by fitting the initial second-order correlation functions for phase–density and density–density with the observed evolution of the phase–phase correlations in momentum space.

The schematics in Fig. 1c illustrate our dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme. We followed the technique in ref. 18 for various input intervals with varying starting points. By scanning the starting points of these input intervals throughout the trapping times, we reconstructed the full covariance matrix at every time t, as depicted in Fig. 1. The interval length (32.5 ms, which is close to L/c ≈ 27 ms, where c is the speed of sound) was selected as it was sufficiently long for the slowest eigenmode to acquire enough dynamical phase for a stable reconstruction, yet short enough to prevent mode interactions from affecting the reconstruction. A detailed overview of this reconstruction process is provided in Methods.

The quadratic form of the pre- and post-quench Hamiltonians allowed us to work within the framework of Gaussian quantum information theory27,28. In this framework, the covariance matrix Γ captured all the accessible information about the state of the composite system during the dynamics, from which we extracted all the information-theoretic quantities of interest in equation (5). As has been demonstrated in various experiments23,29,30,31,32, the quadratic approximation of the Hamiltonian accurately captures the dynamics for the timescales considered. Even if the true dynamics deviates from the Gaussian regime and violates the massless Klein–Gordon theory, a Gaussian extremality argument presented in Supplementary Information Section 4 justifies the Gaussian tomography scheme and provides bounds on the information-theoretic quantities. Thus, based on our dynamical tomographic reconstruction of the covariance matrices, Landauer's principle can also be meaningfully experimentally investigated for interacting models.

Having experimentally reconstructed the post-quench time evolution of the covariance matrices, we partitioned the one-dimensional field of length L into two distinct subregions and split the covariance matrix accordingly (Fig. 1c). Because the quantum field was isolated from its surroundings, one subregion served as the system S with length LS, while the other subregion functioned as the environment E with length LE = L − LS. We probed Landauer's principle (equation (5)) for various system–environment bipartitions by characterizing the generalized entropy production ΔΣ. To do so, we computed the individual contributions βEΔEE, ΔS, ΔI and ΔD.

The results are presented in Fig. 2 as a function of time for different subregion size ratios and in Fig. 3 as a function of subregion size for different times. The timescales are shown in units of ct/L, where \(c=\sqrt{{g}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}{n}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}/m}\approx 1.8\,\upmu\mbox{m}\,\mbox{ms}^{-1}\) is the speed of sound. Overall, a very good fit of the data (circles) was obtained compared to the theoretical calculations (shaded areas), which used the lowest N = 7 modes, considering the imaging resolution of the experiment. The low-lying modes already capture the dynamics of the continuum theory very well. The error bars representing the 68% confidence intervals were obtained from bootstrapping33 with 999 samples and consider the uncertainty in the tunnelling rate and the estimated initial global temperature. The effective inverse temperature of the environment βE with respect to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian was computed using quantum field-theoretic simulations by constructing a global thermal state of the pre-quench massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with the initial global temperature estimated from the experimental data.

a,b, Quantities of Landauer's principle are shown as a function of time for subregion size ratios LS/L = 0.14 (a) and LS/L = 0.43 (b). The legend on the top applies to both panels. For each quantity, the experimental averages are represented by circles with error bars marking the 68% confidence intervals (equivalent to the standard error of the mean) obtained from bootstrapping with 999 samples. The shaded areas show the 68% confidence interval for the theoretical predictions, considering the uncertainty in the estimated temperature and tunnelling rate obtained from bootstrapping with 999 samples. The experimental data agree with the quantum field theory simulation results using Neumann boundary conditions and considering the finite imaging resolution.

First, we examine the decomposition of the generalized entropy production ΔΣ into βEΔEE and ΔS. The term associated with the energy dissipated to the environment, βEΔEE, revealed that a small amount of energy flowed into (or out of) the environment for small (or large) systems around ct/LS = 1. However, this term contributed only minimally to the irreversible post-quench dynamics of the quantum field. By contrast, the entropy change of the system, ΔS, dominated the dynamics and showed a clear linear increase up to ct/LS = 1, followed by more pronounced growth. Notably, in Fig. 2, we present only ΔΣ defined by this first decomposition. However, we also found good agreement with the second decomposition (Supplementary Fig. 2), thus providing evidence that the assumptions underlying Landauer's principle were well satisfied in our experiment.

In comparison to the first, the second decomposition involving ΔI and ΔD shed a slightly different focus on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The largest contribution to ΔΣ, the change in quantum mutual information, ΔI, exhibited similar behaviour to ΔS but with a higher magnitude. This increased magnitude was accounted for by the additional entropy change in the environment. However, ΔI competed with the term proportional to the change of the environment, ΔD, which accounted for both the entropic and energetic changes to the environment. This made ΔD a particularly interesting quantity for characterizing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the environment experimentally. In our case, ΔD decreased, otherwise mirroring the behaviour of ΔS, due to the small energetic contribution.

To interpret the results, we needed to consider the effects of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quantum field, as shown for the quantum field-theoretic simulations in Fig. 4. These boundary conditions can be contrasted with the curved backgrounds that gave rise to the effective boundary conditions discussed in refs. 19,34. The experimental system exhibited Neumann boundary conditions (∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0) due to the vanishing particle current at the edges. Plots contrasting the scaling with subregion size are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.

a,b, Time evolution of the quantities involved in Landauer's principle shown for Neumann boundary conditions (as relevant in the experiment) (a) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (b), using quantum field-theoretic simulations. We interpreted the post-quench dynamics of the global mass quench using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture, as discussed in the text. c,d, Energy density for Neumann boundary conditions (c) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (d). The energetic dynamics can be explained by the difference in the energy density of the initial state at the edges compared to that in the bulk. e, The linear increase in correlations for ct/LS < 1, followed by a plateau, and a linear decrease for ct/LE > 1, can be explained by the linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The effect of the zero mode, present for Neumann boundary conditions, was not captured by the quasiparticle picture for ct/LS > 1. BC, boundary conditions.

However, we first consider simulations with Dirichlet boundary conditions (φ(z)∣z=0,L = 0), which are simpler to understand. Here, the well-established semi-classical quasiparticle picture35 offers a clear and intuitive model for the post-quench dynamics of global mass quenches36,37. The propagation of short-range initial correlations is depicted as occurring through ballistically moving quasiparticles. Following the homogeneous global quench, the initial massive Klein–Gordon thermal state becomes a non-equilibrium state with excess energy relative to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution. This initial state acts as a source of quasiparticle pairs emitted globally from every point across the length of the composite system. Each pair in the bulk consists of two quasiparticles correlated with each other and moving in opposite directions at the same speed. For our set of parameters, due to the finite initial correlation length, there exists a small, localized region where quasiparticles are correlated.

In this quasiparticle picture, the change of quantum mutual information ΔI between the system and environment is proportional to the number of pairs of quasiparticles that are shared between the two different subregions. The spread of correlations of short-range interacting models is described by a linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The increase in correlations is, thus, proportional to the section of the light cone, or in other words, it is proportional to the distance between the quasiparticles of the pair emitted at the system–environment boundary (Fig. 4e). If the system is smaller than the environment, once the first quasiparticle of this boundary pair reaches the edge of the system at ct/LS = 1 and is reflected, the section of the system–environment boundary pair light cone remains constant. The behaviour of ΔI transitions to a plateau value. From a system perspective, the composite system appears to have locally equilibrated to a generalized Gibbs ensemble steady state30,38,39. For finite-size composite systems, the plateau eventually ends again at ct/LE = 1 when the other quasiparticle of the boundary pair reaches the edge. The distance between the two quasiparticles decreases until they meet again at ct/L = 1, which explains the phenomenon of recurrences32,40 (with respect to the correlation functions).

On the other hand, ΔI behaves differently for Neumann boundary conditions. Neumann boundary conditions introduce a zero mode, whose variance does not evolve harmonically like the other momentum modes but quadratically (phase diffusion41,42). The global fluctuations of the zero mode contribute to entropic quantities43, and as they increase with time after a quench, they eventually dominate the contribution of other modes. Because the quasiparticle picture cannot capture this zero-mode feature, its predictions for ct/LS > 1, when a plateau value should be reached, need to be modified under the present Neumann boundary conditions. The above features of the dynamics also apply to the change of system entropy ΔS. In addition, the zero mode restricts the validity of the tomography scheme to ct/L < 1.

The energetic contribution βEΔEE can also be explained using the quasiparticle picture. Initially, βEΔEE remains constant because quasiparticles travelling between the system and the environment carry the same amount of energy, resulting in zero net energy flux. However, a finite-size energy flow becomes apparent when quasiparticles from the edge of the system cross the system–environment boundary. The translational invariance of the homogeneous quench is broken due to the higher energy density at the edges of the composite system for Neumann boundary conditions (the reverse is true for Dirichlet boundary conditions, as the energy density is lower at the edges). This edge region has a size of the order of the initial correlation length. The resulting behaviour of the change of the environment ΔD reflects both the entropic and energetic fluxes.

In this study, we experimentally probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime following a global mass quench in an ultracold atom-based quantum field simulator. By reconstructing the dynamics of the state of the composite system, we examined the information-theoretic quantities related by Landauer's principle, which we interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our approach underscores the general utility of Landauer's principle for characterizing the irreversibility of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems. The way we expressed correlations in terms of entropic quantities with an information-theoretic meaning can be viewed as a vehicle to capture many-body correlations not in equilibrium. The Gaussian extremality argument may offer a pathway to extend our methodology to capture features of out-of-equilibrium processes in interacting models, despite the challenges posed by non-Gaussian effects. A recent alternative approach to studying interacting systems calculates classical entropies of marginal distributions instead of quantum entropies44,45, thereby avoiding the need for tomography. Looking forward, progress has already been made towards investigating a local quench involving two Bose–Einstein condensates at different temperatures being joined together46. This protocol represents a crucial primitive towards developing a quantum field thermal machine47, potentially allowing for Landauer erasure as a mechanism to reduce the entropy of a subregion in the quantum many-body regime, hence functioning as an effective cooling mechanism. Our current work demonstrates the potential of ultracold one-dimensional gases as test beds for quantum thermodynamics in the many-body regime, where complexity, quantum effects and finite size play a crucial role.

Consider a system S and an environment E with a bipartite Hilbert space \({{\mathcal{H}}}={{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{S}}}}\otimes {{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\). For an initial product state \({\varrho }_{{{\rm{SE}}}}={\varrho }_{{{\rm{S}}}}\otimes {\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}\), where the environment is in a thermal state \({\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}=\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}/{{\rm{Tr}}}[\operatorname{e}^{-{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}}]\), the entropy production under global unitary dynamics is given by7

Because it is expressed as a quantum relative entropy, Σ is non-negative due to Klein's inequality48, which is a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. More generally, as in our work, we start with a resourceful initial state that includes both initial correlations ISE(0) and athermality of the environment \(D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\). Although defining temperature for a non-equilibrium state is ambiguous, we determined the effective inverse temperature of the environment βE by demanding that the energy of the environment is equal to that of a Gibbs state, such that \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\equiv {{\rm{Tr}}}[{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\) (ref. 49). This choice also minimized the athermality term. Thus, we defined the resource cost of the initial state as13

Although there is no unique consensus on entropy production for initial non-equilibrium environment states50 and initial correlations51,52, we define Landauer's principle (equation (5)) in terms of generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0) as

This can be derived as in ref. 6. One caveat is that ΔΣ may not necessarily be non-negative, which is a necessary criterion for a strictly valid definition of entropy production. However, this makes sense, as ΔΣ may be considered to be a finite-difference version of the entropy production rate \(\Delta \varSigma =\varSigma (t)-\varSigma (0)=\int_{0}^{t}\,\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }\,({\mathrm{d}\varSigma ({t}^{{\prime} })}/{\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }})\), which also can be negative16,17. Thus, ΔΣ intuitively measures the ‘extra' irreversibility associated with the protocol, excluding the initial resources.

The experimental set-up consisted of a pair of tunnelling-coupled one-dimensional 87Rb quasicondensates, following a protocol implemented previously18. The magnetic fields required to trap the gas in a double-well potential were generated by an atom chip21, which achieved transverse trapping frequencies of ω⊥/2π = 1.4 kHz. After preparing a thermal equilibrium state at a temperature of 49 nK, all traps were turned off. Absorption imaging of the atoms was performed during a free-fall time of 15.6 ms and was used to measure the two-dimensional atomic density distributions. This procedure enabled us to detect the relative phase between the condensates across the length of the quasicondensate using matter interferometry (Fig. 1b). Owing to the destructive nature of the detection process, many repetitions of the experiment were necessary to accumulate numerous phase correlation images throughout the time evolution, thereby also ensuring statistically accurate expectation values.

As discussed in previous works18,23, two tunnelling-coupled quasicondensates can be used as a quantum field simulator of the one-dimensional sine-Gordon model. The relative degrees of freedom of two conjugate variables, the relative phase (φ) and relative density fluctuations (δρ), in the regime of low-energy collective excitations can be described by the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian:

In our experiment, the length of the composite system was set to L = 49 μm, and the mean density n1D = 70 μm−1. The coupling strength between the particles was chosen as g1D = 8.594 × 10−39 kg m3 s−2, and we had an atomic mass m = 1.433 × 10−25 kg. The initial single-particle tunnelling rate was J = 2π × 0.76 Hz. Under these parameters, the experimental system was sufficiently cold and strongly coupled, ensuring that the phase coherence length,

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T temperature, exceeds the healing length of the relative phase,

Hence, the cosine term in equation (11) can be expanded to second order, thus reducing the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian to the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian:

The post-quench evolution is then described by the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with J = 0.

The tomography scheme for reconstructing the initial thermal covariance matrix is detailed in refs. 18,26. Here, we extend this method to dynamically reconstruct the state over time. We provide a brief overview below. Given Neumann boundary conditions, ∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0, then in a box-like potential with length L and average linear atomic density n1D, the relative phase φ(z) and relative density fluctuations δρ(z) can be expanded in Fourier space in terms of the eigenfunctions, fkφ and fkρ, for each mode k:

The post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian (equation (14)) is diagonalized as (indices omitted for brevity from now on)

with u := 2g1D/(ℏL) and

The interaction strength g1D is given by

where as = 5.2 nm is the three-dimensional scattering length. Consequently, the time evolution of modes (k > 0) in Fourier space is

with a non-harmonic time evolution of the zero mode:

As mentioned in the main text and shown in Fig. 1, the covariance matrices can be dynamically tomographically reconstructed by measuring the relative phase profiles using matter interferometry at various times. Subsequently, the relative phase correlations were computed as \({\varPhi }_{m,n}^{2}(t)=\langle (\varphi ({z}_{m},t)-\varphi ({z}_{0},t))(\varphi ({z}_{n},t)-\varphi ({z}_{0},t))\rangle\) with z0 as a reference position. We then expanded this in Fourier space (equation (15)) and expanded the time-evolved operators to express the measured phase correlation function in terms of the covariance matrix elements before the time evolution:

where

Inserting the time evolution equations, we see that the covariance matrix Γ(t) can be obtained by fitting the elements Γφφ;k,l(t), Γρρ;k,l(t) and Γφρ;k,l(t) using the phase-space correlations:

By gathering statistics, we employed the same method as in ref. 18 and simply shifted the window of observation.

We obtained the covariance matrix in momentum space for the first N modes that give physical (positive) occupation numbers. The imaging system was accounted for by a Gaussian point spread function with a standard deviation of 3 μm to estimate the initial state. In this way, we also confirmed the global initial thermal state and extracted a pre-quench temperature. We used discrete cosine eigenfunctions to convert the momentum space correlators to real-space correlators, from which we computed the quantities of interest.

In this section, we delineate how the quantities in Landauer's principle, as expressed in equation (5), were computed using the full covariance matrix Γ in real space defined on a grid of N pixels. First, the von Neumann entropy S(Γ) was computed using the symplectic eigenvalues λn of the covariance matrix Γ (ref. 27). These eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvalues of iΩΓ, where

is the standard kernel of the symplectic form capturing the canonical commutation relations. The von Neumann entropy S(Γ) of a Gaussian state is given by

Given two full covariance matrices corresponding to different times, we partitioned them into system and environment subspace covariance matrices (Fig. 1c), which allowed us to compute the entropy change of the system ΔS and the mutual information ΔI.

Next, we illustrate how we calculated the energy of the environment with respect to the post-quench Hamiltonian. To obtain the correct environment Hamiltonian, we needed to proceed with care. The field corresponding to the environment was discretely defined with NE = N(LE/L) pixels. A naive approach would discretize the continuous Hamiltonian defined over the length of the environment, but this nearest-neighbour phase-coupling Hamiltonian would yield a nonlinear dispersion relation that inadequately describes the physics of the environment for the continuum model used in the experiment. Instead, we started from the environment Hamiltonian of the continuous theory, diagonalized it to obtain a momentum decomposition of infinitely many modes and then truncated the Hamiltonian53 of the environment to a form with a linear dispersion relation while retaining only NE modes:

with uE := 2g1D/(ℏLE) and

Converting back to real-space operators, we derived an effective resolution scale-dependent Hamiltonian:

where

encodes the long-range coupling of the effective Hamiltonian. Here, Δz ≔ L/N is the pixel size and NS(E) is the number of pixels for the system (environment).

The energy of the environment can then be calculated27 as \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]={{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varGamma }^{{{\rm{E}}}}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\), where \({\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\) is a matrix expression given by \({H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}={X}^\mathrm{T}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}X\), with \(X={(\varphi ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\varphi ({z}_{N-1}),\updelta \rho ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\updelta \rho ({z}_{N-1}))}^\mathrm{T}\). Thus, to calculate the energetic contribution βEΔEE, we needed to obtain the inverse temperature of the environment. As indicated in the previous section and detailed in ref. 18, we obtained the inverse temperature of the composite system with respect to the pre-quench Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian experimentally. Subsequently, we constructed the thermal state corresponding to this temperature in the continuum limit simulation. We obtained the inverse temperature of the environment βE for different subregion sizes by demanding that the energy of the environment matches that of a Gibbs state. We then interpolated the profile for each pixel. Note that the post-quench temperature is slightly higher than the temperature measured with respect to the pre-quench Hamiltonian and that βE > 0 is nearly homogeneous across different subregion sizes.

To calculate the energy of a Gibbs state for the environment in the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, we began with the partition function \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})={Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}){Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) (ref. 43), where \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) is the zero-mode partition function and \({Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\;{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\) is the harmonic-oscillator partition function. Because of the compactified nature of the field, the zero-mode partition function can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi-theta function. Given our experimental parameters, we approximated it as

The harmonic-oscillator partition function is

The energy is then \({E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})=-{\partial }_{{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}[\log {Z}_{{{\rm{E}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})]={E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{{\rm{zm}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})+{E}_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{{\rm{ho}}}}(\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}})\), where the zero-mode contribution to the energy is

which approximates to 1/(2βE) for our experimental parameters. The contribution of the harmonic oscillator to the energy is

Consequently, we expressed the quantum relative entropy of the environment state ϱE with respect to a Gibbs state at inverse temperature βE as

and we obtained ΔD accordingly.

Metrics details

Brain connectivity can be estimated in many ways, depending on modality and processing strategy. Here, we present the Krakencoder, a joint connectome mapping tool that simultaneously bidirectionally translates between structural and functional connectivity, and between different atlases and processing choices via a common latent representation. These mappings demonstrate exceptional accuracy and individual-level identifiability; the mapping between structural and functional connectivity has identifiability 42–54% higher than existing models. The Krakencoder combines all connectome flavors via a shared low-dimensional latent space. This fusion representation better reflects familial relatedness, preserves age- and sex-relevant information, and enhances cognition-relevant information. The Krakencoder can be applied, without retraining, to new out-of-distribution data while still preserving inter-individual differences in the connectome predictions and familial relationships in the latent representations. The Krakencoder is a notable leap forward in capturing the relationship between multimodal brain connectomes in an individualized, behaviorally and demographically relevant way.

The brain is a vastly complex, interconnected network of neurons (and other types of cells), the healthy function of which enables us to move, think, feel, and observe, as well as interact with our environment. Studying how the brain's connections relate to behavior, so-called brain connectome–behavior mapping, is crucial not only for understanding how the brain works generally but also for identifying biomarkers of disease, predicting outcomes in neurological disorders, and designing personalized interventions. Brain connectivity can be probed through various structural and functional neuroimaging techniques. Structural connectivity (SC) can be captured with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measures of white matter, or the anatomical wiring, that connects different brain regions. Functional connectivity (FC), as measured with blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI), quantifies the temporal similarity between brain regions' dynamic neural activity patterns, irrespective of their structural connection. The association between SC and FC is a subject of intense research, given that it is believed that structural pathways provide the backbone over which functional activation flows. Despite this, correlations of SC and FC are moderate at best. Understanding the relationship between SC and FC is key to deciphering how the brain's physical structure supports its dynamic functions and may offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying behavior, injury or disease, and recovery1,2,3,4.

There are many approaches to modeling the relationship between SC and FC, most of which focus on using SC to predict FC. These methods include biophysical models (for example, linked neural mass models5,6,7,8,9,10), graph theoretical models (for example, communication strategies11,12,13,14,15), statistical models (that is, models of SC and FC topological metrics16,17,18,19) and network control theory20,21,22,23. More recently, machine learning has been used to predict FC from SC24,25,26,27, predict SC from FC28, or to translate a connectivity estimate between parcellations29,30. Many of these studies have shown that metrics of SC–FC relationships vary with age, sex and behavioral variables16,27,31, or disease and/or injury and recovery4,32,33.

Among the challenges and considerations in modeling this relationship, the assumption that estimated SC is an objective, fixed constraint on possible FC patterns is increasingly questioned. Evidence suggests that the brain's functional dynamics can be highly flexible and adaptive, and may be driven by geometric factors not measured with SC34. Variability in SC estimation techniques, particularly in their sensitivity to detect faint or indirect connections, further complicates the interpretation of connectivity data. Moreover, the performance metrics and loss functions currently used in connectivity studies often fail to adequately account for inter-subject variability, potentially skewing the results and interpretations.

Despite the utility of modeling the relationship between connectomes, there is strong methodological disagreement in the literature as to how to extract the connectomes themselves from brain images35,36,37. Biases inherent in different processing choices, referred to here as ‘flavors', have been shown to lead to different or even contradictory conclusions38,39. Each connectome flavor may differ in how the brain is parcellated into regions, how potential noise, artifacts, or confounds are removed, and how the connectivity between regions is quantified, among other methodological choices. Furthermore, connectome data from different studies are often shared only in certain flavors, making comparisons between datasets challenging.

In this work, our fundamental assumption is that each set of choices in the imaging and processing pipelines provides a different view of the same underlying system. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in multi-view learning40, we develop and share a tool called ‘Krakencoder' that provides a way to combine these choices (that is, connectome fusion), and thus create a more comprehensive representation of the brain's connectivity. Deriving a unified latent representation from within-modality and/or across modality connectome estimates may enable reconciliation of differing views of the same underlying network to overcome limitations and combine benefits from various processing choices. Krakencoder is a ‘universal' brain connectivity encoding architecture capable of transforming connectivity estimates between parcellations, estimation techniques and modalities with high precision. Importantly, the Krakencoder is able to preserve inter-individual differences in a way that is behaviorally and demographically relevant. This element is crucial if we are to use the Krakencoder to improve our understanding of how brain structure and function and their interplay maps to behavior, impairment, or recovery after disease or injury.

The Krakencoder architecture consists of a set of encoders and decoders that enable transformation of each connectivity type into every other connectivity type via a common low-dimensional latent representation (Fig. 1). The Krakencoder was trained to optimize for both reconstruction accuracy and preservation of individual differences. The latter was achieved by enforcing latent-space representations of different connectivity types from the same subject to be close to one another and far from other subjects' latent space connectome representations. The model was trained on resting-state FC and white-matter SC data from 683 healthy young adults (366 female, aged 28.6 ± 3.8 years) from the Human Connectome Project, validated during training on 79 held-out subjects (43 female, aged 29.1 ± 3.8 years), and finally tested on 196 subjects (107 female, aged 29.1 ± 3.6 years). Care was taken to ensure that no siblings spanned the divisions, because this data leakage can lead to over-optimistic model performance. Connectivity flavors consist of three parcellations (with 86, 268 and 439 regions), three common FC estimates (Pearson correlation, Pearson correlation following global signal regression, and regularized partial correlation), and two SC estimates (volume-normalized streamline counts from deterministic and probabilistic tractography), for a total of 15.

a, Autoencoder pathii: connectivity flavor i to connectivity flavor i. This path begins by stacking the upper triangular portion of each subject's connectivity matrix into input \({X}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{{\rm{edges}}}\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\). A precomputed, fixed PCA transformation normalizes the data and reduces dimensionality to \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{256\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\), equalizing the size of disparate input flavors. A single fully connected layer Encoderi, followed by L2 normalization, transforms \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) into a latent hypersphere surface \({z}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{128\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\). Batch-wise encoding loss Lz(zi) controls inter-subject separation in latent space. A single fully connected layer Decoderi transforms zi to \({\hat{X}}_{i}^{{\prime} }\), and batch-wise reconstruction loss \({L}_{r}({X}_{i}^{{\prime} },{\hat{X}}_{i}^{{\prime} })\) and Lz(zi) are backpropagated to optimize Encoderi and Decoderi. b, Transcoder pathij: connectivity flavor i to connectivity flavor j. This path converting input flavor i to output flavor j begins the same as pathii, transforming \({X}_{i}\to {X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\to {z}_{i}\), then Decoderj transforms \({z}_{i}\to {\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\), and reconstruction loss \({L}_{r}({X}_{j}^{{\prime} },{\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} })\) is backpropagated to optimize Encoderi and Decoderj. c, Cross-path latent-space similarity optimization. The latent similarity loss Lz.sim(zi, zj, zk, …) provides explicit control to ensure that the latent representations of each subject are consistent across connectivity flavors. See Extended Data Table 1 for details about the loss terms. d, Multimodality fusion predictions from averaged latent space vectors. For these predictions we average the encoded latent vector from all input flavors (as in the fusion model), or a subset of input flavors (as in the fusionSC model, which averages latent vectors from only the SC inputs), and then decode this average vector to all output flavors. The fusion-parc model demonstrates cross-parcellation prediction, by averaging inputs from only the other parcellations.

We create a separate encoder and decoder for each of the 15 connectivity flavors and then train the model to predict each flavor from each other flavor. There are 225 total training paths, including 15 autoencoders that map between the same flavor (Fig. 1a) and 210 transcoders that predict one flavor from another (Fig. 1b). Each encoder is a single fully connected linear layer, followed by L2 normalization that constrains the latent representation to the surface of a 128-dimensional hypersphere. Each decoder is a single fully connected linear layer. Dimensionality of the connectivity flavors varies between parcellations, which could lead to an imbalance in the training to favor higher dimension connectivity flavors. We balanced the contributions of each flavor by reducing each connectivity input to 256 dimensions using a precomputed principal component analysis (PCA), derived using only training data to avoid leakage between train and test sets. Reconstruction loss for each training path includes both Pearson correlation and Euclidean distance (Extended Data Table 1). We include a contrastive component to the correlation and Euclidean loss functions, to explicitly preserve inter-subject variability of predicted connectomes. A contrastive loss term is applied to the latent representation as well, to further promote inter-subject variability of the representations. The term ‘contrastive' here refers to a penalty that attempts to force the same subject's reconstructed and latent space connectomes close to each other and far apart from other individuals' representations. Finally, we include an intra-subject latent space consistency loss to maximize the similarity of the latent representations from each connectome flavor for a given subject (Fig. 1c). This combination of loss functions enabled us to fine-tune the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and inter-subject variability (Extended Data Fig. 1b), and to condition the latent space representation.

During model inference, the Krakencoder predicts each of the 15 connectivity flavors from any other, transforming predictions that exist in the reduced 256-dimensional space to their higher native dimensions using the inverse of the precomputed PCA transforms. The model can also combine information from multiple connectomes by averaging their latent space representations to obtain a ‘fusion' representation; this fusion representation can then be decoded to predict all 15 connectome flavors. The encoding and averaging step in the fusion process can include all available connectome flavors, or a subset of flavors to, for example, predict FC flavors from the fusion latent representation of all SC flavors or vice versa (‘fusionSC' or ‘fusionFC', Fig. 1d), or to predict one parcellation using inputs from the averaged latent representations of all other parcellations (‘fusion-parc', Fig. 1d). The fusion-parc version is particularly informative if one is using the Krakencoder to translate connectome data to a desired atlas on which it had not been computed.

Given the high degree of similarity of measured connectomes to each other and to the population mean, we assess our connectome predictions using complementary measures of prediction identifiability (top-1 accuracy and average rank percentile, or avgrank, equation (4)) and de-meaned correlation (Pearson correlation after subtracting the population mean, or avgcorrdemean, equation (2)). The accuracy of the Krakencoder's connectome predictions was evaluated on 196 held-out test subjects.

The average rank percentile for FCs predicted from FCs of different parcellations or connectivity estimations (FC → FC) shows near-perfect identifiability (Fig. 2b, upper section, upper left block, mean = 1.0). Similarly, SC → SC predictions have near-perfect identifiability (upper section, lower right block, mean = 0.99). Inter-modality predictions performed worse than within-modality, but still far exceeding chance (random chance for avgrank is 0.5), with an overall average rank identifiability of 0.82 for SC → FC (lower left block) and 0.85 for FC → SC (upper right block). In general, we find that better avgrank prediction identifiability coincides with connectome sparsity, with higher dimensional parcellations (for example, the Coco439 atlas) and more sparse FC estimates (FCpcorr) being more easily identifiable. The avgcorrdemean metric (Fig. 2c) shows an average of 0.38 for FC → FC, and an average of 0.35 for SC → SC. Inter-modality predictions are again more difficult, with an overall avgcorrdemean of 0.16 for FC → SC of 0.16 and 0.09 for SC → FC. Lower dimensional parcellations generally had higher avgcorrdemean. Higher dimensional atlases are likely to be better at capturing inter-individual variability in the functional boundaries within an atlas and thus have higher identifiability, while lower dimensional atlases are likely to benefit from higher signal-to-noise ratio in the measured regional SC and FC and thus have smaller reconstruction error when mapping between flavors.

Heatmaps in a–c show connectome prediction performance from each source flavor (row) to each target flavor (column). Flavors consist of three parcellations (the 86-region FreeSurfer atlas (FS86), the 268-region Shen atlas (sh268) and the 439-region CocoHCP439 atlas (coco439 or co439)), three FC estimates (Pearson (FC), global signal regressed Pearson (FCgsr) and regularized partial correlation (FCpc)), and two SC estimates (deterministic tractography (SCdt) and probabilistic tractography (SCpr)). The Average row is the mean of performance metrics for all sources in the column above. The Fusion row shows predictions from the average latent vector from all 15 connectome flavors (Fig. 1d). FusionFC and FusionSC are predicted from the average of nine FC or six SC latent vectors, respectively. Fusion-parc predicts each parcellation from the average of all parcellations except itself. a, Connectome prediction: top-1 accuracy. This measures the fraction of test subjects whose predicted connectome is closer to their own measured connectome than to any other subject's measured connectome. Chance level is 1/196 = 0.005. b, Average rank percentile. This measures the fraction of other subjects' measured connectomes that are further from the target subject's predicted connectome than the target subject's own measured connectome. This rank percentile is then averaged across subjects. The chance level is 0.5. c, Average corr(\(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ, \(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ). This is the average correlation of each subject's measured and predicted connectomes, after subtracting the population mean (avgcorrdemean). d, Baseline using related subjects as prediction. For each subject sa, we select an age- and sex-matched individual sb of a given relatedness (unrelated, sibling, dizygotic (DZ) or monozygotic (MZ) twin, or self-retest) and consider the measured connectome from sb as the prediction for sa. For each relatedness level, we compare the set of pseudo-predictions to measured connectomes using each performance metric, as though they were predictions from our model. Thus, we can observe the reliability and utility of each flavor and performance metric, and provide multiple baselines for evaluating model performance. We also show performance using the population mean for each flavor (‘pop. mean') as pseudo-prediction, which for the avgcorr metric (bottom) exceeds self-retest, but for all other metrics is zero or chance.

Predictions of regularized partial correlation FC (FCpcorr) had the highest avgrank, but the lowest avgcorrdemean among FC flavors, which reflects the noise inherent in this estimate, even with regularization, but also an increased sparsity that drives identifiability. SC predicted from FCpcorr yielded consistently better performance than other FC inputs, likely to be due to the increased sparsity and removal of nonspecific correlations. The best single FC input for predicting all SC flavors was the Shen268 FCpcorr, which predicts Coco439 SCpr (probabilistic SC) with an avgrank of 0.99 and avgcorrdemean of 0.19. The best single SC input for predicting all FC flavors was the Coco439 SCpr. The fusion-parc predictions exclude inputs of the same parcellation from the averaged latent vectors, and their relatively high values demonstrate the level of shared information across flavors within the Krakencoder's unified latent space.

In assessing the spatial variability of prediction accuracy, we find that regions with higher measurement reliability (for example, default mode) also have higher prediction accuracy (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, high-level association cortex has higher prediction accuracy than low-level sensorimotor cortex (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Spearman r = 0.249, Pspin = 0.019, 10,000 spin-test rotations). Conversely, as shown in previous work, regional structure–function coupling is lower for higher level cortex16,19 (Extended Data Fig. 4b, Spearman r = −0.191, Pspin = 0.116). This latter relationship primarily reflects the relationship between population-average SC and FC rather than predicting inter-individual variability.

Finally, we show that the Krakencoder's fusion prediction also preserves the network properties of the measured connectomes. Extended Data Fig. 5 shows the Spearman correlation between the measured connectomes' network properties (mean node strength, mean betweenness centrality, characteristic path length and modularity) and the Krakencoder's predicted connectomes' network properties, across 196 held-out individuals in the test set. The three fusion representations are used as input and each of the 15 connectome flavors as output; correlations between measured network metrics from the various familial relatedness groups are shown as comparison. The Krakencoder's predicted connectomes generally preserve the network properties of the measured connectomes as well as or better than the correlation between network properties extracted from identical twins (that is, monozygotic) or two scans of the same individual (self-retest).

The fusionSC-parc and fusionFC-parc rows in Fig. 2a–c represent the accuracy of the Krakencoder when predicting an SC or FC connectome flavor from all other SC or FC flavors (excluding those from the predicted parcellation). If we compare this directly with Fig. 2d, we can see how the Krakencoder's predicted connectome accuracy compares with several baseline estimates: measured connectomes from age- and sex-matched individuals who are unrelated, family members (non-twin siblings, dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twins), retest sessions from the same individual (self-retest), or the population mean connectome. For instance, the self-retest row in the Fig. 2d heatmaps can be considered as a measurement reliability ceiling, while the ‘unrelated' row shows the performance that can be explained by age- and sex-matching alone. Within a modality, top-1 accuracies (ranging from 0.93 to 1 for fusionFC-parc → FC and 0.83–0.97 for fusionSC-parc → SC) and average rank percentiles (all equal to 1 for fusionFC-parc and fusionSC-parc) in Fig. 2a and 2b are similar to the self-retest identifiability (when connectomes derived from imaging the same person twice are used to perform the identification), and better than the identifiability of individuals who are genetically identical (MZ twins). Similarly, the diagonal entries in Fig. 2c, representing the autoencoder avgcorrdemean for each flavor, range from 0.13 to 0.74, which is comparable to the self-retest noise ceiling (0.15–0.81), and are larger than the ‘MZ twin' row (0.07–0.47, a 40–110% increase). This indicates that the autoencoders with a 128-dimensional bottleneck preserve more inter-subject connectome variability than can be explained by identical genetics, and approximately the same amount of variability as expected when measuring the connectome from the same individual twice. The fusionSC and fusionFC rows in Fig. 2c represent the avgcorrdemean for the unified SC (or FC) → FC (or SC) connectome predictions, with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.16 for SC → FC and 0.16–0.26 depending on the flavor. These exceed the similarity observed in the sibling or ‘DZ twin' row from the avgcorrdemean subpanel in Fig. 2d, indicating that predicting FC from our unified SC representation preserves more inter-subject FC variability than can be explained by age, sex and 50% genetic similarity.

We next tested whether the Krakencoder latent space preserves inter-subject variation related to family structure as well as demographic and behavioral features. We examined the inter-subject similarity of latent space representations for pairs of age- and sex-matched unrelated individuals, non-twin siblings, DZ and MZ twins, and self-retest, along with inter-subject similarity of observed connectomes (Fig. 3a). By comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) separability of each pair of violin plots, we see that separation is greater for the Krakencoder latent space than for the observed connectomes, with statistical significance for unrelated versus sibling, DZ versus MZ twins, and MZ versus unrelated (Pperm = 0 to 0.015, two-sided permutation test with 10,000 permutations, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected across all 30 comparisons).

a, Inter-subject similarity of latent space representations and observed SC and FC data, stratified by family relationship. Each violin plot shows the distribution of inter-subject similarity for age- and sex-matched pairs for each familial relationship (n = 60 sibling pairs, 26 DZ, 58 MZ), as well as unrelated pairs (n = 8,694) and self-retest (n = 37). Due to the high baseline similarity in observed data, latent and observed data similarity measures were independently z-scored by the mean and standard deviation of the similarity of unrelated subjects for visual comparison. Separability of each pair of violins within a modality was computed as the area under the ROC curve. Separability estimates for a given relationship pair from the latent space and observed data were statistically compared using a permutation test, where bars show family-level pairs where latent space separability exceeds observed data separability (Pperm = 0 to 0.015, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 30 comparisons). b, Prediction accuracy of demographic and cognitive metrics from different subsets of the Krakencoder's latent space and observed SC and FC data. Variability of prediction accuracy was assessed through bootstrap resampling (n = 100). Bar height, box and whiskers represent the mean, 50% and 90% bootstrap confidence intervals, respectively. *Significant difference between prediction accuracy from latent space and the observed data (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 18 comparisons). Bal.Acc, balanced accuracy.

To demonstrate the preservation of demographically and behaviorally relevant features in the Krakencoder latent space, we trained linear models to predict individuals' age, sex and cognitive scores (‘total', ‘fluid', ‘crystallized' and ‘early childhood' composite scores from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) toolbox) from the Krakencoder latent space, and compared them with the same predictions based on observed connectome data. Linear kernel ridge regression models for each variable were built from the mean latent vectors (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC, each of which is nsubj × 128) or from the average inter-subject cosine similarity of observed data (that is, the average of 9 FC, 6 SC or 15 SC + FC nsubj × nsubj matrices) (Fig. 3b). The Krakencoder and observed connectome data predict sex with a similar balanced accuracy of ≥0.93. The Krakencoder latent space predicts age with Pearson r ≥ 0.5 (fusionFC r = 0.50, mean absolute error (MAE) = 2.35; fusionSC r = 0.51, MAE = 2.57; fusionFCSC r = 0.58, MAE = 2.33), similar to the predictions from observed data (observed FC r = 0.57, MAE = 2.31; observed SC r = 0.49, MAE = 2.58; observed FC + SC r = 0.59, MAE = 2.33). For age prediction, fusionSC outperformed observed SC, and observed FC outperformed fusionFC (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across all 18 comparisons), but the observed data and fusion SCFC models performed similarly. The Krakencoder latent space predictions significantly outperformed the observed data model predictions for predicting all cognitive composite scores (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test with 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across all 18 comparisons).

Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine which brain areas' connections played the largest role in the accuracy of the Krakencoder's connectome mapper, and in the accuracy of the models predicting age, sex or total cognition from the Krakencoder latent space (Fig. 4a). These analyses demonstrate how the Krakencoder may be used to understand the biological underpinnings of, for example, SC to FC relationships, or which brain networks may play the largest role in predicting cognition.

a, Brain network masking and analysis workflow. We estimate the sensitivity of the Krakencoder's prediction accuracy to regions in a given Yeo functional network by replacing all connectome edge values not in that network with the population mean, and feeding these masked connectomes into the connectome and demographic predictions. The accuracy after masking reveals the amount of information that the particular network's regional connections have in the mapping and the demographic and behavioral predictions. Upper right panel shows the overall number of edges in each network. bal.acc, balanced accuracy; Cbm, cerebellum; Con, control; DA, dorsal attention; Def, default; Lim, limbic; SM, somatomotor; Sub, subcortex; S/VA, salience/ventral attention; Vis, visual. b, Masked connectome predictions. Connectome prediction identifiability (avgrank, top) and reconstruction accuracy (avgcorrdemean, bottom) using only the connections to and from regions within each brain network shows how much information the model is utilizing from each network when predicting whole-brain connectomes. The Non-masked column on the right shows performance using original connectomes without masking. Values that are lower indicate that the network's connections do not contribute as much to the accuracy of the Krakencoder's mapping. c, Similarly, predicting subject sex (top), age (middle), and total cognition (bottom) from masked input data shows the relative amount of information that the connections to and from regions in each network contain about those demographic and cognitive features.

By examining the mean avgrank and avgcorrdemean when retaining only the individual-level values of those networks' connections, we see that default mode network connections appear important for mapping accuracy, particularly for the fusion → all and fusionFC → SC (Fig. 4b). Connections to and from regions in the somatomotor network and subcortex seem to be more informative for fusionSC → FC than for fusionFC → SC. Together, these heatmaps illustrate that although connections to a single network contain much of the information needed to identify an individual's connectome (for example, avgrank from default mode network inputs is 98% of that from the non-masked input), it is not sufficient to numerically recreate all of the missing connections (for example, avgcorrdemean from default mode network retains 66% of the non-masked input). This may arise from a combination of factors including the difficulty of predicting so many missing features, and the measurement noise of those predicted features.

In Fig. 4c we see the largest retention in accuracy for predicting sex when functional and structural connections to and from regions in the default mode network and structural connections to and from the subcortex are retained. Age was best predicted using functional connections to and from the salience and ventral attention network, and structural connections to and from the subcortex. Total cognition was best predicted by functional connections to and from regions in default mode and dorsal attention networks, and by structural connections to and from regions in the visual network.

To assess generalizability of the Krakencoder to new datasets, we applied our frozen, pretrained Krakencoder model to data from the multi-site Human Connectome Project (HCP) Lifespan study41,42,43, including both the Development cohort (HCP-D) and the Aging cohort (HCP-A). These two studies differ from the original HCP young adult (YA) study in both subject demographics (ages 8–21 years for HCP-D and 36–100+ years for HCP-A versus 22–37 years for HCP-YA) and acquisition parameters, with voxel sizes and scan durations more similar to those used in typical neuroimaging studies. To account for domain shift, we linearly mapped the population mean of each connectome flavor to the population mean of the HCP-YA training subjects before applying the HCP-YA-derived PCA dimensionality reduction and Krakencoder latent space projection. Despite the demographic and acquisition differences, the Krakencoder still predicts connectome flavors with high accuracy and precision (Fig. 5a–d). Within-modality connectome prediction identifiability remained high for both HCP-D and HCP-A (avgrank > 0.96). Inter-modal prediction identifiability was reduced 6–12% compared with held-out HCP-YA subjects, although with avgrank > 0.75 it was still well above chance. Intra-modal avgcorrdemean was reduced by 10–26%, while inter-modal avgcorrdemean was 30–50% lower than that for held-out HCP-YA. Thus, despite the reduction in prediction accuracy due to substantial differences in age and acquisition, the Krakencoder model still performs well above chance and preserves inter-individual differences when mapping between connectome flavors.

a–d, Heatmaps of connectome prediction performance for subjects from the HCP-Development study (ages 8–21 years) (a,b) and the HCP-Aging study (ages 36–100 years) (c,d). The Krakencoder model applied was trained on HCP-YA data (ages 22–37 years) and frozen; no retraining or fine-tuning was performed. a,c, Average rank percentile (Fig. 2b). This is the fractional rank of the similarity (Pearson correlation) of a subject's predicted and measured connectomes compared with all other measured connectomes, averaged across subjects (random chance, 0.5). b,d, Average corr (\(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ, \(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ). Average correlation of each subject's measured and predicted connectomes, after subtracting the population mean. e, Sibling similarity from the HCP-Development study. Connectomes from 76 sibling pairs in HCP-D are more similar than age- and sex-matched unrelated pairs, with the latent space similarity of the sibling pairs being significantly more separable from that of the unrelated pairs than in the observed data. Each violin plot shows the distribution of inter-subject similarity for sibling pairs or pairs of unrelated individuals with matching age and sex disparity. As in Fig. 3a, latent and observed connectome similarity were independently normalized for visualization. Separability was measured using ROC analysis, and significance was assessed using permutation testing. For all three fusion types (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC), siblings were more similar in the Krakencoder's latent space than in the observed data (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across three comparisons).

The HCP-D dataset contains 76 sibling pairs (50 same-sex, 26 opposite sex, Δage 0–9 years), therefore we performed a familial similarity analysis similar to that for HCP-YA. In Fig. 5e we show that siblings were more separable from age- and sex-matched individuals in latent space than in the observed data for all three fusion types (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC) (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 3 comparisons). Finally, we performed a regression analysis to predict age, sex and cognition in the HCP-D and HCP-A datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6). New predictive models using the same approach as that for the HCP-YA predictions were fitted and cross-validated for each of the two new datasets. As with HCP-YA, sex was predicted very accurately by both latent and observed data models (balanced held-out test accuracy = 0.86–0.95). Age was predicted with much higher accuracy in HCP-D and HCP-A than in HCP-YA (HCP-D r = 0.84–0.95, MAE = 1.45–1.72; HCP-A r = 0.76–0.85, MAE = 6.13–6.52 on held-out test data), likely to be due to the much larger age range and larger age-related changes during development and aging. Cognitive score prediction performance for the HCP-A data was similar to or better than HCP-YA, perhaps due to larger age-related cognitive effects, but performance was considerably worse for the HCP-D dataset. This decrease in predictive ability was especially pronounced when predicting cognition from SC, in which accuracy (Pearson's r) from latent and observed data models was not significantly greater than 0. For all other predictions, observed data models performed significantly better than those on the Krakencoder latent space (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 18 comparisons), although the Krakencoder predictions remained well above chance.

We aim to further test Krakencoder's biological plausibility by applying it to connectomic data from individuals with pathological changes in the brain's structural and functional connections. We extracted SC and FC from 100 individuals with multiple sclerosis (age, 22–71 years, 45.5 ± 11.4 years; 66% female; disease duration 12.97 ± 8.07 years), an autoimmune disease that results in lesions primarily in the brain's white matter44. This disease has also been associated with changes in SC and FC that are related to individuals' disability levels45,46. The fMRI and dMRI acquisitions for these patients had substantially lower spatial, temporal and angular resolution than the HCP-YA or HCP-Lifespan data (Extended Data Table 2). We fed the observed, pathological SC and FC into the corresponding arms of the frozen Krakencoder to obtain a fusionSC and fusionFC, from which we predicted the various FC or SC flavors. We found that the average rank identifiability of the Krakencoder's predicted FC (from the fusionSC) was up to 83%, which was higher than the identifiability of the observed SC to observed FC (calculated within the same atlas), which was at most 55% (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). Mapping the fusionFC, calculated from fMRI in the patients with multiple sclerosis, to the various SC flavors using the Krakencoder had around the same identifiability (up to 69%) as the mapping between observed FC to SC (up to 67%). Higher prediction performance for SC → FC than FC → SC is consistent with our out-of-sample HCP-Lifespan results. Using the current model and a simplistic approach to domain adaptation, our multiple sclerosis FC data appear less well matched to the HCP-YA FC training data than multiple sclerosis SC, or either HCP-Lifespan dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1c). This mismatch, due in part to differences in fMRI and dMRI acquisition, may explain the increased difficulty in making predictions from these inputs. Overall, these results show that even though the Krakencoder was trained on young, healthy individuals, it can still represent with good fidelity the relationship between connectomes in individuals with pathology. Importantly, it may indeed better capture the mapping from SC to FC than the observed connectome data itself. This provides evidence of the biological plausibility of the Krakencoder's architecture and hints at its possible clinical relevance in capturing low-dimensional representations of disease pathology.

Although the prediction of FC from SC is not the only application of our model, this route of prediction is among the most commonly studied problems in brain connectivity mapping. To compare our current Krakencoder model with this previous literature, we gathered a few recent studies that used different approaches to predict FC from SC. The first is a deep neural network proposed by Sarwar et. al24 (‘deepnet') and the second is a graph neural network from Neudorf et. al25 (‘graphnet').

By both the avgrank and avgcorrdemean metrics, the predictions from our model outperform both the deepnet and graphnet models across all connectome flavors and parcellations (Extended Data Fig. 7). Specifically, the Krakencoder avgrank was 17–86% higher (average 42%) than the deepnet or graphnet models for the same single SC inputs, and 18–90% higher (average 54%) using the fusionSC input to predict each FC flavor. Krakencoder avgcorrdemean was 1–890% higher (average 335%) than either model using single SC inputs, and 25–980% higher (average 450%) using fusionSC. Similarly, the accuracy of network properties for FC predicted by Krakencoder exceeded that from either alternative SC to FC framework. These particular results highlight the special emphasis of the Krakencoder on preservation of individual differences when mapping from SC to FC.

Given a new connectivity flavor computed on the same training subjects as the pretrained model, we can train a new autoencoder with an additional loss term to align the new latent representation with the precomputed fusion latent representation (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To illustrate this capability we extended our model to new data from a previously unseen parcellation (cc200, ref. 47), with bandpass-filtered time series for FC (original flavors use a high-pass filter) and un-normalized streamline count for SC (original flavors use pairwise volume normalization). Prediction identifiability and reconstruction accuracy are comparable to the original 15 flavors (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Unlike the training of the original 225-path model, which takes up to 30 hours on a GPU (graphics processing unit), the addition of each new flavor takes only 1–2 minutes without a GPU. In this example, we used the original 683 HCP-YA training subjects, but this model-extension technique can use any population for which we have already computed the Krakencoder latent representation.

Previous work in mapping between connectomes, mostly predicting FC from SC, has largely focused on optimizing accuracy in the model predictions by maximizing the correlation between predicted and measured FC. We argue here that over-emphasis on this metric can result in a model that predicts FC that is close to the population mean and/or does not preserve individual differences. The deepnet model did incorporate into its loss function a term that aimed to reduce inter-subject similarity of predicted FC24. However, it appears that this only pushed the individual FC predictions away from one another and not toward the particular individual's measured connectomes, given that its identifiability was just above chance. The Krakencoder's connectome predictions, however, achieve perfect average rank identifiability within the same connectome modality, and consistently high average rank identifiability when predicting FC from SC. Other modeling work has shown that regional SC–FC coupling follows a functional gradient wherein the coupling is highest in visual and somatomotor networks and lowest in higher-order association networks16,19.

The Krakencoder has many novel aspects, including its ability to translate between connectome flavors without requiring raw data. This is useful when researchers only have access to a connectome from a particular pipeline or atlas and need it in another. One previously developed tool called CAROT does enable translation of FC from one atlas to another without requiring the raw data30; however, that tool does not enable translation of connectomes between different processing pipelines or mapping between SC and FC. There is no specific FC or SC processing pipeline that has been agreed upon by the field; many researchers choose one pipeline and replicate on others. The ability of the Krakencoder to predict other flavors within the same modality suggests a common, latent connectomic backbone that gives rise to each FC or SC flavor when a given parcellation or connectome estimation strategy is used. The Krakencoder's fusion functionality removes the burden of having to choose one pipeline or replicate findings on several different pipelines and attempt to make general conclusions. More than that, we believe that the fusion of various snapshots of the underlying connectome increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the connectome representations and perhaps becomes more than the sum of its parts. This latter statement is supported by the finding that models predicting cognition from the fused latent space representations outperformed models based on the observed connectome data; age and sex predictions were similar between the models but these are generally easier to predict compared with cognitive scores. As we have demonstrated, the Krakencoder's signal-to-noise ratio boosting effect can be especially useful when the tool is applied to connectomes extracted from lower quality data, which is often the case in clinical populations.

The Krakencoder is robust when applied to completely new, out-of-distribution data from individuals across the lifespan (8–100+ years of age) and from adults with pathological changes to their connectomes (individuals with multiple sclerosis). The frozen model (trained on young adult data) still retained a high level of identifiability and explained variance when mapping between connectomes from the HCP-D, HCP-A and multiple sclerosis datasets. The Krakencoder appears somewhat impervious to the sweeping connectomic changes that occur throughout human development, aging and, to a certain extent, disease processes48,49. The inter-modality predictions become more difficult when new datasets are less consistent with the training data, with the current model more sensitive to domain mismatch in prediction inputs than outputs. The drop in demographic predictions of the latent space for the HCP-D, HCP-A and multiple sclerosis data could mean that the Krakencoder may benefit from further training (perhaps fine-tuning) using lifespan and/or disease data.

Future work will apply the Krakencoder to predict connectomes under other clinical conditions, and further explore the relationship between the common latent representation and factors of neuroscientific or clinical relevance. We will also create a fine-tuning procedure to further increase the robustness of the Krakencoder when applied to novel datasets, to promote its wider applicability, particularly in datasets that contain pathology such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. We have demonstrated the ability to train encoding and decoding arms for new connectome flavors, but the Krakencoder could also be adapted to data from other modalities (magneto- or electro-encephalography) or even to explicitly capture demographic and/or behavioral information so that the latent space may be used more effectively for brain–behavior mapping. While we purposefully chose atlases that were derived in varied ways, that is, using anatomical versus functional information, there still may be disagreement in the labeling of regions across subjects. However, by translating between and fusing SC and FC derived from all atlases, the Krakencoder attempts to identify a latent organizational representation that underlies those observed in different overlapping parcellation schemes. In the context of SC–FC coupling, we do not think that these atlas choices prevent its accurate evaluation within an individual, given that we are using the same parcellation for both SC and FC. Finally, while this first proof-of-concept work focused on applying the Krakencoder to static FC, we know that brain activity is flexible and adapts to task demands, varied states, and pharmacological manipulations. Further work will investigate the adaptation of the Krakencoder to better reflect dynamic changes that occur in brain networks.

The data for this study come from the original Human Connectome Project (HCP)50 and the HCP Lifespan studies41,42,43, which together include high-resolution 3 T MRI data for 2,490 healthy participants aged 8–100+ years. Primary model training and testing was performed using data from 958 subjects from the original young adult HCP study (HCP-YA), aged 22–37 years, which includes MZ and DZ twin pairs as well as non-twin siblings. For benchmarking performance, we include a subset of 40 HCP-YA subjects who returned for a complete retest session 1–11 months after their initial session. The HCP-Development (HCP-D, 608 subjects, aged 8–21 years, including 76 pairs of non-twin siblings) and HCP-Aging (HCP-A, 716 subjects aged 36–100 years) cohorts from HCP Lifespan were used to evaluate our pretrained model on out-of-sample, out-of-distribution data. HCP Lifespan data differ from HCP-YA in both age range and acquisition parameters, with Lifespan acquiring less than half as much fMRI and dMRI data as HCP-YA. HCP Lifespan studies were also collected across four different sites using standard MRI scanners while the HCP-YA data were all acquired on a custom MRI scanner at a single site. See Extended Data Table 2 for demographic and acquisition details. For all three datasets, we excluded subjects with incomplete resting-state fMRI or dMRI, and subjects with known acquisition or quality control issues.

All resting-state fMRI time series were preprocessed by HCP using the minimal preprocessing pipeline51, which includes motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, coregistration to anatomy and nonlinear template space (FMRIB Software Library (FSL) MNI152 template, 6th generation), as well as automated denoising using ICA-FIX52. We used a custom post-processing pipeline to identify motion and global signal outlier timepoints (global signal > 5σ, motion derivative >0.9 mm), regress out tissue-specific nuisance time series (five eigenvectors each from eroded white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks53) and motion-related time series (24 in total, including six motion parameters, their backward derivatives, and the squares of both54), and temporally filter (high-pass >0.01 Hz for HCP-YA, >0.008 Hz for HCP-A/D, using DCT (discrete cosine transform) projection), and parcellate time series using each atlas. Outlier timepoints were excluded from nuisance regression and temporal filtering. Regional time series for each brain region were obtained by averaging voxels in the denoised time series data. Regional time series for each of the four (for HCP-YA) or two (for HCP-Lifespan) scans were variance-normalized and concatenated, and Pearson correlation between regional time series (excluding outlier timepoints) resulted in a region × region resting-state FC matrix for each subject. We also computed an FC matrix with global signal regression, FCgsr, by regressing the mean gray matter time series and its temporal derivative from each regional time series before computing region × region Pearson correlation.

Finally, we computed a Tikhonov-regularized partial correlation FCpcorr (or FCpc) that minimizes the average Euclidean norm between subject FCpcorr and the population mean of the unregularized precision matrices36:

For the Shen268 and Coco439 atlases, the target \(\overline{\Omega }\) was computed by averaging the pseudoinverse of each subject FC rather than the inverse. A different λ was identified for each atlas, based on the 700 training subjects from HCP-YA. Optimal λ was 0.06 for FS86, 0.15 for Shen268 and 0.25 for Coco439. For the HCP-A, HCP-D and multiple sclerosis data, regularization target \(\overline{\Omega }\) was the \(\overline{\Omega }\) from the HCP-YA training data. For HCP-A: FS86 λ = 0.10, Shen268 λ = 0.31, Coco439 λ = 0.57. For HCP-D: FS86 λ = 0.17, Shen268 λ = 0.35, Coco439 λ = 0.54.

The dMRI data were preprocessed by HCP using the minimal preprocessing pipeline, which jointly corrected for motion, susceptibility distortion and eddy current distortion using FSL's ‘topup' and ‘eddy' tools55,56, before being linearly coregistered to the anatomical image. Preprocessed dMRI were further processed using MRtrix3 (ref. 57; 3.0_RC3), including bias correction, constrained spherical deconvolution (multi-shell, multi-tissue fiber orientation distribution (FOD) estimation, lmax = 8, ref. 58), and whole-brain tractography. We performed both deterministic (SD_STREAM59, or SCdt) and probabilistic, anatomically constrained tractography (iFOD2+ACT60,61, or SCpr) using dynamic white-matter seeding62 for both methods, resulting in 5 million total streamlines per subject for each tractography algorithm. SC matrices were constructed for each atlas by counting the number of streamlines that ended in each pair of gray matter regions, normalized by the total volume of each region pair.

We used three different whole-brain atlases, covering a range in size and construction methodology. The 86-region FreeSurfer atlas (FS86) combines 68 cortical gyri from Desikan–Killiany and 18 subcortical gray matter regions (aparc+aseg output file63,64). The 268-region Shen atlas (Shen268 or sh268) is an MNI-space cortical and subcortical volumetric atlas based on resting-state fMRI clustering65,66. The 439-region CocoHCP439 atlas (Coco439 or co439) combines 358 cortical regions from the HCP multimodal parcellation67, defined using anatomical and functional connectivity gradients, with 12 subcortical regions from FreeSurfer aseg (further modified by FSL FIRST68; FSL 6.0), 30 thalamic nuclei derived from FreeSurfer 7.2.0 (ref. 69; 50 original outputs included many small nuclei, which were merged into the final set of 30), 27 cerebellar regions from the SUIT atlas70, and 12 additional subcortical nuclei from AAL3 (ref. 71). The FS86 and Coco439 atlases were defined based on each individual subject's FreeSurfer surface and subcortical parcellations, whereas the Shen268 atlas was applied directly to MNI-resampled data for each subject. The FS86, Shen268 and Coco439 parcellations result in 3,655, 35,778 and 96,141 pairwise connectivity estimates, respectively.

A key consideration when assessing the performance of a connectome prediction model is the high degree of similarity of measured connectomes with the population mean. The Pearson correlation between connectomes of unrelated individuals can exceed 0.9, depending on the flavor, and a model that simply predicts the population mean for every subject can appear to have a very high prediction accuracy if it uses Pearson correlation as its metric (Fig. 2d, ‘pop. mean' in bottom subpanel). One simple solution to this issue is to subtract the population mean calculated from training subjects before correlating measured and predicted connectomes; here, we refer to this metric as avgcorrdemean (equation (2)). However, this metric still cannot determine whether predictions faithfully capture individual variation, particularly when there is clustering within the population (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

Our goal here is to create individualized connectome predictions to understand the sources and consequences of across-subject variability. Thus, we also consider the identifiability of our predictions: whether our measured connectome for a subject is closer to the predicted connectome for that subject than the predicted connectome of any other subject. The top-1 accuracy (top1acc, equation (3)) is a winner-take-all measure that reflects the fraction of subjects for whom this is true. Specifically, it measures the fraction of subjects whose predicted connectome is more similar (higher Pearson correlation) to their measured connectome than to any other subject's measured connectome (random chance 1/nsubj = 0.005 for 196 HCP-YA test subjects). For a more continuous measure of identifiability, more suitable to assessing imperfect predictions, we use an ‘average rank percentile' measure (avgrank, equation (4)), which is the fractional rank of the similarity (Pearson correlation) of a subject's measured and predicted connectomes compared with all other predicted connectomes, averaged across subjects (random chance, 0.5). Taken together, prediction accuracy and identifiability, as measured with avgcorrdemean and avgrank, convey a more complete picture of how well a model explains individuals' connectomes.

The following metrics were used to compare predicted connectomes (denoted \({\hat{X}}_{s}\) for subject s) with measured connectomes (denoted Xs) when evaluating model performance:

In addition to these measures of prediction accuracy for the connectivity matrix values, we compute several common graph theoretical metrics to assess how faithfully the predicted connectomes capture the network properties of the measured connectomes. We use the Brain Connectivity Toolbox72 to compute average node strength, average betweenness centrality, characteristic path length, and modularity (Louvain community detection) for each measured and predicted connectome, and compute the Spearman rank correlation between the predicted and measured values for all test subjects for each metric.

Each model training epoch consists of two stages: (1) path-wise reconstruction and inter-subject dispersion and (2) latent space consistency. For a given path i → j, we loop through batches of subjects (nbatch = 41), apply Encoderi to transform input flavor \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) (256 × nbatch) to latent representation zi (128 × nbatch), and Decoderj to transform zi to predicted output flavor \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\) (256 × nbatch). Path-wise reconstruction loss and inter-subject dispersion terms (Lr.corrI, Lr.mse, Lr.marg) are computed per batch from \({X}_{j}^{{\prime} }\) and \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\). These reconstruction losses collectively penalize reconstruction error in both absolute MSE and correlation terms, and promote inter-subject separation in the reconstruction space. Path-wise latent space dispersion loss (Lz.corrI, Lz.dist), computed from zi, promotes inter-subject separation in the latent space. This forward pass and backpropagation is repeated for each batch of training subjects, before moving on to the next training path. The order in which paths are selected is randomly reshuffled each epoch. The second stage of each training epoch, latent space consistency, enforces similarity of the latent space representations from each input flavor. We re-compute zi for all input flavors from the encoders updated in the path-wise stage, and then compute Lz.sim as the total MSE between the set of zi matrices for all flavors. Explicit weights were applied to the reconstruction MSE loss term Lr.mse (wrm = 1,000), the combined path-wise latent space dispersion loss Lz (wz = 10), and the latent space intra-subject consistency loss Lz.sim (wzs = 10,000). See Extended Data Fig. 8 for pseudocode of training procedure, and Extended Data Table 1 for details of loss function terms.

After each training epoch, we compute predicted connectomes for all paths on a held-out set of 80 validation subjects, and the inverse PCA transform (precomputed on the training data only) is applied to compute \({\hat{X}}_{j}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{{\rm{edges}}}}\) from \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{256}\). Reconstruction accuracy and identifiability are computed in this high-dimensional data space. Loss term weights were tuned empirically to balance the reconstruction (avgcorrdemean) and identifiability (avgrank) performance metrics in the validation dataset. Extended Data Fig. 1b illustrates this trade-off when tuning MSE reconstruction loss.

The model was implemented in PyTorch 1.10, using the AdamW optimizer with learning rate 10−4. Model weights were regularized by weight decay 10−2, as well as dropout in all encoders and decoders (dropout rate 0.5). The model was trained for 5,000 epochs, which took approximately 36 h on an Nvidia A100 GPU. Due to the regularization and the largely linear nature of the model, we did not observe pronounced overfitting. Validation performance plateaued after 500–1,000 epochs, and we selected the 2,000-epoch checkpoint for further evaluation.

To examine how the connectomes (predicted and measured) reflect family structure, we first compute the averaged latent vector in the Krakencoder for each subject from either all 15 flavors (fusion) or the nine FC (fusionFC) and six SC (fusionSC) separately, and then compute an nsubj × nsubj inter-subject latent similarity matrix using Pearson correlation. These pairwise similarities are grouped according to the inter-subject relationship. For comparison, we also compute the inter-subject similarity for all 15 flavors of the high-dimensional measured connectome data, average these 9, 6 or 15 nsubj × nsubj similarity matrices, and group them according to relatedness. Due to the high baseline similarity in observed data, latent and observed data similarity measures were independently z-scored by the mean and standard deviation of the similarity of unrelated subjects for visual comparison. Differences of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) separability of the distributions (for example, separability of DZ and MZ distributions in latent space, compared with separability of DZ and MZ in observed data) was assessed through permutation testing (10,000 matched permutations).

For demographic predictions, we used a linear support vector classifier to predict sex, and kernel ridge regression with linear kernel to predict age and cognition73. For the Krakencoder, models were fitted using cross-validation on the average latent vectors for the 683 subjects used to train the Krakencoder model, and tested on the 196 held-out subjects. For the observed connectome data, we computed the inter-subject cosine similarity matrix of each connectome flavor, and used the averaged similarity matrices as input into the model, using the same training and testing splits as for the Krakencoder. Regression hyperparameters were selected by nested cross-validation grid search. Variability of prediction accuracy was assessed through bootstrap resampling (n = 100), and significant differences between Krakencoder and observed data models was assessed using two-sided permutation testing of matched bootstrap samples (10,000 permutations).

We assessed the spatial variability of prediction accuracy to determine whether certain brain regions are more accurately predicted than others. For fusion-parc, fusionFC-parc and fusionSC-parc (fusion predictions made without the parcellation being predicted), the prediction accuracy for each edge is the Pearson correlation between the predicted and measured values for the 196 held-out test subjects. To simplify visualization and enable comparison across varied size parcellations, each region is assigned to one of seven cortical resting-state networks74 or subcortical and cerebellar networks. The edge-wise accuracies (region × region) are then grouped and averaged into a 9 × 9 network representation for each connectome flavor. In the top block of Extended Data Fig. 2a, the network-averaged edge prediction accuracy is presented for each of the fusion types as input (rows) and each connectivity flavor as output (columns). The bottom block shows the baseline network-averaged edge similarity comparing measured connectomes of unrelated age- and sex-matched subjects and related individuals. The figure demonstrates that the Krakencoder's prediction accuracy is relatively uniform throughout the cortex and subcortex. Networks with lower Krakencoder predictability (for example, the limbic network), also show low self-retest measurement reliability (bottom row). In Extended Data Fig. 2b, each network × network heatmap in Extended Data Fig. 2a is correlated with the corresponding self-retest measurement reliability (bottom row), to quantify the consistency of the spatial pattern of edge-wise accuracies with the reliability of the edge-wise measurements. We see that the spatial pattern of the edge-wise accuracy of the Krakencoder's fused intra- and inter-modality predictions is as similar to the spatial pattern of the edge-wise self-retest measurement reliability as the MZ twins' spatial patterns of edge-wise reliability. Extended Data Fig. 3 summarizes the edge-wise prediction accuracy at a region level for each connectivity flavor in its own parcellation, showing a similar agreement between prediction and measurement reliability.

To quantify the relationship between SC–FC predictions and cortical hierarchy, we first correlate regional prediction accuracy with an estimate of the cortical hierarchy gradient derived from functional connectivity75. We find a significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.249, Pspin = 0.019, 10,000 spin-test rotations76). Conversely, if we correlate corresponding rows in the square measured and predicted connectome matrices, we find that predicted connections to high-level cortex are less coupled to their measured rows than low-level cortex (Spearman r = −0.191, Pspin = 0.116; Extended Data Fig. 4b).

Regions were grouped into seven cortical resting-state networks74 or subcortical and cerebellar networks. To perform the sensitivity analyses, every connectome edge was set to the population mean of the training set, except for the columns and rows corresponding to the regions within the network of interest, which were left untouched (Fig. 4a). The fusion latent space representations (fusion, fusionSC and fusionFC) were re-calculated for each individual and used to predict, first, each connectome flavor, and second, age, sex and total cognition using re-fitted kernel ridge regression models.

The Krakencoder model incorporates six flavors of SC (two per parcellation) and nine flavors of FC (three per parcellation). These two previous SC–FC prediction frameworks are designed to predict a single flavor of FC from SC. Thus, we trained 12 separate models for each of the two frameworks for all combinations of SC (SCdt or SCpr) and FC (FC or FCpcorr). FCgsr was excluded due to computational constraints and relative redundancy with FC.

A note on computational efficiency: training all 12 deepnet models required approximately 140 GPU hours on an Nvidia A100 (4 × 5 h for FS86, 4 × 10 h for Shen268, and 4 × 20 h for Coco439), and all 12 graphnet models required 1,200 GPU hours (4 × 50 h for FS86, 4 × 100 h for Shen268, 4 × 150 h for Coco439). For comparison, the Krakencoder required only 30 GPU hours to train a model for all 15 × 15 = 225 prediction paths simultaneously. When applying the Krakencoder model to new connectome data, the computational requirements are minimal and can even be done using free cloud-based platforms such as Google Colab.

a. In this illustration, filled circles represent each subject's measured connectome (Xsubj), open circles represent each subject's predicted connectome (\({\hat{X}}_{subj}\)), and the black star is the population mean of all Xsubj. Thick lines indicate that a subject's Xs=a is closer to its own \({\hat{X}}_{s = a}\) than any other \({\hat{X}}_{s\ne a}\). All three scenarios have the same residual magnitude ∣ε∣ (that is, RMSE), and similar average predicted correlation, but very different measured → predicted identifiability: Predictions for a given subject (\({\hat{X}}_{subj}\)) can be closer to the measured data of another subject than their own measurement (Xsubj). This relationship becomes complementary when observed data are close to the population mean or have distinct clusters. b. Each point shows the performance (reconstruction accuracy avgcorrdemean, and identifiability avgrank) averaged within prediction categories for a model trained with a different reconstruction loss weight wmse. Intra-modality predictions (SC → SC in red, FC → FC in blue) have high identifiability, and increasing wmse increases reconstruction accuracy without decreasing identifiability. Inter-modality predictions (FC → SC in yellow, SC → FC in purple), have lower accuracy and identifiability, and SC → FC identifiability decreases sharply with increasing wmse. wmse= 1000 was chosen to balance these two factors. Performance of a model trained without using PCA dimensionality reduction (green outlines) shows reduced ‘avgrank' without improving avgcorrdemean.

For the Krakencoder's fusion predictions made without the parcellation being predicted (fusion-parc, fusionFC-parc, and fusionSC-parc), the prediction accuracy for each edge is the Pearson correlation between the predicted and measured values for 196 held-out test subjects. a. To simplify visualization and compare across parcellations, each region is assigned to one of 7 cortical resting-state networks73 or separate subcortical and cerebellar networks, and the edge-wise accuracies (region × region) are then grouped and averaged into a 9 × 9 network representation. Age- and sex-matched individuals of given relatedness, as well as self-retest, are correlated and averaged in the same manner, in order to provide a baseline for comparing the spatial patterns of edge-wise accuracy. b. Each network × network heatmap in a is correlated with the corresponding self-retest (bottom row), to show the consistency of the spatial pattern of edge-wise predictions with measurement reliability.

For the Krakencoder's fusion predictions made without the parcellation being predicted (fusion-parc, fusionFC-parc, and fusionSC-parc), the prediction accuracy for each region is the Pearson correlation between the predicted and measured edge values for 196 held-out test subjects, averaged across all other regions. Age- and sex-matched individuals of given relatedness, as well as self-retest, are correlated and averaged in the same manner, in order to provide a baseline for comparing the spatial patterns of edge-wise accuracy. Only the left hemisphere is shown, to simplify visualization.

Regional SC → FC prediction accuracy covaries with the principal gradient of cortical hierarchy derived from functional connectivity74. a. Edge-wise prediction accuracy, measuring the explained inter-subject variance for each connectome edge, compared to fcgradient01. b. Regional prediction coupling, computed by correlating each region's row in the measured and predicted connectome, compared to fcgradient01. Red (fcgradient01 > 0) and blue (fcgradient01 < 0) areas on the cortical map correspond to high-level association cortex and low-level sensorimotor areas, respectively. Each dot in the scatter plots represents a region colored according to its assigned Yeo network73.

Each numbered entry in the heatmap shows the Spearman rank correlation between the graph metric of the Krakencoder's predicted connectome (based on one of the three fusion representations, ‘fusion-parc', ‘fusionFC-parc', and ‘fusionSC-parc', where inputs exclude the parcellation being predicted) for that output connectome flavor listed on the x-axis, compared to the graph metric for that measured flavor of connectome. These values were calculated using the held-out set of 196 individuals. Colors indicate the correlation's p-value. Bold entries denote significant correlation (pperm < 10−3, two-sided permutation test, 1000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 120 comparisons per metric).

Prediction accuracy of demographic and cognitive metrics from different subsets of the latent space and observed connectome data, for HCP-Dev (a) and HCP-Aging (b). Bar height, box, and whiskers represent the mean, 50%, and 90% bootstrap confidence intervals, respectively. * = significant difference between prediction accuracy from latent space and observed data. (pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 18 comparisons).

Krakencoder's performance in mapping from SC to FC, compared against a deep neural network (‘deepnet')24 and a deep graph neural network (‘graphnet')25. Top-1 accuracy (top1acc), average rank percentile (avgrank), average correlation of predicted and measured FC after (avgcorrdemean) and before (avgcorr) de-meaning are presented in the top row of panels, one value for each FC flavor as output (columns) and various SCs as input (rows). Network metrics are provided in the bottom row of figure panels. There are three SC inputs for the Krakencoder model: volume-normalized deterministic SC for that parcellation only [kraken:SCdt], volume-normalized probabilistic SC for that parcellation only [kraken:SCpr] and the fusion of all 6 SC inputs in the latent space [kraken:fusionSC]. There are two SC input flavors (deterministic [SCdt] and probabilistic [SCpr] volume-normalized SC) for the deepnet and graphnet models. The same metrics between pairs of measured FC from varied familial relatedness categories is shown as a comparison. Deepnet and graphnet models were trained and evaluated using the same data and subject splits as the Krakencoder model. Colors indicate the correlation's p-value.

What is this thing?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Deep in the galactic plane of the Milky Way, within a region of stars shrouded in gas and dust, one star is behaving like no other that has ever been observed before.

Stars can be as mysterious as they are mesmerizing. When scientists at NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory were making observations with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) X-ray imaging instrument, something bizarre appeared—a previously unidentified source of X-rays. Intense X-ray and radio pulses were coming from this source, which is known as ASKAP J1832-0911.

This extreme object is a long-period radio transient, or LPT—an astrophysical object whose brightness keeps changing. Few long-period radio transients, whose radio wave emissions vary over tens of minutes, are known. In fact, the first one was only spotted in 2022. The radio wave intensity of ASKAP J1832-0911 cycled every 44 minutes, and was exceptionally bright in radio at the time of observation. Most excitingly for scientists, LPTs had never before been observed emitting both X-rays and radio waves.

Astronomer Ziteng Wang from Curtin University in Australia—who led the team of researchers investigating ASKAP J1832-0911—wanted to find out more. The object was observed six months later with ACIS and the Follow-Up Telescope on board ESA's Einstein Probe. By then, its X-ray luminosity had decreased, and so had its radio emissions. But its existence alone is a breakthrough in itself. 

“ASKAP J1832–0911 is currently the only LPT detected with (pulsed) X-ray emission — perhaps unsurprisingly, given its extreme radio brightness and the potential correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities,” Wang and his team said in a study recently published in Nature. 

This object is thought to be some sort of star, but exactly what kind of star remains debatable. The researchers believe ASKAP J1832–0911 to be compact and to have strong magnetic fields, which would align with the properties of either a magnetic white dwarf (the corpse of a star that has lost its outer layers of gas) or a pulsar (a rotating neutron star that is highly magnetized). But then, there is the issue of its unprecedented pulses. Its X-ray pulses alone are too variable to line up with the steady flash of a pulsar, and X-ray emissions from white dwarves also tend to be fainter and more stable than those produced by ASKAP J1832–0911. 

So, if it isn't a pulsar or white dwarf, then what is it?

Well, it might be a binary white dwarf system—fast-spinning white dwarfs are sometimes found locked in binary systems with other low-mass stars. The radio emissions from these binaries are usually significantly weaker than those from ASKAP J1832–0911, but Wang suggests that the situation remains possible.

If not a binary white dwarf system, however, ASKAP J1832–0911 could be a magnetar. These isolated neutron stars have powerful magnetic fields, and the mystery object's properties (including varied pulses and a radio spectrum that is constantly changing)are in line with those of  magnetars that emit strong radio waves. Magnetars also throw ‘tantrums' with similar X-ray outbursts. But ASKAP J1832–0911 also differs from the typical presentation of magnetars—its quiescent X-ray luminosity (the opposite of its peak luminosity) doesn't line up with expected magnetar behavior, and its especially low luminosity when its rotation slows down doesn't match either. Older magentars are thought to act more like this, but cannot reach such bright radio extremes as ASKAP J1832–0911.

“It could host an unusual core-dominated magnetic field […] requiring a revision to models of magnetic field evolution in neutron stars,” Wang said. “If ASKAP J1832–0911 is an old magnetar, explaining the radio emission challenges existent models.”

Whatever ASKAP J1832–0911 actually is, classifying it will demand consideration of the strength and frequency of both X-ray and radio emissions. For now, it just winks at us.

When Ross Ulbricht received a $31 million bitcoin donation last weekend from an unknown source, many observers saw it as more than a very nice welcome-home gift. Rumors swirled that the creator of the Silk Road, less than five months after receiving a pardon from Donald Trump that saved him from a lifetime in prison, was sending himself a trove of his stashed criminal proceeds from his days running the dark web's first black market more than a decade prior.

Now cryptocurrency tracing investigators say they've arrived at a stranger explanation: The money wasn't originally Ulbricht's, and didn't come from the Silk Road. Instead, they suspect it came from a different long-defunct dark-web black market: AlphaBay.

The crypto tracing firm Chainalysis tells WIRED that, based on blockchain analysis, it has tied the origin of the 300 bitcoins sent to Ulbricht on Sunday to someone involved in AlphaBay, a dark web market that sold a wide variety of drugs and cybercriminal contraband from 2014 to 2017 and eventually grew to be 10 times the size of the Silk Road, according to the FBI.

Chainalysis says the funds appear to have emerged from AlphaBay around 2016 and 2017. Given the amount of the donation, Chainalysis suggests it might have come from someone who acted as a large-scale seller on the market. “We have reasonable grounds to suspect that these funds originated in AlphaBay,” says Phil Larratt, Chainalysis's director of investigations and a former official at the UK's National Crime Agency. “Looking at the amount, that would suggest they came from someone who was possibly a vendor on AlphaBay back in the early days.”

WIRED reached out to Ulbricht for comment about the donation's origin via contacts at the Free Ross campaign that lobbied for his pardon, but didn't immediately receive a response.

Prior to Chainalysis' finding that the $31 million donation appears to have originated at AlphaBay, the independent crypto-tracing investigator known as ZachXBT had already posted to his account on X his own findings that the money didn't appear to have come from the Silk Road. ZachXBT found that, despite the donor's use of multiple Bitcoin “mixers” that take in users' coins and return others to obfuscate their trail on the blockchain, he was able to trace the funds to an address that had been flagged in Chainalysis' software tool Reactor as tied to illicit activity. That analysis suggested that the money was a “legitimate donation but not legitimate funds,” ZachXBT wrote in a text message to WIRED.

ZachXBT also found that the same individual who controlled the funds had cashed out other cryptocurrency at an exchange in small, distributed quantities rather than in a single sum, suggesting he or she may have been trying to prevent them being seized or flagged—another sign that the money may have come from criminal origins. “Usage of multiple mixers, spreading out CEX deposits, etc,” ZachXBT writes to WIRED, using the term CEX to mean a centralized exchange, “that is done typically if you are trying to avoid getting illicit funds frozen.”

Chainalysis declined to offer more information on how exactly it identified the funds as originating at AlphaBay. But the company has built a business around identifying illicit services like digital black markets out of the morass of billions of cryptocurrency addresses. Chainalysis' identification of the AlphaBay cluster of bitcoin addresses, in fact, played a key role in the takedown of the market in a law enforcement investigation known as Operation Bayonet that spanned 2016 and 2017.

AlphaBay certainly produced plenty of crypto kingpins who would have the kind of eight-figure sum donated to Ulbricht. Before it was torn offline in an elaborate sting operation in July 2017, the site was facilitating $2 million a day in sales, largely of illegal drugs although it also offered malware, stolen data, and other cybercriminal wares. AlphaBay's creator and administrator, Alexandre Cazes, died in a Bangkok jail cell under mysterious circumstances following his arrest, but the site's second-in-command, who went by the handle Desnake, appears to have remained at large. Any bitcoins an AlphaBay seller or administrator managed to hold onto since the site's closure would have since appreciated more than 40-fold.

Exactly why one of AlphaBay's crypto moguls would donate $31 million to Ulbricht, however, remains a mystery. Speculation on social media has ranged from a fellow black marketeer repaying a favor to a more principled gift intended to thank Ulbricht for blazing a trail with his invention of the Silk Road's crypto-enabled anonymous transactions.

That gratitude may also take into account that, while many got rich on the dark-web markets that Ulbricht pioneered, he instead spent over a decade in prison, speculates Taylor Monahan, a crypto tracer and security researcher at crypto firm MetaMask. “People donate when they're deeply inspired by someone and/or grateful and/or have some sort of remorse for the situation,” says Monahan. “Survivor's guilt is wild.”

The Nintendo Switch 2's packaging material is thin enough for a staple to pierce the Switch 2 screen inside.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 arrives today, but for some, the launch is bittersweet. Some units from GameStop have reportedly been damaged by staples responsible for holding store receipts onto the boxes. Several customers have gone to X to report the issue, noting that the staples are puncturing through the Switch 2's thin packaging material and damaging the console's screen.

One such customer, Oadhan Lynch, stated on X that Gamestop "stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box." Another from Rudeboy on X stated, "Hello! My switch 2 has staple holes in the screen. They stapled the receipt to the box at 1756 Forest Ave, Staten Island, NY 10303 and it damaged the screen."

@gamestop Helo ! My switch 2 has staple holes in the screen. They stapled the receipt to the box at 1756 Forest Ave, Staten Island, NY 10303 and it damaged the screen. @NintendoAmerica pic.twitter.com/aqxPtRgNEsJune 5, 2025

Most of the reports appear to be coming from the aforementioned GameStop location in New York. No one knows the full extent of the damage, but a since-deleted Reddit post allegedly stated that Gamestop (presumably the New York location) had its entire pre-launch batch of Switch 2s damaged by staples.

Thankfully, the affected Switch 2s appear to be fully functional, with several customers posting images on X of their stapled Switch 2s working fine except for having two tiny holes pierced into the LCD panel. Regardless, we can expect GameStop and Nintendo to provide replacements as soon as possible.

However, shipping replacements could take a while. Not only is the Switch 2 in high demand, but the new console is also more expensive to produce and significantly more expensive to repair than the original Switch. Replacement parts for the Switch 2 are allegedly 92% more expensive in Japan compared to the prior version.

The Nintendo Switch 2 went on sale earlier today at its $449.99 MSRP, but most US-based retailers have allegedly run out of stock. Stock will vary depending on the retailer and store location. For example, my local Target in Georgetown, Texas, has 2 units available at the time of writing, but the Target in Round Rock, 11 miles away, is already out of stock.

The new console is Nintendo's latest iteration of the Switch, featuring a bigger LCD high refresh rate (120Hz) screen, an all-new custom Nvidia chip with ray tracing and DLSS support, and upgraded Joy-Cons 2 joysticks that can transition to mimic a PC mouse.Correction: June 5, 4 p.m. ET — This story was updated to correct the type of panel used on the Switch 2. We regret the error.

To the best of our knowledge, JBL does not process a magic shrinking ray. But short of that we're having a hard time figuring out how they got so much of their signature JBL sound into a portable Bluetooth speaker as compact as the JBL Go 3. If you'd like to get on the case yourself, the JBL Go 3 Portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker is just $30 right now at Amazon.

See at Amazon

This limited-time 25% off deal brings the JBL Go 3 Portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker down to the same price it was during the Black Friday and Cyber Week 2024 holiday shopping season, and it's well worth it, especially now that the weather's warm and you'll be wanting to bring your favorite tunes on the go with you to the beach or on a bike ride, or basically any and everywhere you want.

The durability and tough construction of the JBL Go 3 are just as big a selling point as its minute size and great sound. It's IP67 waterproof and dustproof, so not only will it keep bringing the sound if it starts to rain, it's also a really great shower speaker. The built-in loop is perfect for hanging over a shower nozzle, or the handlebars of a bike, or for attaching to a backpack with a carabiner for a long hike or camping trip. The outer covering of fabric helps protect the JBL Go 3, and also gives you a better grip on it. But if you do happen to drop it into the pool, relax — it's fully waterproof.

Just how small is the JBL Go 3? It's pretty teeny — just 1.6 x 3.4 x 2.7 inches, and 7 ounces in weight. To call it portable is a huge understatement — it's literally pocket-sized, and when you pack it or attach it to something to take it on the go, it'll give you 5 hours of playback time on a single charge. Pop it onto a charger with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, or any USB-C cable you already have, and it'll be back up to full strength in no time.

Here's the part that really blows our minds. Even with such a tiny construction with built-in waterproofing and dustproofing, the Go 3 still manages to crank out the famous Original JBL Pro Sound, with crisp high notes and resounding bass.

Heads up, folks. This 20,000mAh Anker power bank is down over 40% for a limited time. That brings the price to just $40 (down from $70). It's equipped with two two-way USB-C ports, one of which already has the built-in cable, along with a USB-A port. This means you can charge up three devices at once. Plug in your laptop while your phone is recharging as well. And it's is compact so it can store easily in a backpack or messenger bag. The main USB-C cable can actually click back into the power bank so you'll never find yourself without a cable.

20,000mAh is the total energy this power bank holds. To put that in more grounded terms, It can charge an iPhone 15 four times from zero percent to a hundred before running out. Similarly, it's got just shy of four charges of a Galaxy S24 in it. It's fast too, operating at 30W. You can charge an iPhone 16 Pro Max to 50% with the Anker portable charger in just 27 minutes. Compare that to your traditional power bank which will take about an hour.

The portable charger features an interactive digital display so you can see just how much juice it has left while charging your phone, laptop, or earbuds.

Don't be like me. Recently I went on a trip to Spain. I was coming from New York and the flight was about seven hours or so, plus an hour connecting flight to our final destination. I used to have a good power bank, but I lent it to a friend and never got it back. I considered picking up a new one before the trip, but figured, “Ahh, I probably don't need it. All planes these day have outlets and charging ports at your seat.”

Well, when I got there, the only port was a USB A. I went to pull out a charging cable and low and behold, it was USB C-to-C. All of my devices I had with me were USB C or my iPhone which again, the only cable I had was USB C-to-Lightning. Stranded in my aisle seat with a Nintendo Switch I forgot to charge and a laptop loaded with movies and shows with only about a half hour of use left. This flight sucked.

Don't do what I did. Grab this travel-friendly Anker power bank on sale for $40 and save $30 (-43%).

The Wo-We Mini PC is amazingly cheap, but there are some trade-offs.

I was browsing through the r/buildapcsales today, looking for something interesting, when I stumbled onto quite the deal. Amazon is selling a fully-functional desktop mini PC for just $44.99, and that's not even a limited-time sale. But just what do you get for your money?

The Wo-We Mini PC is powered by a dual-core, Intel Celeron N4020 CPU and sports 4GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and Wi-Fi 5 wireless connectivity. It comes with Ubuntu Linux preinstalled, though we don't know which version.

In terms of video out, the PC has both a VGA and an HDMI port. It can support dual screens and a maximum resolution of 4K (on a single screen) via its Intel UHD Graphics 600 integrated GPU.

On its Amazon page, Wo-We claims that the Mini PC offers "powerful performance without breaking the bank" and that its Intel UHD 600 GPU offers "state-of-the-art" graphics technology. The company says that its 802.11ac Wi-Fi offers "faster, smoother and more stable Internet access" too.

The tiny, 5.12 x 6.61-inch black box has a USB-C 5 Gbps port, microSD and dual USB Type-A 5 Gbps ports on the front. The back has the VGA, HDMI, 1 Gbps Ethernet, and dual USB 2.0 ports.



Depending on your needs, the Wo-We is either "Whoa, we got a lot for the money" or "Woe betide we who bought this." If you just want to use web tools, are comfortable working in Ubuntu Linux (which isn't hard to learn), and don't do much multitasking, this could work out.

If you like to have many tabs open or you don't have a lot of patience, this could end up as a $44 paperweight. We haven't gotten the Wo-We Mini PC in for testing. However, we wouldn't expect great performance, considering that its 2019-era Celeron has two cores, two threads, 4MB of cache, a base clock of 1.1 GHz, and a boost clock of 2.8 GHz.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Those are some weak specs, as most desktop CPUs and even many mobile CPUs these days have boost clocks in the 4 to 5 GHz range. The good news is that the Celeron only has a 6W TDP, so it doesn't need active cooling. That keeps the Mini PC from making noise.

What probably hurts the experience more is the 4GB of RAM, which would make web browsing with more than a couple of tabs open a challenge. However, Linux usually makes better use of memory than Windows does.

Another problem: the eMMC memory is probably about equivalent in speed to a typical (not high-speed) microSD card. So boot time and the time you wait to open apps could be slow.

Tech-savvy users who know to expect lag may have the patience for slowness, but those who need this the most -- people who don't have computers already -- will likely be less inclined to tolerate it. If you're a low-information user, you may be confused by Linux and frustrated by any problems you run into. You could always get Windows and install it, though not Windows 11.

Of course, there are other low-cost choices that allow you to do basic computing. Right now, Woot has a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB of RAM for $44. However, during non-sale times, you're getting 2GB of RAM on your Pi at this price and 4GB will cost you quite a bit more. And with Raspberry Pi, you'd need to buy a microSD card to install your OS on, get micro HDMI cables for video and you couldn't run install Windows (like you can on the Wo-We).

Wo-We also sells a $54 Mini PC with 8GB of RAM but with an even older AMD Excavator A9-9400 CPU that launched in May 2016. That's a bit long in the tooth, even for a bargain.

It's interesting to see that you can get a workable, brand-new desktop PC for $44. However, the people most fascinated with this system (PC enthusiasts like me) probably need it the least.

Every gaming keyboard manufacturer seems to be jumping on the Hall effect bandwagon, and why wouldn't they? The keyboard technology has been proven in both esports arenas and home office setups worldwide and offers countless advantages over standard mechanical keyboards, with no real performance compromises.

Hall effect keyboards have also arrived as countless other technologies enter the keyboard space: Everything from gasket-mounting to touchpads is now in mainstream keyboards. That also means I regularly see new products, mechanical and Hall effect, with features I've never even considered before. Case in point, the Asus ROG Falchion Ace HFX, a small keyboard with a large name and a lot of unusual features.

This $200 wired-only keyboard has Hall effect switches, an 8,000-Hz polling rate, multidevice connectivity with two USB-C ports, and a programmable touchpad on the back edge. Not to mention countless on-keyboard controls and a flipable lever to enable or disable the rapid trigger feature found on most Hall effect keyboards. While it does have some strange design decisions, it has a lot of really clever ones too.

The Falchion has one of the deepest typing sounds compared to other Hall effect keyboards. This is likely a combination of the keyboard's unique HFX magnetic switches, one of the few I've tested that aren't made by Gateron, and the sound dampening inside. It consists of multiple layers of foam, Poron, and silicone, and a sheet of small rubber domes.

The switches feel incredibly smooth, even when pressed slowly, with a consistent feel throughout the entire keypress. They use a polycarbonate top housing, a POM stem, and a POM bottom housing, contributing to the deeper typing sound and ensuring smoothness across the entire keystroke. Unlike most Hall effect switches, the HFX doesn't have a hole in the center, instead, it moves the magnet to the front, where the metal contact leaf would typically be on a mechanical switch. This makes the Falchion incompatible with standard Hall effect switches, but likely improves the sound profile as well: Open-bottom switches tend to have a more hollow typing sound, which can be heard on competitors.

The springs are weighted to 55 grams of total force, which is 5 grams lighter than the Gateron Nebula dual-rail switches used by Keychron, and 10 grams lighter than the standard Cherry MX Red. There aren't any other switches available for this keyboard, but because Hall effect switches are contactless, the existing switches can be removed without any desoldering or extensive disassembly.

I didn't find myself wanting to change the switches, though—they have a poppy and deep sound that's incredibly crisp, and they feel responsive and smooth, especially with rapid trigger enabled. My largest issue with the typing experience was the keycaps. They have a rough texture that, while grippy, felt noticeably coarse and unpleasant when typing. It comes down to preference, but I found them less enjoyable than smooth or lightly textured keycaps.

The stabilizers in this keyboard use an older, less-common design seen on a few Razer keyboards in the past, where the stems clip directly onto the internal wires. The stems can be pulled out from the top to apply additional lube without needing to disassemble the keyboard. From the factory, none of them rattled or clicked at all.

The typing experience can be adjusted in a few ways. The largest is the dust cover included with this keyboard; it's essentially a bigger version of the keyboard's existing case lined with a layer of rubber. The keyboard can be placed inside it, creating a deeper, more rounded-out typing sound. When not in the cover, the keyboard's typing angle can also be adjusted with flip-out feet. It sits flat at 3 degrees and can be adjusted to 6 or 9 degrees, all standard angles.

The Falchion has top-of-the-line specs, but it stands out in how these features are implemented. Directly above the standard keys, there's an RGB light bar with an indicator on each side. The left indicator is linked to the touchpad on the back edge of the keyboard and shows what it is currently set to adjust. The right indicator shows whether the rapid trigger is enabled. These indicators, and their respective settings, are adjusted using controls on the back of the keyboard. Windows key locking and Caps Lock are located on this LED bar, too.

The button on the back edge of the keyboard cycles the touchpad through multiple functions. These are controlled by swiping and/or double-tapping the touchbar, and they include media playback controls, RGB brightness adjustments, and—the most unique and useful setting—live adjustment of the switches' actuation point, which makes adjustments more streamlined and reduces the need for using software. When adjusting the actuation point, the center light bar will fill in to indicate the adjustment: If it's halfway full, the switches actuate at 2.0 millimeters; if it's full, they actuate at 4.0 mm, and so on.

The lever on the right side, which activates rapid trigger, swaps between on and off with a satisfying click. Rapid trigger is a feature that's become standard on most Hall effect keyboards today. It allows a switch to be pressed down a second time immediately after it's released to register a second keypress, instead of waiting until the key returns to a neutral position. This allows for faster, rapid key presses and generally makes the keyboard feel more responsive, ideal for fast-paced games. It works perfectly on this keyboard, but is only set to work on the WASD keys by default. I had to go into Asus' Armoury Crate software to enable rapid trigger across all the keys.

The software shocked me: Asus got it right in almost every way. Armoury Crate is simple, easy to use, and incredibly lightweight. Almost every setting includes a description or an information tool tip, and there are diagrams to demonstrate how to use specific settings.

An 8,000-Hz polling rate, while fantastic, is overkill for the average person. Unless you're playing at incredibly high levels with no room for error, a keyboard this fast won't make a tangible difference in your gameplay. Still, it's always nice to have something excessively capable (until you can't blame losing in a game on your keyboard).

Another detail that's probably overkill but nice to have is the dual USB-C ports on either side of this keyboard. You can connect a device on each side and use the switch in the center to swap between them. If you're one of the rare people with two PCs at a desk, or if you swap between a desktop and a laptop, this is a great feature and rare to find.

While this keyboard's switches, buttons, and touchpad all feel great, the build quality is pretty average. The Falchion uses a modified tray-mount assembly that, while effective, doesn't bring anything special to the table. Typically, there are multiple posts that the printed circuit board (PCB) and plate screw onto, resulting in a singular, rigid piece without any softness or bounce when typing.

On the Falchion, these posts instead extend through the PCB and sit below the plate without making contact. The screws on top flare out from the posts to hold the plate in place. The internal assembly sits on top of the case's sound insulation, which has multiple small rubber domes placed throughout. These domes can slightly compress when typed on, resulting in a bounciness similar to a gasket-mounted keyboard. The domes look nearly identical to Topre domes, albeit much smaller, and the stacked design feels reminiscent of Mode's stack mount and lattice block mount designs, which both have the keyboard's internal assembly sitting on top of a mounting material instead of being compressed by it.

All this to say, it's an improvement on a standard tray mount, but ultimately falls short of true gasket mounting. It has some bounce, which alleviates the “dead zones” that a tray mount has near the mounting posts, but doesn't do much more. That said, not needing extra space for gaskets in the case makes the keyboard super compact.

The case is incredibly thin, and while this makes the keyboard more lightweight and portable, it also means it can easily be flexed by hand and will be more susceptible to cracking or damage during transport. The case uses metal screws that go directly into plastic, which could cause stripping or thread damage if you take this keyboard apart a few times to modify it, and the LED bar and buttons on top make it a bit difficult to remove the PCB without having to bend the case or risk breaking any of the screw posts. The LED bar creates further issues with how it is connected to the main PCB, using a mix of small JST connectors and ribbon cables that range from slightly annoying to nearly impossible to reconnect after a full disassembly.

There is one part of this keyboard that I can't understand, though: The Falchion includes a dust cover that can also be used as a secondary case for the keyboard to sit in. It has an obvious purpose to repel dust, but I can't understand why something like this was seen as a worthy inclusion on this keyboard. More than anything else, it seems like an extra piece of plastic to take up space, sit inside the box, or end up lost or thrown away a few years from now.

The Asus ROG Falchion Ace HFX is a solid keyboard. It has several great features that improve quality of life massively over other Hall effect keyboards: The controls at the top are practical and convenient, and the touchpad is novel and functional, especially with how well it is integrated into the LED light bar. The largest limitation is customizability: With proprietary switches and a complicated internal design, the Falchion doesn't have the same modification potential as many of its competitors from Wooting, Keychron, or even SteelSeries.

I prefer seeing a company take big swings, even if it means some misses alongside some hits, rather than play it safe and create something boring. The Falchion Ace HFX is a big swing, bringing some great new ideas to the table while still being a solid keyboard underneath.

Ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9, Apple on Thursday offered a new update on its global App Store business, sharing that developers generated $1.3 trillion in billings and sales in 2024. The company stressed that 90% of those billings and sales did not involve paying Apple a commission.

The study also noted that developer billings and sales for digital goods and services in 2024 totaled $131 billion, driven by mobile games, photo and video editing apps, and other enterprise tools. Physical goods and services, meanwhile, topped $1 trillion, thanks to increased demand for online food delivery and pickup, and online grocery apps.

In-app advertising revenue was $150 billion last year.

Spending across digital goods and services, physical goods and services, and in-app advertising has more than doubled since 2019, with physical goods and services seeing the strongest growth at more than 2.6 times, Apple said.

The numbers are intended to highlight how the App Store creates financial opportunities for mobile developers that extend beyond sales from in-app purchases. The storefront provides a place for developers to have their apps discovered by consumers, and Apple provides the technical infrastructure required to run an app business.

This position ignores the fact that the App Store is now a mature ecosystem, and apps are a selling point for the iPhone itself. Developers today have a number of tools at their disposal to host, distribute, and manage their own applications, if they choose, but Apple's policies prevent this.

That's starting to change, however. In a recent court ruling in favor of Epic Games in the U.S., Apple was required to let developers link to their own websites for processing in-app purchases without having to pay Apple a commission. In Europe, the tech giant is fighting against the rules proposed by the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which, among other things, directs Apple to give developers the right to inform their customers about alternative payment mechanisms.

The new data comes from an Apple-funded study by economists Professor Andrey Fradkin from the Boston University Questrom School of Business and Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group. The latter has been working with Apple for years throughout its antitrust legal battles to document the App Store's success in a more positive light for the company.

The study highlights other regional growth trends, like how the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store more than doubled over the past five years in the U.S., China, and Europe. Digital payment spending, meanwhile, also grew by more than seven times in the U.S. since 2019, thanks to the broad adoption of mobile payments.

The report also reiterated other metrics, like how the App Store attracts 813 million average weekly visitors worldwide, and pointed to the various investments Apple has made in tools and technologies to support developers, like coding and distribution platforms, frameworks, analytics, anti-fraud systems, developer support, and more.

Handle with care.

Nintendo's long-anticipated and likely most leaked handheld, the Switch 2, is set to hit shelves today. If you plan to purchase one, handle it with care, as replacement parts are expected to become more expensive, via Notebookcheck. Nintendo Japan's pricing indicates a massive surge of up to 92% for replacement parts, affecting components like the mainboard, LCD, dock, Joy-Cons, and even the new Pro Controller.

Since Nintendo has only disclosed these prices on their Japanese storefront, a direct comparison for U.S. customers is not possible. We have, however, drafted a table outlining the replacement parts for the Switch 2 alongside those for the Switch OLED, Switch V1 (HAC-001), and the Switch Lite from Nintendo Japan. With some expected variations, we may probably see a similar spike globally as well. (U.S. prices are conversions purely for reference)

Replacing the main board, which houses the Tegra T239 SoC along with 12GB (2x6GB) of LPDDR5x-8533 RAM, and 256GB of TLC-based UFS 3.1 storage, will run you 27,500 Yen ($175), or about 67% more expensive than the original Switch V1 from 2017. Even with an IPS panel, the Switch 2's display costs 30% more to repair than the Switch OLED (or 60% more than the Switch V1), attributable to its 120 Hz, HDR10, and VRR capabilities.

Replacement for parts excluding the CPU board and LCD were consolidated into a single package previously, but now Nintendo will charge different prices depending on the affected components. A faulty game card slot, Type-C port failure, or a battery replacement will cost Japanese consumers around 9,900 Yen ($63), or 65% more. Meanwhile, audio-related issues or a broken SD card reader are priced at 7,150 Yen ($45), or 18% more expensive than previous models.

Similarly, resolving video-output issues with the new dock will cost $44, a 76% increase compared to the Switch OLED dock's $25 repair fee. Despite not featuring hall-effect joysticks, the new Joy-Cons will cost $25 to repair, making them 40% pricier than their Switch OLED/V1 counterparts. Lastly, the Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back $41.50 in repair costs, making it 50% more expensive than its predecessor.

Most of these changes can be attributed to increased manufacturing costs and new features, but the clear takeaway is the importance of carefully handling your console. Given the Switch 2's MSRP increase from $299 to $449, higher repair costs were almost a guarantee. Aside from authorized repair, iFixit has lowered the original Switch's repairability score from 8/10 to 4/10, citing issues with parts availability, repair manuals, and design challenges. It remains to be seen if the Switch 2 will improve upon this or achieve an even worse rating.

Anthropic says it has released a new set of AI models tailored for U.S. national security customers.

The new models, a custom set of “Claude Gov” models, were “built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs,” writes Anthropic in the blog post. Compared to Anthropic's consumer- and enterprise-focused models, the new custom Claude Gov models were designed to be applied to government operations like strategic planning, operational support, and intelligence analysis.

“[These] models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments,” writes Anthropic in its post. “[They] underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models.”

Anthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. government customers as it looks for dependable new sources of revenue. In November, the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic's major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic's AI to defense customers.

Anthropic says its new custom Claude Gov models better handle classified material, “refuse less” when engaging with classified information, and have a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. The models also have “enhanced proficiency” in languages and dialects critical to national security operations, Anthropic says, as well as “improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.”

Anthropic isn't the only top AI lab going after defense contracts. 

OpenAI is seeking to establish a closer relationship with the U.S. Defense Department, and Meta recently revealed that it's making its Llama models available to defense partners. Google is refining a version of its Gemini AI capable of working within classified environments. Meanwhile, Cohere, which primarily builds AI products for businesses, is also collaborating with Palantir to deploy its AI models, TechCrunch exclusively reported early last December.

Social network X has changed its developer agreement to prevent third parties from using the platform's content to train large language models.

In an update on Wednesday, the company added a line under “Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions,” a subsection of restrictions on use: “You shall not and you shall not attempt to (or allow others to) […] use the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model,” it reads. 

This change comes after Elon Musk's AI company xAI acquired X in March — understandably, xAI wouldn't want to give its competitors free access to the social platform's data without a sale agreement.

In 2023, X changed its privacy policy to use public data on its site to train AI models. Last October, it made further changes to allow third parties to train their models. 

Reddit has also put in place safeguards against AI crawlers, and last month, The Browser Company added a similar clause to its AI-focused browser Dia's terms of use.

When Monik Pamecha co-founded AI voice startup Toma in early 2024, he hadn't anticipated spending the summer months sweating in Bible Belt car dealerships. He and co-founder Anthony Krivonos were still focused on banking and healthcare customers when the dealers came knocking. 

“They just called us up and said ‘we are drowning in phone calls,'” Pamecha described that initial contact in an interview with TechCrunch. 

Seeing an opportunity to pivot into a far less-regulated space than banking or healthcare, Pamecha and Krivonos set up a test: They decided to have their voice agent call essentially every car dealership in the country multiple times. Over the span of a few weeks they found those calls were only picked up 45% of the time. 

The co-founders packed their bags. And like some sort of modern reinterpretation of the movie “Tommy Boy,” they set out to tour a dozen car dealerships in Oklahoma and Mississippi to get a better understanding of how these businesses work. They got their hands dirty both figuratively and literally; Pamecha said his wife was surprised by the grease stains on his clothes when he returned home. 

That commitment paid off. Not only did they win customers, they got the dealers' full charm offensive. The founders shared home-cooked meals — a sometimes awkward-but-funny affair given Pamecha's vegetarianism, he said — and were invited to tour the Corvette Museum. At least one dealer even asked the Toma founders to tag along to a shooting range.

Seema Amble, a partner at a16z who led the $17 million that Toma has raised to date, said the pair were “effectively living at these dealerships, going to these dealers' family barbecues, really understanding how they operate.”

“We invest in a lot of the next-generation of vertical AI companies, a lot of the best founders have just lived and breathed with these customers to understand what's going on under the hood,” she told TechCrunch. “No pun intended.” 

The insights from that trip helped Pamecha and Krivonos sharpen the Toma voice agent into a tool that is already in use at more than 100 dealerships around the country. The AI helps customers schedule service appointments, handle parts orders, answer sales questions, and more.

Along with a16z, Pamecha and Krivonos attracted investment from Y Combinator (they created Toma at YC in January 2024), the Scale Angels Fund, and auto industry influencer Yossi Levi, also known as the Car Dealership Guy.

Levi told TechCrunch that dealerships struggle with phone calls in part because it's hard to predict volume. 

“It ebbs and flows. Sometimes you're overwhelmed with demand. Other times there's not enough demand, and matching staffing and properly training that staff for a consistent experience is just not an easy thing to do,” Levi said. AI has “provided an opportunity for dealers to really standardize that process, and deliver a richer customer experience that is consistent.” 

Pamecha said Toma's onboarding process involves training on a dealers' customer calls for a week or two to give the AI some context. This is important because while dealerships broadly do the same things, there can be a lot of variance in the details. Some dealers might service more diesel engines, for example. Dealerships also run lots of custom promotions for both sales and service.  

After that initial burst of training, the Toma AI starts taking calls, handing off to human employees if and when it gets stumped. Those handoff calls get analyzed, too, in order to reinforce the AI model to better help that specific dealership. On the business side, Toma operates a subscription model. As the AI agents can handle more parts of a dealership's operations, those dealers will have to pay up for those extra capabilities.

The Series A “comes at a great time” for Toma, according to Pamecha. The startup only hired its first true sales employee within the last few weeks. Before that, it was still largely Pamecha and Krivonos hustling like they did across the country last summer. 

Without that trip, though, Pamecha said he's not sure Toma would have reached this point.

“It has been one of the best experiences of my life,” he said. “I feel like we've all become friends, and I think it all comes from a place of like, feeling their pain. I think they see that we feel the pain, too.”

Now, tardigrades can play a sad song for you on the world's smallest violin

Physicists at Loughborough University in the UK have printed the "world's smallest violin" using new nanolithography tools. The team behind the instrument, which is thinner than a human hair, chose the project as a reference to the timeless insult. More than just a SpongeBob reference, the instrument represents the future of nanoscale computing.

Using a process the Loughborough team compare to screen printing on a microscopic scale, the violin is a tiny 13 microns wide and 35 microns tall. This puts it thinner than human hair, and small enough that even the smallest tardigrades could not play it—a fact made slightly less relevant by the violin's inability to produce musical notes.

The instrument is made of platinum through a process called thermal scanning probe lithography. The violin is a test print for the university's new thermal scanning probe microscope as it prepares to research nanoscale memory devices.

The above video shows Professor Kelly Morrison explaining the tech behind the diminutive etching. "Building the world's smallest violin may all seem like fun and games, but a lot of what we've learnt in this process has essentially laid the groundwork for the research that's going to be implemented here," shares Morrison.

The university used its new thermal scanning probe microscope, a NanoFrazor from Heidelberg Instruments in Switzerland. The tool has an ultrasharp, ultra-hot probe tip that etches structures at the nanoscale into many different materials at resolutions as fine as 15 nm; a "very, very, very, small needle that can see atomic interaction," per Morrison.

A stencil of sorts was etched into a resist-coated chip by the probe, which was then developed to dissolve the resist and leave behind an imprint in the shape of the etched violin. A layer of platinum was deposited on the chip, with a final acetone rinse leaving behind only the platinum violin statuette.

Loughborough's NanoFrazor is one of a very small number of units in the UK, and is unique among its peers thanks to its being installed in its so-called "glove box", keeping the probe and its potential air- and water-sensitive work materials safe from interference.

The nanolithography process employed to create the violin is already being studied by two teams at Loughborough's School of Science to iterate on and improve data storage technologies. One such research team is studying a future in heat-based storage systems; utilizing nanolithography to fabricate heat-sensitive nanoparticles may be a major step in memory devices utilizing multiple different materials on a single memory device.

Another project utilizing the nanolithography tools is an inquiry into using the probe to develop nanoscale magnetic sensors for even smaller magnetic memory devices. As magnetic hard drives continue growing smaller, it becomes more difficult to read and write magnetic data with acceptable stability at ever-increasing densities; this was the physical limit necessitating HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology in today's bleeding-edge hard drives. But if the magnetic reader could be made on the nanoscale, a new frontier in memory density could be opened up.

While many scientists and researchers have begun looking beyond to alternate hardware trends like photonic-based microchips as Moore's Law begins to slow, this push deeper into nanolithography promises to return dividends in extending the lifespan of traditional compute technologies. And from now on, when someone offers up a truly sad anecdote, you really can play for them a song on the world's smallest violin, provided, of course, you can catch a ride to Loughborough in Leicestershire.

Some concerns over a persistent SSH backdoor left by a stealthy exploit soothed by Asus


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Asus has issued multiple statements regarding a highly publicized botnet attack infecting over 9,000 routers to date. Per our previous reporting, the "AyySSHush" botnet has infected its hosts through a mix of brute-force attacks and authentication bypasses, and hides its backdoor in non-volatile memory, thus attempting to hide from firmware updates and refreshes.

In an official statement regarding the insecurity, Asus told Tom's Hardware that the vulnerabilities can be avoided for those yet uninfected, and fixed for those routers that have been compromised. The hostile agents utilize a known command injection flaw, CVE-2023-39780, to enable SSH access on a custom port (TCP/53282) and insert an attacker-controlled public key for remote access.

This exploit has been patched in the latest Asus firmware update, and as such, Asus advises all users of its routers to update their firmware. After this, Asus advises a factory reset, followed by adding a strong administrator password. For those users with routers that have reached end-of-life support, or those who are tech-savvy enough to open up their router settings and wish to avoid a factory reset, Asus recommends "disabling all remote access features such as SSH, DDNS, AiCloud, or Web Access from WAN, and confirming that the SSH (especially TCP port 53282) is not exposed to the Internet."

The AyySSHush botnet was first discovered by security firm GreyNoise in March, making its findings public in May, via alerts thrown up by its proprietary AI monitoring technology, Sift. GreyNoise categorizes the attackers responsible for the botnet as "a well-resourced and highly capable adversary", though without making any accusations about who the attackers were. A Censys search of the affected routers, which at the time of writing numbers above 9,500, can be found here. To date, activity from the botnet has been minimal, with only 30 related requests registered across three months.

In further comment specifically sent to Tom's Hardware, Asus adds that it sent push notifications to applicable users alerting them to update their firmware once the exploit became widely known. Users also have resources, including Asus's product security advisory page and an updated knowledge base article covering the exploit specifically.

Asus also claims to have been working to update firmware on models, including the RT-AX55 router, well before the GreyNoise report went up to protect against this known vulnerability. This is a key detail from the company, as CVE-2023-39780 reporting shows that Asus had been made aware of the vulnerability before the most recent GreyNoise report went out.

Any concerned Asus router users should confirm that their SSH is not exposed to the internet, and are advised to check their router's log for repeated login failures or unfamiliar SSH keys indicating a past brute-force attack. Leaving routers exposed to WAN access and the open internet is a recipe for disaster, and nearly all routers infected by the botnet were likely operating under highly vulnerable, unsafe conditions caused by end users. Still, as with all web security matters, it is better to be safe than sorry, and to ensure routers and other web-connected devices are operating on modern firmware.

Dutch team celebrates autonomous drone milestone.

A team of scientists from TU Delft in the Netherlands is celebrating a highly significant autonomous drone milestone. According to a university press release, “for the first time, a drone has beaten human pilots in an international drone racing competition.” This milestone for AI-controlled drones was passed at the recent A2RL Drone Championship 2025 in Abu Dhabi.

Situated in a large indoor space in the UAE capital, there were two prestigious drone racing events. The Falcon Cup Finals saw the best human pilots pit their skills against each other. Meanwhile, the A2RL Drone Championship was a showcase for the fastest AI-powered, autonomous drones. Perhaps most interestingly, a subsequent race dubbed the A2RL Grand Challenge allowed the best human pilots to face off against the best AI contenders. As per our headline, the TU Delft AI drone was the ultimate winner.

Central to the Dutch scientists' drone racing win was a finely tuned AI “capable of split-second, high-performance control.” The A2RL took place on the very winding track, with drones reaching flight speeds up to 95.8 km/h, so there's not a lot of room for suboptimal racing technique, let alone mistakes.

Readers must also understand that the autonomous racers were confined by several factors. Firstly, the drone only had access to a single on-device forward-facing camera and a single motion sensor, making the competition much fairer vs humans. The AI drone teams were also strictly time, computationally, and energy limited, notes the source.



TU Delft shares what might be one of the most important advances behind its drone's race success. The researchers say that a new element in this drone's AI is “the use of a deep neural network that doesn't send control commands to a traditional human controller, but directly to the motors.” This methodology yielded a very efficient AI model, which worked well with the limited on-board processing. It was suggested that, thanks to this technology, the Dutch racing drone could “more closely approach the physical limits of the system.”

The above milestone marks a great advance for the AI drone racing community. Obviously, there are implications to drone-based activity in the real world. Delivery drones could benefit from similar AI tuning, for example. However, wider implications for industries that will one day churn out millions of autonomous robots, self-driving cars, and so on are also clear.

PalmPay, an African digital bank fintech, is in talks to raise between $50 million and $100 million in a Series B round, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. 

It's unclear what valuation it hopes to get, but its last round, in 2021, ranked it among the continent's most valuable startups, estimated just shy of unicorn status.

While PalmPay declined to comment on fundraising specifics, a spokesperson said the 6-year-old fintech is “in a strong financial position and exploring growth opportunities.”

The company, which has raised nearly $140 million across its seed and Series A rounds, is now profitable, according to people familiar with its finances.

The new capital, expected to include both equity and debt, will fuel PalmPay's expansion: deepening its footprint in Nigeria, scaling its newer business-focused offering, and rolling out both products in new markets across Africa and Asia.

Last month, PalmPay announced it had hit 15 million daily transactions, driven by its 35 million registered users. These transactions now add up to “tens of billions of dollars” annually in value, according to the company.

Revenue has also surged. PalmPay's revenue — $64 million in 2023, according to the Financial Times — has more than doubled since, people familiar with the company's financials say. 

Launched in 2019, PalmPay started out in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and a major fintech hub. At the time, over half of adults in the country were unbanked, and traditional banks catered mostly to salaried or formal-sector clients, often with requirements that excluded mass-market users.

PalmPay saw an opportunity to flip that model on its head: build a digital bank from scratch, but optimize it for the realities of Africa's informal economy. The company launched an app featuring instant onboarding, zero transfer fees, and a growing suite of services (including credit, savings, insurance, and bill payments), all tailored to the needs of underbanked consumers and small businesses.

Crucially, PalmPay didn't rely solely on digital acquisition. The fintech built a vast on-the-ground network of over 1 million small businesses and agent merchants, who now serve more than 10 million customers monthly through the PalmPay Business app and point-of-sale devices (for cash-in, cash-out services). 

Other major fintechs in the country, including OPay, Moniepoint, and Paga, have also adopted the hybrid model, combining digital apps with physical touchpoints.

PalmPay claims to process more transactions than any traditional bank in Nigeria, and 25% of its users report that it was their first-ever financial account. For credit products, offered in partnership with licensed lenders, that number jumps to 60% among borrowers, it claims.

Part of PalmPay's strong distribution and marketing advantage stems from its partnership with Transsion, the Chinese phone maker that dominates smartphone sales in Africa, with a market share of over 40% across its brands (Tecno and Infinix). 

Through the partnership, PalmPay pre-installs its app on select financed smartphones, helping drive user acquisition and engagement.

Having established itself as one of the most widely used fintech apps in the country, PalmPay is now preparing to replicate its model in new markets abroad. 

The neobanking platform has expanded to Tanzania and Bangladesh (its first foray outside Africa), where PalmPay is entering with device financing and consumer credit as wedges before layering in more services. (Other African digital banks, including FairMoney, MNT-Halan, and TymeBank, have expanded their financial services into Asia with varying degrees of success.)

The company also plans to introduce device financing in Nigeria, its spokesperson confirmed. 

While Transsion, which led PalmPay's seed round, remains a strategic partner, the company's spokesperson says the fintech is actively exploring collaborations with more original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). 

GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund) and MediaTek, one of the world's largest mobile chipset makers, are some of its other investors. 

On the business-facing side, PalmPay offers cross-border payments for merchants who want to send and collect payments across Africa via a single API, a recurring pain point (even with the promise of stablecoins). This newly launched business feature, currently live in Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania (with South Africa in the pipeline), already processes “hundreds of millions of dollars monthly,” the company's spokesperson confirmed.

A new study to be presented at the SLEEP 2025 annual meeting found that poor sleep quality is related to relationship insecurity, which moderates the effect of sleep quality on daily feelings of jealousy.

Results show that anxious attachment, which involves difficulties with trust and low self-esteem in relationships, was related to poorer sleep quality. The study also found that poor sleep quality was associated with more daily feelings of jealousy, but this effect was only significant for those with high levels of attachment anxiety.

Interestingly, poor sleep wasn't uniformly related to all negative socioemotional outcomes. This suggests that attachment style might shape which emotions are most affected by sleep quality."

Giovanni Alvarado, lead author and doctoral candidate at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, sleep is essential to health. The AASM recommends that adults should sleep 7 or more hours per night on a regular basis to promote optimal health. In addition to adequate duration, healthy sleep requires good quality, appropriate timing and regularity, and the absence of sleep disturbances or disorders.

The study involved 68 young adults who completed questionnaires about sleep and relationships. They also completed daily self-reports capturing experiences of social emotions and behaviors over a two-week period.

According to Alvarado, the study underscores the complex link between sleep and relationships.

"People with anxious attachment, or those who struggle with insecurity in relationships, may be especially vulnerable to feelings of envy and jealousy when they're sleep deprived," said Alvarado. "This helps us understand why some individuals may have more difficulty navigating social situations when they're tired and could inform more targeted interventions that consider an individual's relationship style when addressing sleep issues."

The research abstract was published recently in an online supplement of the journal Sleep and will be presented Tuesday, June 10, during SLEEP 2025 in Seattle. SLEEP is the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

Researchers from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, along with multiple collaborators, have developed a compact diagnostic platform that can evaluate antibody protection against COVID-19 using only a single microliter of fingertip blood. Known as the Tip Optofluidic Immunoassay (TOI), the system delivers a comprehensive immune profile-measuring both antibody binding and viral inhibition-in just 40 minutes.

As new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge and individual vaccination or infection histories grow more complex, there is an urgent need for accessible tools that can assess immune protection quickly and accurately. The TOI platform addresses this challenge by combining microfluidic biosensing and chemiluminescence detection in a portable format suitable for both clinical and field use.

At the core of the platform are high-affinity polystyrene microfluidic immuno-reactors that interface directly with standard pipette tips. These reactors are paired with a portable chemiluminescent imaging station, creating a simple yet powerful workflow. This design supports the rapid and quantitative evaluation of IgG binding levels, binding kinetics, and virus inhibition capacity-all using only a small drop of fingertip blood, without the need for complex laboratory equipment or large sample volumes.

Compared with traditional assays such as ELISA or virus neutralization tests (VNTs), TOI significantly reduces testing time and operational demands. It achieves a detection sensitivity of approximately 0.1 ng/mL, spans a dynamic range of 3 to 4.5 orders of magnitude, and delivers a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10,000. These features enable accurate, high-resolution immune analysis at the point of care.

A key innovation in the methodology is the development of RIVIA 2.0, a rapid in vitro inhibition assay that emulates viral neutralization. Central to this advance is the rational protein engineering of SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S-ECD) trimers, synthetically optimized with orientation-specific Avi-biotin tags to ensure consistent and functional surface presentation. These engineered protein probes, paired with human ACE2-Fc receptors, form a highly controlled binding interface that enables precise measurement of neutralizing antibody activity within just 20 minutes. By applying synthetic biology principles to optimize these probes, RIVIA 2.0 significantly improves the speed, reproducibility, and scalability of functional immune testing over conventional neutralization assays.

The system was validated with 135 samples from 113 individuals, including a subset followed over six months. The results confirmed TOI's ability to detect broad-spectrum and high-titer antibody responses, particularly among individuals with hybrid vaccine regimens. Importantly, the researchers proposed a preliminary IgG concentration threshold (~20 ng/mL) associated with reduced short-term infection risk, highlighting TOI's potential for predictive immune monitoring.

Beyond COVID-19, the platform could be adapted for other infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, or future viral threats. Its low sample requirements and portable design make it particularly valuable for decentralized testing in clinics, communities, and resource-limited settings. It also holds promise for therapeutic antibody development and vaccine efficacy studies.

This study demonstrates how TOI bridges the gap between advanced laboratory diagnostics and real-world application. By combining speed, sensitivity, and multi-dimensional immune assessment in a highly compact format, TOI sets a new benchmark for personalized and scalable infectious disease management.

The research was led by SIAT in collaboration with Peking University, Changping Laboratory, Shenzhen University, the National Innovation Center for Advanced Medical Devices, Sino Biological Inc., University of Michigan, and the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Birmingham spin-out Linear Diagnostics has been awarded £1m funding to finalize the development of a rapid test for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in partnership with the NIHR HealthTech Research Centre (HRC) in Diagnostic and Technology Evaluation and the North East Innovation Lab, part of Newcastle Hospitals. 

Linear is developing a low-cost, accurate, near-patient diagnostic platform, that aims to diagnose infection from a single sample faster than any commercially available alternative. 

The funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Invention for Innovation programme covers a three-year package of work, which will culminate in the first test of the technology on clinical samples in a real-world setting, and readiness for clinical trials.

Linear's Exponential Amplification (EXPAR) technology detects bacterial DNA using an extremely fast method for amplifying the signal, which was developed and tested at the University during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The company has now shown that it can detect bacterial STIs, urinary tract infections, and viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 in as little as 5 minutes.

In recent years the company has focussed on STIs, specifically Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis as the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strain of the former has become a global concern. 

It is here that rapid testing is essential to stop the chain of transmission, so patients can be diagnosed and start treatment within one clinic visit. While current tests may be easy to use with minimal training, existing technologies have been unable to meet the target of 20 minutes from sample to results. 

The new funding will enable Linear to finalise the design of a cartridge and reader design platform and validate the platform.

The most difficult criteria to achieve in diagnostic testing is combining rapidity with accuracy. While rapid lateral flow meets the ideal timeframe of 20 minutes to diagnosis, it struggles to meet market requirements for high sensitivity and specificity. And while Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests deliver high accuracy, samples are sent to laboratories for analysis, meaning the waiting time for results may be days. We are developing a near patient device that will overcome this conundrum."

Dr. Jean-Louis Duprey, Head of Research and Development at Linear Diagnostics

The HRC, hosted by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with Newcastle University, will help to evaluate the technology.

Dr. Jana Suklan, Senior Methodologist at the HRC, said: "The NIHR HRC in Diagnostic and Technology Evaluation is delighted to be collaborating with the North East Innovation Lab to support Linear Diagnostics with their exciting technology. Through reviewing clinical guidelines and speaking with healthcare professionals as well as patients and the public we will pinpoint how the platform can be developed and used so it can improve patient care."

"Our research involves analysing unmet needs, examining current practice and identifying the most promising point in the patient pathway for implementing the technology. We will also assess the diagnostic accuracy of the test by statistically analyzing data collected by the innovation lab and determine whether adopting the technology will provide value for money for the NHS through health economic modelling. Our public contributors will guide the research and ensure it meets the needs of patients, public and carers." 

John Tyson, Head of the North East Innovation Lab, part of Newcastle Hospitals, said: "We're delighted to have the opportunity to continue our collaborative work with our partner innovators to support the development and evaluation of this new exciting test. By providing access to an extensive range of clinical samples and NHS lab performance testing, we can generate the necessary evidence to move new innovative technologies to the next stage of their development or launch to mainstream use."

Giving a P2Y12 inhibitor anti-clotting drug to patients with coronary artery disease is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke compared with traditional aspirin, with no increased risk of major bleeding, finds a study published by The BMJ today.

P2Y12 inhibitors are often given to patients alongside aspirin ("dual therapy") after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) - a procedure to widen or unblock a coronary artery - to help prevent cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke.

After several months, patients are usually switched from dual therapy to lifelong aspirin, but some trials have suggested that a P2Y12 inhibitor may be more effective for long term prevention than aspirin.

To explore this further, researchers analysed individual patient data from five randomized clinical trials involving 16,117 patients (average age 65; 24% women) who were assigned to a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) or aspirin after completing dual therapy following PCI.

After an average follow-up period of around 4 years, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy was associated with a 23% lower risk of an outcome that combined cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke, compared with aspirin, with no significant difference in major bleeding. This means that for every 46 patients taking a P2Y12 inhibitor instead of aspirin after dual therapy, one cardiovascular death, heart attack, or stroke would be prevented.

When considering outcomes individually, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy reduced heart attacks and stroke compared with aspirin. However, all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and stent thrombosis were similar between the treatments.

The researchers acknowledge that some changes in the original design of some trials were needed to create uniform data, and that certain characteristics of individual trial populations may reduce the generalisability of the findings.

But they say no significant difference in major bleeding between groups was seen, and results were consistent after further analyses accounting for factors such as age, sex, geographical region, smoking, previous heart attack or stroke, underlying conditions and medication history, suggesting they are robust.

"Overall, this study supports preferential P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy prescription over aspirin due to reductions in major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) without increasing major bleeding in the medium term," say researchers in a linked editorial.

However, they note that "medium term efficacy does not necessarily extend lifelong, which is the duration we advise patients to continue these medications."

As such, they suggest that "a large-scale globally representative trial directly comparing different monotherapy strategies (including discontinuation) with extended follow-up would benefit our understanding of the long-term impact of P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy across the treatment class for secondary prevention following PCI."

A team at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), led by Jorge Alegre-Cebollada, has developed an innovative method, called TEVs-TTN, for studying the specific mechanical functions of proteins through their controlled cleavage, a process that renders the proteins unable to sense and transmit mechanical force. The study results extend knowledge about the development of muscular diseases.

The study, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, demonstrates that interrupting mechanical transmission by the protein titin precipitates muscular diseases. This finding opens new routes to understanding muscular dystrophies and other diseases associated with the protein titin.

Titin, named after the titans of Greek mythology, is the largest protein in animals and plays a critical role as the structural linchpin of sarcomeres, the contractile units of muscle cells. Mutations in the titin gene (TTN) are a leading cause of congenital muscular diseases and cardiomyopathies, explains first author Dr. Roberto Silva-Rojas: "Many of these mutations generate a prematurely truncated form of the protein, impeding its correct anchoring in the sarcomeres and disrupting muscle function."

Through controlled cleavage of titin with TEVs-TTN, the CNIC team was able to replicate the sarcomere disorganization typical of patients with titin mutations. As Silva-Rojas explains, muscles with cleaved titin show similar defects to those observed in patients, including cell-volume reduction, nuclear internalization, mitochondrial aggregation, and interstitial fibrosis.

"In the absence of experimental animal models with titin-cleavage mutations, our approach allows a structured and targeted analysis of the impact of these types of alterations. This makes TEVs-TTN an ideal tool for testing therapies designed to mitigate the effects of impaired sarcomere integrity."

One intriguing finding of the study is that titin cleavage caused complete disintegration of sarcomeres over the course of a few days, leaving muscle cells devoid of their basic functional unit. Nevertheless, these cells survived, suggesting that similar processes might operate in other situations, such as muscle tears, heart failure, or cardiotoxicity associated with chemotherapy.

The methodology developed at the CNIC marks a milestone in the study of how protein mechanics contribute to tissue and organ physiology. Just as titin is critical for force transmission in sarcomeres, other proteins, such as dystrophin, dystroglycan complexes, integrins, and lamins, play critical roles in extracellular matrix regulation and cell membrane integrity.

The new tool will enable the research team to confirm or refute hypotheses about the functioning of these proteins. These advances, in turn, could pave the way to the development of new therapeutic strategies for many diseases beyond those affecting muscle.

The study was funded mainly by the European Research Council through the ProtMechanics-Life Consolidator Grant (101002927) and a postdoctoral fellowship from the European Molecular Biology Organization to Dr. Silva-Rojas (EMBO ALTF 417-2022).

Scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget), Milan, have found that gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 in combination with AAV6 vectors can trigger inflammatory and senescence-like responses in blood stem cells, compromising their long-term ability to regenerate the blood system. The study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, outlines new strategies to overcome this hurdle, improving both the safety and efficacy of gene-editing-based therapies for inherited blood disorders.

The research was led by Dr. Raffaella Di Micco, group leader at SR-Tiget, New York Stem Cell Foundation Robertson Investigator and Associate Professor at the School for Advanced Studies (IUSS) of Pavia, in collaboration with Professor Luigi Naldini, Director of SR-Tiget, and several European research partners.

Homology-directed repair (HDR)-based gene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) holds great promise for the treatment of genetic blood diseases. Despite significant advances in HDR-based gene editing, translating these approaches into safe and effective clinical therapies for patients remains a major challenge. While the technology shows strong potential in laboratory settings, achieving reliable, durable outcomes in human hematopoietic stem cells - without compromising their function - has indeed proven difficult. The team of Di Micco at SR-Tiget discovered that CRISPR-Cas9 editing, especially when using AAV6 vectors to deliver the repair template, activates a strong DNA damage response (DDR) and inflammatory signals driven by p53 and IL-1/NF-κB pathways.This leads to inflammation and a senescence-like state that reduces the the regenerative capacity of the edited cells post-transplantation.

We found that a fraction of gene-edited hematopoietic stem cells shows signs of premature aging. This reduces their ability to regenerate blood cells after transplantation, which can limit the long-term success and therapeutic benefit of gene therapy."

Dr. Raffaella Di Micco, group leader at SR-Tiget

We were surprised by the persistence of senescence-like features even months after transplantation," says Dr. Anastasia Conti, first author of the study and Project Leader in Dr. Di Micco's lab. "Our findings suggest that stem cells retain a 'memory' of the genetic engineering process. These adverse effects are not just transient stress responses-they can lead to lasting impairments in stem cell function.

To counteract this adverse effect, the researchers tested two complementary strategies:transient p53 inhibition and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, particularly Anakinra - a clinically approved IL-1 receptor antagonist.

"Both approaches significantly reduced senescence markers in edited HSPCs and improved their ability to regenerate a healthy, diverse blood system in preclinical models. Importantly, Anakinra also reduced potential genotoxic events, such as large deletions and translocations, suggesting a safer profile compared to p53 inhibition alone" says Dr. Conti.

"Our study shows that modulating the inflammatory and senescence-related response during gene editing can preserve the fitness of edited hematopoietic stem cells and enable more stable and polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution in the long-term. These findings help explain setbacks observed in recent clinical trials involving HDR-based gene editing in blood stem cells and offer a concrete path to enhance outcomes. The strategies proposed could be especially valuable for diseases requiring long-term correction and stem cell engraftment, such as immunodeficiencies or bone marrow failure syndromes" concludes Dr. Di Micco.

This groundbreaking research was conducted in the Di Micco Lab with support from the European Research Council (ERC), the European Innovation Council (X-PAND), and the New York Stem Cell Foundation. With a longstanding history of pioneering gene therapy technologies, SR-Tiget continues to lead international efforts to optimize CRISPR-based treatments for safe clinical translation.

A baby's makeup of gut bacteria - their microbiome - which starts to form as soon as they are born, could help protect against viral infections later in childhood, a new study suggests.

As part of the largest study of UK baby microbiomes to date, researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and University College London (UCL) found that babies with a specific mix of gut bacteria at one week old, which was only found in some babies born vaginally, were less likely to be hospitalised for viral lower respiratory tract infections (vLRTI) in the first two years of life.

This research, published today (4 June) in The Lancet Microbe, is the first study to show an association between the makeup of the gut microbiome in the first week of life and hospital admissions for respiratory infections in early childhood. The team did this using whole genome sequencing and analysis of stool samples from 1,082 newborns and then using their electronic health records to track admissions to hospital up to the age of two years old.

Building on previous findings from the UK Baby Biome Study, this new research suggests that certain microbiome compositions could give different benefits, such as protection against viral infections.

While further research is needed to prove this link, these findings could help shape future research and prevention efforts for childhood respiratory diseases, including the development of effective infant therapeutic probiotics to reduce the risk of respiratory infections in infants.

Overall, this study sheds more light on how the gut microbiome in early life plays a role in our future health and underscores the importance of even larger studies such as the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project.

The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of millions of microbes that are vital for human health and important in immune system development. As it begins to form immediately at birth, the first month is the earliest window for intervention that could be used to restore or boost the microbiome.

Previously, the team found that babies born vaginally have a different microbiome compared to those born via caesarean section (C-section), although the differences largely evened out by the time the child was one-year old. A different study from the same team also found that all UK babies have one of three bacteria within the first week of life, called pioneer bacteria. Two of these, Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) and Bifidobacterium breve (B. breve), are considered beneficial as they help promote the development of a stable microbiome.

In new research that builds on both of these studies, the team at the Sanger Institute and UCL analysed stool samples from 1,082 newborns to understand how pioneer gut bacteria acquired in the first week of life may affect their health outcomes later in infancy. The researchers then looked at electronic health records to track admissions to hospital from birth and up to the age of two, and see if there was any association.

The researchers found some babies born vaginally, with a higher amount of pioneer bacteria B. longum in their early gut microbiome, alongside other similarly beneficial Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species, such as B. bifidum and B. dorei, had a lower risk of being admitted overnight to hospital for vLRTI, when compared to all other babies. This was still seen after taking account of important confounders, such as babies receiving antibiotics, and whether babies were fed with breastmilk, formula, or both.

However, not all babies born vaginally had the same microbiome composition. The team identified two other groups of babies based on their microbiome profile, who had a higher risk of hospital admission for vLRTI compared to those in the B. longum group. These other microbiome profiles were found in babies born vaginally and by C-section.

It's important to note that the team observed this finding as an association, otherwise known as correlation, and further research is needed to prove any causal links. While this study has examined only one common health outcome in children - respiratory viral infections - future research with a much larger cohort is needed to investigate whether the possible protective effects of B. longum, or other potentially beneficial pioneer bacteria such as B. breve, may be linked to other health outcomes. The researchers aim to explore this in the upcoming 4M study.

Dr Cristina Garcia-Mauriño, first author of the study at UCL, said: "Viral lower respiratory tract infection is one of the leading causes of hospitalisation in young children, and our research raises the possibility that certain early gut microbiomes might help lower this risk. Further research to confirm and explore the factors behind this, including if there is an interaction between the gut microbiome and the lung microbiome, could lead to new ways to help prevent respiratory infections in childhood."

While observational, our findings that certain infant microbiomes are linked to a lower risk of viral respiratory infection in childhood are striking and new. This is the first time that this association has been observed, and it was only possible due to the size of the Baby Biome Study, and by combining high-resolution genomics technologies with clinical outcomes. To understand more about how our microbiome impacts health, larger studies such as the 4M project are crucial, and I am looking forward to insights from both the Baby Biome Study and 4M that will further shape our understanding of how our microbiomes and our health interact."

Professor Nigel Field, senior study author at UCL, and co-lead of the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project

Professor Louise Kenny, Lead Investigator of the Children Growing up in Liverpool (C-GULL) study and previously a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, who was not involved in this study, said: "A Caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby. Furthermore, decisions around childbirth are personal and complex, and there is not one single approach that is best for everyone. While this study suggests that some babies born vaginally may be less likely to experience severe respiratory infections, this was not seen across all babies born this way, suggesting that other factors are at play. Further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture and to help find new ways to ensure advice and clinical approaches are tailored to personal situations."

Dr. Trevor Lawley, senior study author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, and co-lead of the Microbes, Milk, Mental Health and Me (4M) project, said: "Within the first few days of our lives, our microbiomes are already thriving ecosystems that develop and adapt with us as we age. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that the pioneer gut bacteria acquired in early life may influence health later on, highlighting how gut microbes could help protect us from infections and other diseases. Different types of infant gut bacteria may provide different benefits, and understanding these could pave the way for developing targeted infant probiotics to support early microbiome development. In the future, we might be able to create personalized interventions that optimise a child's gut microbiome based on their unique microbial profile, promoting better health and development."

A new National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant will aid Wayne State University researchers in measuring the effects of fentanyl during pregnancy on maternal behaviors and offspring at birth through early development.

This two-year, $423,500 grant, "Understanding the effects of gestational fentanyl exposure on external morphology, neonatal opioid withdrawal, and brain volume, morphology and neurochemistry of offspring," is supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the NIH. The principal investigators on this study are Shane Perrine, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences in Wayne State's School of Medicine, and Susanne Brummelte, Ph.D., professor of psychology in Wayne State's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

Our labs have collaborated on prior studies and this project is a natural extension of our previous work. I was working on the study of illicit fentanyl use and Susie's lab was looking at the effects of opioids, including morphine and buprenorphine, during pregnancy."

Shane Perrine, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences in Wayne State's School of Medicine

Both researchers credited a news report and a previous NIH grant received by Brummelte to examine the effects of opioids during pregnancy as what inspired them to explore this area.

"An NBC news report came out that was based on a published study suggesting there's a new syndrome called fetal fentanyl syndrome related to fentanyl use during pregnancy," said Perrine. "This was characterized by birth defects such as facial abnormalities, webbed toes and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. We wanted to study these effects in our rodent model since it involved both of our areas of study."

The study will determine the impact of gestational fentanyl exposure on morbidity and mortality, developmental milestones, external morphology, blood cholesterol, brain morphogen signaling, and neonatal opioid withdrawal and related behavioral measures in offspring. The team will also measure brain volume, morphology and the neurochemistry of offspring using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy in vivo.

"No previous studies used proper animal models to study the effects of fetal fentanyl syndrome," said Brummelte. "In humans, timing, exposure, the dose and so forth can make interpreting findings difficult so we wanted a more controlled study using the funds from this grant."

"Developing the animal model will allow us to explore the neurobiological mechanisms that cause these fetal fentanyl syndrome defects," said Perrine. "We want to see if it is just fentanyl or if there are other factors at play such as polydrug use or genetic predisposition that can contribute to these defects."

Perrine and Brummelte hope their findings may help mitigate adverse health outcomes of infants exposed to fentanyl during pregnancy.

"Once we find out what specifically is causing these defects, we can start looking for solutions to prevent them or address them," said Brummelte.

"R21 awards from the National Institutes of Health help support researchers explore new research ideas that could foster innovative ideas that may one day lead to breakthrough discoveries," said Ezemenari M. Obasi, Ph.D., vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "I look forward to the findings that Drs. Perrine and Brummelte will have that may lead to new knowledge about the impact of fentanyl on unborn children."

The award number for this grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health is R21DA062066.

A new norovirus strain is sweeping the US, dethroning the long-standing leader and reshaping the landscape of gastroenteritis outbreaks. Will GII.17 remain on top, or could another variant emerge next?

A recent study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases reported rising predominance of norovirus GII.17 in the United States (US). Norovirus remains the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States. Noroviruses are genetically stratified into 10 genogroups (GI to GX) and further into 48 genotypes and 60 P-types.

GI and GII genogroup viruses are responsible for the most outbreaks. Between 2011 and 2024, GII.4 viruses accounted for over half of outbreaks in the US in each season (September to August). In 2014, several Asian countries found that a GII.17 strain had completely replaced the GII.4 Sydney strain, and it was also detected in the US and Europe.

Nevertheless, GII.4 viruses rebounded in 2016, regaining their global predominance. The likely ancestor of the current GII.17 virus is a strain that caused an outbreak in Romania in 2021. However, during the 2023-24 season, several countries recorded increased GII.17 outbreaks and cases.

In the present study, researchers analyzed the increase in GII.17 outbreaks since 2022. First, they examined the genotype distribution of outbreaks between September 2022 and April 2025 using CaliciNet, the norovirus outbreak surveillance network of public health laboratories in the United States, which serves as a valuable early warning system for emerging strains. Genotypes were categorized into three groups: GII.4 (including GII.4 Wichita, GII.4 Sydney, and GII.4 San Francisco), GII.17, and all other genotypes.

In the 2022-23 season, GII.4 and GII.17 accounted for 48.9% and 7.5% of outbreaks, respectively. In 2023-24, GII.17 caused 34.3% of all outbreaks, while GII.4 outbreaks accounted for 27.7%. Moreover, by the 2024-25 season (data up to April 2025), GII.17 accounted for 75.4% of outbreaks so far, whereas GII.4 outbreaks accounted for 10.7%.



Increase in outbreaks of norovirus GII.17 over GII.4, United States, 2022–2025. Seasons are defined as September 1 of one year to August 31 of the next. The 2024–25 season is truncated to September 2024–April 2025. Other genotypes: GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, GI.4, GI.5, GI.5, GI.6, GI.7, GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, GII.6, GII.7, GII.8, GII.10, GII.12, GII.13, GII.14, GII.21, GII.27, and GIX.1.

Peak norovirus activity was observed in February, March, and January, in 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons, respectively. GII.17 outbreaks overtook GII.4 outbreaks in April 2024, and GII.17 accounted for more than 50% of outbreaks each month from May 2024 to March 2025. The distribution of GII.17 and GII.4 outbreaks showed no regional differences. During September-December, GII.17 accounted for 13.4%, 17.1%, and 46.3% of all outbreaks in the 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25 seasons, respectively.

The data indicate a considerable shift in the norovirus outbreak genotype distribution in the US between 2022 and 2025, with the emergence of GII.17 as the predominant genotype. This shift coincided with a decline in GII.4, which had traditionally been the leading cause of outbreaks in the US. Norovirus season usually starts in December in the US. However, during the 2024-25 season, it began in early October. During the 2023-24 season, a protracted outbreak occurred, with cases observed even in the summer, likely due to the sustained circulation of GII.17.

Meanwhile, the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons followed a more typical pattern with cases declining in the spring months. With the decline in GII.4 outbreaks, whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season remains unclear. In summary, GII.17 accounted for 75% of all outbreaks in the 2024-25 season so far, replacing GII.4 as the predominant strain in the United States.

Further genomic analyses of GII.17 and identification of neutralizing antibodies against GII.17 could help determine whether the GII.17 strain will persist. In addition, continued surveillance of norovirus is necessary to determine whether GII.17 will remain the predominant strain.

While UK families cherish the togetherness of takeaway nights, new research uncovers surprising trends about who is most likely to indulge, challenging assumptions about income, convenience, and the real meaning of family meals.

Study: “Takeaway Night”: Understanding UK Families' Consumption of Takeaway Food for Family Mealtimes. Image Credit: Lucky Business / Shutterstock

Friday night tradition reigns supreme: Takeaways weren't just occasional; they became a ritual, with 75% of families specifically choosing Friday or Saturday dinners for their shared takeaway meals.

In a recent article published in the journal Appetite, researchers at the University of Reading, UK, investigated how families incorporate takeaway food – defined as hot food prepared away from home, collected or delivered, and eaten at home as part of a shared family meal – into shared family mealtimes. They aimed to understand the emotional and social benefits of eating together as a family that might counterbalance, though this remains unproven, the poor nutritional quality of their meals.

They found that almost all families (96%) reported at least occasional takeaway use, although most had takeout less than once a week. Parents viewed it positively as an enjoyable, convenient treat that fostered family connection. While most parents expressed positive views, some also acknowledged guilt or concern about the healthiness of takeaways. Parents from low-income households and the most deprived neighborhoods were more likely to consume takeaways frequently. However, this pattern was non-linear: high-income households showed a similar frequency to low-income ones, suggesting complex socio-economic influences.

"Break from the grind" mentality: Parents didn't just find takeaways convenient; they described them as a vital "break from the grind" of daily meal planning, cooking, and cleanup, reducing stress and workload.

In today's food environment, families have widespread access to food that is not prepared at home. These options fall under the UK's broader definition of takeaway food, which typically refers to hot meals collected or delivered for consumption at home.

However, strong evidence suggests that takeaway food is nutritionally poor, being high in saturated fat, salt, and sugar. It is associated with higher calorie intake, increased body fat, and risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The growing availability and consumption of takeaway food is considered a factor in the obesity epidemic.

Despite these concerns, family mealtimes, regardless of the food served, are associated with numerous positive developmental outcomes. Research suggests that regular family meals are linked to enhanced mental health and well-being in children and adolescents, as well as decreased involvement in high-risk behaviors.

Although preparing meals can be stressful for parents, they generally value the shared experience and often prioritize health in their meal planning. In this context, takeaway food may reduce conflict and ease preparation while still promoting family togetherness.

Yet, it remains unclear whether these social benefits can counterbalance the nutritional drawbacks. This study, therefore, aimed to explore how often and why UK families consume takeaway food for family mealtimes, and under what circumstances.

Frequency Takeaway Food Consumed for Family Mealtimes (N = 189)

Joint decision-making wins: Choosing wasn't left to one person. Nearly three-quarters of families (73%) reported everyone having input on both the restaurant and what to order, making it a shared family activity.

This cross-sectional study employed an online survey to investigate how UK families utilize takeaway food for family meals, focusing on parents of children aged 18 years or younger residing in the UK.

Recruitment combined broad outreach via social media and parenting forums with focused efforts to reach underrepresented groups, such as single parents, ethnic minorities, and low-income households, through targeted platforms and community noticeboards.

Participants who accessed the survey were first presented with study information and definitions of key terms, such as "takeaway food" and "family mealtime." The survey included two main components. The questionnaire, developed by the researchers, consisted of five closed-ended and six open-ended questions assessing frequency, timing, participants, and reasons for takeaway use. It also captured decision-making processes related to ordering and consumption settings. A second questionnaire collected socio-demographic data.

Data quality was ensured through multiple checks, including attention checks, required open-ended responses, and time analysis.

Quantitative data were analyzed using binary logistic regression to explore which socio-demographic factors predicted frequent takeaway consumption. Variables for the regression model were selected through univariate analyses, and categorical variables were collapsed when needed for statistical validity.

TV dinners vs. table talk: While over half (54%) ate their takeaways at the table together, almost a third (32%) opted for TV dinners, enjoying their meals in front of the screen in the living room.

Out of 246 participants, 189 were eligible for analysis. Most were female (95%), White (86%), well-educated (78%), and lived with a partner and children (83%) in high-income households (77%). About one-third lived in more deprived areas, though the sample underrepresented ethnic minorities (14% vs 18% national average) and overrepresented degree holders (78% vs 34% nationally).

Takeaway food was consumed infrequently (less than once a week) by 74% and frequently (once a week or more) by 26%. Most frequent consumers had takeaway once a week (84%), while a few had it several times per week (16%).

Over the years, 44% reported no change in consumption frequency, 31% reported a decrease, and 25% reported an increase. Decreases were mainly due to cost or income constraints; increases were often linked to children growing old enough to eat takeaway food.

Regression analysis revealed that middle-income households were significantly less likely to frequently consume takeaway food compared to low-income households. Participants from moderately deprived areas were also less likely to consume frequently than those in the most deprived areas. Notably, high-income households showed no significant difference in frequency compared to low-income households.

Takeaway food was most commonly consumed during Friday or Saturday dinners (75%). Families usually ate together at the table, made joint decisions about orders, and mostly ordered through food apps, especially pizza.

Convenience, ease, enjoyment, and treating the family were key motivations. Downsides included high cost, unhealthiness, occasional guilt, and dissatisfaction with quality or service.

The researchers found that while takeaway consumption was common, it was usually infrequent, framed as a convenient and enjoyable family treat. Socio-demographic analysis revealed a non-linear relationship where both low- and high-income families consumed takeaway more frequently than middle-income families, indicating complex socio-economic dynamics.

The study's mixed-methods design and efforts to recruit a diverse sample strengthened its findings. However, the overrepresentation of highly educated, White mothers may have led to underestimates of takeaway frequency. The study did not assess the nutritional quality of takeaways, and the perspectives of males were limited.

Policymakers should consider the emotional and social value of takeaway meals to families and prioritize improving their nutritional quality over restricting access, including interventions addressing portion sizes, advertising standards, and reformulation. Future research should explore broader eating patterns and socioeconomic status-linked motivations, particularly how families balance convenience and enjoyment with nutritional concerns.

It's a compliment to Sullivan and Harriel's talents, but it might also be a reflection of the national team's bigger issues. Dest joins a long list of stars who are injured or out for other reasons.

CHICAGO — Union midfielder Quinn Sullivan and defender Nathan Harriel made the U.S. men's soccer team's squad for the Concacaf Gold Cup, the team announced Thursday. 

It's a nice compliment to their talents, but it might also be a reflection of the national team's bigger issues. A slew of key players are injured, some are committed to the Club World Cup this summer, and others have fallen out of favor with manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Just this week, the injured list grew by two notable names. First, Downingtown-born goalkeeper Zack Steffen suffered a knee injury in practice, just after recovering from an abdominal injury.

Then on Thursday, U.S. Soccer announced that right back Sergiño Dest was judged not fit enough for the summer's slate, following his return from a torn ACL. He suffered the injury in April of last year and returned in March to his club team, the Netherlands' PSV Eindhoven. Dest played seven games down the stretch of the season, and only one was a full 90 minutes. 

“The technical, medical and high performance staffs have done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp,” Pochettino said in a statement. “In the case of Sergiño, we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season.”

Amid all the absences, Pochettino has turned to a crop of players from Major League Soccer to try to win the continental title and to restore fans' faith a year before the biggest World Cup ever.

Harriel's odds of making his senior national team debut this summer go up with Dest's absence, though this isn't the way anyone would ask for it. He already was a late addition to camp because of other injuries, and now the 24-year-old is one of two right backs on the Gold Cup team. The other is Orlando City's 20-year-old Alex Freeman — the son of former Eagles and Green Bay Packers wide receiver Antonio Freeman.

Union fans know Harriel also can play other defensive positions in a pinch. He might not have to with the U.S., with five centerbacks and two leftbacks forming the rest of the unit. 

The centerbacks include Union alumnus Mark McKenzie, a potential starter next to starting lock Chris Richards. The left backs include John Tolkin of Germany's Holstein Kiel (and formerly the New York Red Bulls), who was called in to fill the spot opened by Dest's injury.

Sullivan is an interesting case. He's listed as a midfielder on the U.S. roster, and that's how he plays with the Union. But he's just as likely — perhaps more likely — to play as a winger with the national team. 

This squad's winger class also includes Union alumni Brenden and Paxten Aaronson, Damion Downs of Germany's FC Köln, and Haji Wright of England's Coventry City. The Aaronsons have their own versatility: Brenden is listed as a midfielder but can play as a winger, and Paxten is listed as a forward but can play in many spots. Wright also can play at striker or out wide.

Brenden Aaronson gave Sullivan a nice endorsement this week in an interview with The Inquirer. 

“I've seen him grow over the last years from afar,” Aaronson said. “His assists are unbelievable at the moment. His numbers with his assists, and his numbers with goals, and how he is in the game — he's lively, he wants to get on the ball always, he doesn't have any fear.”

It's seven assists and two goals so far this year, to be precise. Aaronson hasn't seen them all live, because a 7:30 p.m. kickoff at Subaru Park is 12:30 a.m. at his home in England. But he was at Subaru Park when the Union hosted Lionel Messi's Inter Miami a few weeks ago, and Sullivan scored a great goal that night just after being named to the U.S. training camp squad.

“He always gives 100%, and he's always great to have on your team,” Aaronson said. “You want players like that. … He just goes out there and plays, and that's what he's doing right now.”

Eight players in all across the 26-player squad have ties to the Union, whether as former players or former academy prospects: the two Aaronsons, Harriel, McKenzie, Sullivan, goalkeeper Matt Freese, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Brian White.

The U.S. will play Turkey on Saturday in East Hartford, Conn. (3:30 p.m., TNT, Telemundo 62), then Switzerland on Tuesday in Nashville (8 p.m., TNT, Peacock). The Gold Cup starts on June 14, with the U.S. playing Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia, and Haiti in its group. (That last game could see Sullivan and Harriel playing against Union teammate Danley Jean Jacques.)

The Gold Cup runs until July 6. If the U.S. makes the final — and it's under well-earned pressure to win the title — Sullivan and Harriel would miss four Union games. Their first one back would be the July 9 U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal against the New York Red Bulls.

On Wednesday night, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a travel ban against 12 countries in a move he described as “protecting the national security and national interest of the United States and its people.”

The ban goes into effect on Monday, and it entails a ban against travel into the United States by citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar (Burma), Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. This ban relates to the entry of both immigrants and non-immigrants.

Trump also imposed partial restrictions and limits on the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

From a soccer perspective, the news is particularly significant because FIFA is hosting two tournaments in the United States over the next 13 months — first the FIFA Club World Cup, which will begin June 14, and then the World Cup in 2026, which will be shared with Canada and Mexico. Iran has already qualified for the tournament, while several countries facing travel bans are in contention to qualify. Additionally, Concacaf is hosting the Gold Cup this summer in the United States, with Haiti one of the competing teams. There are also players from Sudan, Venezuela and Iran due to compete in the Club World Cup.

The Athletic breaks down the instant questions that are raised by Trump's travel ban.

The good news for FIFA is that the executive order contains an exemption for “any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

This would appear to suggest, therefore, that Iran, whose qualification has already been assured for the World Cup in 2026, will be able to send a team and support staff to compete at the tournament. However, players will not be able to bring friends and family who are Iranian nationals beyond “immediate relatives.”

Trump's executive order describes Iran as a “state sponsor of terrorism,” adding that the state “regularly fails to cooperate with the United States Government in identifying security risks.”

Among the nations with full travel bans, Haiti is currently the best-placed team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, having won its first two games in the second round of Concacaf's qualification process to sit second in its five-team group. The top two from each of the six groups of five progress into the third round — where 12 teams remain — and three nations are guaranteed access to the World Cup with an additional two Concacaf teams to enter into the intercontinental playoffs.

In Africa, Libya has an outside chance of making the World Cup, currently placed third in a group of six after six matches. The four best runners-up from the 10 African groups will enter into a playoff tournament to stand a chance of qualifying for the World Cup. Both Haiti and Libya would be in the same position as Iran, should they qualify, whereby they are permitted to attend as teams — but there does not appear to be an exception for nationals of those teams who might wish to travel to the tournament to support their country during the competition.

Among the nations with partial travel bans, Venezuela is currently placed seventh in the South America qualification table, which would enter them into an intercontinental playoff. Cuba lies third in its five-team Concacaf group, with a game in hand on second-place Bermuda after two games played. Sierra Leone is also third in group play in the CAF qualification phase to remain in with a chance of qualification.

The Gold Cup begins June 14 and ends July 6, with all matches except one due to be played in the United States.

The only competing nation impacted by the travel ban is Haiti, an opponent of the USMNT in the group stage of the competition. Saudi Arabia and Trinidad and Tobago make up the four-team group.

The exemption listed by Trump's executive order refers to athletes and teams being allowed to “travel for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the Secretary of State.”

The Gold Cup is not specified and therefore it must be determined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The Athletic contacted both Concacaf and the Department of State to seek clarity on the matter and to ask whether Haiti will be granted entry with the White House later confirming, following publication, that both the Club World Cup and Gold Cup are considered major sporting events, meaning it appears they will be able to play.

Trump's executive order cited overstay percentages on visas by Haitian citizens within the U.S. and claimed “hundreds of thousands of illegal Haitian aliens flooded into the United States during the Biden Administration.” The order claimed that this “harms American communities by creating acute risks of increased overstay rates, establishment of criminal networks, and other national security threats.”

While exemptions appear to have been made for athletes, teams and immediate relatives, further-reaching exemptions for supporters do not appear to be present in the executive order. Exemptions are made for nationals of designated countries who are traveling on government business, NATO business or those who are lawful permanent residents of the United States, as well as those who are dual citizens and traveling with a passport from the non-designated country. There will also be entry granted to Iranians on immigrant visas owing to ethnic or religious persecution in their home country.

These exemptions aside, however, it appears that entry will be limited for nationals from those countries who face partial and full travel bans. Venezuela and Cuba, for example, have had temporary tourist visa access forbidden. It also appears that Haitians will be forbidden from entering the U.S. to support their team at the Gold Cup this summer or if they qualify for the World Cup next summer.

The 32 teams who will be competing in FIFA's revamped club competition this summer are not from any of the countries impacted by the travel ban.

There are, however, some players who are potentially at risk of being affected. The exemption in the executive order, as explained above, states that allowances will be made for athletes and immediate relatives coming for the World Cup or “other major sporting events,” as determined by the Secretary of State. The Club World Cup is not specified in the document. The White House confirmed to The Athletic following publication that both competitions are considered major sporting events with participants therefore appearing to be exempt from the ban. A State Department spokesperson did not directly respond when asked about the tournaments' status, saying only: “We are implementing the President's directive to secure U.S. borders and protect American communities and citizens.”

A quick browse of the squads offers up potential challenges. At the Abu Dhabi club Al-Ain, for example, is the Sudanese player Mohamed Awadalla, and his country has seen all visas blocked — meaning he may require an exemption — while Inter Milan Iranian forward Mehdi Taremi may also be in the same position.

The Venezuelan trio of Matías Lacava, Salomón Rondón and Jefferson Savarino — at Ulsan, Pachuca and Botafogo, respectively — may also require exemptions, even though the partial travel ban inflicted upon Venezuelan nationals does not extend to those seeking to come to the U.S. on the P-1 visa. This is used when an athlete seeks to come to the U.S. as part of a team at an internationally recognized level of performance. However, ordinarily this would only be used if they have contracts with teams in the United States. For example, MLS, NBA, MLB international players are either on a P1 or a green card. Those coming in for temporary competitions would ordinarily do so on B1 or B2 visa – a temporary visa for business or tourist purposes – both of which are now blocked for Venezuela. As such, these players will also be hoping that the Club World Cup is labelled as a major sporting event.

On Wednesday, as part of our report tracking FIFA's difficulties in filling stadiums for the Club World Cup, FIFA told The Athletic that supporters from more than 130 countries had acquired tickets for this summer's tournament. We have now approached FIFA to ask whether any nationals from countries impacted by the travel ban have acquired tickets for the tournament, as well as if any exemptions will be made to enable them to enter the country, or if these supporters can otherwise expect refunds.

Back in 2017, before the U.S. secured the World Cup a year later, FIFA President Gianni Infantino told reporters: “It's obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup.”

Additionally, as part of the United States' joint bid with Canada and Mexico to host the World Cup — dated May 2, 2018 — Trump wrote to Infantino and said he was confident that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.”

The Athletic has approached the White House for comment.

Earlier this year, Infantino said: “America will welcome the world. Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun and to celebrate the game will be able to do that.”

Infantino also claimed that the two FIFA tournaments over the next year would generate almost $50 billion in economic output for the U.S. The question, however, is whether repeated news cycles about a more stringent approach to entering the U.S. may dissuade global travelers from attending both the tournament this summer and next year's World Cup, leaving FIFA more reliant on a domestic audience and host cities at risk of falling short of their economic impact, as tourists are likelier to spend more money.

Speaking about the World Cup, Vice President J.D. Vance last month said during a meeting of the White House's World Cup task force: “Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games.

“But when the time is up, we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem,” he said, referring to Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security.

Indonesia can no longer qualify automatically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup from the ongoing third round of the Asian qualifiers.

Not after second-placed Australia established an unassailable buffer between them earlier in the evening with a stirring 1-0 win over Group C winners Japan.

Nonetheless, Indonesia's lofty dream of qualifying for the World Cup -- for the first time since 1938 when they were still known as the Dutch East Indies -- remains very much alive after a 1-0 victory over China on Thursday.

Continuing his red-hot form on the international stage, Ole Romeny converted from the penalty spot in the 45th minute -- his third goal in as many caps -- to secure a crucial three points for his side.

The result lifted the Indonesians to third on the table although Saudi Arabia can regain that spot in their game against Bahrain later in the evening.

Indonesia actually want that.

Because having now established a six-point lead over fifth-placed Bahrain, a Saudi Arabia victory -- or even a draw - would secure for Indonesia a top-four finish, along with progress to the next round of qualifiers.

The fourth round would then see them drawn alongside two other nations, where the group winners also secure tickets to the World Cup while the runners-up advance to yet another stage which eventually leads to an interconfederation playoff.

That will be something to worry about in October for the teams that do get there.

For now, there is still one more match day in the third round next Tuesday -- and there are not too many better positions that Indonesia could wish to be in.

Considering the uproar in some quarters that greeted a shock parting of ways with former coach Shin Tae-Yong in January, the fact that Indonesia have since notched two wins in three outings under his successor Patrick Kluivert has gone some way in vindicating the huge call made by PSSI, the country's football governing body.

Kluivert's first game at the helm coincided with the international bow of Dutch-born Romeny, who qualifies to represent the Southeast Asian national through his maternal grandmother.

It was a night to forget as the Indonesians were comprehensively beaten 5-1 by Australia, but Romeny did provide the Timnas faithful something to smile about with a debut goal.

Despite their remarkable rise over the past couple of years, if there was an area of Indonesia that was particularly glaring, it was probably the lack of a formidable threat leading the line.

For all his admirable endeavour, Rafael Struick only has one goal in 26 caps while others such as Ramadhan Sananta and Hokky Caraka remain prospects for the future.

Even goal threats like Marselino Ferdinan, Ragnar Oratmangoen or Egy Maulana deal the most damage from withdrawn or wider positions.

Three games do not warrant a definitive verdict but the signs suggest that Romeny could be the answer.

Having netted the only goal of the game to seal victory over Bahrain back in March, which crucially got Indonesia's campaign back on track, Romeny repeated the trick against China to now bring his team to the precipice of progress to the next round of qualifiers.

He clearly has an eye for goal but it is not his only strength.

Again, against the Chinese, Romeny was ever-mobile and constantly looked to move out wide or drop deep to provide a link-up option, displaying a savviness in finding pockets of space.

The 24-year-old was also unafraid to pull the trigger whenever a half-chance presented itself, and might even have added to his tally on another night.

He was far from Indonesia's only hero on Thursday.

Captain Jay Idzes was once again an authoritative figure in the heart of defence, aided resolutely by Calvin Verdonk and Rizky Ridho.

Ricky Kambuaya and Yakob Sayuri, part of a surprisingly-noticeable Indonesian born-and-bred presence in the starting XI given the ever-increasing number of naturalised heritage imports in the ranks, were industrious both when defending and attacking.

Making his long-awaited debut having flirted with the idea of switching his allegiance to Indonesia for several years now, Emil Audero overcame a few early nerves to be a reliable presence in goal -- suggesting there could be an intriguing duel once the incumbent Maarten Paes returns from suspension.

Even Egy, who was once the next great hope for Indonesian football but has not managed to reach his full potential, produced a lively showing.

Romeny may be the new darling grabbing the headlines for now, but he is far from the only one making a valuable contribution to the cause.

Indonesia are certainly going to need as many if, or rather when, they get to the next stage of their World Cup dream.

Franco Mastantuono is edging closer to becoming a Real Madrid player, but fans hoping to see him in Spain this summer will need to wait a bit longer. According to a new report from Marca, Real Madrid have all but secured an agreement with the 16-year-old Argentine prodigy — but his transfer won't be finalized until after River Plate's participation in the FIFA Club World Cup.

The player, along with his representatives and River Plate, has requested that he remain with the Buenos Aires club through the end of the tournament. It's a scenario that suits all parties: Mastantuono gets a major opportunity to shine on a global stage with his boyhood club, while Real Madrid secure one of the most exciting young talents in world football.

Negotiations between Real Madrid and River Plate are ongoing, and Juni Calafat — the club's chief scout and key figure behind recent South American signings — personally traveled to Buenos Aires to move talks forward. Reports in Spain say the framework of an agreement is now clear: Madrid are ready to pay Mastantuono's €45 million release clause, likely in six structured instalments, as River have been unwilling to lower their valuation.

While the paperwork isn't signed just yet, Mastantuono's move to Madrid is described as a matter of “when,” not “if.” The player's agent and Calafat are expected to fly to Spain next to finalize the final terms.

Importantly, according to SER, Mastantuono has already spoken directly with Real Madrid representatives — including manager-in-waiting Xabi Alonso — and is reportedly enthusiastic about the role he'll play in the team's long-term project. Barring any surprises, Mastantuono is expected to join up with Madrid in late July, after the Club World Cup concludes.

This development also explains why Paris Saint-Germain, who had been monitoring the situation, backed out of the race after refusing to match the €45 million clause.

HOUSTON (June 5, 2025) – Houston Dynamo FC midfielder Jack McGlynn has been confirmed as a member of the U.S. Men's National Team's (USMNT) 26-man roster for two upcoming friendlies and the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

The USMNT will host two friendlies in early June in preparation for the Gold Cup:

In Gold Cup action, the USMNT will compete in Group D of the tournament. Below is the team's group play schedule:

McGlynn returns to the national team after most recently earning a roster spot for the 2024-25 Concacaf Nations League Finals, making an appearance in the Semifinals versus Panama on March 20.

The 21-year-old midfielder has earned 29 caps for the U.S. across the U-20, U-23 and senior levels. McGlynn made his first start for the senior USMNT on Jan. 18, 2025, when the midfielder recorded his debut goal and assist in a 3-1 victory over Venezuela. His standout January camp under head coach Mauricio Pochettino also featured 45 minutes of action versus Costa Rica, while his senior debut came in January 2024 in a friendly versus Slovenia.

The midfielder also made his mark in Paris with the U.S. Men's Olympic Soccer Team where he featured in all four matches as they advanced to the Quarterfinals. McGlynn registered an assist in the Group A finale against Guinea.

McGlynn joined the Dynamo from the Philadelphia Union in a historic cash-for-player trade ahead of the 2025 season, as Houston sent $2.1 million in exchange for the midfielder, marking the first cash-for-player trade for a Homegrown player in MLS history.

McGlynn has made an immediate impact on the Dynamo roster this year, already scoring three goals and recording five assists across all competitions. He opened his goal tally in a 1-0 victory over LAFC on April 5, then added two more stunning goals, one in the U.S. Open Cup Round of 32 match versus Phoenix Rising FC and the other in the most recent Texas Derby against FC Dallas. Notably, McGlynn ranks third in MLS with 47 key passes and is second in the team with five assists.

Charlotte FC are one of four MLS clubs to have two players called into the Gold Cup roster

CHARLOTTE, NC (Thursday, June 5, 2025) – Charlotte FC forward Patrick Agyemang and defender Tim Ream made the final 26-player U.S. Men's National Team roster for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. Agyemang and Ream will be available for both international friendlies on June 7 (Turkey) and June 10 (Switzerland), alongside the Gold Cup Group Stage matches (June 15-22).

The USMNT opens Group D play on June 15 when they take on Trinidad and Tobago at PayPal Park in San Jose, Calif. (6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT). Four days later, the U.S. faces Saudi Arabia at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas (9:15 p.m. ET/8:15 p.m. CT) and concludes the group stage against Haiti at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas (7 p.m. ET/6 p.m. CT).

Nearly one year before the start of the World Cup on home soil, the USA will first host Turkey on June 7 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn. Kickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. ET, with the match broadcast live on TNT, truTV, and Telemundo Deportes and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field will hold a special place in the heart of Patrick Agyemang. Not only did he attend his first USMNT game there in 2010 at the age of nine, it's also in his hometown of East Hartford, Conn. Born to parents who emigrated from Ghana, he climbed nearly every rung on the soccer ladder, starting in the Division III college program at Eastern Connecticut State to Division I, MLS NEXT Pro, and finally at Charlotte FC in MLS, all before landing his first USMNT callup in January of this year. He's made the most of the opportunity, already collecting three goals in four matches.

Three days later, USA-Switzerland, presented by Coca-Cola, will serve as the Send Off match ahead of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup. GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn., hosts on June 10, with the match kicking off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local) and will be available on TNT, truTV, Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Agyemang had a strong showing in his first national team camp and competition to kick off 2025. The East Hartford, Connecticut, native began his national team tenure with goals in back-to-back January Camp games against Venezuela and Costa Rica. He was then called back for the Concacaf Nations League Finals and scored the lone USMNT goal in the third-place match against Canada. For Charlotte this season, Agyemang has tallied eight goals and two assists across all competitions, three in MLS play and two in U.S. Open Cup competition.

Ream enters the Gold Cup as the USMNT's most capped player, having amassed a total of 68 caps, including appearances in the 2022 FIFA World Cup and helping the team take home the 2023-24 Gold Cup. The St. Louis native most recently featured with the USMNT during Concacaf Nations League Final match against Panama in March, where Ream served as captain. He has captained the last six USMNT matches he has started.

This year's edition of the Gold Cup represents the USA's final participation in an official competition ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Alongside Canada and Mexico, the three host countries for the World Cup receive automatic entries. The USMNT will seek its eighth confederation championship trophy, having won the inaugural tournament in 1991 before being crowned regional champion again in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2021.

The 18th edition of the Concacaf Gold Cup is set to take place this summer across 14 stadiums in 11 metropolitan areas in the United States and Canada. The tournament will feature 16 men's national teams, including 15 from Concacaf and Saudi Arabia (guest nation). The final will be held on July 6 at NRG Stadium in Houston, marking the first time the Gold Cup Final will be played in the state of Texas.

Tar Heels appear to remain a part of the US national team for years to come.

With the amount of success the North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer team has had over its history, that's led to plenty of Heels also having success in the sport. The history of the US women's national soccer team is deeply intertwined with UNC, as many greats, from Mia Hamm to recent stars like Crystal Dunn, have come from Carolina. Pretty much every USWNT roster features at least Heel.

With UNC still regular contenders for the NCAA Tournament championship and current reigning champions, that's likely to stay the case in the future. On Tuesday night, we saw some of new Tar Heel faces lead the way for the USWNT.

Over the last week or so, the US national team played in some friendly matches, which included a 4-0 win over Jamaica on Tuesday night. In the roster for those matches was five former Tar Heels, most of which are very much in the newest generation of national teamers.

Apart from the 32-yeard old Dunn, the oldest of the UNC alumns in this past USWNT roster was Emily Fox at just 26. Fox has plenty of experience at the international level already, now up to 67 appearances for the USWNT since debuting in 2018. The other three Tar Heels who were in the roster for the recent friendlies were goalkeeper Claudia Dickey (25), defender Avery Patterson (22), and forward Ally Sentnor (21). Beyond them, 20-year old former Heel Savy King has also been part of US training camps in recent month, although she may not be appearing a game of any kind for a while after a very scary recent health incident.

Beyond just being part of coach Emma Hayes' recent rosters, some of the Tar Heels have also made impressive showings. Just the other night in the aforementioned game against Jamaica, Sentnor got the start for the USWNT and more than made the most of it. The 21-year old, who was the first pick of the 2024 NWSL Draft, scored goals in the 19th and 29th minutes. Fox provided the assist for the first goal, while Patterson assisted on a Lynn Biyendolo goal that was the final on in the US's 4-0 win over Jamaica.

There's no major international tournament until the next Women's World Cup in 2027, and no true tournaments of consequence until they play in the CONCACAF W Championship next November. (That tournament will decide who qualifies for said World Cup and also the next Olympic tournaments.) Rest assured that when those tournaments happen, there's a very good chance there will be Tar Heels playing crucial roles in them.

ASPACH, Germany – The U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team defeated Germany 2-1 in the first of two matches between the teams. Lilly Reale scored in the first half, and Evelyn Shores tallied in second-half stoppage time.

The match marked the first international game for the U.S. U-23s since Feb. 20, 2023, a span of two years, three months and 11 days, as USWNT head coach Emma Hayes looks to kickstart the U-23 program as an important part of the player pool for the full U.S. Women's National Team. For the first time in USWNT history, the U.S. U-23s started a game featuring 11 professional players.

The U.S. roster for this trip featured 15 players under 23 years of age, and, per an agreement with Germany, this is standard for Women's U-23 internationals in Europe. Each squad had five “overage players,” none of whom were born before January 1, 1999.

The young Americans had most of the play in the match and opened the scoring off a corner kick just before halftime. Jadeyn Shaw, owner of 26 senior team caps, crossed on the ground from the left side. Chelsea FC forward Mia Fishel, who has three senior team caps of her own, dummied the ball, and it skidded through to outside back Lilly Reale, who knocked the ball off a German defender and in from close range. It was Reale's first goal at the U-23 international level. She has one goal this season for Gotham FC in the NWSL.

The USA looked to be cruising to a win, but the Germans – who featured San Diego Wave attacker Gia Corley in its starting lineup – equalized in the 86th minute as Mara Alber latched onto a cross from the right wing that flew through the U.S. goal mouth and smashed home her shot from a very tight angle on the left side of the penalty area.

With the match seemingly headed for a draw, five minutes of stoppage time were added, and the USA won it with 29 seconds left on the clock.

The USA attacked down the right wing via Portland Thorns winger Caiya Hanks, but Germany was able to poke the ball free. Seattle Reign forward Maddie Dahlien did well to dig the ball out and win it in the right side of the penalty area. She whirled toward goal, avoided a few defenders with a nice dribble and was able to poke the ball back to Seattle Reign center back Jordyn Bugg, who floated a perfect cross to the far post. Midfielder Evelyn Shores ran under the ball and struck a spectacular full volley that soared between the near post and the German goalkeeper to give the USA the win.

Shores is the only college player on the roster, along with 19 professionals. She won an NCAA title last year at North Carolina and now has netted her first goal at the U-23 international level.

Fifa declined to comment on recently signed ban

Unclear whether exception includes Club World Cup

Donald Trump's newly signed travel ban contains an exemption that could apply to players, staff or associated families with clubs participating in the 2025 Club World Cup, the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Olympics.

The US president has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term.

The nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen will be “fully” restricted from entering the US, according to the proclamation. Meanwhile, the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela will be partly restricted.

There is an exemption, however, outlined in section 4 of the order, which states that “any ­athlete or member of an athletic team, ­including coaches, persons ­performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, travelling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state” are not subject to the ban.

A Fifa spokesperson declined to comment when asked if the governing body had lobbied for the exception's placement. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has gone out of his way to appear publicly with Trump in recent months, taking a seat next to the president at the first public meeting of his World Cup taskforce and arriving late to the Fifa Congress in order to meet with Trump during his tour of the Middle East.

It is also not clear whether the “World Cup” mentioned in the exemption applies to both the 2026 World Cup involving international teams and the 2025 Club World Cup, which will feature many of the world's top club teams in venues across the US this year.

Also unclear is whether the ban will force US-based players who play internationally for countries subject to the ban to return from the current Fifa international window early. Venezuela, for example, have three players on its squad who play in Major League Soccer. They are scheduled to play two World Cup qualifiers: one against Bolivia on Friday night and another against Uruguay on Tuesday. Trump's travel ban is set to come into action on Monday 9 June.

Teams that have qualified for the Club World Cup employ 10 players from countries named in the travel ban. They are: Inter Miami's Telasco Segovia (Venezuela), Botafogo's ­Jefferson Savarino (Venezuela), ­Espérance de Tunis's Roger Aholou (Togo), LAFC's David Martínez ­(Venezuela), Internazionale's Mehdi Taremi (Iran), Ulsan's Matías Lacava (Venezuela), Al-Ain's Kodjo Fo-Doh Laba (Togo), Josna Loulendo (Republic of Congo) and Mohamed Awadalla (Sudan), as well as Pachuca's Salomón Rondón (Venezuela).

Only one country on the travel ban list, Iran, has already qualified for the 2026 World Cup. Venezuela are ­seventh in South American qualifying, five points behind Colombia for an automatic World Cup place but still in the picture to qualify via an inter-confederation playoff. ­Equatorial Guinea and Libya are mathematically still alive in African qualifying but unlikely to progress to the next round. Sudan are third in their World Cup qualifying group, just one point from automatic qualification. Haiti look good to reach the next round of Concacaf World Cup qualification.

Jack Grealish has bit back at critics on social media and defended his recent record after being left out of Manchester City's Club World Cup squad.

The latest stub will allow the 29-year-old and his representatives to instead be focused on finding him a move away from the Etihad Stadium, as he seeks to force himself into England's World Cup plans.

Grealish started only seven times in what was a poor season for City by their own standards. While he has two years remaining on his £300,000-a-week contract, a repeat would do neither City nor the player any favours.

Following reports of the omission, accounts on social media were keen to voice their opinion on the former Aston Villa star's situation - with messages of support as well criticism directed his way. 

Interestingly, Grealish took the opportunity to put his feelings on the record amid continued speculation over his future. 

Responding to a post from talkSPORT which claimed that Villa favourite Gabby Agbonlahor is 'not happy' with Guardiola for unfairly treating Grealish, the winger wrote: 'What u want me to do score a [hat-trick] in 20 [minutes]?'

He also waded into a discussion between two users discussing his form for City this term. 

'Dude, Jack has been bad lately and I'm not surprised Pep did that,' wrote one user on X. Another replied: 'Lately? Lol, been too long to be called lately. Let these people talk s***.' 

The England international chimed in with a defense of his recent displays, adding: 'Haha, I've been bad lately? Score 3 goals in my last 3 appearances over 45 mins but okie dokie love x'. 

Clubs in England and Europe are expected to be interested in the playmaker, although the fact that many are grappling with profit and sustainability issues may point to the likelihood of a loan deal, rather than a permanent move for a man who cost City £100m when he signed from Aston Villa for a British record fee in 2021.

After Grealish was left out of City's final Premier League fixture at Fulham, Guardiola said that officials would work with Grealish and his representatives to find a solution that suited both sides.

Chelsea have given Cole Palmer the No.10 shirt, previously worn by Mykhailo Mudryk, for the Club World Cup this summer.

Palmer has worn the No.20 shirt for Chelsea ever since his £42.5 million move from Manchester City two years ago.

Mudryk, meanwhile, was handed Chelsea's No.10 shirt when he joined Stamford Bridge in a £88.5m deal from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2023.

But with Mudryk provisionally suspended after failing a doping test in October, Chelsea have stripped the Ukraine international of his No.10 jersey and have handed it to Palmer ahead of their Club World Cup campaign.

A statement from Chelsea on Thursday read: ‘Chelsea can confirm Cole Palmer will move to the No.10 shirt ahead of our 2025/26 campaign, starting from the FIFA Club World Cup.

‘Palmer, who has worn the No.20 shirt since signing from Manchester City in September 2023, will make the switch ahead of our participation in the US-based tournament and could wear 10 for the first time when the Blues face Los Angeles FC in Atlanta on June 16.'

Chelsea's Club World Cup tournament begins against Los Angeles FC on June 16.

Enzo Maresca's side will then play Flamengo on June 20 before finishing their Group D campaign against ES Tunis on June 20.

Chelsea have also confirmed that Liam Delap will be given the No.9 shirt.

The 22-year-old, who scored 12 goals in the Premier League this season, has joined from Ipswich Town after Chelsea triggered his £30m relegation release clause.

Delap is also eligible to play for Chelsea at the Club World Cup this month.

You could argue the United States isn't exactly the most welcoming country for visitors at the moment.

There's been a surge of border crackdowns, new visa restrictions and an overall sense of fear over being detained amid multiple reports of foreigners being locked up for weeks in the five months since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.

Yet, one of the biggest, most highly anticipated and attended sports events is coming to the U.S. next year: the 2026 FIFA World Cup, soccer's premier international competition.

The U.S. will co-host next year's World Cup with Mexico and Canada. Of the 16 host cities, 11 are on American soil. It's been estimated that, across the three countries, 6.5 million people will attend the tournament. 

FIFA president Gianni Infantino, an ally of Trump, has promised that international fans will be welcome at the World Cup. But Trump's immigration stance has raised questions about potential challenges for the numerous international fans expected to travel to the U.S.

Human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch have raised "grave concerns" about the matches being held in the U.S. And at the same time that excitement has started to build for the tournament — and Toronto and Vancouver have started preparing for a deluge of soccer fans — there have been calls to boycott the U.S. as a host.

The current political climate in the U.S., if it continues, could be a considerable deterrent, especially for fans from countries that are at odds with America, according to Vijay Setlur, an expert in sport marketing and sport business in the Schulich School of Business at York University.

"I could see fans potentially staying away out of a fear of being detained. Even though they're there to watch soccer, they could be accused of espionage or something like that," Setlur told CBC News.

"It could be a big problem."

Iran for instance, was one of the first teams to qualify for the World Cup, but the two countries are engaged in a decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday night, Trump signed an order that would ban people from a dozen countries, including Iran, from entering the United States. It's set to go into effect on Monday.

The ban makes exceptions for athletes, coaches and immediate relatives travelling for the World Cup, but doesn't mention fans.

Given that the U.S. also is preparing to welcome the world for FIFA's Club World Cup later this month, golf's Ryder Cup in September and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, the question becomes: will the world want to come, or will they even be able to?

Last month, Human Rights Watch wrote an open letter to FIFA's president, citing "grave concerns" about the impacts of the U.S.'s immigration policies on the 2026 World Cup.

"Immediate action is needed to address policies that directly contradict FIFA's stated values of human rights, inclusion and global participation," the advocacy group wrote in the May 5 letter.

"The 2026 World Cup was intended to raise the bar ... these commitments are now at serious risk."

The U.S. policies cited by the advocacy group include: reported travel restrictions and bans; visa practices that require applicants to disclose their sex assigned at birth and only recognize binary sex categories; the detainment of international students; the deportation of third-country nationals; and the blocking of refugees.

Amnesty International, an international human rights NGO, has also voiced concerns for the players and fans travelling to the U.S. 

In a statement to CBC News, Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International's head of business and human rights, cited Trump's mass deportation program and "arbitrary arrests and detentions." He also noted that routine border crosses "have turned into harassment," especially for 2SLGBTQ+ people, religious minorities and people of colour.

"It's hard to know who the Trump administration will target next," Cockburn said.

"With no sign of the Trump administration's cruel treatment of immigrants and crackdown on freedom of expression slowing down, travellers may unfortunately find their human rights under threat while in the U.S."

Human Rights Watch also noted that when FIFA awarded the bid to the U.S., Canada and Mexico, the decision was celebrated as one that would unite positive change. At the time, in 2018, rifts created by tariffs and a proposed border wall were glossed over because of the neighbours' longstanding political and economic alliances.

"The unity of the three nations" was the overriding theme articulated by Carlos Cordeiro, then-president of the U.S. Soccer Federation. 

And it was a smart decision at the time, said Setlur, not only for FIFA to grow its revenue, but because it was also an opportunity to elevate the sport of soccer in North America's very crowded sports market. 

And now, with Trump inciting trade wars with the U.S.'s neighbours and around the globe, combined with his aggressive immigration enforcement campaign?

"At this point, would FIFA from a logistical standpoint wish this World Cup was in Europe? Probably," Setlur said.

"But at this point they can't change it and they just have to hope they can lobby the U.S. government enough."

Canada wins bid to co-host FIFA World Cup in 2026

Regardless of where it's held, the month-long World Cup is often considered the biggest sporting event in terms of its magnitude and global appeal. FIFA says 1.5 billion people tuned into the 2022 final match between Argentina and France live on television (the 2025 Super Bowl, by comparison, netted about 127. 7 million viewers).

Alan Rothenberg, who ran the 1994 World Cup and oversaw the bid to host the 1999 Women's World Cup as then-president of U.S. Soccer, previously told The Associated Press that he thinks fans will still come to the FIFA World Cup.

Pointing to concerns about the last two World Cups, in Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, he noted those tournaments still attracted more than three million attendees apiece.

"A lot of this is government-to-government," Rothenberg said. "A passionate soccer fan is not going to be held up by that."

And as travel groups have raised concerns that wait times mean fans from some of the 48 nations set to compete will not be able to secure a U.S. visa before the FIFA tournament, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the administration is considering putting consular officers on double shifts and employing artificial intelligence to help manage the processing.

Meanwhile, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has warned that visitors must "go home" after attending matches.

"Otherwise, they'll have to talk to Secretary Noem," he said with a laugh as Trump smiled beside him, referring to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, while speaking to media during the first World Cup task force meeting in early May.

Setlur says he agrees die-hard fans will likely still come to the tournament despite the risks. But between the political deterrents and the economic cost of attending the match — not just ticket prices, but flying to North America and between the multiple host cities — he says he wonders if FIFA will be able to fill the stadium seats.

"In the U.S., soccer is growing, but it's not the No. 1 sport ... they're going to have to rely quite a bit on visitors."

A stunning smash-and-grab 1-0 victory over Japan has put the Socceroos on the brink of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup after Aziz Behich's stoppage-time winner.

Having been dominated by Japan for the full 90 minutes, a moment of magic from Riley McGree and a phenomenal finish by Behich earned the Socceroos a stunning backs-against-the-wall victory.

McGree turned on the edge of the area before racing to the by-line, cutting back towards Behich to finish with his right foot and score his first Socceroos goal in 13 years and earn Australia's first win over Japan in 16.

"It hasn't quite sunk in just yet," Behich said.

"But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling.

"It was a tough game. We knew we had to grind it out. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we will get our opportunity if we get to it.'

"Fortunately enough it fell to me and my right foot.

"It has been a long campaign and we have worked so hard … the group we have in this change room and the boys that come in every camp, the mentality is second to none.

For so long it seemed the very best the Socceroos could be able to hope for was to escape from Perth with a draw after a turgid display.

Japan were utterly dominant, displaying an ease of possession that made a mockery of their second-string personnel and had their hosts chasing shadows throughout.

Yet for all their possession, 69 per cent of it at full time, there was very little in the way of clear cut chances created — and the Socceroos made them pay for that profligacy.

Daniel Arzani, a 80th-minute substitute, created the spark to help the Socceroos advance down field and, tellingly, keep possession there without the swarming Japanese defence clearing their lines.

ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.

He fashioned a ball towards McGree, whose stunning turn prised open the firmly locked Japanese defence.

His cut back missed the first wave of Socceroos strikers, but Behich was alert to the lose ball and curled a delightful effort past Kōsei Tani into the far corner.

Credit must be given to Tony Popovic for his changes, all of whom made an impact after a dire first half showing.

The Socceroos were more lively in the second half but still second best, right up until Behich's stunner.

Given the Socceroos far superior goal difference, only a catastrophic defeat against Saudi Arabia — who must also beat Bahrain later on Friday morning — in Jeddah on Wednesday morning (AEST) will deny Tony Popovic's side a spot in North America.

Look back on how all the action unfolded in our live blog.

By Simon Smale

Don't forget to join us on Wednesday morning over your breakfast cereal for the still important but nowhere near as important as before clash against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday morning, we'll be blogging that one too for you from 4:15am AEST.

But for now, let's leave you with the image of happy Socceroos - because is there anything better?

Good night, and thanks for being with me.

By Simon Smale

Here's Tony Popovic.

"Look, we stayed in the game," he says.

"It was a great goal at the end, we're getting our left wing 
back coming in, 90th minute to finish off a chance.

"It just shows the belief that the group has. And I believe there's more to come from them."

Popovic says that Australia seemed second to the ball in the first half and paid credit to his subs.

"Nothing against the boys that came off, we just seemed second to the ball," he says.

"We didn't win our challenges and the duels. We 
tried to get more strength in there. Bit more spark and energy.

"Then Daniel came on. All the players that came on made an impact. So we're very happy with the win."

He says Australia still want to finish with a win.

"Beating Japan, doing it at home and the last minute, you couldn't have scripted it any better," he says.

"We still have got a game to go. The emotions are high. 
We're very proud at the moment. And everyone in here and I'm sure every Australian that has seen this game is a proud Australian tonight. We don't want to deny anyone of that joy.

"We still have a job to do in Saudi Arabia and we want to finish well."

Here's Alessandro Circati, who grew up in Perth and is letting the tears flow, playing his first match for the Socceroos since an ACL injury.

"I don't have many words. I'm just very happy. It is a bit emotional as well," he says.

"Obviously growing up here for so long, after an injury that I had, 
coming back here and playing and, we are not exactly qualified but ... It is like a dream come true. Just so, so happy. I couldn't be any happier."

He says he's emotional because the impact of the injury.

"It's been probably seven very hard months, when vu an injury like this. It's a bit of an unknown. You don't know how you return back. Some 
people feel amazing. Luckily I do. I feel better than before. Some people come back, you know, not the same. As I said, I'm just so happy."

Here's the man of the hour, Aziz Behich.

"It  hasn't quite sunk in just yet," he says.

"But when that final whistle went, it is a great feeling.

"It was a  tough game. We knew we had to grind it out. The boss said at half-time, 'No matter how tough it gets, we  will get our opportunity if we get to it.'

"Fortunately enough it fell to me and my right foot, in the  A-League and managed to see the back of the net again.

"It has been a long  campaign and we have worked so hard over this campaign. We've had a  change of coach, never easy, the  group we have in this changeroom and the boys that come in every camp,  the mentality is second to none.

"I think we more than deserve of going to a World Cup again."

Behich says that the rope a dope tactic was definitely not planned, but the result is all important.

"We wanted to take the game to them. Japan is a quality side, that's for sure.  Obviously we've had better games,  but that's football,"  he says.

"They always say the ones where you have to grind and fight with your teammates, scrap,  and then you get the win in the end, those are the ones you remember.

" Look, we will enjoy this night. What a beautiful crowd. 60,000 here on  home soil and we get to win against an opponent we haven't beaten in a while."

By Simon Smale

Riley McGree is speaking on Channel 10.

"I  honestly thought the cutback was too far back and no-one was going to get on it," he says.

"No-one was defending on  the other end, but he ended up  getting on it and I look up and it hits the net. Unbelievable."

He says that he's getting goosebumps getting asked about the goal, even though it was only scored 10 minutes ago.

He also says that the Socceroos deserved to win...

"Japan is a quality side and at stages we had to weather the storm and with  the quality we have, it will only  take one opportunity and we were  fortunate to get that opportunity  and the way we took it, we deserved to win."

I'm not sure I'd go that far, Riley, but the Socceroos took the one clear opportunity that they had and that was the difference and the only difference that mattered.

Unbelievable.....Aziz Behich!!!! In she goes!!!!!

- stumcin

Thanks Simon - from where I'm sitting it sounds like we've won....

- Mike

Holy cow! I didn't expect that. We finally beat Japan!! Thank you, Behich!!!!!!

- M

We will take that AZIZ!

- Chris

I'm crying!

- chris

By Simon Smale

Cos we got plenty.

By Simon Smale

Unbelievable. Japan sharper all night, created so many chances, dominated possession. To their credit, Socceroos were combative to the end. Substitutes Geria, Arzani, McGree combining for the goal. And what a finish Aziz Behich 

- j

Popovic got his subs right, that's for sure.

By Simon Smale

Now, even if Saudi Arabia wins against Bahrain in the early hours of the morning, they will need to mount a monumental assault on their goal difference to have any chance of pipping the Socceroos to second spot on the ladder.

It means the match in Jeddah is important, but only a monumental catastrophe there would mean Saudi Arabia could overhaul them.

By Simon Smale

Absolutely stunning!

The Socceroos have one foot and four toes in the FIFA World Cup finals after the latest of smash and grab wins against Japan in Perth!

Aziz Behich told 10 Sport before the match that he'd had a good five days after winning the A-League grand final with Melbourne City - how about now?!

Japan absolutely battered Australia in that match but lacked the end product and it cost them dear.

It's their first World Cup qualifier defeat in their last 20 matches and could yet see Australia make the finals.

By Simon Smale

What just happened!!!!! How good 

- Josh

By Simon Smale

That's a nasty head clash right on the edge of the Socceroos penalty area and he's down and will need treatment.

By Simon Smale

smash and grab that! 

- Cat

By Simon Smale

ASTONISHING!

AZIZ BEHICH SCORES WHAT MUST BE THE WINNER!

A rare lapse from Japan's defence, a rare passage of more than five passes without an error by the Socceroos and it nets them the winner that could send them to the World Cup!

Riley McGree performed a lovely turn on the edge of the penalty area, cuts the ball back and then Behich was there to pounce on the loose ball and curl the ball home.

Astonishing.

It's his first Socceroos goal in 13 years, and could give the Socceroos their first win over Japan in 16 years, to get Australia to the World Cup next year.

Suzuki swings a ball in from the right side, but despite a charge of Japanese runners, none can get a touch at the back post and Australia can sigh their relief.

By Simon Smale

The Socceroos just can't get hold of the ball at the moment, the Samurai Blue are shifting from left to right to left and back again with such ease it looks like the Socceroos are florescently-clad training models.

It's just so easy for them.

By Simon Smale

Hopefully we can hold on for a draw and a point but frankly a win would be a travesty. 

- Richard 

In Japan earlier in the qualification tournament Australia managed a 1-1 draw without having a shot on goal, so there's always hope...

By Simon Smale

Lovely move down the left side by Japan, Yuito Suzuki on the end of the cut-back cross but his first-time effort flies well over the bar.

Chelsea have confirmed what number Liam Delap has selected to wear after he completed his transfer to Stamford Bridge.

Delap, 22, has joined Chelsea on a six-year contract until June 2031 after his £30m release clause was triggered by Enzo Maresca's side.

The England Under-21 international bolsters the Chelsea attack for the 2025/26 season, which will see him compete with Nicolas Jackson for a starting role, with Christopher Nkunku expected to depart on a permanent basis.

After scoring 12 goals in the Premier League last season, Delap caught the eye of several clubs, but it was Chelsea who won the race, with their qualification for next season's Champions League playing a key part in convincing the former Manchester City youth player to move to the English capital.

Delap is set to play in Chelsea colours for the first time later this month when Chelsea feature in the Club World Cup in the United States.

Following his arrival, his shirt number has been confirmed. He will wear the no.9 at Stamford Bridge.

Delap follows the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Fernando Torres, Tammy Abraham, Gonzalo Higuain and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to wear the no.9 shirt for Chelsea.

The new Chelsea arrival is eager to rekindle his relationship with Cole Palmer, who he played with at youth level for Manchester City.

"Cole is incredible in everything he does," Delap told Chelsea's in-house media team. "I can't wait to be in front of him again and receive his passes!"

He added: "I spent a lot of time with them both (Palmer and Romeo Lavia) at City. We grew up and played some incredible football together. I spoke to them about joining and I am excited to play alongside them again."

The second grand slam of the year is ongoing at Roland-Garros this week. The 2025 French Open has reached the semifinals. The defending champions, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek have both made it through so far — though notably neither player occupies the top-seeded spot in their respective singles tournaments. Jannik Sinner is the No. 1 seed in the men's tournament, Aryna Sabalenka is the No. 1 seed in the women's. American tennis star Coco Gauff is the No. 2 seed on the women's side. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max.

Are you ready to watch the French Open? Here's how to follow all the action down on the clay courts at Roland-Garros.

Dates: May 25 - June 8

Time: Play starts daily at 5 a.m. ET

Location: Stade Roland-Garros

TV channel: TNT, truTV

Streaming: HBO Max

The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8.

Thanks to the time difference between the U.S. and France, the tennis tournament at Roland-Garros will start daily play at 5 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT.

In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max).

Disney

The Disney+, Hulu, Max bundle gets you exactly what it sounds like: access to Disney+, Hulu and Max. If you go ad-free ($29.99/month) you'll save up to 38% off compared to individually paying for all three services — and gain access to all French Open coverage. 

If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus.

 

While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. 

Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. 

If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV.

Don't live in either of those places? Don't worry, you can still stream like you do with the help of a VPN. A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user.

 

ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. 

ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription. Plus, the service offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, in case you're nervous about trying a VPN.

Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka snapped Iga Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros with a hard-fought victory in Thursday's semifinals. Sabalenka collected her 40th WTA main-draw of the year and now advances to her first clay-court Grand Slam final.

Aryna Sabalenka has ended Iga Swiatek's reign at Roland Garros.

World No. 1 Sabalenka defeated No. 5 seed Swiatek 7-6(1), 4-6, 6-0 in their French Open semifinal showdown on Thursday. Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and two-time runner-up, is now into her first Grand Slam final off of hard court.

"I'm super happy with the win today and beating Iga at Roland Garros," Sabalenka said, after her win. "It's just something unbelievable and something I'm super proud of, and yeah, just happy to get through this difficult match."

Roland Garros: Draws | Scores

Sabalenka took 2 hours and 19 minutes to snap four-time champion Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at the event. Swiatek picked up her first title here in 2020, then won three in a row from 2022 to last year. Swiatek's Roland Garros win-loss record now sits at 40-3.

But Sabalenka is definitively on top of the tour at this point, at WTA events as well as Grand Slams. Her victory over Swiatek was her tour-leading 40th main-draw win of this season, and she has won her last five Grand Slam semifinal matches.

Title hopes extended: After defeating this decade's dominant force at Roland Garros, Sabalenka's quest will continue for one more match. She will face Coco Gauff of the United States in a No. 1 vs. No. 2 final on Saturday.

Sabalenka and Gauff have a totally deadlocked head-to-head. They are 5-5 overall and 1-1 at Grand Slam events.

"[The semifinal] was a big match, and it felt like a final, but I know that the job is not done yet," Sabalenka said. "I have to go out there on Saturday, and I have to fight and I have to bring my best tennis, and I have to work for that title, especially if it's going to be Coco."

Fast facts: This was only the second Grand Slam meeting between Sabalenka and Swiatek. Poland's Swiatek pulled off a three-set win over Sabalenka in the 2022 US Open semifinals, en route to her one Grand Slam title off of clay.

Swiatek came into the match with a 5-1 head-to-head lead over Sabalenka on the Pole's beloved clay courts, but this was the first year since 2020 that Swiatek came into Roland Garros without having won a clay-court title.

It was a different story for Sabalenka, who had already won three titles (including a third Madrid title on clay) and reached three other finals this year entering Paris. Now, she has reached six Grand Slam finals during the 2020s -- one more than Swiatek.

"It's going to mean everything to me and my team, because I have to say that almost like the whole life I've been told where [clay] is not my thing and then I didn't have any confidence.

"And in the past I don't know how many years, we've been able to develop my game so much, so I feel really comfortable on this surface and actually enjoy playing on clay. If I'll be able to get this trophy, it's just going to mean the world for us."

Sabalenka is now the first woman to reach the singles final in three consecutive Grand Slam events (2024 US Open, 2025 Australian Open and French Open) since Serena Williams (Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon, all in 2016).

Match moments: The clash took place beneath a closed roof on a wet day in Paris, and in more controlled conditions, service returns became the story of the closely-contested first set. Sabalenka led by a double-break at 3-0 and served for the set at 6-5 -- but Swiatek battled back both times. Both players were broken four times en route to a first-set tiebreak.

In the breaker, though, Sabalenka came up with some of her most overwhelming serves to supplement her return prowess; she fired an ace to change ends with a dominant 5-1 lead. On the next point, Swiatek misfired long on return to give Sabalenka five set points; the top seed needed only one to wrap up a hard-fought first set after an intense 1 hour and 15 minutes.

Three straight breaks opened the second set, but as quickly as they appeared, the service breaks dried up. Swiatek had the break lead at 2-1 and she held that advantage all the way through the rest of the set, as she flattened out her forehand and found better net play. Swiatek executed a love hold to level the match and keep her streak alive for at least one more set.

Swiatek's hopes, though, were rapidly extinguished as Sabalenka took command in the third set. It was Sabalenka who doubled down on ferocious, flat forehands as she romped through the 22-minute decider. In the third set, Sabalenka went 3-for-3 on break points, hit five winners to Swiatek's two, and was credited with zero unforced errors.

Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka snapped Iga Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros with a hard-fought victory in Thursday's semifinals. Sabalenka collected her 40th WTA main-draw of the year and now advances to her first clay-court Grand Slam final.

Unlike some of her counterparts in the top 10, Coco Gauff didn't have much trouble solving the riddle of Lois Boisson. 

Gauff, the No. 2 seed, dismantled the previously unknown Frenchwoman 6-1, 6-2 on Thursday to reach the French Open final for a second time. Gauff will face No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the player she defeated in 2023 to win the US Open, on Saturday.

Though her level of play has vacillated between sharp and sloppy throughout the tournament, Gauff was mostly dialed in against Boisson, who captivated the Parisian crowds in recent days by knocking off No. 3 Jessica Pegula and No. 6 Mirra Andreeva to reach the semifinals in her Grand Slam singles debut. 

But Boisson, who was ranked No. 361 in the world when the French Open began, seemed to run out of gas against Gauff, who limited her errors and relentlessly targeted the shaky Boisson backhand. Though Boisson managed to get back on serve briefly in the second set and provide a glimmer of hope for the French fans, Gauff quickly ended the drama with another break and sprinted to the finish line. 

Gauff has been hunting a French Open title since arriving on tour, reaching the finals in 2022 and the semifinals last year, losing to four-time champion Iga Swiatek on both occasions. 

This time, the 21-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, won't have to face Swiatek – but Sabalenka stands as just as much of a challenge these days, even on clay. 

Sabalenka ran away from Swiatek in the other semifinal, 7-6, 4-6, 6-0, breaking through to her first French final. Sabalenka will be trying to win her fourth major, joining two Australian and one US title. 

Gauff and Sabalenka have split their 10 career meetings. Most recently, Sabalenka edged out a 6-3, 7-6 win in the Madrid finals on clay. Gauff beat Sabalenka 7-6, 6-3 last fall in the championship match of the WTA Finals on a hard court.

Gauff will face world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in her third career Grand Slam final.ByDavid KanePublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 05, 2025

Coco Gauff guaranteed a No. 1 vs No. 2 final at 2025 Roland Garros when the No. 2 seed ended Loïs Boisson's fairytale run, defeating the French wild card, 6-1, 6-2 on Thursday.The 2022 finalist is into her first Grand Slam final since winning the 2023 US Open, and will face top seed Aryna Sabalenka in the championship match after a one hour and nine-minute victory over Boisson under the Court Philippe-Chatrier roof.Gauff defeated Sabalenka to win her first major title in Flushing Meadows, and though she has not reached a major final in 18 months, the American has returned to her career-high ranking on the strength of some remarkable results, winning the 2024 WTA Finals and reaching back-to-back finals at the Mutua Madrid Open and the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

The 21-year-old lost just one set en route to the semifinals, rallying to defeat Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the quarterfinals, and found herself as a heavy favorite in what was unquestionably the biggest match of Boisson's career.A year older than Gauff, Boisson considerably trailed her opponent in experience, having never faced a Top 50 opponent before accepting a wild card to this year's tournament. Boisson was poised to make her Grand Slam debut at this event in 2024, but a torn ACL delayed those dreams by 12 months. She made up for lost time in style this week, scoring Top 10 victories over Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal.With inclement weather causing the Chatrier roof to close, Gauff and Boisson followed Sabalenka's 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 win over defending champion Iga Swiatek. Like Sabalenka, Gauff enjoyed a quick start against Boisson, winning the first three games and ultimately broke serve four times to claim the opening set.

Like Sabalenka, Gauff enjoyed a quick start against Boisson, winning the first three games and ultimately broke serve four times to claim the opening set.

The youngest French major semifinalist since Amélie Mauresmo in 1999, Boisson looked to make a move as the second set got underway, earning a break point on Gauff's serve in the third game and breaking back when the American took a 3-1 lead.As the match ticked past the one-hour mark, Gauff locked back in and earned another break and this time consolidated to put herself a game from the finish line.Boison, who is projected to rise from No. 361 in the WTA rankings into the Top 70, bravely served to stay in the match, but was unable to find the magic that took her through five victories in Paris and fell behind two match points. Gauff outrallied the wild card to earn one last break and ease into her third Grand Slam final in under 70 minutes.Gauff moves onto a highly anticipated final against Sabalenka; the winner will not only win their first Roland Garros trophy, but also break their tied head-to-head (currently 5-5).

It may not have been the French Open final, but Coco Gauff played like a champion during her semifinals match vs. Lois Boisson on Thursday. Gauff turned in a dominant performance in the win, beating Boisson (6-1, 6-2) in straight sets.

It was an excellent performance from Gauff, who seemed completely locked in against Boisson.

Despite her dominance, Gauff played an emotionless game. She didn't react to mistakes or excellent shots. She was just solely focused on taking down her opponent.

The strategy worked. Seemingly every shot hit by Gauff landed where ever she desired. She often had Boisson running across the entire court just to keep the rally alive. Boisson acquitted herself well there, showing plenty of hustle to extend rallies, but all that movement caught up with her in the end.

The loss ends Boisson's miraculous run at the 2025 French Open. After coming into the event ranked 361, Boisson out-dueled No. 3 Jessica Pegula and No. 6 Mirra Andreeva to make it to the semifinals. Boisson — who is French — had the crowd on her side in all her matches, but Gauff was able to take the crowd out of the equation with a dominant showing Thursday.

The victory pushes Gauff into the French Open final for the second time in her career. Gauff also made it to the final in 2022, where she lost to Iga Swiatek.

There will be no rematch in 2025. Swiatek lost her semifinals match to women's No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday. Sabalenka and Gauff will square off in the final Saturday.

The 2025 French Open semifinals match between Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek was as good as advertised. After a back-and-forth match, Sabalenka came out on top in three sets (7-6, 4-6, 6-0), advancing to the final.

It was a tremendous match all the way through. Despite some early mistakes by Swiatek, she was able to rally in the first set and eventually force a tiebreak.

But with the first set on the line, Sabalenka rose to the occasion, using her devastating serve to take the win.

Swiatek answered back in the second set, taking an early 3-1 lead. While Sabalenka fought her back, Swiatek came out ahead this time around, winning the second set 6-4 to set up a decisive third set. It was the first time in the entire tournament that Sabalenka dropped a set.

There was a lot riding on the final set for Swiatek, who has won the French Open the past three years. She came into the match riding a 26-match win streak, the second best figure in the history of the. French Open.

Things didn't start out well for Swiatek, as Sabalenka jumped up to an early 3-0 lead in the final set. She carried that momentum all the way through the set, winning 6-0 and advancing to her first French Open final.

Fatigue may have been the biggest factor in Sabalenka's victory. Despite a lengthy match, Sabalenka's serves remained dominant even in the final set. Swiatek, who was able to turn in some strong returns in the first two sets, couldn't seem to keep up with Sabalenka's late serves, which were still coming in at incredible speeds.

With the win, Sabalenka will face Gauff in the final. It should be a tight match. The two have squared off 10 times over their careers, with both players earning five wins in those matches.

Date: Thursday, June 4

Aryna Sabalenka-Iga Świątek start time: 9 a.m. ET

Coco Gauff-Louis Boisson approximate start time: 10:10 a.m. ET

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have reshaped the landscape of the ATP Tour with their meteoric rise and distinct, electrifying styles. One dominates with clinical precision and relentless efficiency, the other dazzles with raw athleticism and instinct.

As Sinner and Alcaraz continue to cement their status at No. 1 and No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, respectively, eight-time major winner Andre Agassi weighed in with high praise and pointed insights on their game during a recent appearance on the ‘Served with Andy Roddick' podcast. Hear more of the interview here.

A former World No. 1 and one of only eight men to complete the Career Grand Slam, Agassi is well placed to talk about movement and adaptation. He was particularly astonished by Alcaraz's seamless transition between the surfaces.

“The thing that amazes me most watching Carlos play live is how little his speed diminishes [from] clay [to] grass,” said Agassi. “Most people who are fast, they go to grass, and their court coverage comes down five per cent, just because you have to play really careful in the corners, you have to let your body weight move. Even if you slide into [certain shots], your first step out has to be very careful.

“Everybody's movement comes down a touch, but his didn't. It's like he trusted himself so much on the power of his second push that, running for a drop shot that caught him cold, on Centre Court at Wimbledon, he trusts that pause and then sticks on the jets and gets there. [He's] like a flying saucer versus the F-15s. Everybody's flying a plane and he's changing altitudes, reversing, and his speed doesn't diminish.”



During his career thus far, in which he has already won four major titles and become the youngest No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz has impressed with his raw physical gifts and willingness to compete.

“He's still so raw. I hope he learns how to maximise, and we should enjoy watching him before he does, because it's so much fun for the fans to watch how he plays the game,” Agassi explained. “But he still has so much more upside from a standpoint of longevity."

Sinner, who is one year older than Alcaraz, has strengthened his grip atop the PIF ATP Rankings over the past 12 months. He is completing his 52nd consecutive week at World No. 1 and is chasing a third consecutive major title at Roland Garros.

In contrast to Alcaraz's instinct-driven brilliance, Agassi described Sinner as a model of precision and efficiency.

“Sinner is the exact opposite, he is constantly maximising. He's never hit a ball he doesn't really need to and when he does let one rip, it makes you wonder if he was forced to, what that gear would really look like,” said Agassi. “He's taking 85 per cent cuts and his jab is like a straight right. Jannik just wants to take over and never look back.”

When it comes to Novak Djokovic, however, Agassi's reverence reached another level. The 38-year-old might now be in the twilight of his career, but remains an ever-present threat at the top of the game. Djokovic is this week chasing a record 25th major title at Roland Garros.
“I see the greatest defensive player the game has ever seen, and shockingly, when he needs to be, possibly the greatest offensive player the game has ever seen,” said Agassi. “He's like the boxer that needs to feel the glove hit him before he even engages.
“He goes into this lockdown mode, then you start throwing punches at him, then you get away with a few, then you start getting him engaged and he goes into hyper lockdown mode. Then he throws some offence in, and you're thinking ‘I couldn't win a point when he was on defence, now he's on offence.'"

Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti have been at the forefront of an Italian tennis boom, and it's showing no signs of slowing down at Roland Garros.

Their simultaneous presence in the semi-finals at the clay-court major this week marks just the second time in history that two Italians have reached the last four of the same Grand Slam tournament, 65 years after Nicola Pietrangeli and Orlando Sirola made deep runs in Paris in 1960.

Yet the 2025 edition of this event feels like more than a coincidence: It appears to be a new standard.

Sinner, who is completing his 52nd consecutive week as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is chasing his third consecutive major title. He is riding a 19-match Grand Slam winning streak — the ninth longest in the Open Era — heading into the semi-finals in Paris.

Right behind him, Musetti's surge has added depth and flair to Italy's rise. Known for his one-handed backhand and natural ability, Musetti was a standout junior, reaching World No. 1 in 2019.
After an impressive clay-court swing this year, during which he became the first Italian player to reach the semi-finals at all three ATP Masters 1000 events on the surface, he has risen to a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.
“We support each other very well,” Sinner said of his relationship with Musetti. "We know each other obviously much better now because of playing the Davis Cup together, and we have a good relationship off the court.
“I just wish him only the best to stay healthy, to be relaxed. He has found good stability off court, and you can see that on court. He's an amazing player, [a] Top-5 player now. [I'm] very happy for him, and he's reaching for more, so it's good.”
Fabio Fognini ended the 40-year wait for an Italian to rise inside the Top 10 in 2019, and Matteo Berrettini joined in 2022. Prior to that, only Adriano Panatta and Corrado Barazzutti had reached such heights since the inception of the PIF ATP Rankings in 1973.
Panatta had held the mark as top Italian ever by reaching No. 4. Now, not only has Sinner held World No. 1 for a year, but Musetti is threatening to crack the Top 4 himself at the same time. But first, they have unfinished business at Roland Garros.
“I guess it's a process of growing, but only inside the court but especially off the court,” said Musetti, who could climb as high as No. 4 this week. “Last year I became a father, and I think that gave me an extra responsibility. I think now I approach things in a more professional way, not just on the court, but in my daily routine: When I practise and in my free time.”

Despite both being 23 years of age, Sinner and Musetti have experienced contrasting routes to the top of the game.
During his childhood, Sinner was a talented skier, but later shifted his attention to tennis. He chose to focus on professional tournaments and therefore did not reach the Top 100 in the junior rankings, as Musetti did. Yet Sinner has quickly emerged as one of the Tour's most methodical and fearless competitors since immersing himself in the sport.
Now, Sinner and Musetti represent more than individual success: They symbolise a cultural shift. Italian tennis is no longer hoping for the occasional breakthrough, it is demanding excellence.
The depth in strength of Italian tennis players stretches much further than Sinner and Musetti. Jasmine Paolini, the Hologic WTA Tour No. 4, leads the nation on the women's side, while Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori have cemented themselves as a top doubles team. They have won three tour-level titles this year and reached the Australian Open final in 2024-25 as well as the championship match at last year's Roland Garros.

With history on the line for both, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic will reignite their evenly poised Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry on Friday at Roland Garros, where they will battle for a spot in the championship match.

The runaway No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner is riding a 19-match Grand Slam winning streak and chasing his third consecutive major title. The 23-year-old has quickly established himself as a dominant force on the ATP Tour, and his recent mastery over Djokovic adds fuel to the fire.

While their Lexus ATP Head2Head series is level at 4-4, Sinner has won the past three meetings, including last year's Shanghai final. But the Italian knows better than to rest on his laurels against Djokovic, who will compete in a record-extending 51st Grand Slam semi-final.

“He has shown in the last period that he is back to the level,” Sinner said of Djokovic. “He plays very, very well, so it's going to be quite tactical, but very, very difficult. He's such an experienced player, 24 Grand Slam [titles]. I think that says everything.”

Fresh from claiming his 100th tour-level title in Geneva, Djokovic has his sights set on another milestone at Roland Garros: a record 25th major title. The Serbian is unbeaten at the venue since 2022, having captured his third crown here in 2023 before an inspired run at last year's Paris Olympics, where he won the gold medal that eluded him for so long.
Even in the latter stages of his career, the 38-year-old continues to strive for excellence, which adds an extra layer of intrigue to his clash with the top-seeded Sinner. Djokovic has, throughout the fortnight, reiterated his enduring passion for rewriting tennis history.
“History in this sport has given me everything in my life, it means a lot to me,” Djokovic said after his first-round win against Mackenzie McDonald. “I always try to make history where I can… In all the tournaments I play, all the practises, all the matches, and especially during the biggest tournaments in the world.
“There is an opportunity to make more history, and that is one of the biggest motivations I have for competitions, for continuing to work and better myself.”


To reach a 38th Grand Slam final, Djokovic will need to back up his authoritative four-set quarter-final win over last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. He could also possibly run a gauntlet of Top-3 opponents en route to the title with Sinner up next and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who faces Lorenzo Musetti, looming in the final.
Sinner, meanwhile, has looked razor sharp since returning from a three-month absence last month. He reached the final in Rome and has been near flawless in Paris, becoming the only semi-finalist yet to drop a set and earning the fourth-longest major win streak this century behind Djokovic (30), Roger Federer (27) and Rafael Nadal (25). 
In their ninth meeting, Sinner will undoubtedly look to dictate with his trademark baseline aggression, but if Djokovic's performance over Zverev is any indication, a compelling tactical battle may unfold. After dropping his first set of the tournament, the Serbian adjusted brilliantly, mixing in frequent drop shots and shifting the rhythm to disrupt Zverev's tempo.
That same strategic variety could be crucial against Sinner, whose powerful groundstrokes and willingness to rally make him dangerous in extended exchanges. If Djokovic employs a similar pattern of softening the court and pulling Sinner forward, the Italian will need to stay alert and adaptable, particularly in neutral and defensive positions where quick changes in tempo can open up the court.

Sinner, who is now 17-1 on the season, is riding high on confidence. But no amount of dominance can overshadow Djokovic's reputation as a big-match player.
“He's going to play [at] a very high level, as he did basically every tournament that he played in the last year and a half. I don't expect anything less from him. But these kinds of matchups and challenges in a way extract the best out of me,” said Djokovic. “Playing best-of-five, late stages of a Grand Slam against No. 1 in the world is, you can't get more motivated than that for me at this age.”
With his victory over Cameron Norrie in the fourth round, Djokovic recorded 100 wins at a major tournament for the first time in his career. Trailing only Nadal (112) for the most wins at Roland Garros, Djokovic owns a 101-16 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
Sinner will be eager to halt Djokovic's bid for glory in the French capital, while also keen to better his result from last year, when he fell to Alcaraz in a five-set tussle.

American tennis star Jessica Pegula may have suffered a tough French Open exit against wild-card entry Loïs Boisson but she was still taking swings at critics afterward.

Boisson, a French wild-card entry for the Grand Slam tournament, defeated Pegula in the fourth round of the tournament. Pegula revealed afterward she received death threats from "delusional" bettors upset over the loss to the relatively unknown tennis star.

"These (bettors) are insane and delusional," she wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, via the New York Post. "And I don't allow dms and try to remember when to shut my comments off during tournament weeks but they always find a way to my timeline. This stuff has never really bothered me much but does any other sport deal with this to our level? I'd love to know because it seems to be (predominantly) tennis?? It's so disturbing."

The daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula, who own the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, also shared screenshots of commenters who ridiculed her for the loss. Some called her "trash" while others said she should just enjoy being the daughter of billionaires.

There were other nasty comments as well.

"You sold this match on purpose," one person wrote. "Can't wait until Karma spends the block back on you. Hopefully your first born child will be a still birth."

Pegula added that "every person" on the Women's Tennis Association deals with some type of awful remark.

"I get told my family should get cancer and die from people here on a regular basis. Absolutely crazy," she added.

"I've seen stories of comments/threats/stalking making headlines in other sports…well news flash tennis I can guarantee it's 100 times worse. The comments are nonstop for us. Win or lose – it's whatever they bet on.

"I actually had threats come through the NHL that they were worried about and sent to me. My response was, ‘oh that's it? I get those all the time' that is so messed up that that is my response. Normalizing death threats!"

Pegula added that staying off social media was unavoidable because most of their sponsorship deals involve posting on their platforms.

The French Open continues to receive criticism for its scheduling decisions at this year's tournament.

As the tournament reaches its latter stages, fans on Paris' most famous court, Philippe Chatrier, have yet to see WTA stars headline a night session.

Instead, it's the men who have been given the nod, entertaining the French Open fans in the evenings.

Several women's players have shared their thoughts on the controversial topic, including Jessica Pegula who complained about the lack of equality shown. 

Iga Swiatek, Ons Jabeur, and Coco Gauff have all expressed similar beliefs, as the question rages on as to why the women aren't being given the opportunity to shine on Chatrier late into the night.

As Roland Garros officials receive complaints, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has weighed in with his thoughts.

Appearing on the Australian Open YouTube channel, Tiley gave his verdict on the French Open scheduling controversy.

“There are many factors that go into making a decision around scheduling,” said Tiley.

“The French [Open] will have their factors and their considerations, and they have different circumstances from us.

“It's a new initiative, it's only been a couple of years that they actually have a night match, normally, like Wimbledon, they just roll through the evening. 

“It's a new thing, and they've got one match; they've got to take that into consideration.

“I haven't spoken to anyone at the French Tennis Federation, so I can't go into the basis of their decision.”

The 63-year-old went on to explain how the Australian Open divides matches between the men and women.

“We have 26 sessions over the course of the fortnight, and a session every night, so there are 14 nights of tennis. Some nights there's three courts playing with two matches,” said Tiley.

“We generally schedule two matches and share them between the men and the women.

“We start earlier, we start at seven. It's even, sometimes the men go first, sometimes the women go first. Some years, you may have it more skewed towards the women or more skewed towards the men. But generally, we try to keep it the same as much as we possibly can.

“There's the added complication of three sets versus five sets, that's just the time, not a value, because you can get three-set matches that are more intense, but on average, the three sets are going to be shorter.”

Tiley outlined the factors that go into making scheduling decisions at Grand Slam tournaments.

“Our decisions are based on what the players want, what the broadcasters want, between when you played your last match, are you playing singles, doubles mixed?” he said.

“The players are a big part of that too, some like day, some like night, so you take all of these into consideration and you do the best you can.

“Because you're dealing with two people every time, you're never going to get it 100%. 

“I always say to the players, we'll make sure it's fair, not necessarily equal.”

The two key differences between night sessions at the Australian Open and French Open are the start times and number of matches.

In Melbourne, the night session starts much earlier, which gives them the opportunity to schedule two matches, whereas the later start in Paris allows for just one match.

With that being the case, there is more riding on the length of the singular night session match at the French Open.

If they were to schedule a women's match on Chatrier's night session, which finished in two short sets, fans would likely leave without a full evening's entertainment.

Last week, former world number four Tim Henman provided a simple solution to the scheduling controversy, addressing those two key issues.

“Go to two matches and start earlier,” said Henman.

It remains to be seen if any changes will be made ahead of the 2026 tournament but it will certainly be something to look out for.

Through the first 11 days of the tournament, fans on Chatrier have been treated to several evening classics between ATP stars, but could their female counterparts have offered up even more entertainment?

It's of course up for debate whether the women's matches would've been better choices than the men's, but the French Open certainly can't say they weren't spoilt for choice.

Day 12 of the French Open will see Aryna Sabalenka take on Iga Swiatek, before Lois Boisson plays Coco Gauff.

PARIS (AP) — Third-seeded Italian pair Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat fourth-seeded Americans Taylor Townsend and Evan King 6-4, 6-2 to win the mixed doubles title at the French Open on Thursday.

It was their second major title together after winning last year's U.S. Open. For Errani, it was another trophy won at Roland-Garros, after winning Olympic gold in women's doubles with compatriot Jasmine Paolini last year.

“Let's see if I will see you next year, let's hope,” the 38-year-old Errani, who was a 2012 French Open singles runner-up, told the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier.



Townsend was the U.S. Open mixed runner-up last year with Donald Young, and has won two major women's doubles titles.

She hopes their performance inspires others back home and beyond.

“This is special for me and Evan. We grew up on the south side of Chicago," Townsend said. "I hope this is inspiration for people to know that this is possible.”

As kids, they learned the game at the same courts.

“He's seen me since I was coming up,” she said. “We used to play at the public courts, Jackson Park, we used to play at the same park and we used to be at the same places.”

She added they will have another go.

“We're running it back at Wimbledon so we're going to try it again,” she said. ___

Jannik Sinner admitted that beating Novak Djokovic when he's playing at his best is a monumental feat. The ATP No. 1 is currently gearing up for a French Open semi-final clash with the Serbian titan this Friday, looking to add to his two Australian Opens and a US Open title.

However, the Italian tennis prodigy knows the task at hand as he faces off against the 24-time Grand Slam champion at Roland Garros on Friday. At just 23 years old, Sinner has been vocal about his respect for Djokovic, having met with him eight times on the court to date. And although Sinner has beaten the seasoned star in their last three matches, his own experiences tell him how formidable Djokovic can be when performing at his best.

Reflecting during the Australian Open this year, Sinner responded to Alexander Zverev's comments comparing him to a prime Djokovic. He said: "Well it's an amazing compliment from Sahsa. I think everyone is different in a way.

"Obviously I have some similarities with Novak's game-style. I still believe when Novak plays at his best it's very, very, very, very tough to beat him. Game-style wise, I looked up to him, trying to understand what he's doing.

"How he handles the pressure moments and important moments. I still believe we are different as players, because everyone is different. But for sure we have similarities, and the similarities are having quite clean well striking from the base-line, having good movement, understanding a little bit where your opponent plays the ball.



"Obviously I aim to improve as a player, because I feel like I still can improve in certain areas. And that is where we are going to work on."

The comments came after his impressive 6-3, 7-6 [7-4], 6-3 victory over Zverev in the final at Melbourne earlier this year. And it's not the first time he has praised Djokovic. Speaking after his loss to the 38-year-old at the 2023 Nitto ATP Final, he said: "I think today [Djokovic] played really, really good, especially in the back of the court.

"But I think today I was not that sharp in certain moments. I felt like also that I dropped this little bit physically. When you drop a little bit against the best player in the world, he makes it look like it's a big difference."

Meanwhile, Djokovic has reciprocated respect for his rival, despite rumours of disrespect before this year's Australian Open. Djokovic participated in a word association game with GQ prior to the tournament, and while he tied Roger Federer with "elegance", Rafael Nadal with "tenacity" and Carlos Alcaraz with "charisma", his succinct response of "skiing" regarding Sinner raised eyebrows amongst some fans.

However, the tennis ace was swift to clarify the situation, saying at the the tournament: "Yes, I've seen it on social media that it's being made into some kind of drama or a story, like I humiliated him or I've intentionally shown disrespect toward him.

"That's ridiculous. It was one of those quiz type of interviews where you have to think of something in a second. Sinner's name came up and I had this image in my head of him skiing, because I saw he was skiing somewhere.

"Also, the two of us talk about skiing always, how we're going to ski together, etc. That's why I said 'skiing', not because I don't respect his achievements in tennis, on the contrary."

He added: "It is as clear as day that the way he is dominating is worthy of every praise – both his playing style and the level of play. He's got all the attributes I've mentioned in others [Federer, Nadal, Alcaraz], and now people make it seem like I am disrespecting him. Rubbish."

All eyes are on Sinner and Djokovic as they prepare for their showdown on Court Philippe-Chatrier come Friday, each aiming to secure their place in the French Open final where they will face either Lorenzo Musetti or Carlos Alcaraz.

Opulent properties can be rented through Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes

Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes

Over half a million tennis fans from around the world will visit southwest London beginning June 30 for Wimbledon, the grand dame of tennis tournaments. Founded in 1877 and held each year at the time-honored All England Club, Wimbledon is the sport's oldest tournament. From its famed strawberries and cream to the all white dress code, Wimbledon honors tradition unlike any other sporting event. Whether you're a tennis enthusiast or not, Wimbledon is a venue that should be on everyone's “must see” list.

The world's greatest tennis players all congregate at Wimbledon.

Wimbledon is much more than a tennis tournament. It is an event where royalty and celebrities gather with everyday sports fans to witness tennis played on iconic grass courts. Wimbledon can turn a relatively unknown into a superstar as it did for a young John McEnroe and an even younger Maria Sharapova.

The Village of Wimbledon, a quaint enclave where Indie boutiques and chic cafes line the streets, serves as the perfect setting for this storied tournament. The vast fields of Wimbledon Common draw walkers and cyclists, while smaller Wimbledon Park attracts families with its playgrounds and lake.

Visitors who wish to experience London at its finest during their stay can opt for a wide variety of accommodations, ranging from high-end hotels to cozy bed and breakfasts. Home to both the Regents Park Mansion and Regent Park Avenue properties, St. John's Wood, London is only minutes from Regent's Park and within easy reach of the All England Club. These opulent properties can be exclusively rented through Mandarin Oriental Exceptional Homes and offer a rare glimpse into the kind of spaces the ultra-wealthy retreat to during the London social season.

Affluent travelers can attend Wimbledon and stay in luxurious accommodations.

Tennis season is officially here, with the French Open currently underway. This weekend, the HSBC Championships will kick off at the Queen's Club. And Wimbledon, of course, starts on 30 June.

Whether you're a player or a dedicated fan, here are some of the best homes on the market for tennis lovers.

 

Players, staff, entourage and hardcore fans all need somewhere to stay throughout Wimbledon. In a rental, they're looking for home comforts, proximity to the grounds and somewhere to rest between matches.

Located a 20-minute walk (or six-minute drive) away from Wimbledon, this four-bedroom period house is available on a “tennis let” throughout the tournament for £3,200 per week via Hamptons. There are two bathrooms, a large kitchen to prepare nutritious, Wimbledon-ready meals and a rear garden for players or fans to relax in. There's also parking available.

 

Why bother with tickets — or queues — for Queens when you can watch the tennis from your terrace? This two-bedroom apartment, listed for £700,000 with John D Wood & Co., overlooks the Queens Club grounds in West Kensington, which host the annual HSBC Championships. This year, it's running from 7 to 22 June, featuring some of the biggest names in the sport, including Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Jack Draper, Emma Raducanu and Naomi Osaka.

Located on Gledstanes Road, the 652 square foot top floor apartment has a west-facing terrace with “truly remarkable views” over Queen's Club.

"Properties with views over the Queen's Club are exceptionally rare, and this apartment offers one of the best vantage points we've seen,” says Nick Scott, sales manager at John D Wood & Co.'s Fulham branch. “The large west-facing terrace is perfect for entertaining or simply soaking in the atmosphere during the tennis season.”

According to the agents, the property is currently rented out to tenants who fell for its views. “It's ideal for young professionals, pied-à-terre seekers, or those looking for a smart investment in one of west London's most desirable pockets," says Scott.

The Grade II-listed Miramonte in New Maldon was designed in 1936 by the English modernist architect Maxwell Fry for the property developer Gerry Green. But as well as being a modernist marvel, it's the perfect home for a tennis player, with its own all-weather tennis court and pavilion, which features a shower room, kitchenette and double bed. Fans can watch from the sun terrace, which overlooks the court.

There are 1.24 acres of grounds and an indoor pool complex, with a spa pool, changing room, steam room and sauna to help boost an athlete's recovery. And, when it's time for the Championships, Wimbledon is a 12-minute drive away.

Yours for £6 million with Coombe Residential.

 

As visitors descend on Wimbledon during the Championships, some homeowners on the nearby streets make thousands of pounds renting out their parking spaces. Spaces listed on YourParkingSpace can go for up to around £70 per day, so homeowners with multiple spaces and bookings throughout Wimbledon are quids in.

This 1,891 square foot property on Somerset Road is a five-minute walk from Wimbledon, and comes with off-street parking big enough for more than one car and a large double garage. Other parking spaces in Cedar Court are being advertised for £62.50 per day.

Besides the parking spaces, the house has five bedrooms – so canny owners could also make an extra buck by renting some out during the tournament. One bedroom is ensuite and there are two extra bathrooms, plus a rear garden. It's on sale for £1.35 million with Hawes & Co.

This four-bedroom house on Grand Drive backs onto the All England Lawn Tennis Club Community Centre in Raynes Park. The centre is home to 25 public tennis courts, which are used by the pros for practice during Wimbledon. 

You might be able to spot some of those training sessions from the rooms at the back of this 1,279 square foot house – or, failing that, you'll live close enough to the community facility to hone your own tennis skills. 

There's a bright kitchen and dining space which leads onto the garden and a loft conversion from which to snoop on the players. It's on the market for £800,000 with James Bailey Property.

This house in Rottingdean, East Sussex, is the former home of Britain's most successful tennis player, Fred Perry. Perry won three Wimbledon titles in the 1930s, as well as the men's singles championships of the United States (three times), Australia and France. 

In 1935, he became the first man to win a career Grand Slam, having won all four major titles between 1933 and 1935. He remains the only British player to have done this, and in 1984 a bronze statue of him was erected outside Wimbledon. Perry founded his eponymous sportswear brand in 1952.

After the Second World War, Perry split his time between Jamaica, Florida and the UK. He moved into this house in Rottingdean in 1965, using it as his UK base until 1994. Perry died in 1995.

The house was built by the developer and financier Charles W Neville, and has 3,935 square feet of space with four bedrooms, a double garage and a south-facing garden. It's on the market with David Webb Residential for £1.5 million.

Djokovic has had the upper hand on clay and at Grand Slams, but Sinner has won their last three meetings in a row.ByJohn BerkokPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

When the draw was made at Roland Garros two weeks ago, it was a potential semifinal match-up everyone had their eye on—a meeting of the last two ATP world No. 1s—and now, it's a reality.Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic will go head-to-head at Roland Garros on Friday, with a spot in the final of the clay-court major on the line.And speaking of head-to-heads, this one couldn't get any closer, as the two have split their eight previous career meetings evenly, four apiece.SINNER VS DJOKOVIC HEAD-TO-HEAD: 4-4'21 Monte Carlo 2nd Rd (clay): Djokovic won, 6-4, 6-2'22 Wimbledon QFs (grass): Djokovic won, 5-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2'23 Wimbledon SFs (grass): Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6'23 ATP Finals RR (indoor hard): Sinner won, 7-5, 6-7, 7-6'23 ATP Finals F (indoor hard): Djokovic won, 6-3, 6-3'23 Davis Cup Finals SFs (indoor hard): Sinner won, 6-2, 2-6, 7-5'24 Australian Open SFs (hard): Sinner won, 6-1, 6-2, 6-7, 6-3'24 Shanghai F (hard): Sinner won, 7-6, 6-3But how relevant are any of those meetings going into this one?There's been an obvious shift in the head-to-head, with Djokovic winning their first three meetings and Sinner winning their last three meetings—you could also look at it as Djokovic winning four of their first five and Sinner winning four of their last five.

The Case For Djokovic First of all, they've only met once before on clay, and Djokovic won in straight sets. Granted, that meeting was four years ago, at Monte Carlo in 2021—but after Rafael Nadal, Djokovic has been by far the most accomplished player on clay this century, the only other man to win Roland Garros three times since 2000 and capturing 11 career Masters 1000 titles on this surface, second only to Nadal's 26.Second of all, he's won his last 22 matches in a row at Stade Roland Garros: seven en route to winning Roland Garros in 2023; four en route to the quarterfinals of Roland Garros last year before having to withdraw from the tournament due to a knee injury; six en route to the gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics, which were held on these courts; and now five more en route to the semifinals of Roland Garros this year.Finally, he leads at majors, 2-1, and though they haven't played here—Djokovic's two wins came at Wimbledon and Sinner's win came at the Australian Open—those are the only three times they've played the best-of-five-set format, so at the very least that will come into play on Friday.

The Case For Sinner Even though their last three meetings—all of which Sinner won—have come on hard courts, it's hard to ignore the clear shift in the head-to-head, especially given the manner in which he's beaten him.Across their last two meetings, at the Australian Open and Shanghai last year, not only did Sinner hold all 30 of his service games, Djokovic didn't even get to break point in any of them—a testament to the Sinner serve that arguably the greatest returner of all time didn't even make a dent.Djokovic isn't the only top player Sinner has dominated as of late, either—he's won 11 of his last 12 matches against Top 10 players, a stretch that dates back to last October, the only loss coming to Carlos Alcaraz in the final of Rome a few weeks ago, his first tournament back on tour.And finally, Sinner knows a thing or two about managing best-of-five, too, as he's currently on a 19-match winning streak at the Slams, a run that has taken him to titles at the 2024 US Open and 2025 Australian Open, and now the semifinals here. All best-of-five matches, all wins.So will Djokovic win his 23rd match in a row at Stade Roland Garros, or will Sinner extend his Grand Slam winning streak to 20 in a row?Tune into Tennis Channel on Friday!

The 24-time Grand Slam champion was brilliant against Alexander Zverev, but now faces a quantum leap in pace from the other side of the net.BySteve TignorPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

“This is where I lock in and really give my best,” Novak Djokovic says. “I thrive on Grand Slams.”If you had any doubts that this was still true, he gave us all the proof we needed in a grinding, grueling, four-set win over Alexander Zverev on Wednesday. Djokovic, who has just one ATP title in the last year and a half, produced a throwback performance to beat the No. 3 seed.He had more aces than the big-serving German, as well as more winners. He made 71 percent of first serves and was broken just once, at the very beginning of the match. He won key points serving-and-volleying, was 27 of 37 at net, and in the final set, he saved a break point by finishing a killer 34-shot rally with a forehand pass. Whenever he couldn't afford to miss, Djokovic didn't miss.All of which is to say that the 38-year-old who stumbled his way through much of the first half of the season, lost two first-round matches at Masters 1000s, and fired his coach, is back in peak form, right on time. Did we expect anything less? I have to say I had my doubts that he could still win seven best-of-five-set matches on clay. Now he just has two more to go.

One of which will come against Jannik Sinner, the No. 1 player in the world, and the winner of his last 19 matches at the majors. Maybe more importantly, the Italian has also won his last three matches, and four of his last five, against Djokovic.The Serb understands what he's up against.“I know what to expect from Jannik,” Djokovic says. “He's going to come out, he's going to play on a very high level, as he did basically every tournament that he played in the last year and a half. I don't expect anything less from him.”That's thing with Sinner these days: You can pretty much count on a five-star, fifth-gear performance from him. The strokes are clean, the pace is blistering, the ball is back on you, or past you, seemingly in no time at all. To say he hasn't dropped a set in five matches feels like a gross understatement. Three of those sets were bagels, and three were 6-1. Against Alexander Bublik in the quarters, Sinner hit 31 winners, made 13 errors, and wasn't broken, despite making just 56 percent of his first serves.“Felt like today I was very, very consistent from the back of the court,” Sinner said afterward. “I think that paid off a lot throughout the whole match.”

As well as these two have looked, neither has played an opponent anywhere near their level so far in Paris. Whose form will hold up better under the heightened pressure?Djokovic will be facing a quantum leap in pace from the other side of the net. While he was able to grind with Zverev, he'll need to up his defensive level against Sinner, who takes the ball much earlier, and find some way to push back and make the tall Italian move.Does that sound impossible? We've seen Djokovic do it before here. Two years ago, when he played Carlos Alcaraz in the semis, he countered the younger man's power by standing toe-to-toe with him, and it worked. Djokovic was both wily and confident against Zverev; he'll need to be both of those things again.“These kind of matchups and challenges in a way extract the best out of me,” Djokovic says.

(Yet another) legendary feat complete.

Sinner is also well aware of what's coming. While Djokovic is 14 years his senior, that means he also has 14 more years experience winning big matches.“He has shown now in the last period that he is back to the level,” Sinner says of Djokovic. “He plays very, very well, so it's going to be quite tactical, but very, very difficult. He's such an experienced player, 24 Grand Slams. I think that says everything.”Sinner will play his game, because why wouldn't he? It's the best there is right now. Djokovic will try to find a way to surprise him and disrupt that game; he's as good as anyone has ever been at that.Djokovic is the man with 24 majors, but these days it's Sinner who has been coming up big at the biggest moments. Winner: Sinner

The 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up Roland Garros with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history.BySteve TignorPublished Jun 05, 2025 copy_link

“Pristine” is not a word that comes to mind to describe Wednesday's women's quarterfinals at Roland Garros.In a nervy, topsy-turvy, largely rhythmless opener, Coco Gauff and Madison Keys combined for 40 winners and 101 errors, and broke each other 14 times. Both players were tense and prone to mistakes early; playing a countrywoman in a Grand Slam quarterfinal will do that to you. But only one of them, Gauff, managed to cut those errors out as the match progressed. By the third set, she'd returned to the lockdown mode that has served her so well at this tournament in recent years.“I'm very happy with how I managed to fight today,” a relieved Gauff said after her . “It was a tough match. Madison is a tough opponent, but glad to be in the semis.”“I wasn't feeling the ball obviously to start the match,” she said, but a change in racquet tension helped. “Usually if you're playing too passive, in the end the more aggressive player is going to win. I was just trying to be aggressive.”

The second quarterfinal, between Biosson and Mirra Andreeva, was of somewhat higher quality, through both made more mistakes than winners. The ugliness came in the second set, when the 18-year-old Andreeva, regularly booed by the capacity French crowd, came unglued, smashed her leg with her racquet, bashed a ball high into the seats and watched a 3-0 lead turn into a .“I didn't really pay attention to the [booing], but obviously with nerves and with pressure, it became a little harder,” Andreeva said. “But, anyway, I think that I can learn from this, so nothing more I can say for now.”Andreeva credited Boisson's good play for her win, which is only appropriate. The 22-year-old, 361st-ranked Frenchwoman has lit up the tournament with one of—if not the most—improbable runs in Grand Slam history.

Her game—physical, spin-based, forehand-centric—is the embodiment of how tennis has been played in this decade. She can hit her serve with flat pace or a high-bouncing kick. She sets up points to feature her forehand, and she loves to take it inside-in for blistering winners. She adds slice and finesse with her backhand.“She has a great serve,” Andreeva said. “She has a great forehand. I think she hit a lot of winners with her forehand today. I think that she also played solid and consistent throughout the whole match.”

Boisson vs. Gauff is a great unknown. It's the rare Slam semifinal in which the two players have never met—by contrast, the other semi will give us the 13th encounter between Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.We can start by saying that Gauff is ranked No. 2 and Boisson, as we all know by now, is 361st. But that 361 is somewhat misleading; she has climbed as high as 152, and surely would have moved higher if not for an injury. Still, Gauff has a huge edge in experience, especially on big stages.Game-wise, the match will likely be defined by high, heavy topspin exchanges that may go on at length. Boisson hits with a lot of topspin on both sides, and Gauff does with her forehand. One dynamic to watch: When Boisson runs around and cracks her forehand inside-out, can Gauff counter that with her flat two-handed backhand down the line? Andreeva had some success doing that on Wednesday, but not enough.

Both women can and will disrupt the points with drop shots, but both are quick enough to track them down. Look for a fair amount of cat and mouse after they've drawn each other up to the net. Boisson's serve looks more reliable. Avoiding a cascade of double faults will be crucial for Gauff, but if her serve is clicking, it will make her more confident all around.As for the Lois-loving fans, Gauff says she's ready for whatever they bring, citing other matches in other countries where she has handled a hostile audience.“I think there are two ways I have done it in the past,” Gauff says. “Either, A, just pretend they're cheering for you, and B, just using it and not letting that get to you.”Gauff and Boisson seem close to evenly matched at the moment. Coco has been here before, and she would likely beat the Frenchwoman in any other place, at any other time. But this week. Boisson is a home-town Cinderella. The old tennis axiom is that a hot-hitting player will eventually show you why they're ranked where they're ranked. I waited for that to happen to Boisson against Pegula, and again versus Andreeva. It hasn't happened yet. Winner: Boisson

Christian Horner has insisted that Red Bull will give Yuki Tsunoda “time and support” in order to increase his confidence in the car, with the team boss backing the Japanese driver to deliver after displaying “flashes of performance”.

Tsunoda was promoted to the outfit from sister squad Racing Bulls after the opening two races of the season, the 25-year-old swapping seats with Liam Lawson amid a difficult start to the campaign for the New Zealander.

While Tsunoda has scored points in three of his seven Grands Prix for Red Bull so far, he has struggled to match the pace of team mate Max Verstappen and faced two particularly tough weekends in Monaco and Spain, having failed to reach Q3 in Qualifying on both occasions.

Tsunoda reckons points were on the cards before the Safety Car was deployed

This has left him in 15th place of the Drivers' Championship as things stand on a total of 10 points, meaning that Verstappen is responsible for 134 out of the team's 144 point-tally.

When asked in Barcelona about what the team can do in helping Tsunoda to feel more confident at the wheel of the RB21, Horner explained: “I think the only thing that we can do is give him time and support and try and get a set-up that he's got confidence in.

“Driving these cars is all about confidence, and that's what he needs to find. I think he'll get there.

"He's fast. He's just got to piece it all together. We keep seeing flashes of performance. We just need to see him put it all together. I think he's capable of that.”

Horner has backed Tsunoda to deliver after showing "flashes of performance"

With various drivers having filled the seat alongside Verstappen in recent years – including Pierre Gasly, Alex Albon and Sergio Perez – Horner also faced questions on the future options for the team, including the possibility of Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar being on the radar after a strong start to his rookie campaign.

However, the Briton was adamant that the team are in no rush to make a decision about that, responding: “I think I'm going to take a leaf out of Flavio [Briatore's] book and say, ‘I don't want to answer it'.

Ryan Coogler is ready to work with one of his heroes: Denzel Washington. The director said during the “7PM in Brooklyn” podcast (in the below video) that Washington will in fact be part of “Black Panther 3,” should that movie ever happen. Washington previously let it slip in November 2024 that Coogler wrote a role for him; however, the third MCU franchise film has still not been formally announced by Marvel.

Coogler told NBA legend Carmelo Anthony that he has been trying to work with Washington “since day one.” 

“There's no fiction out there,” Coogler said of Washington sharing the “Black Panther 3” news. “Denzel is family at this point…I've been trying to work with him since day one. I think he's the greatest living actor, and in terms of what he means to our culture, forget about it. I've been talking to him about this to him for a long time.”

Coogler said there's a lot of false stuff out there, especially about Coogler himself and his work, to the point that he doesn't read Wikipedia anymore. But what Washington said was truthful, and yet Coogler was still “surprised” that Washington went public with the news, even well before anything is set in stone: “I was surprised that when he mentioned it [‘Black Panther 3'], but it's not like it's not true,” he said. 

 










Washington had said on Australian “Today” (via Variety) in 2024 that Coogler was “writing a part for me in the next ‘Black Panther,'” which would be one of his last roles. “After that, I'm going to do the film ‘Othello.' After that, I'm going to do King Lear. After that, I'm going to retire,” Washington said at the time. “For me, it's about the filmmakers. Especially at this point in my career, I am only interested in working with the best. I don't know how many more films I'm going to make. It's probably not that many. I want to do things I haven't done.”

Washington is next starring in “Highest 2 Lowest,” which reunites him with Coogler's mentor and advocate Spike Lee. “I'm so hyped for this. That trailer — the monologue Denzel doing…he's in rare form. I just can't put no words to how excited I am, man, because when [Lee] and Denzel get together, it's always a masterpiece,” Coogler said during the podcast.

Coogler also reflected on showing Lee “Sinners.” 

“For me to give Spike a cinematic experience. I'm just paying him back with interest, bro. It meant the world to me to hear him say that. I cried, bro — I had to hide my — he was jumping around like — I was wiping tears out of my eyes, bro,” Coogler said. “I'm sitting in the IMAX theater showing Spike Lee the movie. He likes it?”

 










Just don't expect Washington or Lee to have any cameos in the “Sinners” cinematic universe: Coogler already said there most likely won't be a sequel to “Sinners.”

“I wanted the movie to feel like a full meal: your appetizers, starters, entrees, and desserts, I wanted all of it there. I wanted it to be a holistic and finished thing,” Coogler told Ebony Magazine. “That was how I was asked all about it. That was always my intention.”

Davis starred in the movie and her JuVee banner produced it. The banner has a focus on developing and producing a library of socially relevant entertainment, with a focus on inclusion and the idea of giving a voice to the voiceless.

Timbo also introduced a new genre called "A-Pop."

Timbaland has launched his own AI entertainment company called Stage Zero and its first signee is the artist TaTa.


	Co-founded with Rocky Mudaliar and Zayd Portillo, Stage Zero's first signee is an AI pop artist called TaTa, driven by Suno AI. The pop artist, along with a bevy of AI-driven creative tools will all be under Timbo's new company. The Grammy-award winning producer will be handling the majority of the production for this new artificial intelligence venture, which he dubbed as a new genre entirely called “A-Pop.”


	“I'm not just producing tracks anymore,” Timbaland said in a statement. “I'm producing systems, stories, and stars from scratch. [TaTa] is not an avatar. She is not a character. TaTa is a living, learning, autonomous music artist built with AI. TaTa is the start of something bigger. She's the first artist of a new generation. A-Pop is the next cultural evolution, and TaTa is its first icon.”

	Mudaliar added, “The artists of tomorrow won't just be human, they'll be IP, code and robotics that are fully autonomous. That's what we're building at Stage Zero.”

	Timbaland has remained a prevalent advocate for AI in music. In an April interview with Billboard, Timbo said AI is in an exciting new place compared to where it was just a few years ago.


	“The technology of today is perfect for what this is,” Timbaland told Billboard. “What used to take me three months only takes me two days. In the beginning, it was like a toy. It was like going to a toy store. You gotta go through gluttony, because you can't believe that it's here.”

EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios is in development on Ally Clark, a new thriller starring Oscar winner Viola Davis, who will produce alongside Rocky Oscar winner Irwin Winkler.


	The project brings Davis back to Amazon on the heels of G20, a recent action thriller that landed the #1 spot on Nielsen's Movie chart debut week with 516 million minutes streamed.


Ally Clark takes us from the marble halls of Washington, D.C. to the sweltering bayous of Louisiana and the icy peaks of Alaska, following investigator Ally Clark (Davis) as she embarks on a perilous inquiry into an international conglomerate following the suspicious death of a close friend.

	











Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger, Salt) will direct from a script by Jose Ruisanchez and Winkler. Producers include Winkler Films' Charles Winkler, David Winkler, and Ruisanchez, and JuVee Productions' Davis and Julius Tennon. JuVee Productions' Melanie Clark will exec produce.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Prior to G20, Davis was seen in hit films including The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, Air, and The Woman King. Upcoming, the EGOT winner has Gina Prince-Bythewood's adaptation of the Tomi Adeyemi novel Children of Blood and Bone for Paramount, among other projects. She is repped by CAA, Lasher Group, and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols.


	Noyce is the director behind films including Salt, The Quiet American, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, all the way back to Dead Calm. Most recently, he directed the action thriller Fast Charlie starring Pierce Brosnan and Morena Baccarin. He is repped by UTA, Anonymous Content, Fineman Entertainment, and Ziffren Brittenham.

Political Editor


UPDATED, with additional back and forth: Donald Trump and Elon Musk exchanged bitter comments and accusations throughout the day on Thursday, as an all-out feud broke out between the most powerful man on Earth and the world's richest man.


	After a series of attacks from Musk, Trump wrote on Truth Social, “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!”


	He also wrote that Musk was “wearing thin” and that he “asked him to leave” his official White House post. 

	











	Trump wrote, “I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Musk, meanwhile, called Trump's post about being asked to leave “an obvious lie” and “so sad.”


	He then brought up Jeffrey Epstein, long the source of conspiracy theories, and claimed that Trump “is in” the files of the federal investigation.


	“That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”


	He added, “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”


	It was only last week that Trump and Musk appeared in the Oval Office as a sendoff for the billionaire as he stepped away from his official government role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.


	But since then, Musk has gone on a tirade about the president's chief legislative effort, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Musk has claimed that the tax, border and defense legislation would bankrupt the government, to the dismay of Trump and his allies.


	Earlier in the Oval Office, Trump made his first public comments about Trump's broadside against the bill. “Elon and I have a great relationship,” Trump said. “I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised, because you were here, everyone in this room practically was here as we had a wonderful sendoff. He said wonderful things about me.”

	











	But as cable networks carried Trump's comments, Musk responded to the president, at times refuting his claims. He later blasted Trump for the idea that he would have won the 2024 election without him.


	“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude,” Musk wrote on X.


	As Musk has railed against Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the past 48 hours, White House officials have tried to point out where they think Musk is wrong. House Speaker Mike Johnson has sought to speak to him by phone. But that did not stop Musk's criticisms on X.


	Trump told reporters that Musk “knew the inner workings” of the bill, and “never had a problem until right after he left.”


	“I'm very disappointed in Elon,” Trump said.


	“People leave my administration and they love us, and at some point they miss it so badly,” Trump said. “Some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It is sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.”


	Musk responded, “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!”


	Just before Trump spoke to reporters, Musk posted one of Trump's past tweets from 2012, in which he wrote, “No member of Congress should be eligible for re-election if our country's budget is not balanced— deficits not allowed!”


	“I couldn't agree more!” Musk wrote.


	Musk's attacks the legislation have threatened the fragile coalition of GOP lawmakers in the House, who passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by one vote last month. The Senate is now taking up the bill.


	Musk has called for a “slim beautiful bill,” as the current legislation encompassed tax cuts, border security funding and defense all in one massive piece of legislation. 


	Trump suggested that Musk's opposition was motivated by the fact that the legislation removes an electric vehicle mandate, which provided subsidies for the purchase of electric vehicles. That is beneficial to Musk's Tesla.


	“Elon knew this from the beginning,” Trump said, referring to his opposition to the subsidies.


	 Musk posted on X, apparently in response, “Whatever. Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this! Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.”


	The president also suggested that Musk was upset that Trump ended the nomination of Jared Isaacman, an ally of the billionaire, to serve as NASA administrator. Trump said that it was because Isaacman “happened to be a Democrat,” something that he did not think was “appropriate.”

“Dancing With the Stars” alum Brooke Burke is in a long-term relationship with Scott Rigsby, and the couple has been engaged since September 2021. They should have celebrated their wedding day last week, but had to make the tough decision to postpone, and now Burke is opening up about why they did that.

A post shared by Brooke Burke (@brookeburke)

In an interview with Page Six on May 28, which was published on June 4, Burke was asked about her wedding day, and she revealed that it was meant to be that day. She confirmed that “actually no one knew,” that they had confirmed the date, but they were filled with sadness about not having the ceremony. “Today when I woke up, we were both, like, [crying],” she told Page Six. “We have been so busy. We built a home in Arizona. We blended our family. We moved in together [in Malibu]. We had the fires and then the fires again and the floods.”

Burke also discussed how the last few years had been “weird” for her and Rigsby, and that after being engaged for almost four years, she felt it was “almost embarrassing” when people ask about when she will get married. She doesn't want to stay engaged forever. It is not just her fans who are curious about their wedding, but even their children. Burke confirmed that she and Rigsby would like to have their wedding before the end of 2025.

A post shared by Homeworthy (@homeworthy)

The topic of wedding planning has been something Burke has been asked about several times in the last few weeks. In an interview with People on June 3, she commented again on her upcoming nuptials. She also revealed why May 28 was so special to her (so could 2026 be the year she says “I do?”).

“I had a really weird wish — because I'm a little bit weird — to get married on 5/28, which is the frequency of love,” she told People. The publication reports that the “love frequency” is often thought to be 528 Hz. 

Burke again commented on how they had been busy and the date had to be pushed back again. But she teased, “We gotta do it next year.” The actress referred to herself as being “slow” to get married, but when she does, it's going to be a memorable occasion. “It's got to be big,” she told People. “That's why it hasn't happened yet.”

She continued, “We want to do something different and innovative and show people how to make a difference. But it's not just about writing checks, it's about having fun, telling your story, living out loud, participating. Generational philanthropy. Nobody's talking about that.”

Elon Musk has been waging a full-throated campaign against Donald Trump's “big, beautiful” reconciliation bill, calling the keystone of the president's legislative agenda a “disgusting abomination” while trying to rally senators to oppose it.


	Trump is not happy. The president responded at length to Musk's opposition to the bill while speaking with reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, criticizing the former head of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), who officially left the administration last week. “I'm very disappointed in Elon,” Trump said. “I've helped Elon a lot.”


	Trump added that Musk didn't have a problem with the bill until after he left the administration, and suggested the world's richest man may have developed a case of so-called Trump Derangement Syndrome. “He's not the first. People leave my administration, and they love us, and then at some point they miss it so badly,” Trump said. “Some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it. We have it with others. They leave and they wake up in the morning and the glamor is gone and the whole world is different and they become hostile.”

	











	Musk escalated his criticism of the bill, which includes massive cuts to social services like Medicaid in order to fund tax cuts for the rich, on Tuesday, writing on X that the “massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk seems to be upset that the bill is expected to add trillions to the national deficit, although some, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), have wondered whether he is actually upset that the bill will strip electric vehicle tax credits, which have helped his car company, Tesla.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump made the allegation himself on Thursday. “Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here,” the president said, adding that “he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate,” he said of Musk.

	Musk responded to Trump in real time on X in what turned into an hours-long onslaught against his former BFF. “False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” he wrote.


	“Whatever,” Musk added. “Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill. In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this! Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.”


	Musk then really hit Trump where it hurts. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” he wrote. “Such ingratitude,” he added before continuing to rant about Trump and the bill throughout Thursday afternoon. Musk even suggested Trump is a pedophile. “Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,” he wrote. “That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!”


	Tesla's stock price plummeted during Musk's meltdown over Trump and the tax bill.


	Trump has responded on Truth Social by calling Musk “CRAZY!” and threatening to “terminate” Musk's government contracts.

	Trump and Musk's full-fledged feud comes less than a week after the duo lauded each other during a farewell press conference for Musk in the Oval Office. “Elon's service to America has been without comparison in modern history,” Trump said, noting that he is “really not leaving.”


	We think it's safe to say after Thursday that Musk will not be back in the Oval Office anytime soon.

	Fifty years ago, the Talking Heads performed for the first time, opening for the Ramones at CBGB. They'd go on to become one of the most influential art-house bands in music history, leaving fans with tons of iconic songs over the decades. Today, they're celebrating their anniversary by reminding people of one specific classic: They've released a video for “Psycho Killer,” the first song they ever wrote as a band.


	“Psycho Killer” ended up on the band's 1977 album Talking Heads: 77 but never got a video — until now. The newly released visuals were directed by Mike Mills and star actress Saoirse Ronan, following her as she goes through a spectrum of emotions before eventually losing it a little bit.


	“This video makes the song better,” the band said in a statement. “We  LOVE what this video is NOT – it's not literal, creepy, bloody, physically violent or obvious.” To coincide with the anniversary, the band has announced the super deluxe edition of their album More Songs About Buildings and Food.

	Last September, the band released an acoustic version of the song recorded with the late musician Arthur Russell nearly five decades ago. “We knew cellist and singer/songwriter Arthur Russell from the downtown world. He died early from AIDS, and during his life, he released very disparate records,” David Byrne had shared in a statement then. “He left a huge legacy of recordings, which are still filtering out 40 years after his passing.”

	











	That acoustic version of “Psycho Killer” is part of a reissue of Talking Heads: 77, which came out in November and features tons of unreleased material from the band's archives.

	The band first formed in 1970s New York and became known for its glam rock look, always performing in face paint and elaborate costumes. It found hits with songs like “Rock and Roll All Nite” and “Deuce”. Their performances included theatrical elements like pyrotechnics, rockets, spitting blood and smoke.

	Darren Lemke wrote the latest draft of the project, which has been developed by band members and Universal Music Publishing Group's Jody Gerson and Universal Music Group's Bruce Resnikoff, who control the band's music rights globally. Polygram's David Blackman also developed the project. 


	Simmons and Stanley will produce, along with Mark Canton and Doc McGhee, Gerson, and Blackman all serving as producers or executive producers. They are joined by Leigh Ann Burton; McG, and his Wonderland producing partner Mary Viola; David Hopwood; Courtney Solomon; and Dorothy Canton; as well as Sweden-based Pophouse, which acquired the global rights to the KISS brand, including name and likeness.


	Jonas, repped by UTA and Schreck Rose, comes from his own musical background, as one of the members of the band The Jonas Brothers, and a subsequent solo career that includes hits like “Jealous.” As for film, Jonas has appeared in the Jumanji franchise and will next be seen starring opposite Paul Rudd in John Carney's Power Ballad for Lionsgate.

Talking Heads are celebrating their 50th anniversary by releasing the first-ever video for “Psycho Killer.” The band enlisted the great Mike Mills to direct, with Saoirse Ronan starring as an office worker who dances, squirms, shudders, and screams through her daily routine. “This video makes the song better,” the band said in a press release. “We LOVE what this video is NOT—it's not literal, creepy, bloody, physically violent or obvious.” Watch it below, and stay tuned for Talking Heads' ongoing celebrations of the 50 years since their formation.

Mills, who previously directed the National's I Am Easy to Find short film, said Talking Heads' debut album, Talking Heads: 77, “literally changed what was possible in life for me.” He went on, “To get to play with the subversive, uncategorizable beauty of Talking Heads, and to play with Saoirse who brought so much surprise, power, vulnerability and mischief to the party, it's one of the best things I ever got to be a part of—still can't believe it actually happened.”

Ronan added, “To simply be mentioned in the same breath as Talking Heads is hands down one of the coolest things that has ever happened to me, let alone making a video with the singular Mike Mills to accompany one of their most iconic songs—‘Psycho Killer.' I have grown up listening to their music, so this truly is a childhood/teenage/lifelong dream come true. Mike, myself and the rest of the creative team had so much fun making this, and I can't wait for Talking Heads fans to see it!”

	Inside a cavernous, neon-lit ballroom in the bowels of a joyless Washington D.C. hotel, Carly Simon blasts from the speakers in an effort drown out the chants of “Free, Free Palestine” from protesters who've crashed a conversation with Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) — the gay, Black, self-described Zionist representing one of the most Democratic districts in the country. 


	Liam Kerr, co-founder of the centrist-supporting political action committee Welcome PAC — decked out in a West Virginia Mountaineers jersey with senator-turned-lobbyist Joe Manchin's name emblazoned across his back — bodies out a bespectacled, man-bunned individual trying to film the scuffle. It would have been a particularly crude piece of performance art depicting the Democratic Party in its present incarnation, but unfortunately, it was real.


	Organizers of WelcomeFest, an event billed as “the largest public gathering of centrist Democrats,” were expecting disruptions when they convened in D.C. on Thursday — you could even say they welcomed them. Earlier that day, as Kerr kicked off the festivities, he drew a contrast between his own apparel and a t-shirt he told the crowd organizers had on hand for any protesters who might show up. The tee featured a depiction of Babydog, the beloved bulldog belonging to Jim Justice, the West Virginia Republican who replaced Manchin in the U.S. Senate this year, and his slogan, “Delivering Justice for West Virginia.”

	











	“I am wearing a jersey of someone who stepped on the West Virginia campus 50 years ago on a football scholarship, who is the number one-rated ‘Wins Above Replacement' candidate,” Kerr told the crowd of his Manchin jersey. (Wins Above Replacement, or WAR, is a sports statistic that measures a certain player's contributions to their team. More on that later.)  The Justice t-shirt was meant to send a message to progressive-minded: If you're not with us, you're against us. Or, as Kerr put it even more bluntly, “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin.”

	Manchin's dark money group, Americans Together, was, incidentally, one of the sponsors of the event.


	Over the course of the afternoon, speakers at WelcomeFest offered their diagnosis for what ails the Democratic Party, which might be summed up as: too much democracy. Too many people making too many demands of their elected representatives. 


	Onstage, speakers used the shorthand “The Groups” when discussing this phenomenon. Speaker after speaker blamed “The Groups” for Democrats' failure to win elections and to govern effectively when they did win them. (Names of the specific Groups in question were rarely invoked on stage, but a recent New York Times op-ed by one of the day's speakers, Democratic operative Adam Jentleson, called out the American Civil Liberties Union, the Sunrise Movement, the Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats as some of the culprits responsible, in his view, for browbeating Democratic candidates into adopting positions in primaries that Republicans could weaponize against them in a general election.)


	The blogger Matthew Yglesias flogged this thesis most aggressively in his presentation. To illustrate his point that “Bad Groups create bad incentives for Democrats,” Yglesias pointed to Democrats' outspoken opposition to a Maryland man was illegally renditioned to a Central American supermax prison by accident — some even traveled to El Salvador to seek Kilmar Abrego Garcia's release and return to the U.S. 


	Besides this being the only moral position one can take on the question of whether the government should be allowed to extrajudicially seize individuals, ship them off to a foreign jail, and refuse to bring them back when ordered by the courts, Yglesias appears to be wrong about this being a politically dangerous position for Democrats to stake out: Media coverage of this case, kept alive by Democrats who continued to raise awareness about it, damaged Donald Trump's image, pollster G. Elliott Morris points out. Approval for Trump's immigration agenda nosedived during the height of the furor over Abrego Garcia's wrongful seizure.

	While speakers at WelcomeFest generally seemed to agree The Groups' influence was to blame for Democrats' failures, no one seemed to offer much in the way of a contrasting vision for what the party's orienting principle ought to be going forward. Abundance, the airport book that some Dems appear determined to adopt as a policy platform, got only brief attention at the WelcomeFest. Instead of a mission or any one overarching vision, there only seemed to be consensus on the fact that Democrats need to start winning again, by whatever means necessary. 

	











	The political analyst Lakshya Jain urged reorienting party recruitment efforts to focus on candidates with high “Wins Above Replacement” statistics. The concept will be familiar to anyone who has read Moneyball, Michael Lewis' book about how the Oakland A's used sabermetrics to identify and recruit undervalued players. Jain's model compares a generic match-up in a particular district with the actual results in an effort to evaluate who overperformed or underperformed expectations for their particular race. 


	To illustrate this point, Jain compared the results of progressive New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's race with that of Janelle Stelson, a candidate who ran in Pennsylvania's 10th district. In his model, AOC, who won her race and outperformed Kamala Harris by six points, underperformed a generic race in her district by two points; Stelson, who lost by one point and outran Harris by four points, overperformed a generic Democrat by nine points. 


	Jain's pitch was that, in the current political environment, which he says is D+6, Democrats have a real opportunity to seize legislative majorities if they focus their efforts on recruiting candidates with high WAR scores — the catch is that these candidates might be unpalatable to The Groups and other party faithful. 


	“Being very blunt, if we run candidates that D.C. finds appealing, we're probably going to lose. There is an inverse correlation between what you guys all find appealing and what the median voter finds appealing,” Jain told the room. 


	He brought up Blue Dog Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), who spoke on a panel with Yglesias and Reps. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) and Adam Gray (D-Calif.).


	“A lot of you may say you find some of Jared Golden's votes to be annoying for a Democrat,” Jain said. “Well, guess what? The choice isn't between Jared Golden and AOC. The choice is between Jared Golden and Paul LePage. So who would you rather have?”


	It was an echo of Kerr's opening remarks — “The choice is Jim Justice or Joe Manchin” — and it's a real question that gets at the heart of Democrats' present predicament. 


	Do Democrats — or Americans writ large — need more candidates in the mold of Joe Manchin, the man single-handedly responsible for torpedoing Democrats' expanded child tax credit, a program that had lifted 2.1 million children out of poverty?

	Unappealing as the choice is, there's also a high probability that it is a false binary too: Jain claimed in his presentation, “The base will vote for you anyway… Don't worry about liberal defections.” 

	











	But if the results of the 2024 election have indicated anything, it's that attitude — the attitude that was also adopted by the Harris campaign — is a losing one: We know that demoralized Democratic-leaning voters who stayed home decided the election.

EXCLUSIVE: Following one of the more unique auctions the industry has seen in some time, Amazon MGM Studios has landed a film and docuseries package on the legendary Isle of Man Tourist Trophy Race with two movie stars at the center of it. Sources tell Deadline that Channing Tatum is attached to star in the film about the motorcycle races, which will be directed by Dog director Reid Carolin, who also wrote the script with Jason Keller and Bryan Johnson.


	The film will be produced by Tatum and Carolin's Free Association, Pitt's Plan B, Keller and Entertainment 360's Guymon Casady. Insiders say once 360 landed the rights and began bringing it to each individual to bring this massive package together.

	











	The corresponding docuseries was filmed during last year's TT races with never-before-seen access to the riders and the races due to an exclusive partnership between the producers and the event promoters. The docuseries was produced by the same group, along with pre-eminent sports documentary producer Box to Box Films and Mediawan — the leading independent European studio and majority stakeholder of Plan B — with the participation of Entourage Ventures.

	Plot details remain vague, but the scope and history of the legendary race have all the notes of an epic feature film. Long before Formula 1, World Endurance and MotoGP, there was the Isle of Man TT. As the world's oldest continuously running motorsport event, it remains a one-of-a-kind spectacle. With riders pushing man and machine to the edge at nearly 200 mph, the TT represents the pinnacle of sporting endeavor and the relentless pursuit of glory.


	The never-before-seen docuseries is a 4×45-minute cinematic, character-driven series where riders chase their dreams and embrace life to its fullest. Through intimate moments, the series explore what drives these extreme riders to take such risks. The series looks into the consequences of this commitment, not only for them but for those around them. It is not just a thrilling adventure experienced through these extraordinary individuals but a deep dive into what sometimes drives us as human beings.

	











	For most of its century-long history, the Isle of Man TT was an event experienced only by dedicated motorbike enthusiasts who made the pilgrimage to the island or tuned in via radio. However, the 2022 launch of livestreaming through the TT's OTT platform, TT+, marked a new era, offering full coverage of every qualifying session and race. Combined with an enhanced social media strategy, this shift has spurred greater public interest, with online searches for the event doubling over the past two years.


	The film and docuseries represent key pillars in the development of a major franchise set to expand across a 360-degree strategy, building on the success of major IPs developed by the talented creators of the Mediawan group and embraced by audiences worldwide such as Call My Agent, The Count of Monte Cristo or Miraculous.


	While the projects were announced lat year along with the news of the docuseries going into production, the packaging of the two has been months in the making given the unique circumstances of bringing two separate things to market with such high-profile talents involved. One project involving a well known event and two stars like Tatum and Pitt could of easily sold somewhere on its own but all parties wanted to make sure whoever took on the package properly handled both projects leading to a thorough auction. In the end, Amazon MGM Studios proved to be the perfect fit given the global reach the studio could give to both the film and docuseries.


	Tatum and Carolin have had strong ties going back to when the two launched the Magic Mike franchise that Tatum starred in, Carolin penned and both produced. The film would mark the second film Carolin has directed following the hit MGM feature Dog, which Tatum also starred in and produced.


	As for Pitt and Plan B, seem to have a strong feel for racing films these days as the upcoming Warner Bros. and Apple pic F1 bows later this month. Pitt stars in the pic which is already earning strong buzz as it is set around the iconic sport.


	Tatum, Carolin and Free Association are represented by CAA, Hansen Jacobson and Relevant. Brad Pitt and Plan B are represented by CAA and Pitt is represented by Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Box To Box Films is repped by CAA. Keller is represented by Entertainment 360.

EXCLUSIVE: Following the award-winning run of his documentary Will & Harper, and with a new Spaceballs movie next on the docket for production, Josh Greenbaum has been tapped to direct a new Care Bears film for Warner Bros. Pictures.


	Good Fear's Chris Bender and Jake Weiner will produce alongside GoldDay's Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley. Sean Gorman and Daniel Barnes from rightsholder Cloudco will exec produce, with Sheila Walcott overseeing for Warner Bros. The project doesn't yet have a writer, so it's early days here. Asking for plot details will get you the Care Bear Stare…

	











Care Bears has an interesting origin story, as the franchise was built around greeting card characters popularized in the 1980s by American Greetings (now Cloudco Entertainment). Each bear had a distinct color and “belly badge” that symbolized their personality and duty — with names like Tenderheart Bear, Cheer Bear, and Grumpy Bear — the idea being to personify different emotions and positive traits to help children express their feelings and foster empathy.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The popularity of the cards led to the creation of a toy line, which then spurred animated TV specials and, eventually, a TV series. The original Care Bears cartoon aired from 1985 to 1988 and was followed by three theatrical films spanning the mid-to-late 1980s. Over the decades, the franchise has undergone several revivals. New iterations of the Care Bears TV series were released in the 2000s, 2010s, and most recently with Care Bears: Unlock the Magic, which launched in 2019.


	With $470 million in global retail sales in 2024 and over $10 billion in lifetime retail, the Care Bears franchise remains a global commercial powerhouse.


	Premiering at Sundance, Greenbaum's Netflix road trip doc Will & Harper examines Will Ferrell's decades-long friendship with former SNL colleague Harper Steele and how it changes, or doesn't change, after she comes out as a transgender woman. The film won a Peabody and a Critics' Choice Documentary Award for Best Documentary Feature, in addition to being nominated for a BAFTA. Currently, the director is in post on pickleball comedy The Dink, starring Ben Stiller and Jake Johnson. Next set to helm the new Spaceballs for Amazon MGM, his other credits include Universal's Strays, cult hit comedy Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, and the Hulu Original documentary Too Funny to Fail about The Dana Carvey Show. The filmmaker is repped by UTA, Entertainment 360, and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols. 

	











	Daley and Goldstein are repped by CAA, Fourth Wall Management, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller; Bender and Weiner by Rick Genow & Allison Binder.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: Nick Jonas is near closed on a deal to star as KISS lead singer Paul Stanley in Shout It Out Loud, the McG-directed film about the formation of the venerable hard rock band in the 1970s. The film will go into production at the end of the year or in early 2026, with STX fully financing. The most recent draft is by Darren Lemke.


	I'm told that Jonas will do his own singing, and he'll need time to train to replicate the jet-engine vocals of Stanley. Besides headlining in the sibling band The Jonas Brothers, Jonas has also proven his chops onscreen. His rise began with the 2016 toxic masculinity hazing drama Goat. He shone in the MMA series Kingdom, as a young gay man who grows up in a family of fighters and has to hide his sexuality from a domineering father.

	











	Jonas grew up on the Broadway stage in numerous musicals, including starring turns in Les Miserables, Hairspray and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and he played singer Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys Live. His screen credits also include Jumanji and The Good Half, and he will co-star opposite Paul Rudd in the John Carney-directed Power Ballad for Lionsgate.  




			Watch on Deadline		







Shout it Out Loud focuses on the formation of the ‘70s glitter rock band. Stanley hardly fit the persona of a sex symbol front man as he was growing up. “I was deaf in one ear and had a slight deformity that made me look different,” Stanley once said. “I was this short, fat kid, and music became my salvation, a place to hide and dream. And when I played music, there were always girls around.”


	McG is zeroing in on a star to play Gene Simmons, the fire-breathing, blood-dripping, growly voiced bass player who formed the band with Stanley. His compulsion to take a rock and roll path also had a lot to do with girls.


	Simmons was a Hasidic Orthodox Jew from Israel who found a new faith one fateful day while exiting the yeshiva. “I remember walking out onto the street, seeing this Spanish girl jumping rope across the street, and staring at her long black hair slapping against this great butt,” he once said. “It occurred to me this was better than religion. How could I get near that?”

	











	They teamed with lead guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss, and then made themselves stand out by playing in face makeup with each adopting different personalities. Their enduring success was fueled by a steady array of power rock anthems including “Rock and Roll All Nite.” They beat the odds to become one of the most commercially successful bands in rock history. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.


	The project has been percolating for years, developed by Mark Canton, Simmons, Stanley and Doc McGhee alongside Jody Gerson for Universal Music Publishing Group and Polygram Entertainment, and Bruce Resnikoff of Universal Music Group/Ume, who control and rep the band's song publishing and recorded music rights globally, and Polygram's David Blackman. Canton, Simmons, Stanley, McGhee, Gerson and Blackman will be producers or executive producers, joined by Leigh Ann Burton. Also producing are McG and his Wonderland producing partner Mary Viola, as well as David Hopwood, Courtney Solomon and Dorothy Canton, and Swedish-based Pophouse, which acquired global rights to the KISS brand. Christa Campbell and Annie Herndon are overseeing for STX.


	McG most recently wrapped Way of the Warrior Kid, an adaptation of the Jocko Willink novel that stars Chris Pratt and Linda Cardellini for Apple TV+.


	Jonas is repped by UTA and Schreck Rose.

The new legal salvo, which argues that the song's references to prostitution describe the rapper's views on women, comes amid a backlash to citing rap lyrics in court cases.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Locked in a legal war with Jay-Z, attorney Tony Buzbee is now quoting the star's lyrics from “Big Pimpin” in his latest court filings, claiming they describe the rapper's views on “how men should treat women.”


	Jay-Z (Shawn Carter) and Buzbee have been battling for months after the Texas lawyer filed shocking rape allegations against him last year. Those claims, which the star denied, were quickly dropped – and now Jay is suing the attorney for defamation and extortion across two different court cases.

	Seeking to dismiss one of them, Buzbee took an unusual step Wednesday: directly quoting from decades-old lyrics in his legal filings. The song, the 2000 smash hit “Big Pimpin',” includes crass references to prostitution – which Buzbee suggests contradicts Jay-Z's claims to a stellar reputation.

	“Carter's latest pleading bemoans what he describes as the ‘incredibly painful' event of explaining [the rape] allegations to ‘his wife' and ‘their children,'” Buzbee writes. “To put those allegations in their proper context, it is helpful to view them alongside the following lyrics from one of Carter's most successful songs, which became famous nationwide around the time [the accuser] claims her sexual assault occurred.”


	The filing included four lines from the opening verse of “Big Pimpin',” including: “You know I thug ‘em, f*ck ‘em, love ‘em, leave ‘em ‘cause I don't f*ckin' need ‘em /  Take ‘em out the hood, keep ‘em lookin' good but I don't f*ckin' feed ‘em.”


	“Released more than 25 years ago, this song of Carter's, like many of the others that made him famous, contains lyric after lyric describing Carter's views on the loss of innocence and how men should treat women,” Buzbee writes in the filing.


	Jay-Z himself has previously expressed regret about the lyrics to “Big Pimpin',” which reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 and spent 20 weeks on the chart in 2000. In a 2010 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he said that re-reading the song's words was “really harsh.”


	“Some [lyrics] become really profound when you see them in writing. Not ‘Big Pimpin'. That's the exception,” Jay-Z said at the time. “It was like, I can't believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?”


	The use of rap lyrics in court cases has become increasingly controversial in recent years, as critics argue that statements made in hip hop songs are unfairly treated more literally than other song lyrics. Efforts have been made to ban rap from criminal cases, and a group of law scholars recently warned that Drake's civil lawsuit – claiming the lyrics to Kendrick Lamar's “Not Like Us” defamed him – is “dangerous” and could have a “chilling effect” on future artists.


	The case against Jay-Z, filed in December, claimed that he and Sean “Diddy” Combs raped a 13-year-old Jane Doe at an after-party following the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z forcefully denied the allegations, calling them a “blackmail attempt” by Buzbee and his client. And after just two months of heated litigation, the accuser dropped her case without a settlement payment.


	Weeks after the case was dropped, Jay-Z sued both Doe and Buzbee in Alabama, accusing her of defamation and accusing both of malicious prosecution and other wrongdoing. That case followed an earlier lawsuit in California in which the star accused Buzbee of extortion and defamation.


	In Wednesday's filing, the Texas lawyer asked a federal judge to dismiss the Alabama case, calling it a “clear attempt by Carter to punish his accuser and silence potential accusers.” And he cited the “Big Pimpin'” lyrics, using them to suggest that Jay-Z was being hypocritical when he said he “mourns his children's loss of innocence.”


	A rep for Jay-Z did not immediately return a request for comment on the new filing. In a statement to Billboard on Thursday, Buzbee said: “Mr. Carter's lawyers have spent millions of dollars aggressively trying to cast me as a villain and unethical person with blatant lies and half truths. At the same time they've vainly attempted to portray Mr. Carter as a bastion of virtue. Look at my background and compare it to his. I'm a Marine Corps Captain who served my country in the infantry and recon during two conflicts. Enough said.”


	Jay-Z's California case against Buzbee also remains pending. As reported by Rolling Stone, the judge hinted in February that he might dismiss Jay-Z's extortion claims while allowing the defamation claim against Buzbee to move ahead. Following new evidence about recorded conversations and a heated April hearing, the judge is still currently mulling whether and how the case should proceed.

Chad Stahelski still can't believe that a fifth “John Wick” film is in the works. Or is it? While Stahelski and co-writer Mike Finch have developed a story for “John Wick 5,” the franchise director is skeptical of whether or not the film will actually get made. In fact, he hasn't even brought the concept to lead star Keanu Reeves yet — despite Lionsgate announcing in April 2025 that Reeves would be back in the role. 

“John Wick 5” was first confirmed in 2020 and later officially announced in 2025. Reeves' titular character seemingly died in the fourth film; however, the Lionsgate release declared that Wick lives and will return for the fifth installment.

Stahelski now told THR that he is unsure if a possible fifth film could even be “satisfying” to make. “Me and Mike Finch — the writer on ‘4' who's also writing ‘5' — we've got a pretty good story that I think is cool. Once we have a 50-page book, and if we're feeling it, we'll sit with Keanu and shape this thing. Look, everybody seems to want it. It's a matter of whether we crack it. We're actively working on it. It's just … is it going to be satisfying?” he said.

When asked by THR why there is a continuation of the franchise with Reeves even after the fourth film “ended so well,” Stahelski said, “I'm with you, man. Keanu and I have discussed this many times and feel the same way. We finished ‘3' and thought that was going to be the last one.” 

He continued, “Look, we never expected to end ‘John Wick.' I just hate cheesy endings. I hate happy endings. Over a long enough timeline, everything's a fucking tragedy. If you kill 86 people, you don't get away. So when we got to ‘4,' we wanted to have something that had a lot of fate and consequence. The ending was going to be a cliffhanger. Then we were sitting in Japan [during the filming of ‘4'] going, ‘We didn't stick the landing.' [Our original ending] kind of sucked. ‘Fuck, we got to finish this, right?' So I was really happy with the way ‘4' ended. It was Keanu and I saying, ‘Thank you, it's been awesome, but it is time to go.' I didn't want to overstay our welcome.” 

Stahelski added, “If we go down the road of ‘John Wick 5' and build this story and decide this isn't right, there are probably going to be 10 other things we'll discover that we'll use for other things. It's a great creative exercise. It's being in the room riffing with people we love. That's nothing but wins.” 

 










However, Stahelski's vision for the process of potentially making the film might be at odds with what Lionsgate wants. “The studio would very much will it into existence, I'm sure, at some point,” he said. “Look, they've been great and they've asked us to really try and we have a really good couple of ideas and we're going to try.” 

Reeves in the meantime will be appearing in spinoff film “Ballerina.”

					By Matthew Carey 

Documentary Editor, Awards


EXCLUSIVE: Author Jack Kerouac set an ambitious task for himself when he pondered writing On the Road, his 1957 masterpiece that still reverberates in the American imagination.


	“My purpose is to conquer knowledge of the U.S.A.,” he wrote, “to know it as I know the palm of my hand.”


	Those words, immodest, carried away with possibility and essentially romantic, are articulated in the new documentary Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation, which makes its premiere this evening at Tribeca Festival in New York. Actor Michael Imperioli voices Kerouac's writings in the film directed by Ebs Burnough and produced by Burnough, Eliza Hindmarch, and John Battsek. Watch an excerpt from Kerouac's Road in the exclusive clip above.

	The documentary interweaves “stories of modern-day travelers with insights from those influenced by or connected to the legendary author,” Tribeca's Jarod Neece writes in the festival program. “The film retraces Kerouac's restless journey across America while exploring how his emphasis on experience over material success, as well as authentic connection over digital convenience, speaks powerfully to our screen-saturated era.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Burnough and team not only enlisted Imperioli but other prominent artists and admirers of Kerouac's novel, including actors Josh Brolin and Matt Dillon, cultural commentator W. Kamau Bell, singer-songwriter Natalie Merchant, and writer Jay McInerney.


	“I am a huge fan of Michael Imperioli, his work speaks for itself, but he digs deep, and it comes through in the work,” Burnough tells Deadline. “He is also a scholar and his knowledge of Kerouac, and his work is incredibly robust, and he is honest about how Kerouac has impacted him.”

	











	Regarding Dillon's participation in the film, Burnough describes the actor as “the consummate artist. He is everything I think Kerouac would have wanted to be had he not had such a complicated life and early death. Matt is a director, actor, writer, and a painter. And he too is honest about the book's impact on him. I owe meeting Matt to my eldest son Bernie! We were having dinner and I said, ‘Matt Dillon really loves On the Road and he voiced the audio book and I have got to find him.' And Bernie (perhaps my most reserved child) said ‘I know him, should I introduce you?' LOL. That made Matt's involvement all the sweeter.”


	“Truly, it was incredible to work with all of our incredible cast,” comments producer John Battsek, “and hear the way that Kerouac's work has touched or influenced their lives in so many ways.”


On the Road has sold millions of copies since it was published in 1957. Readers have been captivated by its syncopated prose, and its imperative to explore – both an outward journey to the wide open spaces of America, and a journey within of self-discovery.


	“America is a vast country, ‘from sea to shining sea' we are BIG, and there are around 340 million Americans in this varied geography; and yet hide as we might, or run as we might, we are all connected,” Burnough observes. “In the tangible sense, we're connected by the incredible highway system that links grandma to grandson or friend to friend; but it's the connection that we long for. It's the feeling of getting out of where you are, the ability to hit the road and find yourself and at the same time know that you are not alone. Americans in particular hold a sense of independence, a drive that says if I hit the road the future is in front of me and whatever I am leaving is behind me. Keep pushing forward towards the unknown, but we know it is great inspire of not knowing exactly what it is. 


	“But I must say, it is not only an American impulse. Our landscape lends itself to getting on the road; but the concept is global. And that is where Kerouac truly understood human nature. In England and India and Africa and Asia, the roads may be different, the topography transformed, but the idea of finding YOUR place, the idea of traveling YOUR road of discovering your voice and your place in the world is as resonant as it is in America. We are all on our own individual journey and Kerouac gives us his manual which we are allowed to update (thank goodness) and alter as we see fit.”


	Notes Battsek, “I was struck by the fact that even though the book was written over half a century ago, its themes of freedom, self-discovery, and rebellion still resonate in today's world. In many ways the book is timeless because it captures the raw, restless energy of youth. I was struck by how Jack struggled so quickly with the success he received from the book and so it felt he wasn't really able to enjoy his success.”


	Kerouac, forever associated with the Beat Generation (he coined the term), published several books after On the Road, none of them approaching the acclaim of that novel. He died of alcoholism in 1969 at the age of 47. Kerouac was born in Lowell, MA to a family of French-Canadian descent (there is some dispute about his birth name, but he said it was Jean-Louis Lebris de Kérouac). He attended Columbia University in New York before serving in the Merchant Marine during World War II.

	











	“New York was such a significant part of Jack's story, and it feels fitting that we're able premiere the film here. It's going to be a really special screening,” Battsek comments. “I hope that the film surprises audiences and shows that Kerouac's passionate and poetic quest for understanding is still relevant in our world.”


	Commenting on the film's implicit themes, Burnough observes, “What binds us together is stronger than what divides us. The road, the physical road that we travel is connective tissue (not the only one) but our system of grids and stop lights and highways brings us together, regardless of gender or race or politics. We all travel it one way or another. And it forces us to bump into one another and see each other as we are finding ourselves. We can travel these roads on our own or with friends and family, but we are all on them together. And whether you're American or African or Asian or European, it's all also a metaphor for the path we're on in our individual lives. I hope this film reminds people that we're all in this thing called life together!”


	In addition to tonight's world premiere, Kerouac's Road: The Beat of a Nation screens on Friday evening and Sunday morning.


	“This is the second film I have ever directed,” Burnough tells Deadline. “To be at Tribeca is a dream come true. To be premiering this in New York is a dream come true. I keep thinking to myself that I hope Jack would think this is pretty cool. But I am also very nervous! Actually, scared is probably a better word, just because we've worked on this for a long time and now it's time to present it to the world and that is scary.”

Premiering on Hulu, the film pits a Viking, a ninja and a World War II pilot against the titular adversary.


							By 

	Frank Scheck



	A Viking warrior, a Japanese ninja and a Hispanic World War II fighter pilot walk into a bar…


	It's not the beginning of a bad joke, but rather the unlikely connective tissue in the new animated Predator movie directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who has undeniably given the franchise new creative life. Premiering on Hulu domestically, Predator: Killer of Killers serves as a fan-pleasing amuse-bouche between the last film in the series, 2022's critically acclaimed Prey (also directed by Trachtenberg), and the upcoming Predator: Badlands, opening in theaters this November.

The Bottom Line

	
	A satisfying dip into the Predator-Verse.
	



Release date: Friday, June 5Cast: Lindsay LaVanchy, Louis Ozawa, Rick Gonzalez, Michael BiehnDirector: Dan TrachtenbergCo-director: Joss WassungScreenwriter: Micho Robert Rutare

									Rated R,
								1 hour 30 minutes			






	This anthology-style entry, divided into three chapters plus a final segment that ties up the stories in highly imaginative fashion, reveals the versatility of the franchise. Like the video games, it shows that the alien killers are just as fearsome in animated form. And with its time-hopping storylines — taking place in the first, 17th, and 20th centuries, respectively — it demonstrates that the Predators can effectively be plunked into any era. The crossover possibilities seem endless — get ready for “Predator vs. the Karate Kid.”

	The storylines are not exactly complex. In the first, entitled “The Shield,” a middle-aged female warrior — “You look like a Viking washerwoman,” one of her enemies sneers — seeks brutal revenge on those who wronged her, only to have her mission disrupted by the arrival of a Predator. In the ensuing violent confrontation, her son is killed.

	











	“The Sword,” taking place in feudal Japan, focuses on the fierce rivalry between two brothers that becomes a fight to the death after their father's demise. When a Predator shows up, they overcome their hostility to join forces against it.


	And in “The Bullet,” set in 1941, a young pilot figures out that the alien vessel threatening his fellow flyers is not the enemy they think it is. “Fellows, don't engage with whatever that is,” he implores them, to no avail. After his aircraft takes a hit, he manages to repair the wing while still in mid-air like an animated Tom Cruise and later channels Harrison Ford when he tells one of the creatures, “Get off my plane!”


	So far, so simplistic. But screenwriter Micho Robert Rutare, working from a story devised with Trachtenberg, ties things together in an extremely clever, satisfying manner that won't be disclosed here but that makes the film more than the sum of its parts.


	More to the point, Predator: Killer of Killers provides the non-stop action that the diehard fans crave. And no concession has been made to the animated format; the film easily earns its R rating with copious amounts of gruesome violence and bloody gore that should well sate viewers' bloodthirsty tendencies. The animation takes a bit of getting used to, with its exaggerated, video game-style visuals, but it serves the material well. 


	The voice cast features Michael Biehn, providing him the impressive genre trifecta of having appeared in Alien, Terminator and Predator films. And there are plenty of Easter eggs in the form of callbacks to previous films, as well as hints about future installments, that should generate the desired social media chatter.

Nearly forty years since its initial release, “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” still gets quite a bit of play. Turn your television on during most hours of the day, and the Matthew Broderick-starring comedy is likely to be on. So when the John Hughes classic popped up last week, just a few days before IndieWire's scheduled interview with star Mia Sara, this writer took some time to catch up on an enduring favorite.

As Sloane Peterson, Sara — just 18 at the time of production, basically still a high schooler herself — is both an iconic cool girl (you'd have to be, to be Ferris‘ girlfriend) and the rare teenager with a real regard for the weight of life itself. If Ferris is the Id of the story, Sloane is the Ego. She's not just along for the ride, she's also the one giving actual thought to the deeper stuff that's unfolding around Ferris' wacky high-jinks. When Cameron (Alan Ruck) is flipping? It's Sloane who grounds him, who steadies him.

Not that Sloane doesn't have her fun, too. Consider one of my favorite scenes of the film, one of the rare moments in which we see Sloane without Ferris or Cameron, and one wholly emblematic of Sara's incredible range and impeccable timing. She's sitting in her classroom, bored out of her skull, waiting for Ferris to break her out. When the school nurse finally appears, Sara engages in a wonderful bit of business: waking up, packing up her stuff, smiling knowingly at a pal, and then delightfully pretending to be surprised that she's the one being taken out of class. It's a small moment, but it says a lot.

 










It's also the kind of moment we've missed over the last decade or so, as Sara took a break from acting after starring in a wide range of projects, from the early Tom Cruise fantasy “Legend” and the Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi joint “Timecop” to later offerings like the first “Birds of Prey” TV series and the “Witches of Oz” miniseries. For her first on-screen credit in over a decade, Sara co-stars in Mike Flanagan's deep-feeling Stephen King adaptation, “The Life of Chuck.”

Told in three chapters, Flanagan's film follows, well, the life of Chuck. Sort of? Told backwards, the film ostensibly guides us through the painful and rewarding life of everyman Chuck Krantz (played by Tom Hiddleston, Jacob Tremblay, and Benjamin Pajak at different points in the film). A big part of Chuck's joy and identity comes from his grandmother, Sarah (Sara), who shows him much-needed affection after tragedy and teaches him how to dance. Sara is lovely in the role, again offering the kind of grace and steadiness she mastered way back when with “Ferris Bueller.”

So, of course, the million dollar question: Why this project? Why now? And how can we make sure we're not waiting so long again for another Sara performance?

“It's Mike,” Sara told IndieWire during a recent interview. “Mike Flanagan is a beautiful man and he's a friend. My husband and I had met him socially and his stunning wife, Kate Siegel, who I think is a genius. We became friends and Mike said [one day], ‘You know what? Come on. Why don't you want to act anymore?' And I had lots of reasons, but then he said, ‘Well, what if I asked you to do something?' And I said, ‘Oh, come on, Mike, for you, I'd do anything.' He called my bluff.”

 










Bluff called, Sara said she still approached the project with some nerves, most of them sprung out of being a fan of Flanagan's large body of work, from other King adaptations like “Doctor Sleep” and “Gerald's Game” to his popular Netflix series like “The Haunting of Hill House” and “Midnight Mass.”

“My whole family, we're such Mike Flanagan fans, so it's very daunting that I'm a part of this,” she said. “Because I'm actually, aside from being his friend, I am a huge fan, which I'm not really of many people. So it was an incredible experience.”

Family was also top of mind when Flanagan pitched the film, based on the early King novella of the same name, to Sara. That sort of stuff sticks with the actress, who had her first child (son Dashiell Quinn Connery) in 1997, followed by her daughter Amelia with second husband Brian Henson in 2005.

“When Mike spoke to us about why he wanted to do it, he said, ‘This is what I want to make for my kids,'” the actress said. “Mike is a wonderful father, and I have kids, and we talked about that and what we want the world to be like for our kids. Then when he sent [the script] to me, I couldn't stop crying and I called him through tears and said, ‘Are you kidding? You really want me to do this? Yes, of course. Absolutely.'”

 










The time-bending and -twisting nature of the script didn't surprise Sara, but she was struck by how much the structure reflected the emotion and meaning of the story.

“Mike had explained it to me, and it lends itself to the whole theme, which is that our whole life, we all contain so many different stories and lives,” Sara said. “Yes, we're born, we live our lives, and then we die, but it doesn't really feel that way to live. We're always going back and forth and back and forth in our lives and memories and experience.”

Funnily enough, the film isn't Sara's first Stephen King joint. In 2006, she appeared in the first episode of the miniseries “Nightmares & Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King.” She's simply credited as “Beautiful Passenger.” What does she remember of that experience? Not too much, even as she delighted in the new connection.

“I was the lady on the plane!,” she said with a laugh. “I was on the plane, and I was married to the director, so I don't know if it counts. But that's right actually. You know what? I did that. But you're right. I never actually made that connection.” (Yes, Henson directed the episode, one of many collaborations the couple have enjoyed over the years.)

A couple of years before, during another interesting period in her career, Sara starred as Harley Quinn on The WB's short-lived “Birds of Prey” series, long before synergistic superhero mania overtook Hollywood. It's one of her last big credits, and one that she recalls extremely fondly. 

 










“I loved doing that so much. I loved it, I really did,” Sara said. “That was pretty much the last thing I did, and it wasn't because it was a bad experience, it was a great experience and I loved that part. If I could play parts like that for the rest of time, that would be awesome. But it also was right as Brian and I decided to have our daughter, so things happened and I got a kind of different life and it was really great and that was it. I felt like I started acting really young and I was ready to take a break.”

Did she happen to see the “Birds of Prey” film in 2020? No, but I assured her there's still time to catch up.

“No, I didn't see it. I wanted to see it. I didn't. I should have seen it,” she said. “I love Margot Robbie. It wasn't because I didn't want to see, I mean, I love Margot Robbie and I would've seen it, but honestly, I spend a lot of time with my horse. That's one of the things I've been doing!”

When Sara stopped acting, she had plenty going on: a new baby, her horse, and a burgeoning career as a poet. But that doesn't mean she didn't like acting anymore, just that — as she wisely noted — she'd been doing it since she was a kid, and maybe it was time to try some other stuff. 

“I started working when I was 14 years old, and from going from always being the youngest person on set and then taking this huge long break and then coming back? It's wonderful to be older,” she said. “I mean, there are some things that are kind of a bummer, but it's great.”

 










In “The Life of Chuck,” Sara spends most of her time with Pajak, who was twelve at the time he filmed the role of “young Chuck.” Sara cannot say enough good things about her young co-star.

“I got in the night before I started rehearsals, and I went to this rehearsal room and there was Benjamin and Mandy Moore, the choreographer,” Sara said. “And Benjamin, I have to tell you, he's a very talented actor. But that light that you see in him, that intelligence, that spirit, that's him. He's an amazing kid. He literally went up to me and he threw himself in my arms and I was like, ‘This kid's wow. This is great.' We had so much fun. He is such a lovely, lovely person. It was a very nice, it felt like a really beautiful cycle for me to be there.”

As a former child actor, did Sara have any advice for the rising star? She laughed. “I don't know, Benjamin's very curious and he asked me all kinds of questions and I tried to answer them, but I don't know if he needs any of my advice,” Sara said. “He's an extraordinary kid. He's so lovely. So it was an absolute joy to work with him.”

Sara also shares the screen with another legend: Mark Hamill, who plays Sarah's husband and Chuck's grandfather Albie. In a film flush with emotions and reveals, it's Hamill, nearly unrecognizable, who carries much of it.

 










“Mark Hamill is the coolest guy. He's just a gorgeous human being. He really is. He was such a delight. I think we just liked each other,” Sara said. “We have friends in common. There's certain history with my husband, Brian Henson, and with Jim Henson's Creature Shop and all that. So we had people that we could talk about.”

Hamill, of course, has a long history with the Hensons, Frank Oz, the Creature Shop, and the Muppets, spanning everything from “Star Wars” to “The Dark Crystal” and back again. And while Sara and Hamill technically both appeared in “Birds of Prey,” they never shared the screen. “The Life of Chuck” granted that wish.

“He is really a lovely human being, and so it was an instant chemistry. Really, by the end we were like, ‘Oh, is that all?' We wanted to do more together,” Sara said. “And come on, I'm a child of the '70s, I get to be married to Mark Hamill, how can I top that?”

So, OK, I had to ask, does she still get recognized for “Ferris Bueller”? “Not anymore,” she said with a little laugh. “I used to. It was always like people would think they went to school with me. They'd say, ‘Wait, don't I know you?' Like, ‘No, no.'”

And, yes, I had to ask one more: that scene, my favorite little scene, with Sloane in the classroom, does she remember that one at all? 

 










“I remember that scene! I don't remember what I was thinking, but I do remember doing that scene, absolutely,” the actress said. “That was so interesting, because I went to a really small school, so it was kind of cool for me. I was not that far from high school, maybe the youngest of that main cast. For me it was like, ‘Wow, is this what a lot of high schools are really like?'”

She added with a laugh, “‘Oh, there's a lot of people in this room.' I went to a really small school.”

Now that she's on the other side of her return to the big screen, Sara doesn't seem quick to shake it. There's so much to take away from the film, about the way life works, the people we meet, the choices we make, the path taken and not taken. It's the kind of thing that sticks with you, the kind of thing that was worth the wait. 

“What I take from it is that every person we meet, every person has all of these things inside of them, and every person we meet, we affect that person and they affect us,” Sara said. “We're not always going to recognize that in the moment, but it does make you realize that we have a choice. In every interaction we have, we have a choice. We can be a benefactor or we can be a detractor. We can smile at that person who we pass on the street or we won't notice them. Each and every one of us is going through that. We all are holding all of that all the time. It's wild all that we have going on in ourselves. If we can recognize that, if I can recognize that in you, if you can recognize that in me, all the stories, all the people, all the connections, all the missed connections, that's so cool.”

 










The big question: how long will we have to wait for another Sara screen performance? Look to Flanagan, who probably won't need to call any bluffs for the time being. “If Mike ever needed me, I would be there,” she said. “I would be happy to be a Mike Flanagan person, that's it.”

Neon will release “The Life of Chuck” in theaters on Friday, June 6.

Willem Dafoe is deepening his hold on the modern thriller: The acclaimed actor is putting his talents to the adaptation of Walter Mosley's novel “The Man in My Basement” alongside “The Color Purple” standout Corey Hawkins. Dafoe stars as Hawkins' unexpected summer tenant who has ill intentions…

The logline reads: “Down on his luck, Charles Blakey (Hawkins) agrees to rent his basement to a mysterious stranger (Dafoe), unaware he may be letting in a force much darker than he imagined.” The film is set in 1994 Sag Harbor, New York, with Charles on the verge of losing his ancestral home to foreclosure. Anna Diop co-stars.

Nadia Latif makes her feature directorial debut with “The Man in My Basement.” She opted to have the film take place a decade before the novel is set (in the early 2000s) to coincide with the backdrop of the Rwandan genocide during the Rwandan Civil War of the '90s. Latif teased to EW that the timeline shift was necessary for a meditation on “who gets to tell whose history,” with a “darker, scarier, and more baroque” tone than the source material. 

 










“I haven't stopped thinking about the novel since I first read it 20 years ago,” Latif said. “It's such a dark, twisted, and wickedly funny journey into the heart of evil.”

Hawkins also told EW that the film “asks each of us to sit in the uncomfortable. We're exploring mental health, trauma, exploitation, and yes, the nature of evil, but we're also dealing with legacy, lineage, home, and love. A script centered on blackness in middle-class Sag Harbor in the '90s is loaded with cultural significance. I love that Nadia honored all of that and was willing to deconstruct the script with us, interrogate it, and put it back together — all of the ugly, all of the beauty. She took the essence of Mosley's novel and distilled it into something very unique.” 

Hawkins, whose role in “The Man in My Basement” was originally to be played by Jonathan Majors before Hulu parted ways with the actor, previously told IndieWire that he was brought in to replace Majors a few months after he exited the film. “It's an incredible look at a Black man who is experiencing trauma, but also legacy and family and curiosity,” he said of the feature. “I don't think we've seen a story like this. It gave me an opportunity as an actor to go deeper than I've ever gone before. To bounce off of somebody like Willem Dafoe day after day after day, it was just like two bulls in the ring. It's a gift.”

 










“The Man in My Basement” will premiere later this year in theaters and on Hulu. Check out the teaser below.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains some spoilers for the Season 1 finale of “MobLand.”]

Having just completed five movies and Guy Ritchie's Shakespearean gangster series “MobLand,” Pierce Brosnan is kicking up his heels in Kauai. It's the day after the airing of the Paramount+'s series bloody first season finale. He's tired, but happy to declaim on a show that he and his wife Keely Shaye Smith enjoyed watching every week as it unfurled, commercials and all. “It is a toxic mess of pure mayhem and great shenanigans,” said Brosnan on Zoom.

 










Brosnan was the first in, after Ritchie sent him five scripts by showrunner Ronan Bennett. At first, Brosnan figured he was going for a North or South London accent: that's where Conrad Harrigan bases his crime family. But Ritchie had other plans, said Brosnan: “In his shoot-from-the-hip style, with great bravado, he said, ‘Go Irish. Don't worry about it. We'll sort it out on the day. Put it out of your mind.'”

Of course, Brosnan did work on the text; then revisions arrived from the pen of Jez Butterworth (“Edge of Tomorrow”). “The writing became even more lyrical and nuanced,” said Brosnan. “I was working with Helen [Mirren] last summer on ‘Thursday Murder Club.' She came up to me one day said, ‘OK, I'm in. If you're doing it, I'm doing it.' And we set sail. Right before shooting, she showed me photographs of herself, how she wanted to play the character, Lady Macbeth, that emblem is there. You take a Jacobean tragedy, any of those desperate pieces of writing. And then she called me up, and she said, ‘I hear you're doing an Irish accent.' She was doing Irish on ‘1923.' Helen is very, very nimble on her feet, and she jumped in. We both flew together.”

 










We've seen Brosnan carry many movies with iconic characters over the years, from James Bond to Thomas Crown, but the older, wiser actor is unfettered and unleashed as he plays a powerful London kingpin who is used to getting his way. He's truly dangerous, capable of doing anything, a Mad King George. 

His wife Maeve (Dame Helen Mirren) is equally unhinged. Conrad's second son Kevin (Paddy Considine) runs the operation with fixer Harry Da Souza (Tom Hardy). Where Conrad and Maeve are volatile powder kegs ready to ignite a mob war, Kevin and Harry are more contained, tasked to keep operations running. “It was palpable on day one,” said Brosnan. “I spoke to Ritchie last summer. Five weeks later, I show up on the set first day. We don't have read-throughs. We had one rehearsal of the scene. It's my first day. Tom Hardy, myself, and Guy said, ‘more Irish.'”

Brosnan wound up deploying a Kerry accent inspired by the father he never knew. “Guy just said, ‘Go mad. Got it?' That was it,” he said. “And we took off from there, and everyone jumped in. It was the most incredible ensemble. Everyone knew what they wanted to do. Everyone was given free rein to just play, and we all knew each other's style. Helen and I had worked together. Tom is one of those great charismatic presences on screen. We never discussed the parts. And I thought, ‘Fuck it. If you're going to start working like this, then I'm free. I'm free. I can do anything I wish to do, whatever comes out of my mouth.'”

There's no question the heightened intensity created a charged atmosphere on set. For Brosnan and Mirren, “both of us, there is a theatricality,” said Brosnan. “There is an operatic tone to the performances. They are grandiose, they are flamboyant. They are mangled, bottled spiders of venom with humor and cutting, biting Irish lyricism. And the writing, I was supported by the great words of Jez Butterworth, who captures the Irish heartbeat of discontent and caustic hearts.”

 










As the cast and crew knocked off the episodes, Butterworth was running behind, supplying new scripts for the final episodes at the last minute. “It was like a carpet that unfurled before me each and every week,” said Brosnan. “There were surprises. And you put your heart, your soul, your passion, your drive, the sheer alchemy of these great actors that you were surrounded by. And it was extremely liberating. Suddenly people were dying, and suddenly I'm losing my son. He's getting his head lopped off. Hence, you're in a nest of vipers.”

One of the vipers is Mirren's Maeve, Conrad's wife. “She is beyond words,” said Brosnan. “She's Lady Macbeth, Phaedra. She's poisoned. She is the ultimate bottled spider. Conrad knows, and he loves her. They love each other. They're joined as these rogue genes from an early age, who challenge each other, love each other, and drive each other on. But there is a deep fracture of psychological damage to all of these characters. They're all not well. They're from abused backgrounds. They all come from a gene pool of bad blood and that's the joy of it. And, Conrad is a pig farmer. He was a car thief. He's done time. He's hurt people. He's a monster, but he has humanity to him as well.”

At the end of the series, Conrad is in Reading Gaol, behind glass with a phone as he meets his son Kevin (Paddy Considine). Conrad unravels as Kevin, who has stayed loyal to him his whole life, finally abandons him and calls him out. “It was a poignant scene,” said Brosnan. “As the series went on, we were playing catch-up all the time, so by the time we got to Episode 8, we really didn't know what was going on, the scripts were coming in last minute. And then you have the poignant, brilliant, soul-searching, Paddy Considine. And when you work with people like that, they make you real, they give you so much. It was the last day, and we were doing this father-son scene in Reading jail where dear Oscar Wilde met his brutal, brutish end, really. That prison holds such tremor of desperation and dank tomb-like death.”

 










Producer David Glasser has teased a Season 2, which has yet to be officially announced. The end of the series sets up nasty conflicts between the surviving players, Conrad included, who goes out on a prison riot. Brosnan suggested playing the Rolling Stones' “Sympathy for the Devil.” 

“Give the guy some juice,” he said. “Because they're all applauding, you know? And they did, and then we cranked up ‘Sympathy for the Devil' in Reading jail, and it just went through the roof.”

Next up: In the remake of the Sylvester Stallone chestnut “Cliffhanger,” “It's Lily James and myself up the mountain, and the bad guys come,” Brosnan said. “I'm the dad, and she's the heroine.” He plays a trainer in docudrama “Giant,” about Prince Naseem “Naz” Hamed, a British-Yemeni boxer who became world champion. And he goes West as a Sheriff battling villain Samuel L. Jackson in “Unholy Trinity.”
 










“There's been work,” he said. “There's been an abundance of work.”

“MobLand” is now streaming on Paramount+.

Donald Trump took his war on immigrants up a notch on Wednesday night, issuing an executive order barring nationals from 12 different countries from entering the United States, and another denying visas to any foreign students trying to enter the U.S. to attend Harvard University.


	The president posted a video to Truth Social on Wednesday explaining the travel ban, asserting that the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, has “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who have come here as temporary visitors and overstayed their visas.”


	“We don't want them,” Trump said, noting that there are “millions and millions of these illegals who should not be in our country.”


	The attack in Boulder was carried out by an Egyptian national who the administration says overstayed their visa. Egypt is not mentioned in the executive order.


	The travel ban affects Afghanistan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The order cites “national security and the national interests” of the nation, as well as the need to protect America from “foreign terrorists.” Trump is also partially restricting the entry of nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

	











	Trump attempted to impose travel bans during his first term in office, but they were blocked by the courts. He vowed in the run-up to his run to take back the White House that he would bring a travel ban back “even bigger and much stronger than before.”

	











	Trump has also ratcheted up his war on the nation's most prestigious higher-education institution, signing an order barring foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard. The order, titled, “Enhancing National Security by Addressing Risks at Harvard University,” deems that Harvard is “no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs.”

	The administration has been doing everything it can to hamstring the university — including freezing billions in federal grants — alleging that it hasn't done enough to crack down on antisemitism as students have protested the war in Gaza. Harvard has fought back, most recently in a lawsuit last week over the administration's move to restrict the school from enrolling international students. A federal judge quickly blocked the effort.

	The school did not take kindly to Trump's order on Wednesday night, either. “This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights,” a spokesperson for the school said in a statement. “Harvard will continue to protect its international students.” 


	Harvard has shown it is willing to take Trump to court over the administration's actions. The courts have been mixed on the president's immigration agenda, although multiple federal judges have blocked the push to deport immigrants without due process. The Supreme Court ruled last week that the administration can revoke the temporary protected status of over 500,000 immigrants, making them subject to deportation.

When Adam David won season 27 of “The Voice” in May 2025, he knew it would not be the last time he saw his coach, Michael Bublé. 

Although many contestants never see the celebrity coaches they worked with on the show once their season is over, Bublé promised his back-to-back winners — David and season 26's Sofronio Vasquez — he would continue to be their coach and friend long after the show was over. Both singers have said the superstar is keeping his word.

A post shared by Sofronio Vasquez III (@sofroniovasquez)

Since his win in 2024, Vasquez — the first Filipino singer to win the U.S. version of “The Voice” — has documented some of the ways Bublé has continued to be involved in his life and career, from working on new music to helping him get gigs. 

On June 5, he posted a screenshot from a FaceTime chat he'd just had with Bublé and wrote, “Not only is he my coach from The Voice, which historically made us win, but he also became family. He calls and sends some wisdom and great news for people like me who dream bigger than the world. Thank you, @michaelbuble”

The two reunited on May 7, when Vasquez shared two Instagram posts showing them together in Los Angeles and captioned their joyful selfies by writing, “had a very productive lunch with the man himself @michaelbuble. we skipped dessert because we are on diet LOL 😂”

Vasquez told WKTV in Utica that Bublé has been instrumental in his success since the show, sharing that the Grammy winner “managed to pull in people that he worked with before—like writers, musical producers. And some of the songs that he has written have not been recorded, or he's written new songs just for me.”

Bublé has also made it possible for Vasquez to perform for and with major celebrities, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates in March, when he attended prolific producer David Foster's birthday party for his wife, Katharine McPhee.

Meanwhile, Bublé has also said he plans to be part of David's life and career, too. Right after David won season 27, the Grammy winner told People that he was so excited, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep that night. 

He told the outlet, “You know what? This is personal for me because honestly, when the cameras shut off, we're friends. He's such a good dude. I won't sleep.”

“He had all the talent, all of it, all the ambitions, all of the unique ability,” Bublé continued. “And all I ever did was just, I wasn't coach. I was a buddy, man. Not all of our conversations are music, which is amazing.” 

On May 22, David told Good Housekeeping that he'd already had talks with both his coach and Vasquez about possible collaborations. 

“Obviously, I want to continue growing my relationship with Michael,” he told the outlet. “I don't think I can reveal anything truly, but we've had some conversations about things. And actually, I spoke with Sofronio Vasquez, and we've had some conversations, too.”

I
n the late 1970s, many of music's top tastemakers felt sure Garland Jeffreys would become the next big thing. Rolling Stone named him the “most promising artist” of 1977. The prestigious PBS program Soundstage predicted he would become “the next performer to lay claim to superstardom.” And powerful radio stations like New York's WNEW-FM kept his songs “35 Millimeter Dreams” and “Wild in the Streets” in heavy rotation. The sound that drew all this praise was marked by vocals that recalled the sardonic cadence of Jeffreys' close friend Lou Reed, matched to a theatrical blast of rock that brought to mind the work of another friend, Bruce Springsteen, had he grown up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, rather than his old stomping grounds in New Jersey.


	So deep was the belief in Jeffreys' talent in those days that, two decades later, he was still famous enough for the massively popular TV show Jeopardy to feature the title of one of his most acclaimed songs as the answer to a question. Unfortunately, the reaction of the show's three contestants in 2000 revealed a sad disconnect: None of them showed any sign of recognition when his song was mentioned. “That tells you everything,” says the singer's wife of more than 30 years and manager, Claire Jeffreys. “Garland was hot enough to have his song mentioned by Jeopardy's writers, but not known by enough of the general public to get a single response.”

	











	That sense of missed opportunity forms the emotional core of a new documentary about the star titled Garland Jeffreys: The King of In Between. The title refers both to Jeffreys' musical style — an uncategorizable mix of rock, reggae, and soul — and to his identity as the mixed-race son of a Black father and a Puerto Rican mother who struggled to find his place in the overwhelmingly white world of '70s and '80s rock. That struggle became his most sustained subject, forming the basis of many of his most powerful songs. “I don't know of anybody who has written about race as directly as Garland has,” Springsteen says in the documentary, which premieres at New York's IFC Center on Friday before arriving in select other theaters in the coming weeks. (The film will stream on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, and Tubi starting in August.)

	Striking as the story of Jeffreys' career may be, it's been dwarfed in some ways by the dramatic events that have taken place in his life in the nine years since his wife began making the documentary. In 2018, the now 81-year-old musician began showing signs of dementia, a condition that has progressed to the point where he is now unable to care for himself and barely able to communicate. The daunting task of his care at their Manhattan apartment has fallen to his wife, with assistance from a home aide.


	Despite that, she chose to leave his dementia out of the film she made. “I felt it would overwhelm the music and everything else about his life,” she says. Ultimately, she adds, she chose to talk about this with Rolling Stone to give full context to a tale that already touches on a host of hot-button topics.


	Even today, years later, Jeffreys' autobiographical style of songwriting remains remarkable. “Garland has been incredibly courageous in the particular way he has written about race,” says guitarist Vernon Reid, who played on one of Jeffreys' albums in the Nineties. “He writes about it in a very intimate way so that what you hear in his songs isn't like the work of anyone else.”


	Jeffreys introduced his approach in the very first track off his self-titled debut album in 1973. In the “Ballad of Me,” he described himself as “Black and white as can be … a freak in the family/Like a newborn child/With a frozen smile.”

	As his lyrics suggest, Jeffreys' family life was fraught from the start. His birth father left the family when he was just two. His mother, whom his wife describes as “high maintenance,” remarried a few years later to a man who beat Garland on a fairly regular basis for the smallest infractions. “His mother would tattle on him, saying ‘Garland didn't sweep the stoop,' and then his father would wallop him,” Claire says. “That his mother, the person who's supposed to protect him, would tell on him created in him a deep psychological distrust of people.”


	She adds, “It made Garland into someone with a huge chip on his shoulder, both personally and professionally.”


	Despite that, she says her husband's childhood in Sheepshead Bay had many bright spots, some involving the family, others involving neighbors whom he would entertain by singing doo-wop on street corners in the style of his idol, Frankie Lymon. At seven, Garland started coming into the city for piano lessons. By his early teens, he sneaked into jazz clubs in Greenwich Village to hear singer Carmen McRae (a distant relative) and sax work from Sonny Rollins (who later played with him in his PBS Soundstage performance). A few years later, his father made sure to send Garland to Syracuse University, no small feat for a man who made his main living waiting tables.

	











	At Syracuse in the early 1960s, Garland met and quickly befriended Lou Reed, a fellow student there. The fact that Reed already wrote songs despite his limited vocal range inspired the more vocally adept Jeffreys to perform himself. Part of their bond came from their mutual ability to reflect the character of their birth city in their music. “You can hear New York talking in both of those guys,” says Laurie Anderson, who married Reed in 2008. “They're both connected to the language of the streets. When they hung out, they would always riff on it and turn it into a song.”


	After college, Jeffreys attended the Institute of Fine Arts in New York but dropped out to pursue music. In 1969, he played guitar on John Cale's debut solo album, Vintage Violence, and, that same year, formed a band named Grinder's Switch that was signed to Vanguard Records and performed at the Fillmore East. Their debut album was produced by Lewis Merenstein, who had recently overseen Van Morrison's classic Astral Weeks.


	Though the Grinder's Switch album flopped, Jeffreys managed to get a solo contract with Atlantic. And while his sole release for the label — that 1973 self-titled debut featuring “Ballad of Me” — was another bomb, it got good reviews for a sound that favored folk rock, blues, and reggae, a style that was just beginning to make an impact in the U.S. at the time. In an attempt to get attention for himself in that period, Jeffreys told some media outlets he was Jamaican. The lie revealed a flair for self-mythologizing already evident in his choice of a stage name: Born William Jeffreys, the singer chose to use his middle name, Garland, to sound more exotic.


	Four long years passed before he got another record contract, this time with A&M. His 1977 debut for the label, titled Ghost Writer, featured a song called “Wild in the Streets” that was inspired by a horrific incident in the Bronx in which two teenage boys raped and murdered a nine-year-old girl.  “He was deeply affected by that story because it happened to children,” Claire says. “He always felt like a wounded child himself.”


	“Wild in the Streets” earned lots of FM radio play and was later covered by the Circle Jerks in what became such a signature piece for the California hardcore punks that few of their fans know Jeffreys actually wrote it. It didn't help that their version inverted its meaning entirely, turning it from a tragedy into an expression of joyous freedom. “Garland didn't mind,” says Claire, who would go on to marry him in 1989. “No matter how someone interprets your song, it's still an honor when someone covers it.”

	











	Given all the hype behind Ghost Writer, including RS‘ “most promising artist” rave, Jeffreys took it hard when the album failed to sell. It didn't help his cause, his wife says, that he frequently fought with his label. “He never felt like the label was doing right by him, even if they technically were,” she says. “He always came from a place of insecurity and distrust.”


	Despite all the setbacks, Jeffreys continued to soar creatively, releasing notable albums like 1979's American Boy & Girl, whose cover featured an image of an interracial couple, and which generated a huge hit in Europe with the song “Matador.” Stateside, Jeffreys continued to burn through labels, issuing albums on Epic and RCA.


	His first effort for the latter label channeled all of his frustrations into a stirring 1992 concept album about race called Don't Call Me Buckwheat. Its confrontational title was inspired by an ugly incident in the early ‘90s at a Mets game when someone in the crowd yelled at Jeffreys, “Hey Buckwheat, get the fuck out of here,” making reference to the Black character from the 1930s series Our Gang. To drive home the pain and poignancy of that, the album cover featured a photo of Jeffreys as a child dressed in his baseball uniform to attend the historic game in which Jackie Robinson broke the color line. One song on the album was titled “Color Line,” while another, named “Racial Repertoire,” discussed what's known today as code-switching. “The way you speak in the neighborhood is different from the way you speak on the job,” Reid explains. “Garland wrote about that situation better than anyone.”


	More daringly, Jeffreys wrote about his own internalized racial shame in “I Was Afraid of Malcolm,” with lyrics that found him struggling to accept Malcolm X's message. “Malcolm was demanding an accounting, and Garland was terrified of what that would mean,” Reid says. “To face the truth of racism is a monstrous thing.”


	While the album resonated in Europe, aided by strong support by a German record executive, it was buried in the U.S., once again reinforcing issues the singer had long faced as a Black rocker. In an interview I did with Garland in 2011, he talked about that. “I'm too Black to be white, and too white to be Black,” he said then.


	“We faced the same issue in my band,” Reid says of his pioneering group Living Colour. “Black artists are not considered in the rock field.”

	











	At his most frustrated, Jeffreys resorted to painting his face Black, while also creating blackface masks to wear onstage. “He knew that could be controversial,” his wife says. “But he felt he had to do something.”


	Reid considers Jeffreys' blackface move to be an “act of self-lacerating performance art. He was forcing the issue while also forcing the audience to face their own complicity in the situation.”


	Jeffreys' lack of success in the States ultimately left him without a recording contract in his home country for nearly 20 years. When he finally returned to recording with The King of In Between in 2011, the album appeared on his own label, Luna Park. Critics raved. Again, audiences remained aloof.


	Undaunted, Jeffreys continued issuing new work through 2017 with 14 Steps to Harlem. Two years later, he announced his retirement, though his wife thinks he should have stepped back sooner. “He had been faltering in live performances for quite a while, forgetting lyrics or telling a story that was meandering,” she says.


	Her initial suggestion to stop didn't go over well. “It was definitely a case of killing the messenger,” she says. “It was really rough because performing was so important to him — way more important than success.”


	Eventually, however, not only did Jeffreys come to accept retirement, he began to appreciate the level of success he had achieved by re-centering his focus on the quality of the work itself. For the documentary, Springsteen offered the most laudatory summation of Jeffreys' talents. “He's in the great singer-songwriter tradition of Dylan and Neil Young,” Springsteen said, “one of the American greats.”


	Spreading the word on that was the main impetus behind Claire Jeffreys making the documentary, but it took some persuading to get her husband to go along. “At first, he was ambivalent because it brought back all of those hard feelings,” she says.

	Despite his declining health, Jeffreys was able to appear during much of the filming. Eventually, though, his wife had to jump onscreen to speak for him. Relieved as she is to finally get the film out, it pains her to know that her husband may be unaware of either its release or its reception. Regardless, she believes his story has a silver lining.


	“Ultimately, this is a story about perseverance,” she says. “When each of us gets older, we realize that certain dreams of ours haven't been fulfilled. I hope this film helps people to accept what they have achieved, as Garland eventually did. Despite all that he faced, his has been a life well lived.”

Fletcher has a few revelations to make. In fact, the singer born Cari Elise Fletcher has 11 of them, manifested as tracks on her third studio album, Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me?, out July 18. All 11 songs are secrets spilled in one form or another; some of them might shock even the most fervent of Fletcher fans. Still, they are stories she had to tell. 


	On the album's intro, “Party,” Fletcher sings about how she's not the chaotic, drama-fueled pop star who taunted her ex's new girlfriend on the viral 2022 hit “Becky's So Hot.” “I'd love to let you love me/Cause I'm that kind of whore/Who needed the attention/I don't need anymore/It's not that kind of party,” she sings.


	So what kind of party is it? “Maybe the kind of party where I have a chill, more intimate heart-to-heart with close friends,” Fletcher tells Rolling Stone in a new interview. “And revealing some really vulnerable shit.” In a note to fans announcing her new project, the singer calls Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me? “both an open wound and an act of liberation.”

	











	On the single “Boy,” released today, she shares something even more personal: “I kissed a boy,” she sings. “And I know it's not what you wanted to hear/And it wasn't on your bingo card this year/Well it wasn't on mine/I fell in love.”

	Fletcher has long emphasized her sexual fluidity, and she has many queer fans; the relationships that she's sung about have, until now, exclusively been with women. “There will be people that feel disappointed and feel confused and have questions,” Fletcher tells RS. “Girl, I had questions and I was confused too. It shocked me just as much as anybody else.”

	











	Of course, who a person chooses to date and how that person identifies across the gender spectrum doesn't negate anyone's queerness. “I am so proud to be queer,” Fletcher continues. “That is not something that has ever wavered or changed. Being queer for me is this lens that I get to view life through.” She knows not everyone will understand what she's sharing, but she's seemingly found peace with that in the name of being unabashedly herself.

	Fletcher tells Rolling Stone that the flood of emotions that informed her new album happened around late 2024 and early 2025, after her last tour. When asked whether she and the muse behind “Boy” are still together, she doesn't answer directly, but makes it known that she's in a great place. “I am getting to experience love again,” she says. “That is the most magical feeling in the entire world. I met a boy who is somehow way more connected to his feelings and his emotions and his heart than even I am.”


Would You Still Love Me If You Really Knew Me? is a candid retrospective of the singer's twenties, navigating love in all its forms, and thinking about fame. On “Hi, Everyone Leave Please,” Fletcher questions why she's not getting more radio play despite selling out Radio City Music Hall (“Kinda bruises my ego”). She says it's her favorite song on the new project.


	During our conversation, Fletcher takes a few emotional pauses while chatting about identity, her support system, the new album, and feeling like Cari was getting lost in her larger Fletcher persona.


What message did you want to send with “Boy”?I was in the studio with [songwriters] Jen Decilveo and Shane McAnally. We were all discussing our queer journeys. I really wanted to capture and talk about what was happening in mine. I had met a boy and started feeling romantic and emotional feelings, and we kissed. I was like, “What the fuck is going on?” My whole world felt flipped upside down. I've always written about my love stories and my heart and very candidly written about what I've been experiencing. “Boy” is just another love story. ”Boy” is just one revelation of many. It's not an album about a guy.

	I think I became known for this chaos and this toxicity and bitterness and sapphic drama, and then I started having different experiences in my personal life. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease [in early 2023] and went through a really intense healing journey, which allowed me to pause. I started having so many questions about my career and my purpose. I think through allowing myself to ask those deeper questions about this fixed dream I thought I would always be chasing, my heart opened in a way I wasn't expecting, and I fell in love with a boy.

	











What exactly was that “fixed dream”?Just the childhood dream of being the biggest pop star in the world. Being an artist that gets to stand up on a stage and share my heart and my feelings with the world…. And I've gotten to achieve that in so many ways. When I started going through all the things I was going through last year, I started to question … if I wasn't singing about creating all this chaos and drama in my life, would anybody want to hear from me? Would anybody still be there, would anybody still love me if they really knew me now?


Have the assumptions people made up until this point about you bothered you?I think people have experienced me as what I've shared with them, you know? All of my romantic relationships over the last 10 years have been with women. And it's what I've written my music about. Through this larger-than-life character that Fletcher became, I feel like there wasn't a lot of room for the parts of me that weren't wild and crazy and aching. There were other parts of me that, as I've gone through this healing journey, I've felt haven't been fully brought to life. I'm a queer woman. I've always been queer. I will always be queer. My identity is not shifting and it's not changing. My community is not changing. But I've had these new experiences that I wanted to let people in on and give them a chance to know me now. 


How gradually did your life change? When we talked early last year, you had already become more measured with certain things. A water between each margarita, that type of thing.I think it's been gradual. I had so many different eras throughout my career. In between all of them, there was love, but there was also my toxic “Becky's So Hot” era. Then there was [In Search of the Antidote] and going on this deeper health journey and learning so much about myself. I feel like it's been gradual, but…. My last tour was just so hard for me. It was really painful for me. I thought that people didn't know the most current version of me. I thought that Cari was getting lost in this larger persona.


Is there any part of you that is scared of how people are going to react to a song like “Boy”?Oh my gosh, yeah. I'm terrified. It's so scary to share your truth, you know. My career launched with a song called “Wasted Youth” in my early twenties about falling in love with a girl. Here I am, 10 years later at the start of my thirties, with a song about falling in love with a boy. Through this entire time, all I've expressed…. My deepest desire for people was for them to boldly and unapologetically be themselves. And I have to walk that walk. If that's what I've been preaching to my fans who I love so much this whole time, then I have to give myself that same grace. Otherwise, what the fuck is the point?

	











	I understand that my love life is not the most important thing in global news in the world, especially within the queer community. Trans people's existence right now is being threatened, and their rights are being threatened at every angle. There's a lot more important things to put attention and energy and love to. But at the same time, even through the fear that I have, the commitment to being myself no matter what is where my heart will always lay. It's my north star that I have to just run towards.


Has your thinking on your identity shifted at all?I'm so proud to be queer. That's not something that's shifted. There's so many other components to me, aside from my queerness. I'm so fortunate to even be lifted up by the community the way that I have been all of these years. I'm a queer woman, that's not changing…. I'm so lucky I've gotten to experience so much magic in this life because of my openness and my curiosity. For me it's always been this living, breathing expression. It doesn't shift or evolve for everyone. But for me, it's always been this living, breathing thing. 


What kind of support system are you leaning on these days?I have my family and my friends who love me so much, and I have people who love on me through every single season. I know there will be people that feel however they're going to feel. That's OK. I'm OK with that. I could have buried this song somewhere in the soundtrack in the larger context of this album. I chose to lead with it first. That's because I knew that it was something that my fans, and the people who have supported me all these years, would care about. I didn't want there to be any veil between me and my truth. It's something that I'm willing to talk about. I have cycled through every emotion through the making of this album. I have cycled through tears, and grief, and guilt, and shame, and fear, and excitement and joy. It is an embodiment of the human experience.

Are there other revelations on this album that you hope fans pay attention to?My biggest hope is for everybody to be free to be themselves and to love themselves and to express themselves. It's scary to share new discoveries about yourself. This album, and “Boy,” is really a permission slip for me to be myself. And for me to love and express myself. I just want it to be a permission slip, you know. I'm stepping into this bravery even if I'm scared, in hopes that other people are able to do that in their own lives. Whatever evolution in your life, whatever doesn't fill your cup anymore — a relationship, or a job, or some version of you that evolved and wants to come through. Fuck it. Life is way too fucking short. Truly. To do anything else. At the end of the day, even if everybody hated me, I'm still myself.

	











If you knew how everything would play out — who you would meet last year — would you do anything differently?No. There's nothing that I would rewrite. There's nothing that I would change about any of my journey. I love all of the women that I have been and the woman that I am becoming. I would never rewrite history. It all happened exactly the way that it was meant to. I celebrate it all.

	The first public glimpse of Lil Wayne's upcoming Tha Carter VI album will be heard on ESPN. “The Days,” a collaboration between the iconic rapper (and May Rolling Stone cover star) and U2's Bono, is the theme song of the NBA Finals' promotional ad for the first day of the championship series between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers. The network has previously played his “I Am Not a Human Being,” “Uproar,” and ‘Glory” tracks in the playoffs.


	In the NBA Finals ad, highlights of both teams are interspersed with Wayne rapping bars like, “live to fight another day if yesterday beat me, cause I ain't gettin' younger, but I'm gettin' better” while Bono sings, “these are the days.”


	“Basketball's been in my blood since day one, so to team up with ESPN less than 24 hours before the drop of Tha Carter VI for the NBA Finals is an incredible honor,” Wayne, who just announced a North American tour, says about the campaign. “My music and the NBA are vibin' on the same frequency because it's perfect timing for fans to hear Tha Carter VI on the game's grandest stage.” The campaign is yet another intersection of sports and music for the avid sports fan and co-founder of Young Money APAA Sports Agency, which represents several NBA players.

Tha Carter VI is Wayne's 14th studio album, and the first since 2023's Welcome 2 ColleGrove with 2 Chainz. Wayne played Rolling Stone songs from the project in January, including “The Days,” an introspective track where he reflects on his life and times. He told Rolling Stone that the project is collaboration-oriented, noting, “If there's one thing about this album that's different, it's me approaching it like, ‘Man, what would I sound like on something with such and such.'” He'll be celebrating Tha Carter VI's launch with the ESPN campaign as well as his first headlining concert at Madison Square Garden on Friday, the album's release date. 

	











	“Lil Wayne brings the energy, edge, and emotion that define the NBA Finals,” said Curtis Friends, Vice President of Sports Marketing at ESPN. “Integrating his music into our NBA Playoffs coverage has been a strategic brand flex – amplifying our storytelling and connecting with fans as we showcase today's rising stars on the league's biggest stage.”

Noah Hawley is trading “Fargo” for a more out of this world location: space. Hawley is the showrunner for “Alien” franchise prequel series “Alien: Earth,” which is set in 2120. The eight-episode series takes place prior to the events of Ridley Scott's “Alien.” Sydney Chandler leads the show, along with Alex Lawther, Timothy Olyphant, Adarsh Gourav, Essie Davis, Kit Young, and Samuel Blenkin. 

The official synopsis reads: “When the mysterious deep space research vessel USCSS Maginot crash-lands on Earth, Wendy (Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet's greatest threat. In the year 2120, the Earth is governed by five corporations: Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold. In this Corporate Era, cyborgs (humans with both biological and artificial parts) and synthetics (humanoid robots with artificial intelligence) exist alongside humans. But the game is changed when the wunderkind Founder and CEO of Prodigy Corporation unlocks a new technological advancement: hybrids (humanoid robots infused with human consciousness). The first hybrid prototype named Wendy marks a new dawn in the race for immortality. After Weyland-Yutani's spaceship collides into Prodigy City, Wendy and the other hybrids encounter mysterious life forms more terrifying than anyone could have ever imagined.”

FX's “Alien: Earth” was created for television and executive produced by Hawley. This is the first TV iteration of the long-running sci-fi franchise, which spans nine films (the most recent of which is Fede Alvarez's “Alien: Romulus”). 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Hawley told IndieWire that he spoke to auteur Scott while making “Alien: Earth.” Scott's Scott Free banner produces the series as well. 

“Ridley is the man. He's the creator of this franchise, he's come back to it later in his career,” Hawley said. “But you know, like the Coen brothers [with ‘Fargo'], he was very respectful of the fact that I seem to know what I'm doing, and I have my own take on it. That's the thing with these films, is that they take on a life of their own. And at a certain point you have to take a step back and let them be what they want to be.”

Hawley added of the recent “Alien” film, “I thought ‘Romulus' was great. It's a thrill ride. These movies are always survival stories. And the challenge in television is, that's great for two hours, but for 20 or 30 or 50 hours, survival isn't enough. You need to tell a larger story that engages you with characters and emotions and is not just about ‘Who is the last one standing?'”

“Alien: Earth” premieres August 12 on FX and Hulu. Check out the trailer below.

Felton, who played the character in the films, will make his Broadway debut with the role.


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


	Tom Felton, who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, will reprise the role on Broadway. 


	Felton will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on Broadway starting Nov. 11, for a 19-week engagement through March 22, 2026. The play is set 19 years after the end of the original Harry Potter series, and sees Draco as a father, alongside Harry, Ron and Hermione, who are all sending their children off to Hogwarts.




	This will mark Felton's Broadway debut and the first time a member of the Harry Potter film cast has joined the stage production.

	In addition to his work on Harry Potter, Felton has recently appeared in the films They Will Kill You, alongside Zazie Beetz and Patricia Arquette for Skydance, and Fackham Hall, with Thomasin McKenzie and Damian Lewis. He made his West End debut in 2022, playing the lead role of Sam in 2:22 A Ghost Story; in 2024, he starred as the lead, Bob Edwards, in Gareth Farr's play A Child of Science at Bristol Old Vic.


	“Being a part of the Harry Potter films has been one of the greatest honours of my life. Joining this production will be a full-circle moment for me, because when I begin performances in Cursed Child this fall, I'll also be the exact age Draco is in the play. It's surreal to be stepping back into his shoes — and of course his iconic platinum blond hair — and I am thrilled to be able to see his story through and to share it with the greatest fan community in the world. I look forward to joining this incredible company and being a part of the Broadway community,” Felton said. 


Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on an original story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, written by Thorne and directed by Tiffany. The production has been running on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre since April 2018.  Since its opening, the play, which was once in two parts and running longer than five hours, has been revised and now is one part under three hours.

With its streaming service set to launch later this year, the sports media giant is debuting a new brand effort during the NBA Finals.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


ESPN will use this year's NBA Finals to tee up its big bet on direct-to-consumer.


	The sports giant will debut a new brand campaign with the tagline “Sports Forever” during the series, leaning into its heritage on TV, and setting the stage for its “next era” on whatever device viewers choose.




	The spot, which you can watch below, features a clip from ESPN's first ever broadcast on Sept. 7, 1979, with anchor Lee Leonard introducing viewers to “sports heaven.” In the background, as clips of Leonard are interspersed with current athletes, teams and games, an anthemic version of ESPN's “dadada, dadada” sound plays in the background.

	“That is literally the first broadcast, the first words ever spoken on ESPN broadcast,” says Sinan Dagli of BSSP, the creative agency behind the campaign. “And we talked about it as almost this prophecy that he's like, setting out this oracle who is setting out the next four decades right from the beginning, it's not modified at all, this is what he said, and it is perfect for ushering us into the new era.”


	The Sports Forever campaign will kick off an extended marketing effort for ESPN, building up to the launch of the ESPN streaming service later this year.


	“Sports Forever is a campaign that emphasizes that being a fan is not just a momentary engagement,  it's a lifelong journey, and that ESPN has been on that journey now for over four decades, with many generations of fans connecting them to sport as well,” says ESPN senior VP of marketing Jo Fox. “That was the sort of starting spot, and we wanted to make sure that we're raising our share of voice and really hitting on ESPN's legacy and leadership in the sports space, before we then do our product launch later in the fall.”


	The inaugural spot ends with a sports fan on the couch, picking up their phone as the ESPN “dadada, dadada” chime plays. A text block says “Fall 2025: The Next Era Begins,” teeing up the streaming service.

	











	“We will have a really large launch campaign in the fall, which will talk about the two jobs we have to do. One is, of course, about launching our direct to consumer service, and that is something we'll have to explain a lot because we've had such a long history within the cable bundle. And the second is about all the features that we have coming to the enhanced app,” Fox says of the next phase of the campaign. “So there's quite a lot to say in that messaging when we go to launch, but we wanted to make sure before we did that and we started talking through these what will be quite comprehensive messages in our campaign that we reminded consumers, reminded fans, that ESPN has the authority in this space and the leadership in this space to really give this to fans, to give them an amazing sports experience that they've had before.”

Blumhouse founder Jason Blum has an axe to grind when he hears people say Ryan Coogler's “Sinners” is not a horror film. Admittedly, the movie is a genre-bending period film and folk fable about the roots of blues music, but it's got vampires killing people in it, so it's a horror movie. And Blum wants you to know it.

“Sinners'” box office success — $350 million worldwide to date — has defied expectations for what an original horror film can do, and even though Blum didn't make it, it's good for his business when the genre as a whole thrives. But much of the discussion around that movie before its release was its hefty budget — a reported $90 million — that complicated its path to profitability. For Blum, he's built his empire on movies made on the cheap that can still be marketed as events, break out in a big way, and spawn franchises. But as Blumhouse has scaled up and the demand for horror has increased, Blumhouse can't make movies as modestly, and the industry too runs into challenges to continue to make horror movies work financially.

Blum on Tuesday took the stage in Hollywood at a press event called The Business of Fear, in which he and a panel of Blumhouse and Atomic Monster associates discussed box office trends for the genre and how horror has evolved over the years, such that the genre “horror” can't be viewed so narrowly. IndieWire asked him about “Sinners,” a movie he says is “one of my favorite horror movies I've seen in a long time,” and why he felt “Sinners” was the rare exception to the rule about making horror movies work on such a massive scale.

“We are definitely not interested in doing movies with that size a budget. That said, I'm glad they had the budget that they had because I think it really helped make the movie rich and incredible and amazing; but we are not going to make horror movies at that level anytime soon, maybe ever,” Blum said in the panel discussion. “The bigger the budget, the more strain on the creative and the more sanding down of edges. And I think, generally speaking, ‘Sinners' being the exception, the product is less interesting. So we are committed to lower budgets to continue to be able to take creative risks and do interesting things, which I think is harder to do when you have more money.”

Blumhouse, following its merger with James Wan's Atomic Monster, has scaled up significantly such that it needs to have “major studio-level success,” as Blum puts it. That means $100 million+ movies, which even for Blum and Wan is rare for movies made for just $1 million. He acknowledges that an indie like last year's “Longlegs” pulled off the feat, and films like “Terrifier 3” came dang close, Blum said today “it's much harder to do what we started doing 15 years ago.”

 










“So the way that we've addressed that is by adding a bit of money to our model; but still, by studio standards, for instance, the budgets of our movies are 60 percent off the average sticker price, actually probably more, 75 percent off, the average sticker price,” Blum said. 

Blumhouse has five remaining movies on its slate for 2025, all of them sequels, including “M3GAN 2.0,” “Five Night's at Freddy's 2,” a new “Conjuring” movie, “The Black Phone 2,” and “Mortal Kombat 2.” At the event, Blumhouse also announced it's in development on “Ma 2,” with Octavia Spencer set to return. But it's threading a needle in finding original properties that someday can be the next major franchise for Blumhouse. 

Together with Atomic Monster it's branching out into video games, an exciting growth area to tell other horror stories, but Blumhouse president Abhijay Prakash explained that they're positioned to adapt one of those games into a film should one break out, though that wasn't the reason it launched the division. Blumhouse also announced at the event it will be adapting another indie horror game hit, “Phasmaphobia.” 

Blum is also staying true to the company's philosophy about finding good stories, things that are genuinely scary, rather than trying to stack them with stars or buzzy directors and figure out the rest later. IndieWire asked Blum about a recent viral video from Charli XCX in which she pitched the idea of a “Final Destination” movie starring all “It Girls,” and directed by Coralie Fargeat for good measure. Blum hadn't seen the video, but he'd want to hear a bit more. 

 










“Generally, I am not a fan, I think no one on this panel is, of reverse-engineering movies. You never get a good result,” he said. “It's how, unfortunately, the vast majority of movies are made, but it's very hard to get a good movie reverse-engineering it.”

Blum added the studio is unlikely to again release a movie day-and-date in theaters and on Peacock as it did with “Five Nights at Freddy's” but won't be repeating with the sequel. Horror works best in the theater, not at home, and it's the reason the genre has consistently grown in popularity and still hasn't reached its peak. He says it will lead to movies that are one day constructed very differently for theatrical than they are for streaming — not just a difference in quality or budgets — and horror is very equipped for that evolution. 

“Horror, in my mind, is the only genre that you just can't get what you are going to see a horror movie for at home on TV. It doesn't work,” he said. “The only way to be really scared is when your phone is not with you and when you are in a dark room with a lot of other people and you are fully focused on a movie. You guys try it. Watch a horror movie on streaming, and when you know a scare is coming, look away for two seconds and look back. It stops working. It's just, your suspension of disbelief is broken, and when you are leading that up to a scare, you are just not scared. It's actually made horror in cinema stronger.”

The planned 'The Birds' TV show also got a shout-out as SXSW London brought together Surian Fletcher-Jones of Working Title Television, Heyday Television's Sue Gibbs and Carnival Films' Noemi Spanos.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	Upcoming Sarah Snook-starring thriller series All Her Fault and Lena Dunham rom-com show Too Much, as well as a planned TV take on Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds got big shout-outs during SXSW London on Thursday.


	They were in the spotlight as global hit series from various production labels under the Universal International Studios umbrella took center stage at the first-ever SXSW London.

	“Global Stories: What makes compelling TV?” was the question discussed by Surian Fletcher-Jones, head of drama at Working Title Television; Sue Gibbs, head of development at Heyday Television, the joint venture of producer David Heyman and Universal International Studios; and Noemi Spanos, creative director at Carnival Films. Beatrice Springborn, president, Universal International Studios and Universal Content Productions (UCP), functioned as the moderator.

	Confronted with a question about how TV industry cost reductions, other spending cutbacks and layoffs are affecting their work, the execs shared insight into the challenges but also opportunities.


	“One is adapting,” offered Gibbs. “Heyday as a company, historically, we've always worked with IP. David's known for it with Harry Potter and Paddington. So we will always be looking for IP. I think we're probably looking less to the new books that are coming out because it's so super competitive. They're so expensive. So, we're looking at classic books, old TV shows, articles, etc. So I think it's adapting in that way.”

	











	Gibbs also mentioned that Heyday has often commissioned scripts with writers and then taken them out to the market to buyers. “We're slightly changing that now and trying to be more fleet of foot,” she explained. “Perhaps you just go out with a pitch so you can be faster. Or we're trying to set up more projects with buyers. [In the past], we would have perhaps taken them out to a number of buyers at the same time. Now, we are trying to get in with a buyer straight off, which is a financial incentive, but it's really more about the emotional incentive. If the buyer is emotionally invested in your project from the off, they can be more likely to try and help make it work.”


	In terms of upcoming shows they are excited for, Spanos touted psychological thriller All Her Fault for Peacock. “Sarah Snook's character knocks on a door to pick up a kid from a play date, and the older woman who opens the door has never heard of her, her kid has no idea what she's talking about,” she explained. “That kicks off that sort of thriller engine, but also it turns into a sort of bigger Big Little Lies kind of mystery about all the secrets and lies between these different families and relationships.”


	Concluded Spanos: “What I liked coming into it, reading it fresh and watching it fresh was that there's quite a thematic feminist messaging underneath it all, because it's called All Her Fault, and it's all really about how the mother is treated very differently from the father in that circumstances by the police, by the community, by everyone, really.”

	











	About the series planned on The Birds, Spanos shared: “This is obviously a Universal film title, the iconic Hitchcock movie. We're not adapting that. We're going back to the source material, the Daphne du Maurier novella and using that as inspiration. And at its heart, it's looking at when nature turns on you. Obviously, with climate change that is very timely, and we just attached an exciting U.S. showrunner who's very experienced in genre.” She didn't mention their name.


	Fletcher-Jones, meanwhile, touted Too Much and how it explores the differences between the U.S. and U.K. in lovable ways. 


	And she said that Working Title and the BBC are developing a TV adaptation of E.M. Forster's popular 1924 novel A Passage to India, which is set against the backdrop of the Indian independence movement against the British Empire and has previously received the film treatment. The companies are collaborating with Canadian director and writer Richie Mehta on the five-part series. “Richie is Indian by heritage, so it is completely turning that novel on its head and doing it from the Indian point of view,” shared Fletcher-Jones. “It's a beautiful piece he's writing and directing it all.” She also called it a take that will “reclaim colonial history, which feels really sort of Soul Food-y.”


On Wednesday, SXSW London sessions featured appearances by the likes of Idris Elba, ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus and Letitia Wright, among others.


	SXSW London, which not only features panel discussions, but also film screenings and live music events, among other things, runs through June 7. Penske Media, the parent company of The Hollywood Reporter, is the majority stakeholder of SXSW.

	Jonas has issued one solo studio album previously, 2011's Fastlife, which debuted and peaked at No. 15 on Top Album Sales. Jonas is also a member of Jonas Brothers, and that trio has logged seven top 10s on Top Album Sales (including four No. 1s). DNCE also counts Joe as a member, and that group has reached Top Album Sales once, with its self-titled project, reaching No. 14 in 2016.

	Elsewhere in the top 10 of the Top Album Sales chart, Playboi Carti, BAEKHYUN and Stereolab all shake-up the region with moves reentries and debuts.

	











Billboard's Top Album Sales chart ranks the top-selling albums of the week based only on traditional album sales. The chart's history dates back to May 25, 1991, the first week Billboard began tabulating charts with electronically monitored piece count information from SoundScan, now Luminate. Pure album sales were the sole measurement utilized by the Billboard 200 albums chart through the list dated Dec. 6, 2014, after which that chart switched to a methodology that blends album sales with track equivalent album (TEA) units and streaming equivalent album (SEA) units.


	Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem holds at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart for a second week (28,000; down 79% from its debut of 133,000). Playboi Carti's MUSIC reenters the list at No. 2 with nearly 18,000 (up from a negligible sum the week previous) following the fulfillment of deluxe boxed sets, exclusively sold via his webstore, to customers during the tracking week. BAKHYUN's Essence of Reverie debuts at No. 4 with nearly 10,500. Kendrick Lamar's chart-topping GNX rises two spots to No. 5 with 8,000 (up 16%).


	Rounding out the rest of the top 10: Jin's Echo falls 2-6 in its second week (just over 6,000; down 82%), BOYNEXTDOOR's 4th EP: No Genre dips 3-7 in its second week (6,000; down 57%), Sabrina Carpenter's chart-topping Short n' Sweet rises 11-8 (nearly 6,000; up 2%), Stereolab's Instant Holograms on Metal Film debuts at No. 9 (almost 6,000) and Sleep Token's former leader Even in Arcadia falls 4-10 (5,500; down 29%).

"Thunder" is the lead single from the superstar K-pop group's just-released fifth studio album Happy Burstday.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


SEVENTEEN found their way back to The Kelly Clarkson Show on Wednesday (June 4) to perform “Thunder,” the lead single from their just-released fifth studio album Happy Burstday.


	The off-site performance takes place in an industrial warehouse, and it starts with THE 8 answering a ringing payphone branded with the logo of The Kelly Clarkson Show. He's then surrounded by his 10 other bandmates — S.COUPS, JOSHUA, JUN, HOSHI, WOOZI, MINGYU, DK, SEUNGKWAN, VERNON and DINO — as they quite literally answer the call to give a bombastic performance on Clarkson's daytime talk show. (JEONGHAN and WONWOO sat out the performance as they're currently serving in South Korea's military.)

	











	Each of the group's three units — hip-hop, vocal and dance — are spotlighted throughout the performance, as the 11 members switch places throughout to put different artists center stage for the stomping choreography in the wide open space.

	For her introduction, Clarkson called SEVENTEEN “a K-pop performance powerhouse” — and she's had a front-row seat to this powerhouse before. Back in January 2021, the group hit Clarkson's show for the U.S. debut performance of their 2020 hit single “Left & Right.”


Happy Burstday, which was released last month to celebrate SEVENTEEN's 10th anniversary, includes solo songs from all 13 members for the first time, as well as three group tracks: “Thunder,” “HBD” and the Pharrell-produced “Bad Influence.” Timbaland also produced on the project. Billboard previously shared exclusive behind-the-scenes photos from the “Thunder” music video set.

To some, Tate McRae and Morgan Wallen might seem like an unlikely pairing. One is rooted in pure country storytelling with a gritty edge. The other is a major pop powerhouse known for viral heartbreak anthems. But their new collaboration, “What I Want,” is proof that musical opposites can not only attract, they can dominate.

The single debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Wallen's fourth Hot 100 chart-topper and McRae's very first. The “Exes” singer topped her previous high with the No. 3 hit “Greedy,” marking a new milestone in her career. This time around, “What I Want” proved to be another hit for the singer, who decided to dive into the country world. Part of Wallen's long-awaited album “I'm the Problem,” the song leaked a day before its official release, and yet, it still managed to go viral on TikTok and explode across streaming platforms.

For Wallen, this was more than just another chart milestone. The collaboration pushed him out of his comfort zone and into a new creative space. While many fans expected him to pair up with another female artist from the country world, he knew McRae was the right choice for this particular track.

“Man, I just think she's awesome,” Wallen said in a recent interview with Zane Lowe. “I think nobody's really doing what she's doing. She seems like a new age real deal—with dancing, the singing, the type of songs she makes.”

Wallen revealed that “What I Want” was the only song he sent to McRae. He was confident that her voice would bring the track to life. “She was awesome, man,” he added. “She didn't ask me a lot of questions—‘Hey, can I change this? Can I do that?' Her range is phenomenal. You can tell… she sang the song that's written for a duet, and she absolutely crushed it. I can't say enough great things about her.”

“What I Want” doesn't just live in one lane. It's not exclusively country, not strictly pop, it's a blend that captures the evolving sound of mainstream music. The song appeals to fans across the spectrum, from rural radio stations to TikTok scrollers. It's proof that the genre-bending appeal has helped it rack up more than 35 million streams in its first week alone.

While the track faces stiff competition from major releases by Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift, Wallen and McRae's duet continues to hold strong on Spotify, Apple Music, and radio. Its success also highlights a larger trend in music. It proves that genre lines are blurring and fans are embracing it.

Ultimately, “What I Want” isn't just a hit; it's a moment. One born out of mutual admiration, fearless collaboration, and the kind of chemistry you can't fake. Whether it holds at No. 1 or not, it's already made its mark, and Wallen isn't shy about who helped him get there.

The trio collected prestigious awards at the event in London on Wednesday (June 4).

Billboard hosted its inaugural Global Power Players event in London on Wednesday (June 4) to celebrate music industry leaders from across the world.


	The invite-only event at Shoreditch House in east London honored the chosen executives for the Global Power Players list and the first-ever U.K. Power Players selections. Huge names including Sir Elton John and his husband and manager David Furnish, EMPIRE founder and CEO Ghazi Shami and afrobeats superstar Tems were recognised with special awards.


	John and Furnish collected the Creators' Champion Award, and John used his speech to warn the U.K. government that “we will not back down” in relation to the Labour party's controversial AI bill, which proposes an opt-out approach for music rights holders. Key industry figures such as John have called upon the government to work with the creative industries to find a solution; the government's bill has been rejected by the House of Lords on five occasions in recent weeks.

	“Copyright has to be transparent and seek permission,” John said. “These two principles are the bedrock of the industry and they must be included in the data bill as a backstop. Let's be clear: we want to work with the government, we want our government to work with us. We are not anti-AI and we are not anti-Big Tech.”


	He added: “I will fight for this until it's done and people have a fair deal. Every young artist or new person who writes a song, I want them to have a future and have their copyright respected.”


	Ahead of her headline set for Billboard Presents The Stage as part of SXSW London on Thursday (June 5), Tems collected the Diamond Award from incoming Billboard Africa editor Nkosiyati Khumalo. 


	“Being African and a musician is a whole new world and I feel like Billboard has been so supportive of not just African music but the whole scene and the culture,” she said. “This has been a really great honor, especially given that that African music is moving to heights that has never been seen before, and Billboard is one of the key players in moving that needle forward.”

EMPIRE founder and CEO Ghazi Shami was the recipient of the coveted Clive Davis Visionary Award, joining TDE's Punch and Top Dawg (2024), Bang Si-hyuk (2023) and Joe Smith (2014) as honorees. Named after the iconic recording executive, the prize was presented by Nigerian musician and YNBL label boss Olamide, and follows EMPIRE alum Shaboozey's record-busting stay atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 2024 with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”


	Collecting the award, Ghazi said: “I often tell people that EMPIRE is a philanthropy company masquerading as a record label. I truly believe that in my heart. It wasn't always that way. Being a visionary means you see a need in your community and you try and figure out how to serve that need. I felt that the San Francisco and the Bay Area community had a void in the music distribution space and fast-forward 15 years later, I'm blessed to say we built a global operation that reaches the four corners of the earth. We have employees in 25 countries and have probably the most diverse staff in the music business by design and intention.”


	He added, “I grew up as an immigrant kid in San Francisco with Palestinian parents who were refugees of war, and sometimes as a child I often felt like I was invisible. How would I be seen in a world that didn't see me? I took the initiative to build a company where everyone could be seen and everyone could be heard and I always like to tell people that if you're excellent they can't deny your existence.”

A Seoul court granted a request by the group's agency, ADOR, to prevent members from performing without prior approval. A second hearing is scheduled for Thursday (June 5).

	Billboard Korea



The ongoing dispute between K-pop breakout group NewJeans and its agency ADOR, a HYBE subsidiary, escalated this week as the Seoul Central District Court approved a stricter legal measure restricting the group's independent activities. 


	In a ruling issued Friday (May 31), the court granted ADOR's request for indirect compulsory enforcement, ordering each member of the group — Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein — to pay 1 billion KRW ($734,000) for every unauthorized entertainment activity carried out without the company's approval. The ruling applies per violation, per person, meaning the members could be collectively fined up to  5 billion KRW (approx. $3.6 million) for a single unapproved group appearance. 


	“Since NewJeans violated the obligations set by the injunction by performing under a new group name and even releasing new songs before and after the injunction ruling, it is necessary to impose indirect compulsory enforcement to ensure compliance with the order,” the court added. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The decision follows the group's March appearance under the name NJZ at ComplexCon Hong Kong, where the five performed a new track titled “Pit Stop.” According to court documents, that performance, along with the release of new content, was deemed a breach of an earlier injunction that barred independent activities. 


	“Until a verdict on the first trial on the ongoing lawsuit regarding the validity of NewJeans' exclusive contracts is delivered, the members are prohibited from engaging in any entertainment-related activities without ADOR's prior approval,” the court stated. 


	The second hearing in that case is scheduled for Thursday (June 5), and a final decision is expected to significantly shape the future of both the group and the structure of idol contracts within K-pop. All eyes are now on the upcoming hearing, which could define not only NewJeans' future but also reshape expectations for artist-agency relationships in the K-pop industry.

If it was meant to silence the trolls then, well, it has had the opposite effect.

The extraordinary 80-second video of the Duchess of Sussex, posted on Instagram to mark Princess Lilibet's fourth birthday, shows a heavily pregnant Meghan twerking. She is lip-syncing and gyrating to the Baby Mama Dance – a song that became a TikTok trend in which pregnant women showcased their dance moves – with a couple of clumsy cameos from Prince Harry.

The video, shot in a hospital room, has been seen by some as a response to the absurd conspiracy theory that has swirled online since the birth of Archie in 2019: namely, that both Meghan's pregnancies were fake.

“Four years ago today,” reads the caption beneath the video.

Meghan writes: “Both of our children were a week past their due dates... so when spicy food, all that walking, and acupuncture didn't work – there was only one thing left to do!”

Some commentators – including The Telegraph's own Camilla Tominey – have weighed in to say that, in labour, dropping it “down down low” probably isn't the only thing left to do. For most women, in fact, the 40th week of a pregnancy is the point in their lives at which they'd be least likely to countenance such a move.

The video, meanwhile, has only fuelled cruel rumours circulating on X, YouTube and Reddit: that Meghan was never really pregnant. 

According to these claims, she wore a “Moonbump” – a brand of prosthetic baby bump – for photo opportunities, and hired a surrogate to carry her two children, now aged six and four, who are sixth and seventh in line to the throne respectively.

It should go without saying that these theories are both baseless and bonkers. Social media sleuths, however, claim to have analysed the video of Meghan and Harry dancing and taken it as further evidence that she was never pregnant at all.

For instance, they cite the lumpen shape under her black dress as proof of a prosthetic belly. This is easily debunked when I ask a midwife: “This is likely to be cardiotocography [CTG] equipment, which continuously monitors the baby's heart rate and the mother's contractions,” she says. 

“We use it in higher risk labours [Meghan has spoken about how she has preeclampsia].” Two sensors are placed on the mother's abdomen and secured round her bump with a strap.

The theories only grow more outlandish. One claims that if Meghan had truly been pregnant, she wouldn't have been wearing a cannula in what they call “a very weird place.” In reality, the Duchess's cannula, placed halfway up her arm, is standard practice.

Another false claim insists that the Baby Mama Dance didn't become a trend until 2023 or 2024, despite online examples dating back to 2018. “Unless Harry & Meghan can predict the future, how were they doing a dance in 2021 when it didn't exist as a trend?” one social media user wrote.

Conspiracy theorists have also taken issue with her weight in the clip, suggesting that although her bump is large, the rest of her seems too slim to be pregnant. Meghan recently revealed on her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, that she “gained 65lb” (around four stone) in both her pregnancies. It doesn't look like it from the video, say the trolls. But Meghan wouldn't be the first pregnant woman whose weight gain appeared confined to her bump.

There is an even more obvious rebuttal to some of the questions raised about the video, too: that extended labour can send you slightly doolally. It may not occur to most heavily pregnant women to film themselves twerking but, then, who can say they made it through an overdue pregnancy without behaviour that was at least a little out of character?

“I did this exact same thing to the same song,” one X user, Drea Humphrey, posted in Meghan's defence on Thursday. “When you're that pregnant you don't care about looking bizarre.” Perhaps it seems odder still to have filmed this private moment – but Meghan was apparently partaking in an online trend in which thousands of other women posted similar videos.

Nevertheless, posts peddling these conspiracy theories have racked up tens of thousands of views – in some cases, millions. By posting a video with more “proof,” Meghan has inadvertently added fuel to the fire.

“Generally, the more you try and refute a conspiracy theory, the more you fuel the idea that there's something to it,” explains Sander van der Linden, prof of social psychology at the University of Cambridge.

“It legitimises it – why would you respond unless it's something credible? There are some exceptions, where people can successfully dismiss conspiracy theories with humour and sarcasm, which is maybe what [Meghan] was attempting to do here.”

Unfortunately, though, all it has done is provide conspiracy theorists with more material to work with. “In an age where all videos are suspect in terms of being AI-manipulated, it creates an extra cloud of confusion,” van der Linden says.

“It provides lots of material for people to cling onto, saying, ‘Look, she's wearing a prosthetic bump,' or suggesting videos are deepfakes.”

For a woman who has spoken candidly about the devastating impact online trolling has had, these rumours must be particularly hard for Meghan to take. Perhaps that's why this isn't the first time she appears to have attempted to debunk them: last month, in an Instagram mood board posted to celebrate her seventh wedding anniversary to Harry, she included an ultrasound photo and a picture of her bare bump.

These, too, were extensively analysed, with anonymous users claiming her stomach was too “shiny” and looked like a prosthetic, and that the ultrasound picture, which did not have a date or name on it, was faked.

These wild theories first emerged online in 2019 in the period before Prince Archie's birth. Photos of Meghan cradling her bump, which were regularly mocked by the tabloid media, sparked the outlandish hypothesis that she was wearing an inflatable belly. Trolls pored over videos of Meghan on official royal duties for any slips, folds or odd movements as proof.

The conspiracy theory initially appeared “on some obscure social media platform where people were congregating who hated Meghan and then made its way into the mainstream,” says van der Linden.

“There's an element of unfamiliarity here with pregnancies of women of colour in particular – there is less representation in the media and on TV shows and there's no clear benchmark. You see the same with Beyoncé, for example [who was subject to similar trolling]. If there's some uncertainty in terms of what people expect to see, there's more potential for rumour and exploitation.”

The couple continued to break with royal tradition, as Archie was born at the Portland Hospital on Great Portland Street, rather than the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Prince Harry, the Prince of Wales, and Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were all born.

Meghan and Harry initially kept Archie's birth a secret – even from Buckingham Palace officials – and also did away with the time-honoured royal ritual of a photoshoot on the steps of the hospital, prompting the scurrilous online rumour that Meghan hadn't actually given birth at all.

When they did have a photoshoot at Windsor two days after Archie's birth, some went so far as to claim the newborn shots were faked using a hyper-realistic doll, and that Kensington Palace posted a hastily deleted tweet announcing he was born via surrogate. Meghan later revealed that this pregnancy was marked by mental health struggles, making the cruel rumours an especially bitter pill to swallow.

When it comes to wild theories about their family life, the couple's quest for privacy has become a double-edged sword. Carefully curated personal revelations, along with family photos and videos they share, are subjected to intense and feverish scrutiny.

When they uploaded Meghan's twerking video, even if it wasn't meant as a response to the bizarre rumours, the couple must have known social media vigilantes would comb through it for clues.

For most of the rest of us, though, it's the cringe factor of the video that stands out above all else.

Mark Millar is finding new ways to sell his new comic book Psychic Sam with John Romita Jr on Kickstarter

When he's not pretending that he's working for Marvel or DC Comics, Mark Millar has been pushing his new comic book series with John Romita Jr, Psychic Sam from his new company Side Hustle Comics. Such as the pencils for the Psychic Sam trading cards from the Kickstarter campaign. As Millar says, "When I was 7 we had Star Wars cards and Luke posing with a big smile, Han and Chewie pointing their weapons at us. When I was 8 we had the Christopher Reeve Superman cards and on the front we had Superman saving a train or standing beside the American flag. Now we have a man who hears voices in his head murdering the people the voices tell him to in various violent ways. I regard this as progress."

 

He has no Dark Horse or Netflix-funded PR campaign for this one. He's also been doing the Comicsgate YouTube guest circuit pushing the book to the vice signallers, and also had Rob Liefeld on his own Millar Time podcast last week. Sadly, Rob Liefeld did not mention how much he hates John Romita Jr's art and finds it "blocky, blocky, blocky". Maybe he could do that when he comes back on Millar Time? And Mark Millar reiterates that you can find him on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, "but I don't bother with the other ones, which seemed to become the Phantom Zone for all the craziest mofos who left Twitter!" Is that what you call Blue Sky thinking? He must get some angry click-throughs from that one.

"SAM NICOLETTI hears a voice in his head the day before something bad happens. The voice tells him the name and address of a murderer and if he ignores this voice an innocent person dies. At first he thought he was crazy, but as the bodies start building up, he realises he needs to do something and, after a while, he hears about a murder that's SO HORRIFIC he needs to intervene. What would YOU do in this situation? You call the cops and they think you're crazy because nothing bad has happened yet. But unless you take matters into your own hands, innocent people are going to SUFFER."

For reasons still unknown, Earth's energy imbalance is rising much faster than models can account for. Now, scientists are calling for long-term investment in monitoring capability, so that they can make informed predictions about climate change.

Earth's energy imbalance is growing faster than anyone expected — and scientists don't understand why.

To complicate matters several NASA satellites that provide the highest-resolution picture of this imbalance are nearing the end of their lives, and researchers fear their lone replacement isn't sufficient. In the worst case scenario, scientists could lose one of the leading indicators of climate change, as the next-best way of measuring the energy imbalance has a lag of about 10 years.

"What we get from [these] satellites is roughly one decade faster data, so that's why it's so critical," Thorsten Mauritsen, a professor in the department of meteorology at Stockholm University in Sweden and the lead author of a commentary on the issue, told Live Science. "The absolute best option is that NASA continues."

Earth's energy imbalance is the difference between the amount of energy our planet receives from the sun and the amount it radiates outward into space. The imbalance is mainly caused by our emissions of greenhouse gases, which trap a portion of the energy radiating from Earth inside the atmosphere, driving temperatures up.

Satellite data suggest Earth's energy imbalance has more than doubled over the past two decades, massively exceeding the increase predicted by climate models. In 2023, the imbalance reached 1.8 watts per square meter (0.16 watts per square foot), which was twice what models estimated based on rising greenhouse gas emissions, according to the commentary, which was published May 10 in the journal AGU Advances — but scientists still aren't sure why there has been such an increase in the imbalance recently.

"We were starting to see this large trend in the last few years, and it just grew and grew," Mauritsen said. "We were both worried about the big trend, and then on the other hand that we are possibly about to lose capability to observe this."

For several years, researchers have puzzled over satellite readings of Earth's energy imbalance. At first, it seemed like the numbers might be reflecting the variability of the system and changes due to climate patterns such as El Niño, Mauritsen said.

But as the imbalance continued to grow faster than climate models could account for, scientists began to suspect that something bigger was happening. "When it just continued afterwards, I started to get worried," Mauritsen said.

Earth's inflated energy imbalance is likely due to a decline in Earth's solar reflectivity — that is, in the amount of energy the planet radiates to space. This decline could be due to a number of reasons, Mauritsen said, including a reduction of reflective surfaces like ice sheets and a decrease in the quantity of reflective particles, or aerosols, from activities like shipping. But the actual reasons remain mysterious.

"Something is missing [from the models], but we don't really know right now what it is," Mauritsen said.



Regardless of why Earth's energy imbalance is growing so rapidly, the implications are alarming. "The larger the imbalance is, the faster climate change happens," Mauritsen said. "If we have more imbalance, that means more energy accumulating, [so] temperatures rise faster."

Earth's energy imbalance is also an important indicator of how far humans have pushed the climate system already, and of what it will take to balance it again.

"We expect temperatures to stabilize after we stop burning fossil fuels, roughly," Mauritsen said. "But if that imbalance stays very high, then it pushes further that temperature level that we can stabilize at. That means we have less CO2 left that we can emit before we get to 2 degrees Celsius [or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming], for example."

Satellite readings from 2024 indicate that the rate at which Earth's energy imbalance is growing has returned to levels predicted by climate models — but there's no telling what will happen in 2025 and beyond. "It may be in the coming years that we stay at these more expected levels," Mauritsen said. "If it does bounce up to those high levels [again], then I'm not sure where we're heading."

To measure Earth's energy imbalance, scientists need satellites equipped with the right instruments. Four such satellites are currently operational and form part of NASA's CERES mission, and these are scheduled to be replaced in 2027 by the follow-on Libera mission, according to the new commentary.



But Libera has only one satellite, and scientists worry that instrument failures could introduce gaps in the data, Mauritsen said — and without continuous and overlapping readings from different satellites, it will be much harder to piece together the evolution of Earth's energy imbalance.

NASA also has no formal plan to continue monitoring the imbalance once the Libera mission ends, and other instruments aboard the International Space Station have limited mission lifetimes, according to the commentary.

Ocean temperature data give some indication of Earth's energy imbalance, but these records only reveal trends a decade after they have happened, and give a much less spatially-refined picture of the imbalance, Mauritsen said.

The agency is brimming with ideas that could advance climate science, but new budget cuts by the Trump administration may put a wrench in the works. For example, NASA scientists recently came up with a "really cool" idea to measure Earth's energy imbalance with spherical satellites, Mauritsen said. These satellites would carry accelerometers capable of measuring radiation from all angles, and then integrating the different sources to calculate the energy imbalance.

In the new commentary, Mauritsen and dozens of researchers from institutions across the world call for improved monitoring capability and more research into the evolution of Earth's energy imbalance.

"It tells us how far we are from stabilizing Earth's climate, and that's why we need to measure it," Mauritsen said. "If we don't know this, then we are driving our climate system blindfolded."

Germany's Wendelstein 7-X stellarator has set a new benchmark for fusion reactors, bringing commercial, near-limitless clean energy one step closer to reality.

A recently concluded experimental campaign at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in Greifswald, Germany has smashed previous fusion records and set a new benchmark for reactor performances.

Nuclear fusion offers a tantalizing promise of unlimited clean energy. By smashing together isotopes (or different versions) of hydrogen at incredibly high temperatures, the resulting superheated plasma of electrons and ions fuses into heavier atoms, releasing a phenomenal amount of energy in the process.

However, while this fusion reaction is self-sustaining under the extraordinary temperatures and pressures within stars, recreating these conditions on Earth is a huge technical challenge — and current reactor concepts still consume more energy than they are able to produce.

Stellarators are one of the most promising reactor designs, so named for their mimicry of reactions in the sun. They use powerful external magnets to control the high-energy plasma within a ring-shaped vacuum chamber and maintain a stable, high pressure. Unlike simpler tokamak reactors — which pass a high current through the plasma to generate the required magnetic field — stellarators' external magnets are better at stabilizing the plasma through the fusion reactions, a feature that will ultimately be necessary when translating the technology to commercial power plants.

In the recent experiments, the W7-X stellarator outperformed previous benchmarks set by the decommissioned tokamak reactors JT60U in Japan and JET in the UK, especially over how long the plasma can be sustained.

Most notably, the international team revealed that the reactor had reached a new record high triple product — a key metric for the success of fusion power generators. The triple product is a combination of the density of particles in the plasma, the temperature required for these particles to fuse, and the energy confinement time (a measure of how well the thermal energy is held by the system). A certain minimum value called the Lawson criterion marks the point at which the reaction produces more energy than it uses and becomes self-sustaining, so a higher triple product indicates a more efficient reaction.

"The new record is a tremendous achievement by the international team," said Thomas Klinger, Head of Operations at Wendelstein 7-X and Head of Stellarator Dynamics and Transport at IPP in a statement. "Elevating the triple product to tokamak levels during long plasma pulses marks another important milestone on the way toward a power-plant-capable stellarator."

Key to the success of this latest milestone was the development of a new fuel pellet injector that combined continuous refueling of the reactor with pulsed heating to maintain the required plasma temperature. Over a 43-second period, 90 frozen hydrogen pellets were fired into the plasma at up to 2,600 feet (800 metres) per second, roughly the speed of a bullet. Pre-programmed pulses of powerful microwaves heated the plasma, which reached a peak temperature of 30 million degrees C, and this coordination between the microwave pulses and the pellet injection crucially extended how long the plasma could be stably maintained.

—Just a fraction of the hydrogen hidden beneath Earth's surface could power Earth for 200 years, scientists find

This same campaign also increased the energy turnover of the reaction to 1.8 gigajoules over a six-minute run, smashing the reactor's previous record of 1.3 gigajoules from February 2023. Energy turnover is a combination of the heating power and plasma duration of a fusion reactor and an indication of the reactor's ability to sustain the high-energy plasma. It is therefore another crucial parameter for future power plant operation. The new value even exceeds the record achieved by the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) in China earlier this year, further evidencing stellarators' potential.

"The records of this experimental campaign are much more than mere numbers. They represent a significant step forward in validating the stellarator concept—made possible through outstanding international collaboration," summarized Robert Wolf, Head of Stellarator Heating and Optimization at IPP in statement.

Home - News - Lithium deposits are of «extraterrestrial» origin — scientists analyze chemical composition

Oleksandr Fedotkin

Author of news and articles

Scientists from Duke University in the United States have found that lithium-rich brine solutions contain a high concentration of boron.

This chemical composition distinguishes lithium salt brines from other saline waters, such as ocean water. This discovery could change the way lithium is mined and the way wastewater generated from mining is managed. 

Currently, about 40% of global lithium production is concentrated in the so-called «lithium triangle» in South America and the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. In these regions, lithium is extracted from underground salt pools.

«We found that the pH of the brines in these regions is almost entirely determined by boron, unlike seawater and other conventional saline waters. It's a completely different geochemical landscape, as if you were studying an extraterrestrial planet», — says study leader professor Avner Vengosh.

The pH of a solution determines its level of acidity or alkalinity. In most natural waters, chemical reactions involving the carbonate molecule affect the pH level, determining alkalinity. However, scientists have discovered that in a large salt lake Salar de Uyuni on the plateau in Bolivia, under which the world's largest lithium-rich salt solutions are located, completely different chemical reactions take place. 

The researchers analyzed the pH and chemical composition of the brines and salts associated with mining on the Uyuni salt marsh. Lithium mining typically involves pumping natural brine from the ground to a series of shallow above-ground ponds. The liquid evaporates from these ponds, leaving a concentrated brine containing lithium and boron. 

The scientists found that the pH level in the natural brine samples was close to neutral. However, the brine samples from evaporation ponds had very high acidity levels. The modeling results showed that high boron concentration was a key factor in the pH level in both cases. 

Natural brines contain high levels of boron in the form of boric acid and borates, the relative distribution of which determines the pH level. Evaporation in the ponds increases the total boron concentration and leads to the breakdown of boric acid, generating hydrogen ions that lower the pH. 

«As a result of a series of geochemical reactions, carbonate alkalinity in the brine from the Uyuni salt marsh decreases, while boric alkalinity begins to prevail», — says the lead author of the study from the Vengosh laboratory Gordon Williams. 

To support their findings, the researchers collected data from more than 300 analyses of lithium-rich solutions from various salt basins, including those in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, and the Tibetan Plateau. The modeling results showed that boron had the greatest impact on alkalinity and pH in most brines. 

«In addition to our new data, we have compiled a geochemical database of lithium brines from around the world and have consistently found that boron is often a key component of brine alkalinity and controls its pH, confirming the results obtained at the Uyuni salt marsh in Bolivia», — Gordon Williams added.

According to the researchers, their work has demonstrated for the first time the role of boron in the chemical changes that occur during the evaporation of lithium brine in salt vats. The results may provide information on future lithium mining technologies as the world explores ways to extract lithium more efficiently and safely waste water management.

Better communication is essential to counter misconceptions, biases and lack of accurate information.


Drawing on expertise of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Horizon 2020 projects, the European Policy Centre and the European University Institute, a new JRC report on navigating migration narratives provides communication professionals with evidence-based recommendations, insights and tools to navigate the complex and often polarised discourse on migration. 

The report serves as a call to action for policymakers and communicators to work together to promote a more informed and balanced public debate on migration. 

The experts emphasise the need for better public communication on migration. This approach should involve providing clear, factual and transparent information about EU migration trends and dynamics, explaining complex concepts, asylum processes and terminology and clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of EU institutions and Member States. 

The report also highlights the importance of having open and honest conversations about both the challenges and opportunities linked to migration, acknowledging and addressing citizens' legitimate concerns, for instance linked to job competition and distribution of national resources. The recommendations emphasise the need for balanced messages that take account of the diversity of public opinions and concerns and point to frequent citizen dialogues to better understand citizens' concerns. 

The report and its five case studies provide a valuable resource for promoting a more informed and balanced public debate on migration. Specifically, it offers a comprehensive analysis of migration narratives and their impact on public opinion, as well as evidence-based recommendations for improving communication on migration. 

The report shows that the public discussion around migration in Europe is shaped by simplified and biased narratives, which are often used to serve political purposes. These narratives can be misleading and create a distorted view of reality, influencing public perception and policy decisions. 

The report notes that discussions about migration are often stuck in one of two positions: one that sympathises with migrants and another that emphasises the challenges they pose to host societies. Both perspectives, whether positive or negative, tend to focus on the problems associated with migration. The authors highlight the need for a more nuanced conversation about migration, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of the issue, and acknowledging both the benefits and challenges that migration can bring to individuals, communities and societies as a whole. 

Emotions play a significant role in shaping people's perceptions and behaviours, making it difficult to change people's understanding and reasoning of an issue once negative emotions are triggered. Populist movements exploit the elicitation of strong, negative emotions to create a sense of crisis.  

The report also includes a social media analysis which finds that the most common narrative systematically promoted by populists in migration-related social media posts is one that pits the messenger, their party and their supporters against a perceived political elite, which is depicted as out-of-touch, ineffective and failing to act in the interest of citizens.  

In this narrative, not only are national political rivals condemned, but the European Commission and the European Union as a whole are portrayed as incapable of managing migration. The messenger, on the other hand, is positioned as the voice of the people - a capable and competent agent of change who will bring stability and security to the immigration landscape. 

The report notes that the rise of populism is making more moderate politicians wary of appearing weak and losing public support. As a result, many politicians feel compelled to choose between capitalising on the same fears that populists are exploiting, or advocate for rational, technocratic solutions, which often contribute to a mixed narrative. Within this narrative, migrants are recognised as victims, but there is a persistent emphasis on keeping them away.  

The report argues that in the EU, populist movements have successfully framed migration as a crisis, evoking fear and insecurity by portraying immigration as being “out of control” and the EU's borders as insecure and "wide open" to unchecked immigration, thereby mobilising public support and shaping policy debates.  

The Great Replacement theory, which portrays immigration as an "invasion", has increasingly infiltrated mainstream, conservative and right-wing political discourse. This narrative, which suggests that native populations are being intentionally replaced by immigrants, has gained significant traction in mainstream and conservative discourse. Alarmingly, a growing number of ordinary people in believe in this theory. A 2017 poll found that 48% of French voters thought that a population replacement either would or might happen in France, and a 2021 poll found that 61% believed this. 

The report emphasises that conspiracy theories, such as those surrounding mass migration and population replacement, provide a sense of control and understanding for individuals who feel powerless and disenfranchised. These narratives tap into deep-seated fears about losing cultural, ethnic and national identity, triggering a defensive response. By offering a simplistic explanation for complex events, conspiracy theories give people a sense of agency and belonging, allowing them to make sense of their circumstances. 

The authors note that this type of divisive narrative often exploits the confusion over migration terminology and people's scarce understanding of asylum procedures. It emphasises the need for a comprehensive approach to better inform citizens, address concerns about migration and counter disinformation.  

Regardless of public opinion and political perspective, migration and the issues around it will continue to be a complex and controversial topic. The JRC and its partners are working to ensure that the public discussion can take place based on facts and evidenced based data, to provide all sides of the debate with clarity. This factually accurate, evidence-based approach is essential for developing effective policies to manage the risks as well as the opportunities posed by migration.  

This JRC Science for Policy Report is published in conjunction with a JRC Technical Report on Public perceptions of fairness in the European migration and asylum system, which describes the results and findings of a survey conducted by the JRC in eight EU Member States, and an independent expert report on Mis- and disinformation on migration, which both feed into this Science for Policy report.

A team of physicists from the University at Albany has proposed scientifically rigorous methods for documenting and analyzing Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) building upon the work of numerous past and present researchers in the field.

The team tested their methods in the field for the first time and reported their findings in Progress in Aerospace Sciences.

UAP is the term used by government agencies like NASA to refer to "observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena."

Utilizing a diverse set of devices to capture different types of data on many channels, UAlbany authors Matthew Szydagis, Kevin Knuth and Cecilia Levy, along with Ben Kugielsky of UAPx, a non-profit scientific research organization, collected observable-light and infrared images during a field expedition in 2021 to Laguna Beach, California.

The team also used weather radar data and radiation detectors to create a robust framework for documenting and testing potentially anomalous phenomena that moves away from reliance on eyewitness testimony and similarly subjective methods.

"Following on from the recent joint Congressional subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena, the study of UAP is slowly moving from the fringe to the mainstream of scientific study," said Szydagis, lead author and an associate professor of physics at UAlbany.

"As this process moves forward, it's critical that future study of UAPs follows a rigorous, repeatable method that can be tested and confirmed by other researchers. We aim to establish a roadmap for these efforts with this paper."

Szydagis noted the combination of tools and data sets his team relied on during the study included the first use of National Weather Service public Doppler weather radar data to corroborate observations from other instruments, the introduction of coincidence timing between detectors to determine whether potential anomalies were simultaneously recorded by multiple instruments, and a radiation-detection tool known as the Cosmic Watch to determine whether anomalies observed on infrared cameras were accompanied by detectable ionizing radiation.

To help analyze the data from the infrared cameras, Szydagis developed new software, Custom Target Analysis Protocol (C-TAP), which combines artificial intelligence with human verification to do a pixel-by-pixel analysis of successive camera frames to study differences and distinguish actual observations from digital noise in the camera images—similar to an approach used by physicists like him and Levy to look for direct evidence of dark matter.

The researchers coupled this data with robust trigonometric calculations to identify and exclude known objects in the night sky, such as the International Space Station.

Ultimately, the UAlbany research team succeeded in plausibly explaining all but one of the potential anomalies detected—demonstrating that their method is effective and completing important field-testing of the equipment and analysis software.

"While we did not find evidence indicating that UAP have anything to do with non-human intelligence, we still cannot fully explain our one remaining ambiguity, or potential anomaly, which was a collection of bright white dots within a dark spot seen in multiple videos," Szydagis said.

The special edition of Progress in Aerospace Sciences includes a comprehensive review of studies conducted on UAPs from 1933 to the present, including more than 20 historical government and privately funded projects, as well as recent scientific research efforts in Ireland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States.

That article, "The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP)," aims to clarify the current and historical scientific narrative around UAP and highlight that UAP/UFOs are longstanding global phenomena that have been observed and recorded for well over 150 years, that UAP/UFOs have been observed and studied by astronomers, scientists, and engineers, and that there are currently several serious academic efforts in multiple countries working to collect hard scientific data on UAP using modern instrumentation.

Knuth is lead author of the article, which was co-written by Szydagis and more than 30 other researchers from around the world.

"Given the longstanding, global nature of the UAP/UFO question, the air safety and security implications of their presence, and the potentially profound importance of their nature, studying and understanding these phenomena is of great and urgent importance," Knuth said.

A team of scientists, led by astrophysicist Daniel Apai from the University of Arizona, has developed a novel framework to assess the habitability of exoplanets-planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system. Traditionally, the search for extraterrestrial life has focused on the presence of water. However, Apai's team introduces a more comprehensive model that considers various factors, including temperature and metabolic viability, to determine if known or hypothetical organisms could survive on distant worlds.

This new approach, detailed in their recent publication, emphasizes evaluating specific environmental conditions of exoplanets to assess their potential to support life. By moving beyond the simplistic criteria of water presence, the model aims to provide a more accurate assessment of a planet's habitability.

According to The Metro, Apai's work is part of the broader "Alien Earths" project, funded by NASA's Astrobiology Program. This interdisciplinary initiative seeks to identify and characterize potentially habitable planets around nearby stars, guiding future missions in the search for life beyond Earth.

He wrote in The Conversation. "Even on Earth, organisms require different conditions to survive - there are no camels in Antarctica. By talking about specific organisms, we made the question easier to answer."

"Second, the quantitative habitability framework does not insist on black-or-white answers. It compares computer models to calculate a probabilistic answer. Instead of assuming that liquid water is a key limiting factor, we compare our understanding of the conditions an organism requires (the "organism model") with our understanding of the conditions present in the environment (the "habitat model")."

Apai's team developed a model to assess habitability by evaluating an organism's needs beyond water. For example, camels require hot, dry climates, so the model correctly rates icy Antarctica as unsuitable. Testing the model on TRAPPIST-1e-like exoplanets, they assessed methanogens-ancient microbes-and found a 69% habitat suitability. This indicates such planets may support simple life forms and are strong candidates for further study.
