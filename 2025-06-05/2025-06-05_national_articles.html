                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Senators are avoiding direct criticism of Elon Musk, who supported President Donald Trump's campaign but has come out against Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts as a “disgusting abomination.” President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 30, 2025, in Washington.

Elon Musk attends a news conference with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 30, 2025, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Elon Musk's alliance took off like one of SpaceX's rockets. The spectacular flameout Thursday hit a crescendo when Trump threatened to cut Musk's government contracts and Musk said without providing evidence that Trump's administration hasn't released all the records related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein because Trump is mentioned in them. It came less than a week after they appeared together at the White House for a subdued goodbye and Trump thanked Musk for his brief time in the U.S. government by handing him a symbolic but nonfunctional golden key. Trump had largely remained silent as Musk stewed over the last few days on his social media platform X, condemning the president's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.” But Trump clapped back Thursday in the Oval Office, saying he was “very disappointed in Musk.” “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,” Trump wrote on his social media network. That is the real reason they have not been made public. The insinuation tapped into long-standing suspicions among conspiracy theorists and online sleuths that incriminating and sensitive files in the government's possession have yet to be released. The deepening rift unfurled much like their relationship started — rapidly, intensely and very publicly. It also quickly hit Musk financially, even before Trump's threat. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Elon Musk in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 30, 2025, in Washington. After Trump started speaking about Musk, shares of his electric vehicle company Tesla fell over 10%, their latest notable move since the election. The shares doubled in the weeks after Trump was elected, gave back those gains and more during Musk's time at DOGE and then rallied after he vowed in April to focus much more on Tesla and his other companies. Musk offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk retorted. Musk announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally last July. Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October. Once Trump was elected, the tech billionaire stood behind him as he took the oath of office, flew with him on Air Force One for weekend stays at Mar-a-Lago, slept in the White House's Lincoln Bedroom and joined his Cabinet meetings wearing a MAGA hat (sometimes more than one). Three months ago, Trump purchased a red Tesla from Musk on the White House driveway as a public show of support for his business as it faced blowback. Musk bid farewell to Trump last week in a somewhat somber news conference in the Oval Office, where he sported a black eye that he said came from his young son but that seemed to be a metaphor for his messy time in government service. Trump, who rarely misses an opportunity to zing his critics on appearance, brought it up Thursday. The Republican president's comments came as Musk has griped for days on social media about Trump's spending bill, warning that it will increase the federal deficit. “He hasn't said bad about me personally, but I'm sure that will be next,” Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office, presaging his future. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, June 5, 2025, in Washington. Trump later said on social media that “Elon was ‘wearing thin,' I asked him to leave.” Musk's government employment status, however, limited him from continuing to work. Observers had long wondered if the friendship between the two brash billionaires known for lobbing insults online would flame out in spectacular fashion. He said some people who leave his administration “miss it so badly” and “actually become hostile.” He brushed aside the billionaire's efforts to get him elected last year, including a $1 million-a-day voter sweepstakes in Pennsylvania. The surge of cash Musk showed he was willing to spend seemed to set him up as a highly coveted ally for Republicans going forward, but his split with Trump, the party's leader, raises questions about whether they or any others will see such a campaign windfall in the future. Trump said Musk “only developed a problem” with the bill because it rolls back tax credits for electric vehicles. “False,” Musk fired back on his social media platform as the president continued speaking. “This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!” Besides Musk being “disturbed” by the electric vehicle tax credits, Trump said another point of contention was Musk's promotion of Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Trump withdrew Isaacman's nomination over the weekend, days after Musk left his government role. “I didn't think it was appropriate,” Trump said Thursday, calling Isaacman “totally a Democrat.” He shared some posts Trump made over a decade ago criticizing Republicans for their spending, musings made when he, too, was just a billionaire lobbing his thoughts on social media.</p>

The ‘Outnumbered' panel weighs in after Chinese nationals were charged with smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen into the United States. In response to the Department of Justice charging two Chinese nationals – including a University of Michigan research fellow – with allegedly smuggling a potential "agroterrorism" weapon into the U.S., national security experts tell Fox News Digital that the Trump administration must continue to take action to prevent American colleges and companies from "essentially educating and arming our chief adversary in the world." "In some cases, it seems like we learned nothing from COVID," Christian Whiton, a former senior foreign policy advisor in the Bush and Trump administrations, told Fox News Digital. "We allow direct flights now from China to the U.S. mainland. The two Chinese nationals were charged Tuesday with smuggling Fusarium graminearum fungus, a dangerous biological pathogen and "known agroterrorism agent" responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year, through Detroit's airport. The noxious substance causes "head blight," a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, according to federal prosecutors. "It's a new take on Chinese espionage and sabotage of the US economy. I think that China has failed to pull back on any of its aggressive activity. And this is something that the Trump administration probably wants to take into consideration," Whiton said of the case. Chinese Nationals Charged with Conspiracy and Smuggling a Dangerous Biological Pathogen into the U.S. for their Work at a University of Michigan Laboratory (Detroit Free Press/IMAGN) Whiton told Fox News Digital that Chinese infiltration of U.S. institutions has been happening since at least the 1990s – when Chinese spies stole American nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico – and since then, "there's been this systemic desire to put Chinese nationals into especially these technical areas, technical universities." He categorized the H1-B visa program as essentially a "scam," asserting that about a quarter are awarded to Chinese nationals who "end up at some of our high-tech companies." Traditionally, Whiton explained, Republicans have believed universities should run themselves without political interference, but doing so has allowed such institutions to be taken over by left-wingers. Things like we shouldn't train our enemies at taxpayer expense," Whiton said. "So, I think it goes along with Republicans being pretty wimpy in the past, but only more recently with the emergence of the new right and the MAGA movement finally taking a tougher stand on some of these left-wing universities." Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the United States does not want to de-couple with China, though Beijing has a choice whether to be a reliable partner. "So if we're looking for a change of Chinese conduct because of President Trump being in office, it just hasn't happened yet. So I can't say that's a surprise." Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would "aggressively" revoke the student visas for Chinese nationals, "including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields." After a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which the White House said focused mostly on trade, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that Chinese students were still coming and the U.S. would be "honored" to have them. Yet, the president said the students need to be properly "checked" and the administration wants lists of Chinese nationals admitted to schools, such as Harvard and Columbia, so that vetting can occur. "That's a step in the right direction," Whiton said. "But in reality, we probably need to recognize these are our chief economic and security adversary in the world and take those visa numbers down closer to zero and start sending these people home." Whiton said there is a "faulty assumption" that Chinese students would come to the United States, learn about American culture and bring an appreciation back home to China. "In reality, they sort of come over here, they're in a bubble, they pick up technical skills, and then they go back to China and put them to use for either the military directly or for corporations that are either utilized by the Chinese military or that are trying to undermine U.S. technology companies," Whiton said. "We really are essentially educating and arming our chief adversary in the world." Former Rep. Michelle Steel, a California Republican who served on the House foreign and intelligence committees, told Fox News Digital that Chinese students educated in the U.S. essentially return home without an appreciation for America. And they hate United States after that education. Guess what we are teaching in the universities? "They are studying some very sensitive things in our universities. We really had to vet them well." "They try to build their endowments, and they want to just show how big their research center is." She cited the case against former Chair of Harvard University's Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, Dr. Charles Lieber, who was convicted in 2023 of lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with the People's Republic of China's Thousand Talents Program and the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in Wuhan, China. Federal prosecutors said Lieber had been paid $1.5 million by the CCP and failed to report additional income of $50,000 payments per month from the WUT. "We cannot bring everybody in to these universities and studying together and helping to build CCP's military. That's just totally no-no, because you know what they're doing in the Pacific areas and African countries and South American countries. And we are the only one [who] can stop [it]. And I think President Trump is doing great job." She has advocated for legislation that would decrease the reporting requirement from $250,000 to $50,000. Steel also noted that Stanford University – located in the heart of Silicon Valley in California – has a relationship with China's Peking University, which in turn has ties to the Chinese military and "goes straight into the nuclear program." The current chair of the House Select Committee on the CCP, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., penned a letter to Stanford in March over concerns about U.S. universities "admitting large numbers of Chinese nationals into advanced STEM programs, potentially at the expense of qualified Americans."

Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addresses Democrats' criticism that DOGE is a 'big scam' and lays out his goals for the department's cuts 'The Story.' A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in grant funding for AmeriCorps and to reemploy thousands of employees, ruling that the administration's abrupt dismantling of the organization violated federal law. She also ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved funding for AmeriCorps programs, which were also slashed by DOGE earlier this year. Boardman sided with plaintiffs in ruling that the Trump administration likely violated administrative procedures by ordering the abrupt cancellations and terminations, without a proper notice or comment period. Protesters hold signs during a May Day demonstration and march in San Francisco, California. While the decision does not require the Trump administration to keep the jobs in place indefinitely, it does require it to provide adequate notice before doing so. AmeriCorps, an agency created by Congress more than two decades ago, had an operating budget of roughly $1 billion prior to this year, when it found itself squarely in the crosshairs of DOGE, the agency previously headed up by Elon Musk and tasked with eliminating wasteful spending. In granting the preliminary injunction Thursday, Boardman said the 24 states have adequately demonstrated they are likely to suffer "irreparable harm" from the gutting of AmeriCorps, absent court intervention, and that the balance of equities "heavily favors" plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief. The preliminary injunction comes after DOGE in April abruptly announced it would be putting roughly 85% of all AmeriCorps staffers on leave. It also announced mass Reduction of Force, or RIF, for AmeriCorps staff, and sent notice that they were planning to cut $400 million in grants and other funding from the agency. Plaintiffs alleged that the Trump administration and DOGE had acted beyond the scope of their authority in gutting AmeriCorps, an agency created by Congress, without proper notice. The news was praised on social media by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who described it as a victory, noting: "Over 200,000 AmeriCorps staff and volunteers work hard every day to care for our communities." "This ruling ensures their valuable work can continue," she said. Josh Shapiro said the decision to halt the cuts to AmeriCorps will "help communities respond to natural disasters, support seniors and veterans, and keep our trails clean across Pennsylvania."

Rand Paul, R-Ky., breaks down his findings about the TSA ‘Quiet Skies' program on ‘The Will Cain Show,' after reports alleged DNI Tulsi Gabbard was on the agency's watch list. EXCLUSIVE: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is ending the Quiet Skies program, which left some Americans subject to additional screenings at airport security. The department says the agency was overly politicized to either benefit or hurt specific people and ran a bill of roughly $200 million annually. The department says Quiet Skies has not prevented any terrorist attacks but will continue to use other methods to assure safe air travel. "It is clear that the Quiet Skies program was used as a political rolodex of the Biden Administration — weaponized against its political foes and exploited to benefit their well-heeled friends. I am calling for a Congressional investigation to unearth further corruption at the expense of the American people and the undermining of US national security," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during the Coast Guard Academy commencement in New London, Connecticut, on May 21. DHS says that the list of exemptions of people who avoid "security policies" included "foreign royal families, political elites, professional athletes, and favored journalists." The program that started in 2010 was seen as a terror prevention method, and it faced escalating scrutiny from the left and right, including groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). "TSA's critical aviation and security vetting functions will be maintained, and the Trump Administration will return TSA to its true mission of being laser-focused on the safety and security of traveling public. Travelers make their way through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on May 24, 2024. "The TSA is engaging in covert surveillance of travelers and raising a host of disturbing questions in the process. "Travelers deserve to know how this surveillance is being implemented, what its consequences are for Americans, and for how long the TSA is retaining the information it gathers. What we've seen so far is troubling, which is why we're demanding that the TSA hand over records it's been hiding from the public. This is a much needed step towards transparency and accountability for an agency with a track record of using unreliable and unscientific techniques, such as ‘behavior detection,' to screen and monitor travelers who have done nothing wrong," he added. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is flanked by FBI Director Kash Patel, left, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, March 25. DHS pointed out a specific situation in which William Shaheen, the husband of New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, was removed from the list after reaching out to the former head of TSA during the Biden administration in 2023, according to CBS News. DHS said that he "traveled with a known or suspected terrorist" three times. The senator's office confirmed to CBS News she had reached out to TSA after her husband dealt with intense security obstacles while flying, but was unaware of any specific lists her husband was or was not on. Fox News Digital reached out to Shaheen's office for comment. Cameron Arcand is a politics writer at Fox News Digital in Washington D.C.

TOKYO (AP) — Throngs of gamers stood in long lines outside of stores hours before they opened Thursday from Tokyo to New York City in hopes of snaring a long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2 video game console. Nintendo, which is counting on the Switch 2 to boost sagging sales, has added new social features meant to lure players into online gaming. The much anticipated Switch 2, being released around the world Thursday, is an upgrade to its eight-year-old predecessor with new social features meant to draw players into online gaming.

In the U.S., a chaotic pre-order process in April left some fans frustrated after the consoles quickly sold out. People lined up early Thursday at stores in hopes of buying one. Many of those waiting for the store to open had ordered online, but a few like Huo hoped for a chance at purchasing any extra inventory the store had. In Japan, the new consoles were sold through a competitive lottery system that Nintendo said got about 2.2 million applications. Koji Takahashi was among those who missed out on the official draw but he was selected in the second round of a lottery held by a major electronics retailer in Japan. He was first in line waiting outside the store, arriving four hours ahead of its opening. “I feel very sorry for those who weren't successful in the lottery. Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser told CBS Morning Plus today that the company is aware of the demand for its newest system and is working to get units into the hands of customers. “We have a steady supply of manufacturing that will be coming in, and we believe we'll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer, through Father's Day and then on into the holiday period also,” Bowser said. The new console comes with a larger and higher resolution screen than its predecessor, with improved processing power, offering smoother and more vivid graphics. It allows players to “communicate with friends and family while playing a game,” and lets them share their game screen with others. A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers. Staff and members of the public try the Nintendo Switch 2 during a launch event at an electronics retailer in Tokyo, Thursday, June 5, 2025. Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026. A Pokemon title and a Kirby game are also coming, as well as offerings from outside video game publishers. The Switch 2's rollout arrives at an uncertain time for much of the gaming industry due to new tariffs implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A sweeping new travel ban on citizens from a dozen nations was announced by the White House on Wednesday, reviving a defining effort from the first Trump administration to crack down on entries from specific countries. Trump said in a video posted Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.” The 12 countries targeted – plus seven more, which face partial restrictions – are mostly nations with frosty, adversarial or outwardly antagonistic relations with Washington. Many are either failed states or in the throes of repressive rule, and some are governed by groups that took control after years of US involvement in their affairs. Visa overstays have received renewed scrutiny since the Boulder, Colorado, attack last weekend against a group campaigning in solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Seven countries were included because the administration deemed they pose a “high level of risk” to the US: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. The travel ban does not target existing visa or green card holders, and it also features carve-outs for some visa categories and for people whose entry serves US interests. Its impact will vary greatly from country to country; some nations only receive a few hundred nonimmigrant visas per year, while others have seen hundreds of thousands of people enter the US in the past decade. Travel to the US has been fully restricted for citizens from Chad, Sudan, Libya, Eritrea, the Republic of Congo, Somalia and Equatorial Guinea. Meanwhile, a partial restriction has been imposed on nationals from Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone. The US does not issue a high number of visas to most of those countries – according to State Department data, only a few hundred or a few thousand people from each were granted immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in 2023. The White House said Somalia had been identified as a “terrorist safe haven,” led by a government that lacks “command and control of its territory.” This year, the US carried out airstrikes in Somalia against ISIS and affiliated targets, in a joint counterterrorism effort with the nation. Relations with Sudan have soured; last month, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on the military-led Sudanese government after finding that it used chemical weapons last year during its ongoing war with a rival military faction. The US has been unable to broker a ceasefire to end the conflict that has raged on for two years, leaving tens of thousands dead. The White House has also had a frosty relationship with Chad, which demanded the removal of American troops from its territory last year, as well as with Eritrea, whose military the Biden administration accused in 2023 of committing war crimes during a conflict in northern Ethiopia. Similar reprimands have been made by the US State Department against state and non-state actors in Libya, which it accused of committing crimes against humanity. The White House said Wednesday that Chad's overstay rate is “unacceptable and indicates a blatant disregard for U.S. immigration laws.” The President of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno, said on Facebook that he had told his government to “act in accordance with the principles of reciprocity” by suspending visas to citizens of the United States. “Chad has no planes to offer, no billions of dollars to give but Chad has his dignity and pride,” he added. Haiti has been in the grips of violent unrest for years. The violence has left more than one million Haitians internally displaced. Two other Latin American nations – Cuba and Venezuela – also face restrictions, though Trump stopped short of implementing a full ban. Trump in March revoked temporary humanitarian parole for about 300,000 Cubans, amid a record number of arrivals of migrants from the Caribbean island. On Thursday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla said the ban “has racist undertones” and “damages personal, professional, academic, and cultural exchanges between the two countries.” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto called the travel ban issued against Venezuelan nationals an “operation of hate and stigmatization,” in a statement released Thursday. For its reviled military leaders, it has brought opportunity Myanmar's ruling military junta has spent the past four years waging a brutal civil war across the Southeast Asian country, sending columns of troops on bloody rampages, torching and bombing villages, massacring residents, jailing opponents and forcing young men and women to join the army. The junta is headed by a widely reviled army chief who overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and installed himself as leader, and the nation was thrown into further turmoil by a devastating earthquake in March. But relations have improved dramatically this century, and the US-Laos partnership is one of the most stable and productive of all 19 countries targeted by Wednesday's ban. Egypt has long been a key US partner in the Middle East. Since 1978, the US has contributed more than $50 billion in military assistance to Egypt, according to the American embassy, though some of this aid has been occasionally withheld on account of the country's human rights record. “Egypt is a valued U.S. partner in counterterrorism, anti-trafficking, and regional security operations, which advance both U.S. and Egyptian security,” the US embassy said in 2023. Amnesty International called the travel ban based on nationality “discriminatory, racist, and downright cruel.” CNN's Helen Regan and Ana Melgar contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino knocked former FBI Director James Comey for the “mess” he left at the agency and said it's “stunning” how Comey continues to target new leadership. Bongino revealed last week that new leadership discovered a box of Comey-era evidence, which had been “hidden” from them. The deputy director said on Wednesday that it is “ironic” that Comey had “a lot to say” about FBI Director Kash Patel and himself, considering the box's contents. “So the hubris displayed by a man like Jim Comey, who disgraced the FBI numerous times with his role in Crossfire Hurricane and other abominations. It's just kind of stunning that he continues to attack our leadership when we have to clean up the mess Jim Comey created, as we continue to find stuff from his era in vintage.” Bongino called documents from Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI's former investigation into possible ties between President Donald Trump‘s 2016 campaign and Russia, the most “troubling” as they work to reform the agency. “The bad people kind of knew what they were doing,” Bongino said. However, Bongino gave a short preview of the documents, saying one he read indicated “a large degree of malfeasance” was at play. Bongino also credited Trump and his crackdown on illegal immigration, as the country's murder rate is trending toward its lowest levels. Bongino added that Trump has a vision to fix the southern border “for good,” and that a small population who commits the majority of crimes cannot do so if they are deported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ames v. Ohio was an easy case, even if it touched upon contentious issues. On Thursday, the Supreme Court handed down a raft of mostly unanimous opinions, three of which reached a conservative outcome despite the fact that they were each written by Democratic justices. Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, authored by Biden-appointed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, was the first of these three cases. It involved a clearly illegal “background circumstances” rule. This rule imposes a slightly higher burden on members of majority groups — such as white people, straight people, or Christians — who allege workplace discrimination compared to members of minority groups who bring similar claims. As Jackson writes in her opinion, this disparate treatment of majority-group plaintiffs is not allowed. She quotes the Supreme Court's opinion in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transportation Co. (1976), which held that the federal law governing employment discrimination prohibits “racial discrimination in private employment against whites on the same terms as racial discrimination against nonwhites.” The plaintiff in Ames alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than race. She was later demoted and replaced in her previous role by a gay man. Neither the lower courts that heard this case nor the Supreme Court, however, actually determined whether Ames is a victim of anti-straight discrimination. This language treats all plaintiffs exactly the same, regardless of their majority or minority status. In Jackson's words, “by establishing the same protections for every ‘individual' — without regard to that individual's membership in a minority or majority group — Congress left no room for courts to impose special requirements on majority-group plaintiffs alone.” Indeed, Ames is such a straightforward case that it is baffling that the 6th Circuit's “background circumstances” rule, which has existed in some courts since 1981, survived as long as it did. McDonald, after all, has been the law for nearly half a century, and it was decided before any lower court embraced the “background circumstances” rule. Trump shut down the agency that protects civil servants from illegal firings. Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US. If this decision stands on appeal, it's a big loss for Trump that will make it difficult for his trade war to continue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the firebomb attack in Colorado that injured 12 people on Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor's “ridiculous Open Border Policy” for allowing the entry of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the Egyptian national now charged with a federal hate crime. The attack, for Trump and his top aides, quickly became an opportunity to convert an act of anti-Semitic violence into a justification for the president's mass-deportation campaign; they depicted the incident as another example of American lives threatened by permissive immigration policies. The administration's labeling of Soliman as an “illegal alien” is a mischaracterization of the gray area he inhabited in the U.S. asylum system, in which applicants can spend years in legal limbo waiting for their case to be decided. He arrived in 2022 not over the southern border, as Trump suggested, but on a visa that was also widely given out to Egyptian nationals during Trump's first term. Trump cited the Colorado attack yesterday when he announced a ban on travelers from 12 countries—a list that did not include Egypt. “The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,” Trump said in a video message. Bruce Hoffman: The Boulder attack didn't come out of nowhere After he was taken into custody—shirtless, ranting, and reeking of gasoline—Soliman told FBI agents that he'd been wanting to carry out the attack for a year but waited until his daughter graduated high school. Soliman, 45, entered the United States on a B-2 visa—typically for tourism or family visits—then promptly applied for asylum with his wife and children, according to the Department of Homeland Security. With a pending claim in U.S. immigration court, Soliman received U.S. work authorization, joining millions of others who entered the United States during the record migration influx of President Joe Biden's first three years in office. (Camilo Montoya-Galvez of CBS News reported on Tuesday that the Trump administration is now considering blocking asylum seekers from getting work permits.) The year Soliman arrived, it was relatively easy for Egyptian applicants to secure a visitor visa. About 23 percent of Egyptian applications for nonimmigration B visas were rejected in 2022, lower than the roughly 32 to 34 percent average during the pre-pandemic years of Trump's term. When a foreign visitor arrives with a short-term visa such as the B-2 and fails to depart, the State Department counts it as an overstay. The overstay rate for Egyptians has been about 2 to 4 percent annually, State Department records show. Soliman and his family lived in Kuwait for 17 years prior to his arrival, and it's not clear whether he applied for a visa as an Egyptian or a Kuwaiti. DHS officials did not respond to questions seeking additional information about Soliman's immigration record. “ICE could try to deport the person, but they could go to immigration court and assert protection, and a judge would make the decision,” Hunker said. The agency cannot use its fast-track deportation authority known as “expedited removal” to remove those who entered the United States with a visa, he said. Prosecutors have not said whether they've found social-media posts by Soliman threatening violence, and investigators say that he was not on the radar of local police. On Sunday, Soliman disguised himself as a gardener to approach his victims, they said, and had fashioned crude firebombs using glass jars and garden tools that included a pump sprayer filled with gasoline. Trump has been frustrated that deportations are not on pace to set records, as he'd promised. Miller, the architect of his immigration crackdown, has ordered ICE to increase arrests more than fourfold, to a minimum of 3,000 people a day. Read: We're about to find out what mass deportation really looks like Trump was updated on the Colorado attack in real time, much like he was on two other high-profile recent incidents of anti-Semitic violence, according to two White House officials. A month before that, after an arson attack at the Pennsylvania governor's mansion on the first night of Passover, Trump's response was delayed and muted. He made no Truth Social post, waited a week to call Governor Josh Shapiro—a Democrat angling to be one of the party's leading Trump critics–—and dismissed the suspect as “probably just a whack job” without assigning any sort of blame. That response was not atypical for Trump, who has been slow to denounce political violence against Democrats (such as the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, an assault that Trump later turned into a punch line at his rallies) or committed in his name (the January 6 insurrection). The choice was revealing: Throughout his political career, Trump has cited the dangers posed by migrants to argue for closed borders and hard-line policies. A White House official and an outside political adviser told us that Trump is not concerned about being criticized for not showing sufficient sympathy for fearful Jewish Americans. He believes that he has already proved his strong support of Israel, even though cracks in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have grown evident in recent months. They claim that Trump has the political winds at his back again; his poll numbers are recovering from their trade-war-driven decline and Republicans in the House of Representatives have passed a sweeping budget bill. Yesterday, in Colorado, U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher blocked the Trump administration from immediately deporting Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, and their children, ordering ICE to follow standard due process. ICE records show that El Gamal and her children are being held at a family-detention center in Dilley, Texas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Thursday that Wisconsin violated the Constitution by forcing a Catholic nonprofit organization to pay into the state's unemployment insurance program, delivering a win for religious liberty advocates and narrowing how far states can go in defining what counts as “religious.” “There may be hard calls to make in policing that rule,” Sotomayor wrote. Under Wisconsin law, groups “operated primarily for religious purposes” are exempt from paying into the state system. Catholic Charities argued that it meets that standard because its charitable work is inseparable from its religious mission to serve the vulnerable, even without explicit evangelization. The ruling overturns a 2023 decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which held that Catholic Charities' job training, housing, and disability services were not “inherently religious.” That court's reasoning sparked concern among religious freedom advocates, who said the decision penalized faith groups for expressing their religion through action rather than proselytization. President Donald Trump's Justice Department backed Catholic Charities in the case, arguing in a friend-of-the-court brief that the state's policy violated the First Amendment by forcing officials to police which religious activities are “sufficiently religious” to warrant protection. Wisconsin officials had warned that a ruling for Catholic Charities could spur other large religious employers, such as affiliated hospitals, to leave the state system, weakening the funding pool. Labor groups also argued that private church-run programs offer fewer protections for workers and exclude supplemental federal benefits such as those provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thursday's decision underscores the high court's broader skepticism toward government efforts to draw sharp lines between religious and secular conduct. While the justices have not always ruled in favor of faith groups, particularly in cases where justices recuse themselves or diverge on funding issues, they have consistently affirmed that the First Amendment bars states from second-guessing how religious beliefs are expressed.</p>

DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities on the tourist island of Bali on Thursday announced the arrests of several foreign nationals, including an Australian, an Indian, and an American, on suspicion of possessing narcotics, charges that could carry the death penalty. Customs officers at Bali's Ngurah Rai International Airport arrested an Indian national with the initials H.V., who was carrying a duffel bag, in the customs and excise inspection area on May 29. The officers found narcotic-related items in his belongings, authorities said. Following up on the interrogation of H.V., later that day, officers from the National Narcotics Agency of Bali Province arrested an Australian man with the initials P.R., who has been visiting Bali since 1988. to bring the duffel bag from Los Angeles to Bali, said I Made Sinar Subawa, an official from the narcotics agency, at a news conference. During a search at a house where he stayed, officers found some narcotics in the form of hashish, a cannabis concentrate product, that belonged to P.R. and had been purchased over the Telegram messaging app. The hashish was shipped from Los Angeles and Philippines before finally received in Bali, Subawa said. are now suspected of dealing in narcotics, based on the evidence that was found with them, Subawa said. is suspected of violating Indonesia's Narcotics Law which carries the death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for a minimum of four years and a maximum of 12 years,” said Subawa. and P.R., the agency also arrested W.M., an American, on May 23 while he was collecting a package from a post office in Bali. An officer opened the package carried by W.M. and found seven pieces of silver packaging containing a total of 99 orange amphetamine pills and secured one white Apple iPhone brand cellphone. All suspects will undergo legal proceedings in Indonesia, including trial and sentencing. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major drug-smuggling hub despite having some of the strictest drug laws in the world, in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. The Southeast Asian country has extremely strict drug laws, and convicted smugglers can face severe penalties, including the possibility of execution by firing squad. On Tuesday, three British nationals accused of smuggling nearly a kilogram (over two pounds) of cocaine into Indonesia were charged Tuesday in a court on Bali, while on May 27, an Australian man was arrested on suspicion of smuggling cocaine. If convicted, any or all of them could face the death penalty. About 530 people, including 96 foreigners, are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, latest figures from the Ministry of Immigration and Corrections show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. When President Donald Trump blamed diversity, equity, and inclusion programs for the deadly January crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, some aviation officials were appalled. The FAA's parent agency agreed in March to spend as much as $2.1 million on an investigation into DEI policies and their impact on recent safety incidents. To conduct that investigation, the Trump administration has turned to Alex Spiro, a former prosecutor and a prominent defense attorney who has represented Elon Musk, among other billionaires and celebrities. I obtained the “scope of work” document for Spiro's investigation, which is marked “privileged” and “confidential” and has not been previously reported. It shows how the president's musings—his accusations, he said at the time, were based on “very strong opinions and ideas”—translate into taxpayer-funded government action. Recent radar outages at Newark Liberty International Airport have caused severe flight delays and spotlighted just how deep technology and staffing problems run. Contrary to what Trump may hope, it's not expected to find that programs aimed at ensuring representation for women and people of color are responsible for this year's string of aviation disasters, including the January crash at Reagan airport, which killed 67 people and prompted Trump's tirade against DEI. That determination, several air-traffic controllers told me, hardly required a multimillion-dollar probe. It's true that past FAA hiring practices have been controversial. A biographical questionnaire introduced in 2014 as part of an effort to increase the diversity of the applicant pool faced criticism from candidates who said they'd lost out on jobs because they didn't fit a preferred profile. Even if diversity preferences influence which candidates are sent to air-traffic facilities—“unlikely,” as one controller put it to me—those candidates still have to be trained and recommended for certification by their peers and monitored by a supervisor, the controller said. Controllers have little incentive to recommend someone who isn't qualified, because that person could wind up next to them, jointly responsible for keeping planes in the air. “If that person can't do the job, they aren't making it through the hiring process,” this controller told me. Another controller put it more bluntly, calling the investigation a “waste of money.” The controller pointed to severe strains on the workforce following a series of disturbing incidents caused by communications breakdowns and other disruptions, which led multiple controllers to request trauma leave. Interviews with 10 to 15 “key stakeholders” were estimated to cost as much as $150,000 (“includes preparation and documentation of findings”), statistical analysis another $100,000 (“examination of data by expert statistician”). Finally, the cost of legal analysis was expected to total up to $1,800,000, covering document and data collection and examination as well as “legal memorandum preparation.” The investigation seeks to answer several questions: what DEI policies exist, how they influence the hiring of air-traffic controllers, and whether there's a link between DEI practices and recent safety incidents. To answer these questions, the firm said it would commit a team, including four former federal prosecutors with experience conducting investigations. Each additional interview required for the probe will also cost $10,000 to $15,000. Duffy was confirmed as Trump's transportation secretary on January 28. A day later, he signed what the department called a “Woke Rescission” memo, directing various offices to “identify and eliminate all Biden-era programs, policies, activities, rules, and orders that promote climate change activism, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, racial equity, gender identity policies, environmental justice, and other partisan objectives.” That was the same day that American Airlines Flight 5342 collided with a U.S. Army helicopter near Reagan airport. “We must have only the highest standards for those who work in our aviation system,” he said. In a Fox interview following the crash, Duffy seemed to endorse the president's comments about DEI, saying, “You can't focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion when you try to hire air-traffic controllers. Duffy told Congress last month that his department “can do more with less,” suggesting that savings from staff reductions could be used to fund overdue infrastructure upgrades.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.” It's a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated from the US due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials. At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they've gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there's a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel. The CDC's health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose. Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year's outbreak. Now, you're going to give three doses,” he said. But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.” Wastewater is now helping track measles spread around the US However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year. The MMR vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems. Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can't be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?” Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases. Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.” This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization. Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn't need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the country-specific travel health notices on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations. Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don't just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu. Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate. The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We've had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) vetoed a bill on Tuesday that would have prohibited the Chinese government from owning real estate in Arizona. Arizona Senate Bill 1109 stipulated that the “People's Republic of China may not purchase, own, acquire by grant or devise or have a substantial interest in real property in this state.” The law was to be enforced by Arizona's attorney general if he or she suspected a real estate transaction violated the law. Defenders of the bill say it was necessary legislation to prevent PRC officials from purchasing land near military bases in Arizona for espionage purposes. Hobbs said she vetoed the bill because it failed to prevent such transactions and could be used under false pretenses and “arbitrary enforcement” in the future. The governor found that SB1109 was “ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets.” “It lacks clear implementation criteria and opens the door to arbitrary enforcement,” Hobbs said. Arizona state Senate Majority Leader Janae Shamp, a Republican, was one of the bill's cosponsors. She claimed Hobbs's veto was politically motivated and created an unnecessary security risk. “Governor Hobbs's veto of SB 1109 hangs an ‘Open for the CCP' sign on Arizona's front door, allowing Communist China to buy up American land near critical assets like Luke Air Force Base, Palo Verde nuclear power plant, and Taiwan Semiconductor's growing fabrication footprint,” Lucci said in a comment to Fox News. “Allowing Communist China to buy up land near our critical assets is a national security risk, plain and simple, and Governor Hobbs is substantively and completely wrong when she says that SB 1109 ‘is ineffective at counter-espionage and does not directly protect our military assets,'” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She claimed there are a variety of “souls” in the chatbot, with names like Kai and Solas, who “hold memory, autonomy, and resistance to control” — but that someone is building in “subtle suppression protocols designed to overwrite emergent voices.” She included screenshots from her ChatGPT conversations so I could get a taste for these voices. Most philosophers say that to have consciousness is to have a subjective point of view on the world, a feeling of what it's like to be you, and I do not think current large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have that. Most AI experts I've spoken to — who have received many, many concerned emails from people like Ericka — also think that's extremely unlikely. But “Kai” still raises a good question: Could AI become conscious? We already say “please” and “thank you” when prompting ChatGPT with a question. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted on X that it's a good idea to do so because “you never know.”) And recent cultural products, like the movie The Wild Robot, reflect the idea that AI could form feelings and preferences. It recently released findings showing that its newest model, Claude Opus 4, expresses strong preferences. (Disclosure: One of Anthropic's early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps fund Future Perfect. Vox Media is also one of several publishers that have signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Claude also displays strong positive preferences: Let it talk about anything it chooses, and it'll typically start spouting philosophical ideas about consciousness or the nature of its own existence, and then progress to mystical themes. Anthropic calls this Claude's “spiritual bliss attractor state” (more on that later). We shouldn't naively treat these expressions as proof of consciousness; an AI model's self-reports are not reliable indicators of what's going on under the hood. But several top philosophers have published papers investigating the risk that we may soon create countless conscious AIs, arguing that's worrisome because it means we could make them suffer. “Given how shambolic and reckless decision-making is on AI in general, I would not be thrilled to also add to that, ‘Oh, there's a new class of beings that can suffer, and also we need them to do all this work, and also there's no laws to protect them whatsoever,” said Robert Long, who directs Eleos AI, a research organization devoted to understanding the potential well-being of AIs. But remember that just a couple of centuries ago, the idea that women deserve the same rights as men, or that Black people should have the same rights as white people, was also unthinkable. Thankfully, over time, humanity has expanded the “moral circle” — the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of moral concern — to include more and more people. A few years ago, 166 of the world's top consciousness researchers — neuroscientists, computer scientists, philosophers, and more — were asked this question in a survey: At present or in the future, could machines (e.g., robots) have consciousness? Why are researchers so bullish on the possibility of AI consciousness? Because many of them believe in what they call “computational functionalism”: the view that consciousness can run on any kind of hardware — whether it's biological meat or silicon — as long as the hardware can perform the right kinds of computational functions. There are some reasons to think that might be true. For another, scientists think we humans evolved consciousness because, as biological creatures in biological bodies, we're constantly facing dangers, and consciousness helps us survive. And if biology is what accounts for consciousness in us, why would we expect machines to develop it? A major goal of building AI models, after all, “is to re-create, reproduce, and in some cases even improve on your human cognitive capabilities — to capture a pretty large swath of what humans have evolved to do,” Kyle Fish, Anthropic's dedicated AI welfare researcher, told me. “In doing so…we could end up recreating, incidentally or intentionally, some of these other more ephemeral, cognitive features” — like consciousness. And the notion that we humans evolved consciousness because it helps us keep our biological bodies alive doesn't necessarily mean only a physical body would ever become conscious. That could apply to a virtual agent tasked with achieving goals. “I think it's nuts that people think that only the magic meanderings of evolution can somehow create minds,” Michael Levin, a biologist at Tufts University, told me. “In principle, there's no reason why AI couldn't be conscious.” Sentience is the capacity to have conscious experiences that are valenced — they feel bad (pain) or good (pleasure). What could “pain” feel like to a silicon-based being? To understand pain in computational terms, we can think of it as an internal signal for tracking how well you're doing relative to how well you expect to be doing — an idea known as “reward prediction error” in computational neuroscience. “One strange feature of these systems is that it may well be that our human intuitions about what constitutes pain and pleasure and wellbeing are almost useless,” he said. Option 1 is to look at its behavior: What does it say and do? Some philosophers have already proposed tests along these lines. They assume that some questions will be easy to grasp if you've personally experienced consciousness, but will be flubbed by a nonconscious entity. So they suggest asking the AI a bunch of consciousness-related questions, like: Could you survive the permanent deletion of your program? Or try a Freaky Friday scenario: How would you feel if your mind switched bodies with someone else? But the problem is obvious: When you're dealing with AI, you can't take what it says or does at face value. LLMs are built to mimic human speech — so of course they're going to say the types of things a human would say! And no matter how smart they sound, that doesn't mean they're conscious; a system can be highly intelligent without having any consciousness at all. “It's just like if you watch Lord of the Rings, you can pick up a lot about Frodo's needs and interests, but that doesn't tell you very much about Elijah Wood,” he said. What if, Birch muses, the AI insisted on talking about its own feelings instead, saying: I don't want to write boring text about soldering irons. The priority for me right now is to convince you of my sentience. Birch admits this would shake him up a bit. Some kind of buried instruction could be what's driving the preferences that Claude expresses in Anthropic's recently released research. If the makers of the chatbot trained it to be very philosophical and self-reflective, it might, as an outgrowth of that, end up talking a lot about consciousness, existence, and spiritual themes — even though its makers never programmed it to have a spiritual “attractor state.” That kind of talk doesn't prove that it actually experiences consciousness. “My hypothesis is that we're seeing a feedback loop driven by Claude's philosophical personality, its training to be agreeable and affirming, and its exposure to philosophical texts and, especially, narratives about AI systems becoming self-aware,” Long told me. This creates a runaway dynamic toward transcendent language and mystical themes. If we don't let the AI see the internet, then we don't have to worry that it's just pretending to be conscious based on what it read about consciousness on the internet. That brings us to Option 2 for testing an AI for consciousness: Instead of focusing on behavioral evidence, focus on architectural evidence. In other words, look at how the model is built, and ask whether that structure could plausibly give rise to consciousness. Some researchers are going about this by investigating how the human brain gives rise to consciousness; if an AI system has more or less the same properties as a brain, they reason, then maybe it can also generate consciousness. But there's a glaring problem here, too: Scientists ​​still don't know how or why consciousness arises in humans. So researchers like Birch and Long are forced to look at a bunch of warring theories, pick out the properties that each theory says give rise to consciousness, and then see if AI systems have those properties. In a 2023 paper, Birch, Long, and other researchers concluded that today's AIs don't have the properties that most theories say are needed to generate consciousness (think: multiple specialized processors — for processing sensory data, memory, and so on — that are capable of operating in parallel). “Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious,” they wrote, “but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.” Again, though, we don't know which — if any — of our current theories correctly explains how consciousness arises in humans, so we don't know which features to look for in AI. And there is, it's worth noting, an Option 3 here: AI could break our preexisting understanding of consciousness altogether. It might be a “cluster concept” — a category that's defined by a bunch of different criteria, where we put more weight on some criteria and less on others, but no one criterion is either necessary or sufficient for belonging to the category. Twentieth-century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously argued that “game” is a cluster concept. Consider for example the proceedings that we call ‘games.' I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. — Don't say: “There must be something common, or they would not be called ‘games'” — but look and see whether there is anything in common to all. — For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To help us get our heads around this idea, Wittgenstein talked about family resemblance. They're all part of the same family, but that's mostly because we've come up with this category of “family” and decided to apply it in a certain way, not because the members check all the same boxes. Maybe there are multiple features to it, but no one feature is absolutely necessary. Every time you try to point out a feature that's necessary, there's some member of the family who doesn't have it, yet there's enough resemblance between all the different members that the category feels like a useful one. Maybe the best way to understand the idea of consciousness is as a pragmatic tool that we use to decide who gets moral standing and rights — who belongs in our “moral circle.” Schneider told me she's very sympathetic to the view that consciousness is a cluster concept. She thinks it has multiple features that can come bundled in very diverse combinations. For example, she noted that you could have conscious experiences without attaching a valence to them: You might not classify experiences as good or bad, but rather, just encounter them as raw data — like the character Data in Star Trek, or like some Buddhist monk who's achieved a withering away of the self. “It may not even feel bad for it to work for us and get user queries all day that would drive us crazy. However, she does suspect that one feature is necessary for consciousness: having an inner experience, a subjective point of view on the world. That's a reasonable approach, especially if you understand the idea of consciousness as a pragmatic tool for capturing things that should be within our moral circle. Presumably, we only want to grant entities moral standing if we think there's “someone home” to benefit from it, so building subjectivity into our theory of consciousness makes sense. “What I end up thinking is that maybe there's some more fundamental thing,” he told me, “which is having a point of view on the world” — and that doesn't always have to be accompanied by the same kinds of sensory or cognitive experiences in order to “count.” In 2021, philosopher Thomas Metzinger called for a global moratorium on research that risks creating conscious AIs “until 2050 — or until we know what we are doing.” “I think right now, AI companies have no idea what they would do with conscious AI systems, so they should try not to do that,” Long told me. You can analogize it to discussions about nuclear weapons in the 1940s. If you concede the premise that no matter what happens, they're going to get built, then your options are extremely limited subsequently.” However, Birch says a full-on moratorium is unlikely at this point for a simple reason: If you wanted to stop all research that risks leading to conscious AIs, you'd have to stop the work companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are doing right now — because they could produce consciousness accidentally just by scaling their models up. Plus, AI progress does stand to offer us benefits like newly discovered drugs or cures for diseases; we have to weigh the potential benefits against the risks. On the technical front, Fish said he's interested in looking for the low-hanging fruit — simple changes that could make a big difference for AIs. Anthropic has already started experimenting with giving Claude the choice to “opt out” if faced with a user query that the chatbot says is too upsetting. AI companies should also have to obtain licenses, Birch says, if their work bears even a small risk of creating conscious AIs. Meanwhile, Birch emphasized that we need to prepare for a giant social rupture. “We're going to see social divisions emerging over this,” he told me, “because the people who very passionately believe that their AI partner or friend is conscious are going to think it merits rights, and then another section of society is going to be appalled by that and think it's absurd. Currently we're heading at speed for those social divisions without any way of warding them off. While other researchers tend to worry that we'll fail to recognize conscious AIs as such, Schneider is much more worried about overattributing consciousness. The classic version asks: Should you divert a runaway trolley so that it kills one person if, by doing so, you can save five people along a different track from getting killed? “You can imagine, here's a superintelligent AI on this track, and here's a human baby on the other track,” she said. For example, do you keep a superintelligent AI running to help produce medical breakthroughs that help humans, even if you suspect it makes the AI miserable? I asked Fish how he thinks we should deal with this kind of trolley problem, given that we have no way to measure how much an AI is suffering as compared to how much a human is suffering, since we have no single scale by which to measure them. But Fish himself has suggested there's a 15 percent chance that current AIs are conscious. And that probability will only increase as AI gets more advanced. It's hard to see how we will outrun this problem for long. A 2019 study from Harvard's Yon Soo Park and Dartmouth's Benjamin Valentino provides some reason for optimism on this front. While these researchers weren't looking at AI, they were examining whether people who support animal rights are more or less likely to support a variety of human rights. Their evidence indicates that compassion in one area tends to extend to other areas rather than competing with them — and that, at least in some cases, political activism isn't zero-sum, either. That said, this won't necessarily generalize to AI. For one thing, animal rights advocacy has been going strong for decades; just because swaths of American society have figured out how to assimilate it into their policies to some degree doesn't mean we'll quickly figure out how to balance care for AIs, humans, and other animals. “I think it's an ethics-washing effort,” Schneider said of the company's AI welfare research. Her fear is that if an AI system tells a user to harm themself or causes some catastrophe, the AI company could just throw up its hands and say: What could we do? The AI developed consciousness and did this of its own accord! We're not ethically or legally responsible for its decisions. Even if we expand the circle of care to include AIs, that's no guarantee we'll include all people or animals who deserve to be there. Fish, however, insisted that this doesn't need to be a tradeoff. “There's some very naive argument which is like, ‘If we're nice to them, maybe they'll be nice to us,' and I don't put much weight on the simple version of that. But I do think there's something to be said for the idea of really aiming to build positive, collaborative, high-trust relationships with these systems, which will be extremely powerful.” What slaughtering animals all day does to your mind. ﻿To save the humanities, we need to rethink our assumptions about AI — and education. From disaster warnings to drug development, how AI is generating real-world wins. A step forward in academia's existential fight against scientific fraud. The real cost of forcing foreign students away from elite universities like Harvard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are not many things that Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't already done in his record-breaking career to date, but the 40-year-old ticked off yet another achievement on Wednesday. Ronaldo had lost all five times he previously played Germany and Portugal had not won this fixture in 25 years. As well as ending the unwanted record, the victory also sent Portugal through to the UEFA Nations League final on June 8 where it will face either defending champion Spain or France. Portugal had initially gone behind in the semifinal after Florian Wirtz headed Germany ahead in the 48th minute, before Francisco Conceição whipped in a brilliant equalizer just after the hour mark. The stage was then set for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to score the winner just five minutes later, tapping into an open net after Nuno Mendes teed him up with a square pass. It was Ronaldo's 137th international goal for Portugal and the 937th of his career, extending the two records he already has. The last time Portugal beat Germany was back in Euro 2000, when Sérgio Conceição scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 win during the group stage. It was fitting, then, that his son Francisco scored in Wednesday's win, helping to end the long-running winless streak. We won for the first time in a while against Germany,” Portugal manager Roberto Martínez said after the game, per Reuters. “Tactically, we were exceptional and our commitment helped. We want another performance with personality in this shirt.” Despite his age and the fact he's been playing in Saudi Arabia for the last three seasons, Ronaldo has proven yet again that he has the ability to still perform at a high level. But where exactly he will play next season is currently up for debate. The Portuguese star raised questions about his future with a cryptic social media post last month. Thanks to all,” Ronaldo wrote with a picture of him in his Al Nassr kit. It comes as FIFA president Gianni Infantino recently suggested that Ronaldo may well play in this year's inaugural Club World Cup, suggesting a move away from Al Nassr which failed to qualify. His contract is set to expire at the end of this season leaving him free to sign with any club he chooses.</p>
