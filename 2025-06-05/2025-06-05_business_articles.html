                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk on Thursday said that his company SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft "immediately" because of threats by President Donald Trump to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. Musk's announcement, on his social media site X, came amid an escalating war of words with Trump that began after the Tesla CEO criticized the major tax bill being pushed by the Republican president. "In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately," Musk wrote. Dragon is the only U.S. option for delivering crew to and from the International Space Station. A Dragon capsule brought NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back to Earth in March after the pair were stranded for months at the ISS by a Boeing Starliner capsule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Thursday called Tesla CEO Elon Musk "CRAZY" and threatened to cut his companies' government contracts as the two men feuded over a major tax bill. "Go ahead, make my day," Musk promptly responded. In addition to leading the electric-vehicle maker Tesla, Musk's businesses include the space exploration and satellite-communication company SpaceX, artificial-intelligence company xAI, tunnel-digger The Boring Company, tech firm Neuralink and the social media site X. Tesla's share price, which was already trading sharply lower, tanked after Trump's latest comments. Trump in a bitter Truth Social post Thursday afternoon wrote that Musk was "wearing thin" by the end of his tenure as a "special government employee." "I asked him to leave," Trump claimed. Trump said in the Oval Office earlier Thursday that Musk was "upset" that the package cuts electric vehicle credits. "I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do! Trump wrote in the social media post. He is actively urging Senate Republicans to "kill the bill," which comprises a huge swath of Trump's domestic agenda. The president wrote in a second Truth Social post, "The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!" SpaceX is one of the nation's largest federal contractors, securing $3.8 billion over hundreds of government contracts in fiscal year 2024 alone, The New York Times reported. The company has taken more than $20 billion in contracts from NASA, the U.S. Air Force and other agencies since 2008, according to data from FedScout. A Washington Post analysis published in February found that Musk and his companies have received at least $38 billion from the government in the form of contracts, loans, subsidies and tax credits over more than two decades. Some of Musk's companies are on track to take in additional federal dollars for years to come, either from existing contracts or from newly inked government business. SpaceX, for instance, is among frontrunners to win a crucial part of President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield plan, Reuters reported. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. trade deficit fell by the largest amount on record in April as imports fell by over 16% after a surge in orders to beat President Trump's tariffs, but there's a worrying flip side for the consumer. These metrics generally track together, according to the Logistics Managers' Index. In 2024, the average space between these metrics was 12.1 points. When inventories are high and quickly expand, warehouses cost more. But costs are still up because the inventory is being held longer. "The situation we're in now, inventories are up, and they're sitting there," said Rogers. "Essentially, imports in January, February, and early March looked a lot like what we would normally see in August, September, and early October." Normally in mid-October, holiday sales kick into gear, which would move inventory out of the warehouse. "Warehousing capacity is tight, which means there is no inventory movement, and the associated costs (e.g., warehousing prices and inventory costs) are much higher than what we would normally see at this time of the year," Rogers said. "This means the inventory is getting more expensive to hold." As President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first call since a raft of new tariff threats on China in an initial attempt to de-escalate the trade war, data on Chinese ocean freight bookings to the U.S. shows a picture similar to the softness in global orders after the early 2025 surge. A recent drop in freight vessel sailings from China drove up the cost for imports as there has been less capacity available on ships. Peter Sand, Xeneta chief shipping analyst, said the recent 88% increase in ocean freight spot rates on the China to U.S. trade route indicates demand of some shippers willing to pay to pull forward their freight during the 90-day tariff pause. "However, this will not last because [vessel] capacity is heading back to the Transpacific and the desperation of shippers to get supply chains moving again will ease once boxes are on the water and inventories begin to build up," said Sand. "Spot rates are expected to peak in June before downward pressure returns," he added. The conditions in the freight market resulted in an advantage for larger firms over small businesses, according to Rogers. "Smaller firms were boxed out during the big rush of imports in Q1, so they have had to bring inventories over later, resulting in higher costs," he said. But since the larger companies aren't continuing to stock up, as the surge ends it is impacting smaller supply chain companies directly, too. They get hit when large manufacturers and retailers avoid inventory as much as possible — unlike the Covid shock era, they are now running leaner inventory overall, which further squeezes the "middle mile." "This could change as inventories move downstream to retailers if costs could be passed down to the consumer," he added. Recent Federal Reserve survey data shows many firms planning to pass on price increases resulting from tariffs to customers. Helen Torkos, president and owner of Regent Tek Industries, which manufactures pavement markings, tells CNBC the global trade war has greatly impacted the cost of importing the raw components needed to manufacture the highest grade of thermoplastic road markings, the product that is on state, city, and local roads and highways. "The majority of our components are now being tariffed," said Torkos. We cannot pass on these costs to some of our customers because they cannot afford the increases. We also cannot source these products domestically." Torkos said the uncertainty of future tariff costs has also led to the cancellation of key projects. To address the swings in tariffs, and in an effort to offer more certainty on possible freight costs, logistics firms are launching tariff analysis tools. Robinson and Flexport are among companies to roll out technology that allows businesses and consumers to model tariff impact on price. Wine for Europe is one example that can impact both the business and consumer. The EU was threatened by President Trump in a social media post of a 50% tariff, only to have that threat walked back by the president, delaying that increase from June 1 to July 9. According to the Flexport Tariff Simulator, if a container with bottles of Chianti from Italy was processed by U.S. Customs on June 2, the wine would be under a 10.24% tariff rate. The duties for one 20-foot container filled with 0.75L bottles of Chianti would be $27,024. These duties have pushed up costs to import retail goods much higher than the 30% associated with the tentative agreement. Using an example of a common summer retail purchase, Flexport data shows a 20-foot container storing 60 fully assembled aluminum chaise lounge chairs with a wholesale value of $60,000, departing from China on June 2 and arriving on July 15 would face a 70% tariff — that includes Section 301 tariffs at 25% under the 1974 Trade Act's unfair practices policy; Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum at 25%; and the national emergency powers fentanyl tariffs at 20%. The total amount in tariffs for that single container would be $42,000. "It's not that simple to calculate," said Ryan Petersen, Flexport CEO. "There's still a lot of uncertainty about what's going to happen. That could end, and tariffs may not be 10% everywhere. Commerce Secretary [Howard] Lutnick has made comments he is committed to making the tariffs higher." Robinson, said for companies to save on tariff costs, they need to have the ability to search their SKUs and identify the product's point of origin so they can tabulate tariff costs. "Based on that information, they could then quickly compare their total duty spending versus various alternative sources," said Short. "Knowing the spending scenarios can provide businesses with clarity on where to focus their efforts to achieve savings and diversification, down to the individual product level," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most loyal fans of podcasts aren't just good listeners — they're paying customers. While podcasters often earn money from advertisements that run during their episodes, many are finding success turning listeners into paid subscribers. In April, Patreon announced a new partnership program with podcast networks like Amazon-owned Wondery and Sony Music. In 2024, podcasters on the platform collectively earned more than $472 million, Patreon told BI. Patreon, which takes a cut of earnings from paid memberships ranging from 5% to 12%, isn't the only platform creators use to monetize their podcast audiences. A slew of community-focused platforms, like Mighty Networks and Fourthwall, offer tools around paid memberships. Larger social media platforms, such as YouTube and Discord, have also dabbled in paid memberships for creators. BI spoke with the creators behind three podcasts that host memberships on Patreon. For each of them, maintaining a paywall around some of their content and offering perks like access to a Discord helps diversify their incomes. "Because we get so much of our revenue through Patreon, we have a lot of leeway with the ads we get to choose," said Aiden McCaig, a cohost of "The Yard" podcast, which has over 412,000 subscribers on YouTube. It also has a licensing partnership with iHeartMedia, which handles the podcast's advertising. "Community really has always been at the heart of what we do with 'Therapy for Black Girls,' specifically with the podcast," Harden Bradford said. How much they earn from Patreon: about $2,000 in May How they do it: "Therapy for Black Girls" offers two tiers on Patreon — one is $10 a month and another is $14 a month. "We're definitely doing content release drops when there's a new episode of one of our segments," COO Ashley Cherry said. "But we're also posting outside of that … to get people talking in the comments to really cultivate a sense of community." Its higher tier also unlocks more virtual events for its community, such as weekly check-ins where members can talk about their lives or do journaling prompts together. Members receive perks like early access to tickets for in-person events, merch, and giveaways. What it is: "RedHanded" is a true crime podcast hosted by Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire, who are both based in the UK. Maguire told BI that if it weren't for the podcast's earnings on Patreon, she wouldn't have been able to quit her previous job to pursue podcasting full time. How much they earn from Patreon: about $59,000 a month The middle tier also unlocks a monthly bonus episode of "RedHanded" and a video version of "Under the Duvet." "RedHanded's" most expensive tier gives subscribers access to the podcast's full library of content. "RedHanded's" Patreon accounts for about 25% of the podcasts' revenue now, Bala estimated. The podcast launched in 2021 and is one of the top podcasts on Patreon, with more than 58,000 members — about 37,000 of whom are paid subscribers. How much they earn from Patreon: about $242,000 a month Its higher tiers unlock exclusive shows, like one where two of the cohosts share commentary on Disney Channel Original Movies, as well as merch discounts. McCaig said that compared to YouTube, where keeping viewers' attention can plateau over time, running a Patreon lets The Yard protect itself from user churn. "Any superfan, once you convert them into a patron, is less likely to leave that than someone who watches your podcast for free sometimes on YouTube," McCaig said.</p>

The AI Race:

Anysphere's program, Cursor, includes an AI-infused code editor that can analyze a programmer's actions and suggest additional lines of code.

The artificial intelligence rush has enabled some small startups to grow very big very quickly. But by some estimates, none have grown as fast as Anysphere Inc., maker of the popular AI coding assistant Cursor, which has surpassed $500 million in annualized revenue, the company said. 

Now, the three-year-old startup has raised $900 million to help drive that growth, Anysphere plans to announce on Thursday. That will bring its valuation to $9.9 billion, including the new capital, underscoring investor enthusiasm for what Silicon Valley sees as one of most promising applications of generative AI thus far.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Circle Internet Group soared as much as 235% after the stablecoin company and its selling shareholders raised almost $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. The stock opened at $69.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after its IPO priced at $31. The New York-based company priced its IPO late Wednesday, far above this week's expected range of $27 to $28, and an initial range last week of between $24 and $26, valuing the company Thursday at some $6.8 billion before trading began. Circle joins Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S. This marks the company's second attempt at going public. "To realize our vision, we needed to forge relationships with governments, we needed to work with policymakers … because if you want this to work for mainstream, it's got to work in mainstream society and you need to have those rules of the road," CEO Jeremy Allaire told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Thursday. "We've been one of the most licensed, regulated, compliant, transparent companies in the entire history of this industry, and that's served us well." The crypto industry is enjoying newfound political favor under a friendly U.S. administration. The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up on the expectation that Congress will pass stablecoin legislation this summer. Wall Street analysts say it could grow 10-fold over the next five years, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity. Based in Boston, the company initially focused on consumer-facing payments and crypto wallet and exchange services. It moved to New York earlier this year. Circle founded the U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to establish a standard for fiat money on the internet, launching it in partnership with Coinbase in 2018 through a consortium called Centre. In 2023, they dissolved Centre as a stand-alone entity, with Circle taking over the responsibilities of USDC and Coinbase taking a minority stake in the stablecoin company. The two companies also entered into an agreement to split the revenue of USDC stablecoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a "stretch goal to make USDC the No. Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies and in anticipation of Congress blessing the system. Specifically, companies that aren't traditional users of cryptocurrencies are now interested in the efficiency and lower cost that stablecoins might bring to remittances, business-to-business payments and e-commerce, at the same time as they remain essential to tokenized financial markets. Rhetoric around stablecoins preserving U.S. dollar dominance — partly by ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins — has grown louder, too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Circle Internet Group soared 168% after the stablecoin company and its selling shareholders raised almost $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. The stock opened at $69 on the New York Stock Exchange after its IPO priced at $31. The New York-based company priced its IPO late Wednesday, far above this week's expected range of $27 to $28, and an initial range last week of between $24 and $26, valuing the company Thursday at some $6.8 billion before trading began. Circle joins Coinbase, Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms as one of the few pure-play crypto companies to list in the U.S. This marks the company's second attempt at going public. "To realize our vision, we needed to forge relationships with governments, we needed to work with policymakers … because if you want this to work for mainstream, it's got to work in mainstream society and you need to have those rules of the road," CEO Jeremy Allaire told CNBC's "Money Movers" on Thursday. "We've been one of the most licensed, regulated, compliant, transparent companies in the entire history of this industry, and that's served us well." The crypto industry is enjoying newfound political favor under a friendly U.S. administration. The stablecoin sector specifically has been ramping up on the expectation that Congress will pass stablecoin legislation this summer. Wall Street analysts say it could grow 10-fold over the next five years, creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity. Based in Boston, the company initially focused on consumer-facing payments and crypto wallet and exchange services and was the first to receive the famously difficult to obtain New York State BitLicense in 2015. It moved to New York earlier this year. Circle founded the U.S. dollar-pegged USDC stablecoin to establish a standard for fiat money on the internet, launching it in partnership with Coinbase in 2018 through a consortium called Centre. In 2023, they dissolved Centre as a stand-alone entity, with Circle taking over the responsibilities of USDC and Coinbase taking a minority stake in the stablecoin company. The two companies also entered into an agreement to split the revenue of USDC stablecoin, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said on the company's most recent earnings call that it has a "stretch goal to make USDC the No. Traditionally used as bridge currencies for crypto traders, stablecoins today are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms as the Trump administration rolls back Biden-era crypto policies and in anticipation of Congress blessing the system. Specifically, companies that aren't traditional users of cryptocurrencies are now interested in the efficiency and lower cost that stablecoins might bring to remittances, business-to-business payments and e-commerce, at the same time as they remain essential to tokenized financial markets. Rhetoric around stablecoins preserving U.S. dollar dominance — partly by ensuring demand for U.S. government debt, which backs nearly all dollar-denominated stablecoins — has grown louder, too. Correction: Circle opened at $69 on the New York Stock Exchange. An earlier version of this story misstated the stock's opening price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The alliance between President Donald Trump and mega-billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk dramatically fractured Thursday over the president's major tax bill I've helped Elon a lot," Trump told reporters at the White House. Musk quickly fired back at Trump in a post on his social media site X. "Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!! In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful." "Without me, Trump would have lost the election," Musk soon after tweeted. Trump's dismissal of Musk's criticisms came after days of the billionaire condemning what Trump calls his "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" over concerns it will blow out federal deficits. Musk on Tuesday called the bill, which is being considered by the Senate, a "disgusting abomination." Musk last week left his temporary government post overseeing DOGE, the Trump administration's effort to slash federal spending and employee headcounts. Last weekend, soon after Musk was lauded by Trump for his government service in an Oval Office event, the president said he was withdrawing Musk's preferred nominee, tech billionaire Jared Issacman, to run the space agency NASA. "You know, I've always liked Elon," said Trump on Thursday. "I'd rather have him criticize me than the bill, because the bill is incredible." "Elon is upset because we took the EV mandate, and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles," Trump said. "And you know, they're having a hard time, the electric vehicles, and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy." "He knew it ... a long time ago." "I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He had no problem with it." "All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that's billions and billions of dollars, and it really is unfair," Trump said. The president also said, referring to Isaacman,  "I'm sure [Musk] respected him, but to run NASA ... I didn't think it was appropriate." And I say, you know, look, we won. And one of the privileges we don't have to appoint a Democrat. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Anduril Industries Inc. has closed a new funding round of $2.5 billion, a deal that more than doubles the defense startup's valuation to $30.5 billion, Executive Chairman Trae Stephens said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. 

The latest capital injection and increased valuation — up from $14 billion last year — underscores how quickly the company is establishing itself as a major player in the corporate landscape of American national security.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moving from New York City to London wasn't exactly a huge culture shock for me. However, since I moved in January, shopping for groceries has yielded some pretty big surprises. From differences in business hours to product availability and placements, here are all the ways grocery shopping in the UK has thrown me for a loop. I live in a big neighborhood just outside Central London and have five grocery stores within walking distance. So, it's not for a lack of trying when I say I haven't been able to find some of my favorite grocery items nearby. Only after I expressed confusion about not being able to find it in the grocery store did I learn that he'd been mixing a custom blend of milk and cream for me all along. I've also noticed that Italian sausage is harder to find. I evidently took for granted how prevalent and relatively inexpensive it was in New York, and even Michigan, where my parents live. Luckily for me, a local helped me find an Italian marketplace in Central London, where the sausages were excellent (and similar to what I had back home), just quite expensive. Admittedly, I was spoiled by having access to a 24-hour grocery store in my New York City neighborhood. In London, I have to be more strategic — especially on Sundays. If you're wandering around the refrigerated aisles in a grocery store in the UK, you won't find any eggs. Instead, they're located on shelves, possibly near the baking supplies. I'm still keeping them in the fridge at home, though. What surprised me, though, was the differences in flavors available. Cheerios are sold here, but they bear Nestlé's logo rather than General Mills and the primary flavors are honey and multigrain. The main difference between the plain Cheerios I'm used to and the multigrain variety I often see here is that plain Cheerios are primarily made with whole-grain oats, while the multigrain variety is made with a combination of whole-grain oat flour, whole-grain wheat flour, and whole-grain barley flour. Meanwhile, Doritos still come in recognizable packaging, but some of the flavors have been renamed. Cool Ranch, for example, is called Cool Original in the UK, in part because Ranch dressing doesn't really exist here. Some other differences include portion sizes, ingredients, nutritional contents, and bag colors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The most loyal fans of podcasts aren't just good listeners — they're paying customers. While podcasters often earn money from advertisements that run during their episodes, many are finding success turning listeners into paid subscribers. In April, Patreon announced a new partnership program with podcast networks like Amazon-owned Wondery and Sony Music. In 2024, podcasters on the platform collectively earned more than $472 million, Patreon told BI. Patreon, which takes a cut of earnings from paid memberships ranging from 5% to 12%, isn't the only platform creators use to monetize their podcast audiences. A slew of community-focused platforms, like Mighty Networks and Fourthwall, offer tools around paid memberships. Larger social media platforms, such as YouTube and Discord, have also dabbled in paid memberships for creators. BI spoke with the creators behind three podcasts that host memberships on Patreon. For each of them, maintaining a paywall around some of their content and offering perks like access to a Discord helps diversify their incomes. "Because we get so much of our revenue through Patreon, we have a lot of leeway with the ads we get to choose," said Aiden McCaig, a cohost of "The Yard" podcast, which has over 412,000 subscribers on YouTube. It also has a licensing partnership with iHeartMedia, which handles the podcast's advertising. "Community really has always been at the heart of what we do with 'Therapy for Black Girls,' specifically with the podcast," Harden Bradford said. How much they earn from Patreon: about $2,000 in May How they do it: "Therapy for Black Girls" offers two tiers on Patreon — one is $10 a month and another is $14 a month. "We're definitely doing content release drops when there's a new episode of one of our segments," COO Ashley Cherry said. "But we're also posting outside of that … to get people talking in the comments to really cultivate a sense of community." Its higher tier also unlocks more virtual events for its community, such as weekly check-ins where members can talk about their lives or do journaling prompts together. Members receive perks like early access to tickets for in-person events, merch, and giveaways. What it is: "RedHanded" is a true crime podcast hosted by Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire, who are both based in the UK. Maguire told BI that if it weren't for the podcast's earnings on Patreon, she wouldn't have been able to quit her previous job to pursue podcasting full time. How much they earn from Patreon: about $59,000 a month The middle tier also unlocks a monthly bonus episode of "RedHanded" and a video version of "Under the Duvet." "RedHanded's" most expensive tier gives subscribers access to the podcast's full library of content. "RedHanded's" Patreon accounts for about 25% of the podcasts' revenue now, Bala estimated. The podcast launched in 2021 and is one of the top podcasts on Patreon, with more than 58,000 members — about 37,000 of whom are paid subscribers. How much they earn from Patreon: about $242,000 a month Its higher tiers unlock exclusive shows, like one where two of the cohosts share commentary on Disney Channel Original Movies, as well as merch discounts. McCaig said that compared to YouTube, where keeping viewers' attention can plateau over time, running a Patreon lets The Yard protect itself from user churn. "Any superfan, once you convert them into a patron, is less likely to leave that than someone who watches your podcast for free sometimes on YouTube," McCaig said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anime-inspired fashion, she told Business Insider, was largely restricted to huge men's jackets or merchandise items that weren't wearable on a daily basis. So James and her husband spent more than $30,000 of their savings to launch Fira X Wear, a swimwear brand that blends cosplay elements with practical apparel. Since its initial launch, the brand's product range has expanded to include leisurewear. James left her game concept art job last year to focus on the brand full time. Now, the Netflix of anime, streaming platform Crunchyroll, is collaborating with James to launch a clothing collection inspired by the "My Hero Academia" anime series. Crunchyroll has around 17 million subscribers globally, the platform told BI. "Fira X Wear and this collaboration is the culmination of all of that: professional design, craftsmanship, and fandom, blended into a wearable collection," Adamian said. James was initially worried people wouldn't consider her brand a "serious business," given its pop-culture and cosplay-inspired roots. "I feel like people think it's kiddish or only a certain age group is into it, without realizing that a lot of us, especially people in my age group, grew up with anime," James, 32, said. But she had plenty of experience making skins — alternative outfits and designs — for characters in video games. "So it taught me just the importance of color and shape and how to kind of apply those things in interesting ways to real life," she added. She said having experience with character design allowed her to "create things that are a little bit more unique than the average fashion drop." When deciding on pricing, James said she wanted her brand to be premium but still affordable. "When you initially go into anime or pop cultural merch, a lot of it can feel very cheap. On the other hand, you'll see very expensive designer launches. But everybody can't afford a $30,000 Gucci outfit to look like their favorite anime character," James said. James hopes to expand her brand globally and design a collection of high-end pieces with more detailing. "There are plenty of times where I'll go into full character concept artist mode, and I'm clearly creating something that would be extremely expensive to produce," James said. "To have them look at what I've been doing on social media and look at my designs and instantly be like, yeah, we want to put our names alongside that, it's a huge honor for me," James said.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Globant, a large tech consulting firm, just ripped up its traditional billing strategy to more fully embrace AI use cases and projects. This is a trend I told you about back in April. The generative AI boom is pushing companies to adopt different pricing models, partly because the latest models have become so expensive to use. Globant, an IT services specialist that competes with Accenture and other consulting firms, is rolling out AI Pods, a subscription for AI-powered offerings including software engineering, product definition, design, and testing. Clients can subscribe monthly to an AI Pod, and each subscription includes token-based capacity, similar to how some leading AI labs structure usage. Every time a company taps into a major AI model, the prompts and other requests are broken down into "tokens," the new language of generative AI, which have to be processed. Traditional consulting projects often come with time-intensive billing structures: work is scoped, employees are assigned, and hours are tracked to calculate what to charge clients. "This is a departure from the traditional effort-based approaches," Globant CEO Martín Migoya explained, describing the move as a "radical departure from what anyone else in our industry is offering." Each subscription comes with a certain number of tokens to use. "We're proposing a novel way of engaging, which is more connected to throughput rather than just the time and effort I'm consuming." Migoya said the token limits are high, so Globant consultants and their clients have more than enough to get projects completed. If some customers blow through token allocations, Globant will work out solutions, but the goal is to keep pricing stable in this new generative AI era, while minimizing surprises, he explained. Instead of spinning up custom teams for every client need, customers now subscribe to digital capacity. The firm also uses its own agent framework, CODA, which automates aspects of code generation, testing, and deployment while ensuring high-quality enterprise output. Globant says the new model is already being used by clients in finance, entertainment, and energy. While subscription-based and token-based models have caught on in the SaaS world, Globant's move is a signal that enterprise consulting may be heading the same way. The largest consulting firms, including Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG, have been investing heavily in automation and AI over the past few years. Recently, Deloitte and EY announced new agentic AI platforms, both built in collaboration with Nvidia. With AI redefining how software is built and deployed, billing just based on human time and effort may soon feel as outdated as dial-up internet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The maker of Tide and Pampers plans to cut as many as 7,000 office jobs, or 15% of its non-manufacturing workforce, over the next two years. Procter & Gamble revealed the job cuts in a presentation from the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference that was published on its website on Thursday. CFO Andre Schulten and COO Shailesh Jejurikar gave the presentation, which outlined a two-year drive starting in the 2026 financial year to boost growth and value creation. "We can unlock significant growth by better meeting the needs of currently unserved and under-served consumers, expanding into new segments, and growing markets to best-in-class levels," per the presentation. The changes were an "intentional acceleration of the current strategy to widen P&G's margin of advantage in superiority, fueled by productivity, to win in the increasingly challenging environment in which we compete." P&G plans to exit some categories, brands, and product forms in certain markets, saying it would reveal more details in the coming months. The changes mean it expects to cut up to 7,000 non-manufacturing roles, or about 15% of that workforce, over the next two years. No further information about regions or sites was given in the presentation. P&G's proposed cuts are the latest in a swathe of corporate job reductions in recent months, as companies battle with economic uncertainty linked to Trump's tariffs and the potential impacts of AI.

Electric Vehicles:

A cargo ship that was abandoned in the middle of the Pacific Ocean after catching fire Tuesday was carrying cars from several Chinese automakers, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Morning Midas was shipping around 3,000 cars from a range of manufacturers including Chery Automobile Co. and Great Wall Motor Co. to Mexico. It's unclear at this stage which brand's electric vehicle caught fire, the people said, who asked not to be identified discussing preliminary findings. </p>
