                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ross Ulbricht received a $31 million bitcoin donation last weekend from an unknown source, many observers saw it as more than a very nice welcome-home gift. Rumors swirled that the creator of the Silk Road, less than five months after receiving a pardon from Donald Trump that saved him from a lifetime in prison, was sending himself a trove of his stashed criminal proceeds from his days running the dark web's first black market more than a decade prior. Now cryptocurrency tracing investigators say they've arrived at a stranger explanation: The money wasn't originally Ulbricht's, and didn't come from the Silk Road. Instead, they suspect it came from a different long-defunct dark-web black market: AlphaBay. Chainalysis says the funds appear to have emerged from AlphaBay around 2016 and 2017. “We have reasonable grounds to suspect that these funds originated in AlphaBay,” says Phil Larratt, Chainalysis's director of investigations and a former official at the UK's National Crime Agency. WIRED reached out to Ulbricht for comment about the donation's origin via contacts at the Free Ross campaign that lobbied for his pardon, but didn't immediately receive a response. ZachXBT also found that the same individual who controlled the funds had cashed out other cryptocurrency at an exchange in small, distributed quantities rather than in a single sum, suggesting he or she may have been trying to prevent them being seized or flagged—another sign that the money may have come from criminal origins. Chainalysis declined to offer more information on how exactly it identified the funds as originating at AlphaBay. AlphaBay's creator and administrator, Alexandre Cazes, died in a Bangkok jail cell under mysterious circumstances following his arrest, but the site's second-in-command, who went by the handle Desnake, appears to have remained at large. Exactly why one of AlphaBay's crypto moguls would donate $31 million to Ulbricht, however, remains a mystery. That gratitude may also take into account that, while many got rich on the dark-web markets that Ulbricht pioneered, he instead spent over a decade in prison, speculates Taylor Monahan, a crypto tracer and security researcher at crypto firm MetaMask. “People donate when they're deeply inspired by someone and/or grateful and/or have some sort of remorse for the situation,” says Monahan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Nintendo Switch 2's packaging material is thin enough for a staple to pierce the Switch 2 screen inside. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 arrives today, but for some, the launch is bittersweet. Some units from GameStop have reportedly been damaged by staples responsible for holding store receipts onto the boxes. One such customer, Oadhan Lynch, stated on X that Gamestop "stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box." Another from Rudeboy on X stated, "Hello! My switch 2 has staple holes in the screen. My switch 2 has staple holes in the screen. No one knows the full extent of the damage, but a since-deleted Reddit post allegedly stated that Gamestop (presumably the New York location) had its entire pre-launch batch of Switch 2s damaged by staples. Thankfully, the affected Switch 2s appear to be fully functional, with several customers posting images on X of their stapled Switch 2s working fine except for having two tiny holes pierced into the LCD panel. Not only is the Switch 2 in high demand, but the new console is also more expensive to produce and significantly more expensive to repair than the original Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 went on sale earlier today at its $449.99 MSRP, but most US-based retailers have allegedly run out of stock. Stock will vary depending on the retailer and store location. For example, my local Target in Georgetown, Texas, has 2 units available at the time of writing, but the Target in Round Rock, 11 miles away, is already out of stock. The new console is Nintendo's latest iteration of the Switch, featuring a bigger LCD high refresh rate (120Hz) screen, an all-new custom Nvidia chip with ray tracing and DLSS support, and upgraded Joy-Cons 2 joysticks that can transition to mimic a PC mouse.Correction: June 5, 4 p.m. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

If you'd like to get on the case yourself, the JBL Go 3 Portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker is just $30 right now at Amazon. This limited-time 25% off deal brings the JBL Go 3 Portable Mini Bluetooth Speaker down to the same price it was during the Black Friday and Cyber Week 2024 holiday shopping season, and it's well worth it, especially now that the weather's warm and you'll be wanting to bring your favorite tunes on the go with you to the beach or on a bike ride, or basically any and everywhere you want. The durability and tough construction of the JBL Go 3 are just as big a selling point as its minute size and great sound. Pop it onto a charger with the included USB-A to USB-C cable, or any USB-C cable you already have, and it'll be back up to full strength in no time. Here's the part that really blows our minds. Even with such a tiny construction with built-in waterproofing and dustproofing, the Go 3 still manages to crank out the famous Original JBL Pro Sound, with crisp high notes and resounding bass.

It's equipped with two two-way USB-C ports, one of which already has the built-in cable, along with a USB-A port. This means you can charge up three devices at once. The main USB-C cable can actually click back into the power bank so you'll never find yourself without a cable. 20,000mAh is the total energy this power bank holds. To put that in more grounded terms, It can charge an iPhone 15 four times from zero percent to a hundred before running out. You can charge an iPhone 16 Pro Max to 50% with the Anker portable charger in just 27 minutes. Compare that to your traditional power bank which will take about an hour. The portable charger features an interactive digital display so you can see just how much juice it has left while charging your phone, laptop, or earbuds. Recently I went on a trip to Spain. I was coming from New York and the flight was about seven hours or so, plus an hour connecting flight to our final destination. I used to have a good power bank, but I lent it to a friend and never got it back. All planes these day have outlets and charging ports at your seat.” Well, when I got there, the only port was a USB A. I went to pull out a charging cable and low and behold, it was USB C-to-C. All of my devices I had with me were USB C or my iPhone which again, the only cable I had was USB C-to-Lightning. Grab this travel-friendly Anker power bank on sale for $40 and save $30 (-43%).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Wo-We Mini PC is amazingly cheap, but there are some trade-offs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. But just what do you get for your money? The Wo-We Mini PC is powered by a dual-core, Intel Celeron N4020 CPU and sports 4GB of RAM, 128GB of eMMC storage, and Wi-Fi 5 wireless connectivity. It comes with Ubuntu Linux preinstalled, though we don't know which version. In terms of video out, the PC has both a VGA and an HDMI port. On its Amazon page, Wo-We claims that the Mini PC offers "powerful performance without breaking the bank" and that its Intel UHD 600 GPU offers "state-of-the-art" graphics technology. The company says that its 802.11ac Wi-Fi offers "faster, smoother and more stable Internet access" too. Depending on your needs, the Wo-We is either "Whoa, we got a lot for the money" or "Woe betide we who bought this." If you just want to use web tools, are comfortable working in Ubuntu Linux (which isn't hard to learn), and don't do much multitasking, this could work out. If you like to have many tabs open or you don't have a lot of patience, this could end up as a $44 paperweight. We haven't gotten the Wo-We Mini PC in for testing. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Those are some weak specs, as most desktop CPUs and even many mobile CPUs these days have boost clocks in the 4 to 5 GHz range. What probably hurts the experience more is the 4GB of RAM, which would make web browsing with more than a couple of tabs open a challenge. However, Linux usually makes better use of memory than Windows does. Another problem: the eMMC memory is probably about equivalent in speed to a typical (not high-speed) microSD card. Tech-savvy users who know to expect lag may have the patience for slowness, but those who need this the most -- people who don't have computers already -- will likely be less inclined to tolerate it. Of course, there are other low-cost choices that allow you to do basic computing. Right now, Woot has a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB of RAM for $44. However, during non-sale times, you're getting 2GB of RAM on your Pi at this price and 4GB will cost you quite a bit more. And with Raspberry Pi, you'd need to buy a microSD card to install your OS on, get micro HDMI cables for video and you couldn't run install Windows (like you can on the Wo-We). Wo-We also sells a $54 Mini PC with 8GB of RAM but with an even older AMD Excavator A9-9400 CPU that launched in May 2016. It's interesting to see that you can get a workable, brand-new desktop PC for $44. Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Every gaming keyboard manufacturer seems to be jumping on the Hall effect bandwagon, and why wouldn't they? The keyboard technology has been proven in both esports arenas and home office setups worldwide and offers countless advantages over standard mechanical keyboards, with no real performance compromises. Hall effect keyboards have also arrived as countless other technologies enter the keyboard space: Everything from gasket-mounting to touchpads is now in mainstream keyboards. That also means I regularly see new products, mechanical and Hall effect, with features I've never even considered before. This $200 wired-only keyboard has Hall effect switches, an 8,000-Hz polling rate, multidevice connectivity with two USB-C ports, and a programmable touchpad on the back edge. Not to mention countless on-keyboard controls and a flipable lever to enable or disable the rapid trigger feature found on most Hall effect keyboards. This is likely a combination of the keyboard's unique HFX magnetic switches, one of the few I've tested that aren't made by Gateron, and the sound dampening inside. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. This makes the Falchion incompatible with standard Hall effect switches, but likely improves the sound profile as well: Open-bottom switches tend to have a more hollow typing sound, which can be heard on competitors. The springs are weighted to 55 grams of total force, which is 5 grams lighter than the Gateron Nebula dual-rail switches used by Keychron, and 10 grams lighter than the standard Cherry MX Red. There aren't any other switches available for this keyboard, but because Hall effect switches are contactless, the existing switches can be removed without any desoldering or extensive disassembly. I didn't find myself wanting to change the switches, though—they have a poppy and deep sound that's incredibly crisp, and they feel responsive and smooth, especially with rapid trigger enabled. They have a rough texture that, while grippy, felt noticeably coarse and unpleasant when typing. It comes down to preference, but I found them less enjoyable than smooth or lightly textured keycaps. From the factory, none of them rattled or clicked at all. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The typing experience can be adjusted in a few ways. The keyboard can be placed inside it, creating a deeper, more rounded-out typing sound. The Falchion has top-of-the-line specs, but it stands out in how these features are implemented. Windows key locking and Caps Lock are located on this LED bar, too. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. These are controlled by swiping and/or double-tapping the touchbar, and they include media playback controls, RGB brightness adjustments, and—the most unique and useful setting—live adjustment of the switches' actuation point, which makes adjustments more streamlined and reduces the need for using software. The lever on the right side, which activates rapid trigger, swaps between on and off with a satisfying click. Rapid trigger is a feature that's become standard on most Hall effect keyboards today. This allows for faster, rapid key presses and generally makes the keyboard feel more responsive, ideal for fast-paced games. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The software shocked me: Asus got it right in almost every way. Armoury Crate is simple, easy to use, and incredibly lightweight. Almost every setting includes a description or an information tool tip, and there are diagrams to demonstrate how to use specific settings. An 8,000-Hz polling rate, while fantastic, is overkill for the average person. Unless you're playing at incredibly high levels with no room for error, a keyboard this fast won't make a tangible difference in your gameplay. Still, it's always nice to have something excessively capable (until you can't blame losing in a game on your keyboard). Another detail that's probably overkill but nice to have is the dual USB-C ports on either side of this keyboard. You can connect a device on each side and use the switch in the center to swap between them. While this keyboard's switches, buttons, and touchpad all feel great, the build quality is pretty average. Typically, there are multiple posts that the printed circuit board (PCB) and plate screw onto, resulting in a singular, rigid piece without any softness or bounce when typing. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The internal assembly sits on top of the case's sound insulation, which has multiple small rubber domes placed throughout. The domes look nearly identical to Topre domes, albeit much smaller, and the stacked design feels reminiscent of Mode's stack mount and lattice block mount designs, which both have the keyboard's internal assembly sitting on top of a mounting material instead of being compressed by it. All this to say, it's an improvement on a standard tray mount, but ultimately falls short of true gasket mounting. It has some bounce, which alleviates the “dead zones” that a tray mount has near the mounting posts, but doesn't do much more. The case is incredibly thin, and while this makes the keyboard more lightweight and portable, it also means it can easily be flexed by hand and will be more susceptible to cracking or damage during transport. The case uses metal screws that go directly into plastic, which could cause stripping or thread damage if you take this keyboard apart a few times to modify it, and the LED bar and buttons on top make it a bit difficult to remove the PCB without having to bend the case or risk breaking any of the screw posts. The LED bar creates further issues with how it is connected to the main PCB, using a mix of small JST connectors and ribbon cables that range from slightly annoying to nearly impossible to reconnect after a full disassembly.

There is one part of this keyboard that I can't understand, though: The Falchion includes a dust cover that can also be used as a secondary case for the keyboard to sit in. It has an obvious purpose to repel dust, but I can't understand why something like this was seen as a worthy inclusion on this keyboard. More than anything else, it seems like an extra piece of plastic to take up space, sit inside the box, or end up lost or thrown away a few years from now. The Asus ROG Falchion Ace HFX is a solid keyboard. It has several great features that improve quality of life massively over other Hall effect keyboards: The controls at the top are practical and convenient, and the touchpad is novel and functional, especially with how well it is integrated into the LED light bar. The largest limitation is customizability: With proprietary switches and a complicated internal design, the Falchion doesn't have the same modification potential as many of its competitors from Wooting, Keychron, or even SteelSeries. I prefer seeing a company take big swings, even if it means some misses alongside some hits, rather than play it safe and create something boring. The Falchion Ace HFX is a big swing, bringing some great new ideas to the table while still being a solid keyboard underneath.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company stressed that 90% of those billings and sales did not involve paying Apple a commission. The numbers are intended to highlight how the App Store creates financial opportunities for mobile developers that extend beyond sales from in-app purchases. The storefront provides a place for developers to have their apps discovered by consumers, and Apple provides the technical infrastructure required to run an app business. Developers today have a number of tools at their disposal to host, distribute, and manage their own applications, if they choose, but Apple's policies prevent this. In a recent court ruling in favor of Epic Games in the U.S., Apple was required to let developers link to their own websites for processing in-app purchases without having to pay Apple a commission. Digital payment spending, meanwhile, also grew by more than seven times in the U.S. since 2019, thanks to the broad adoption of mobile payments. The report also reiterated other metrics, like how the App Store attracts 813 million average weekly visitors worldwide, and pointed to the various investments Apple has made in tools and technologies to support developers, like coding and distribution platforms, frameworks, analytics, anti-fraud systems, developer support, and more.

Nintendo's long-anticipated and likely most leaked handheld, the Switch 2, is set to hit shelves today. If you plan to purchase one, handle it with care, as replacement parts are expected to become more expensive, via Notebookcheck. Nintendo Japan's pricing indicates a massive surge of up to 92% for replacement parts, affecting components like the mainboard, LCD, dock, Joy-Cons, and even the new Pro Controller. Since Nintendo has only disclosed these prices on their Japanese storefront, a direct comparison for U.S. customers is not possible. With some expected variations, we may probably see a similar spike globally as well. Replacement for parts excluding the CPU board and LCD were consolidated into a single package previously, but now Nintendo will charge different prices depending on the affected components. Despite not featuring hall-effect joysticks, the new Joy-Cons will cost $25 to repair, making them 40% pricier than their Switch OLED/V1 counterparts. Lastly, the Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back $41.50 in repair costs, making it 50% more expensive than its predecessor. Most of these changes can be attributed to increased manufacturing costs and new features, but the clear takeaway is the importance of carefully handling your console. Given the Switch 2's MSRP increase from $299 to $449, higher repair costs were almost a guarantee. Aside from authorized repair, iFixit has lowered the original Switch's repairability score from 8/10 to 4/10, citing issues with parts availability, repair manuals, and design challenges. It remains to be seen if the Switch 2 will improve upon this or achieve an even worse rating. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic says it has released a new set of AI models tailored for U.S. national security customers. The new models, a custom set of “Claude Gov” models, were “built based on direct feedback from our government customers to address real-world operational needs,” writes Anthropic in the blog post. “[These] models are already deployed by agencies at the highest level of U.S. national security, and access to these models is limited to those who operate in such classified environments,” writes Anthropic in its post. “[They] underwent the same rigorous safety testing as all of our Claude models.” Anthropic has increasingly engaged U.S. government customers as it looks for dependable new sources of revenue. In November, the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of Anthropic's major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic's AI to defense customers. Anthropic says its new custom Claude Gov models better handle classified material, “refuse less” when engaging with classified information, and have a greater understanding of documents within intelligence and defense contexts. The models also have “enhanced proficiency” in languages and dialects critical to national security operations, Anthropic says, as well as “improved understanding and interpretation of complex cybersecurity data for intelligence analysis.” Anthropic isn't the only top AI lab going after defense contracts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social network X has changed its developer agreement to prevent third parties from using the platform's content to train large language models. In an update on Wednesday, the company added a line under “Reverse Engineering and other Restrictions,” a subsection of restrictions on use: “You shall not and you shall not attempt to (or allow others to) […] use the X API or X Content to fine-tune or train a foundation or frontier model,” it reads. This change comes after Elon Musk's AI company xAI acquired X in March — understandably, xAI wouldn't want to give its competitors free access to the social platform's data without a sale agreement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Monik Pamecha co-founded AI voice startup Toma in early 2024, he hadn't anticipated spending the summer months sweating in Bible Belt car dealerships. “They just called us up and said ‘we are drowning in phone calls,'” Pamecha described that initial contact in an interview with TechCrunch. Seeing an opportunity to pivot into a far less-regulated space than banking or healthcare, Pamecha and Krivonos set up a test: They decided to have their voice agent call essentially every car dealership in the country multiple times. And like some sort of modern reinterpretation of the movie “Tommy Boy,” they set out to tour a dozen car dealerships in Oklahoma and Mississippi to get a better understanding of how these businesses work. They got their hands dirty both figuratively and literally; Pamecha said his wife was surprised by the grease stains on his clothes when he returned home. Seema Amble, a partner at a16z who led the $17 million that Toma has raised to date, said the pair were “effectively living at these dealerships, going to these dealers' family barbecues, really understanding how they operate.” “We invest in a lot of the next-generation of vertical AI companies, a lot of the best founders have just lived and breathed with these customers to understand what's going on under the hood,” she told TechCrunch. The AI helps customers schedule service appointments, handle parts orders, answer sales questions, and more. Along with a16z, Pamecha and Krivonos attracted investment from Y Combinator (they created Toma at YC in January 2024), the Scale Angels Fund, and auto industry influencer Yossi Levi, also known as the Car Dealership Guy. Levi told TechCrunch that dealerships struggle with phone calls in part because it's hard to predict volume. Other times there's not enough demand, and matching staffing and properly training that staff for a consistent experience is just not an easy thing to do,” Levi said. Pamecha said Toma's onboarding process involves training on a dealers' customer calls for a week or two to give the AI some context. Some dealers might service more diesel engines, for example. Dealerships also run lots of custom promotions for both sales and service. After that initial burst of training, the Toma AI starts taking calls, handing off to human employees if and when it gets stumped. On the business side, Toma operates a subscription model. As the AI agents can handle more parts of a dealership's operations, those dealers will have to pay up for those extra capabilities. Before that, it was still largely Pamecha and Krivonos hustling like they did across the country last summer. Without that trip, though, Pamecha said he's not sure Toma would have reached this point. I think they see that we feel the pain, too.” With the countdown to TC Sessions: AI underway, it's your chance to flex your AI knowledge—and score 2 tickets for the price of 1.

This puts it thinner than human hair, and small enough that even the smallest tardigrades could not play it—a fact made slightly less relevant by the violin's inability to produce musical notes. The instrument is made of platinum through a process called thermal scanning probe lithography. "Building the world's smallest violin may all seem like fun and games, but a lot of what we've learnt in this process has essentially laid the groundwork for the research that's going to be implemented here," shares Morrison. The university used its new thermal scanning probe microscope, a NanoFrazor from Heidelberg Instruments in Switzerland. The tool has an ultrasharp, ultra-hot probe tip that etches structures at the nanoscale into many different materials at resolutions as fine as 15 nm; a "very, very, very, small needle that can see atomic interaction," per Morrison. A layer of platinum was deposited on the chip, with a final acetone rinse leaving behind only the platinum violin statuette. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The nanolithography process employed to create the violin is already being studied by two teams at Loughborough's School of Science to iterate on and improve data storage technologies. One such research team is studying a future in heat-based storage systems; utilizing nanolithography to fabricate heat-sensitive nanoparticles may be a major step in memory devices utilizing multiple different materials on a single memory device. Another project utilizing the nanolithography tools is an inquiry into using the probe to develop nanoscale magnetic sensors for even smaller magnetic memory devices. As magnetic hard drives continue growing smaller, it becomes more difficult to read and write magnetic data with acceptable stability at ever-increasing densities; this was the physical limit necessitating HAMR (heat-assisted magnetic recording) technology in today's bleeding-edge hard drives. While many scientists and researchers have begun looking beyond to alternate hardware trends like photonic-based microchips as Moore's Law begins to slow, this push deeper into nanolithography promises to return dividends in extending the lifespan of traditional compute technologies. And from now on, when someone offers up a truly sad anecdote, you really can play for them a song on the world's smallest violin, provided, of course, you can catch a ride to Loughborough in Leicestershire.
