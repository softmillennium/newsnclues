The defending champions, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek have both made it through so far — though notably neither player occupies the top-seeded spot in their respective singles tournaments. American tennis star Coco Gauff is the No. In the U.S., coverage of this year's tournament is airing on TNT and truTV, and every match is streaming live on HBO Max. Are you ready to watch the French Open? The 2025 French Open will take place between May 25 and June 8. Singles play begins May 25, with the men's final closing things out on June 8. In a shift from last year, the 2025 Roland-Garros tennis tournament will air across TNT and truTV — with all matches streaming on Max (soon to be officially re-named HBO Max). If you don't already have access to these platforms, this is a great option that really covers your bases, streaming-wise. You'll get access to three vast libraries, fully stocked with everything MCU, all those Disney princesses (new and old), Hulu's robust catalog of shows on-demand the day after they air, including the latest episodes of Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and more, and the most recent seasons of The Last of Us, The Pitt and White Lotus. While Sling doesn't offer a free trial these days, the tournament will last longer than any free trial anyway. With Sling Blue, you can get access to French Open coverage on TNT and truTV. Sling also has an option to bundle Max in with your Sling Orange + Blue subscription and save $5 on the overall price, in case you want to watch games via Max and take advantage of all the channels offered in the Sling Orange + Blue combo package. If you want to catch every match of the French Open and don't currently subscribe to HBO Max or a live TV streaming service, in Australia a majority of the action is streaming free with ads on 9Now, and in Austria it's all streaming free with ads on ServusTV. Don't live in either of those places? A VPN (virtual private network) helps protect your data, can mask your IP address and is perhaps most popular for being especially useful in the age of streaming. Whether you're looking to watch Friends on Netflix (which left the U.S. version of the streamer back in 2019) or tune in to next F1 race without a cable package, a VPN can help you out. Looking to try a VPN for the first time? This guide breaks down the best VPN options for every kind of user. ExpressVPN offers “internet without borders,” meaning you can tune into an Austrian or Australian livestream this month as opposed to paying for another streaming subscription. All you'll need to do is sign up for ExpressVPN, change your server location and then find free livestream coverage on 9Now or ServusTV. ExpressVPN's added protection, speed and range of location options make it an excellent choice for first-time VPN users looking to stretch their streaming abilities, plus, it's Engadget's top pick for the best streaming VPN. New users can save 61% when they sign up for ExpressVPN's 2-year subscription.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka snapped Iga Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros with a hard-fought victory in Thursday's semifinals. Aryna Sabalenka has ended Iga Swiatek's reign at Roland Garros. 5 seed Swiatek 7-6(1), 4-6, 6-0 in their French Open semifinal showdown on Thursday. Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam singles champion and two-time runner-up, is now into her first Grand Slam final off of hard court. "It's just something unbelievable and something I'm super proud of, and yeah, just happy to get through this difficult match." Sabalenka took 2 hours and 19 minutes to snap four-time champion Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at the event. Swiatek's Roland Garros win-loss record now sits at 40-3. But Sabalenka is definitively on top of the tour at this point, at WTA events as well as Grand Slams. Title hopes extended: After defeating this decade's dominant force at Roland Garros, Sabalenka's quest will continue for one more match. She will face Coco Gauff of the United States in a No. "[The semifinal] was a big match, and it felt like a final, but I know that the job is not done yet," Sabalenka said. Fast facts: This was only the second Grand Slam meeting between Sabalenka and Swiatek. Poland's Swiatek pulled off a three-set win over Sabalenka in the 2022 US Open semifinals, en route to her one Grand Slam title off of clay. Swiatek came into the match with a 5-1 head-to-head lead over Sabalenka on the Pole's beloved clay courts, but this was the first year since 2020 that Swiatek came into Roland Garros without having won a clay-court title. It was a different story for Sabalenka, who had already won three titles (including a third Madrid title on clay) and reached three other finals this year entering Paris. Now, she has reached six Grand Slam finals during the 2020s -- one more than Swiatek. "It's going to mean everything to me and my team, because I have to say that almost like the whole life I've been told where [clay] is not my thing and then I didn't have any confidence. "And in the past I don't know how many years, we've been able to develop my game so much, so I feel really comfortable on this surface and actually enjoy playing on clay. Both players were broken four times en route to a first-set tiebreak. In the breaker, though, Sabalenka came up with some of her most overwhelming serves to supplement her return prowess; she fired an ace to change ends with a dominant 5-1 lead. On the next point, Swiatek misfired long on return to give Sabalenka five set points; the top seed needed only one to wrap up a hard-fought first set after an intense 1 hour and 15 minutes. Swiatek executed a love hold to level the match and keep her streak alive for at least one more set. Swiatek's hopes, though, were rapidly extinguished as Sabalenka took command in the third set. It was Sabalenka who doubled down on ferocious, flat forehands as she romped through the 22-minute decider. In the third set, Sabalenka went 3-for-3 on break points, hit five winners to Swiatek's two, and was credited with zero unforced errors. Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka snapped Iga Swiatek's 26-match winning streak at Roland Garros with a hard-fought victory in Thursday's semifinals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlike some of her counterparts in the top 10, Coco Gauff didn't have much trouble solving the riddle of Lois Boisson. 2 seed, dismantled the previously unknown Frenchwoman 6-1, 6-2 on Thursday to reach the French Open final for a second time. Though her level of play has vacillated between sharp and sloppy throughout the tournament, Gauff was mostly dialed in against Boisson, who captivated the Parisian crowds in recent days by knocking off No. 6 Mirra Andreeva to reach the semifinals in her Grand Slam singles debut. Gauff has been hunting a French Open title since arriving on tour, reaching the finals in 2022 and the semifinals last year, losing to four-time champion Iga Swiatek on both occasions. This time, the 21-year-old from Delray Beach, Florida, won't have to face Swiatek – but Sabalenka stands as just as much of a challenge these days, even on clay. Sabalenka ran away from Swiatek in the other semifinal, 7-6, 4-6, 6-0, breaking through to her first French final. Sabalenka will be trying to win her fourth major, joining two Australian and one US title. Gauff and Sabalenka have split their 10 career meetings. Most recently, Sabalenka edged out a 6-3, 7-6 win in the Madrid finals on clay. Gauff beat Sabalenka 7-6, 6-3 last fall in the championship match of the WTA Finals on a hard court.</p>

American tennis star Jessica Pegula may have suffered a tough French Open exit against wild-card entry Loïs Boisson but she was still taking swings at critics afterward. Pegula revealed afterward she received death threats from "delusional" bettors upset over the loss to the relatively unknown tennis star. Jessica Pegula of the U.S. plays a shot against France's Lois Boisson during their fourth round match of the French Tennis Open at the Roland-Garros stadium in Paris, Monday, Jun. "These (bettors) are insane and delusional," she wrote on her Instagram Stories on Wednesday, via the New York Post. "And I don't allow dms and try to remember when to shut my comments off during tournament weeks but they always find a way to my timeline. This stuff has never really bothered me much but does any other sport deal with this to our level? The daughter of Terry and Kim Pegula, who own the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres, also shared screenshots of commenters who ridiculed her for the loss. Some called her "trash" while others said she should just enjoy being the daughter of billionaires. There were other nasty comments as well. "You sold this match on purpose," one person wrote. "Can't wait until Karma spends the block back on you. Hopefully your first born child will be a still birth." Pegula added that "every person" on the Women's Tennis Association deals with some type of awful remark. "I get told my family should get cancer and die from people here on a regular basis. "I've seen stories of comments/threats/stalking making headlines in other sports…well news flash tennis I can guarantee it's 100 times worse. Win or lose – it's whatever they bet on. "I actually had threats come through the NHL that they were worried about and sent to me. Pegula added that staying off social media was unavoidable because most of their sponsorship deals involve posting on their platforms. Jessica Pegula, of the United States, returns to Iga Świątek, of Poland, during the quarterfinals of the U.S. Open tennis championships, Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2024, in New York. Pro tennis players Arthur Bouquier and Caroline Garcia also shared threats they've received in recent years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The French Open continues to receive criticism for its scheduling decisions at this year's tournament. As the tournament reaches its latter stages, fans on Paris' most famous court, Philippe Chatrier, have yet to see WTA stars headline a night session. Several women's players have shared their thoughts on the controversial topic, including Jessica Pegula who complained about the lack of equality shown. As Roland Garros officials receive complaints, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has weighed in with his thoughts. “There are many factors that go into making a decision around scheduling,” said Tiley. “I haven't spoken to anyone at the French Tennis Federation, so I can't go into the basis of their decision.” “We have 26 sessions over the course of the fortnight, and a session every night, so there are 14 nights of tennis. Some nights there's three courts playing with two matches,” said Tiley. Some years, you may have it more skewed towards the women or more skewed towards the men. “There's the added complication of three sets versus five sets, that's just the time, not a value, because you can get three-set matches that are more intense, but on average, the three sets are going to be shorter.” Tiley outlined the factors that go into making scheduling decisions at Grand Slam tournaments. “Our decisions are based on what the players want, what the broadcasters want, between when you played your last match, are you playing singles, doubles mixed?” he said. “The players are a big part of that too, some like day, some like night, so you take all of these into consideration and you do the best you can. “I always say to the players, we'll make sure it's fair, not necessarily equal.” If they were to schedule a women's match on Chatrier's night session, which finished in two short sets, fans would likely leave without a full evening's entertainment. Last week, former world number four Tim Henman provided a simple solution to the scheduling controversy, addressing those two key issues. “Go to two matches and start earlier,” said Henman. Through the first 11 days of the tournament, fans on Chatrier have been treated to several evening classics between ATP stars, but could their female counterparts have offered up even more entertainment? It's of course up for debate whether the women's matches would've been better choices than the men's, but the French Open certainly can't say they weren't spoilt for choice. Day 12 of the French Open will see Aryna Sabalenka take on Iga Swiatek, before Lois Boisson plays Coco Gauff.</p>

PARIS (AP) — Third-seeded Italian pair Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat fourth-seeded Americans Taylor Townsend and Evan King 6-4, 6-2 to win the mixed doubles title at the French Open on Thursday. It was their second major title together after winning last year's U.S. Open. For Errani, it was another trophy won at Roland-Garros, after winning Olympic gold in women's doubles with compatriot Jasmine Paolini last year. “Let's see if I will see you next year, let's hope,” the 38-year-old Errani, who was a 2012 French Open singles runner-up, told the crowd on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Townsend was the U.S. Open mixed runner-up last year with Donald Young, and has won two major women's doubles titles. She hopes their performance inspires others back home and beyond. “This is special for me and Evan. We grew up on the south side of Chicago," Townsend said. “He's seen me since I was coming up,” she said. “We used to play at the public courts, Jackson Park, we used to play at the same park and we used to be at the same places.” This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner admitted that beating Novak Djokovic when he's playing at his best is a monumental feat. 1 is currently gearing up for a French Open semi-final clash with the Serbian titan this Friday, looking to add to his two Australian Opens and a US Open title. At just 23 years old, Sinner has been vocal about his respect for Djokovic, having met with him eight times on the court to date. And although Sinner has beaten the seasoned star in their last three matches, his own experiences tell him how formidable Djokovic can be when performing at his best. Reflecting during the Australian Open this year, Sinner responded to Alexander Zverev's comments comparing him to a prime Djokovic. He said: "Well it's an amazing compliment from Sahsa. I think everyone is different in a way. "Obviously I have some similarities with Novak's game-style. But for sure we have similarities, and the similarities are having quite clean well striking from the base-line, having good movement, understanding a little bit where your opponent plays the ball. And that is where we are going to work on." The comments came after his impressive 6-3, 7-6 [7-4], 6-3 victory over Zverev in the final at Melbourne earlier this year. And it's not the first time he has praised Djokovic. When you drop a little bit against the best player in the world, he makes it look like it's a big difference." This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Meanwhile, Djokovic has reciprocated respect for his rival, despite rumours of disrespect before this year's Australian Open. Djokovic participated in a word association game with GQ prior to the tournament, and while he tied Roger Federer with "elegance", Rafael Nadal with "tenacity" and Carlos Alcaraz with "charisma", his succinct response of "skiing" regarding Sinner raised eyebrows amongst some fans. However, the tennis ace was swift to clarify the situation, saying at the the tournament: "Yes, I've seen it on social media that it's being made into some kind of drama or a story, like I humiliated him or I've intentionally shown disrespect toward him. Sinner's name came up and I had this image in my head of him skiing, because I saw he was skiing somewhere. "Also, the two of us talk about skiing always, how we're going to ski together, etc. He added: "It is as clear as day that the way he is dominating is worthy of every praise – both his playing style and the level of play. He's got all the attributes I've mentioned in others [Federer, Nadal, Alcaraz], and now people make it seem like I am disrespecting him. All eyes are on Sinner and Djokovic as they prepare for their showdown on Court Philippe-Chatrier come Friday, each aiming to secure their place in the French Open final where they will face either Lorenzo Musetti or Carlos Alcaraz.

Tennis season is officially here, with the French Open currently underway. Players, staff, entourage and hardcore fans all need somewhere to stay throughout Wimbledon. Located a 20-minute walk (or six-minute drive) away from Wimbledon, this four-bedroom period house is available on a “tennis let” throughout the tournament for £3,200 per week via Hamptons. There are two bathrooms, a large kitchen to prepare nutritious, Wimbledon-ready meals and a rear garden for players or fans to relax in. Why bother with tickets — or queues — for Queens when you can watch the tennis from your terrace? This year, it's running from 7 to 22 June, featuring some of the biggest names in the sport, including Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Jack Draper, Emma Raducanu and Naomi Osaka. Located on Gledstanes Road, the 652 square foot top floor apartment has a west-facing terrace with “truly remarkable views” over Queen's Club. "Properties with views over the Queen's Club are exceptionally rare, and this apartment offers one of the best vantage points we've seen,” says Nick Scott, sales manager at John D Wood & Co.'s Fulham branch. “It's ideal for young professionals, pied-à-terre seekers, or those looking for a smart investment in one of west London's most desirable pockets," says Scott. There are 1.24 acres of grounds and an indoor pool complex, with a spa pool, changing room, steam room and sauna to help boost an athlete's recovery. And, when it's time for the Championships, Wimbledon is a 12-minute drive away. As visitors descend on Wimbledon during the Championships, some homeowners on the nearby streets make thousands of pounds renting out their parking spaces. Spaces listed on YourParkingSpace can go for up to around £70 per day, so homeowners with multiple spaces and bookings throughout Wimbledon are quids in. This 1,891 square foot property on Somerset Road is a five-minute walk from Wimbledon, and comes with off-street parking big enough for more than one car and a large double garage. Other parking spaces in Cedar Court are being advertised for £62.50 per day. One bedroom is ensuite and there are two extra bathrooms, plus a rear garden. This four-bedroom house on Grand Drive backs onto the All England Lawn Tennis Club Community Centre in Raynes Park. You might be able to spot some of those training sessions from the rooms at the back of this 1,279 square foot house – or, failing that, you'll live close enough to the community facility to hone your own tennis skills. There's a bright kitchen and dining space which leads onto the garden and a loft conversion from which to snoop on the players. This house in Rottingdean, East Sussex, is the former home of Britain's most successful tennis player, Fred Perry. In 1935, he became the first man to win a career Grand Slam, having won all four major titles between 1933 and 1935. He remains the only British player to have done this, and in 1984 a bronze statue of him was erected outside Wimbledon. It's on the market with David Webb Residential for £1.5 million.
