                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A United States district judge has ruled that the Trump administration must provide hundreds of migrants sent to an El Salvador megaprison under the Alien Enemies Act the ability to challenge their deportation. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling on Wednesday, determining that allowing those deportations to stand without recognizing migrants' due process would not only violate their rights, but also create an unacceptable precedent. Boasberg also noted that President Donald Trump issued the order for deportations against individuals who his administration had determined were part of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang. An independent examination of migrants who were deported to the El Salvador CECOT prison complex on March 15 and 16 shows that there is no evidence of any criminal history for around three-quarters of those individuals. By refusing to allow these individuals the ability to challenge their deportations, the administration “plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. The judge's decree does not apply to all immigrants who were deported to El Salvador, but is narrowly focused on those who were removed from the U.S. based on the Alien Enemies Act proclamation that Trump made earlier this year — individuals like Kilmar Abrego García, whose deportation is similarly questionable but was based on other rationales, are not affected by Boasberg's ruling. Boasberg left open the possibility that some deportations could be viewed as justifiable if the administration allowed individuals to challenge their deportations. Boasberg was also mindful of the incredibly dangerous precedent that could be created by allowing the administration's actions to remain unchallenged. “Absent this relief” from his ruling, Boasberg said, “The Government could snatch anyone off the street, turn him over to a foreign country, and then effectively foreclose any corrective course of action.” It's unclear what appellate courts may do next with the case. “[This is an] important moment for the rule of law and against government lawlessness,” Ryan Goodman, co-editor-in-chief of Just Security, wrote in a Bluesky post. Noting that “details [of the case still need] to be worked out” — chiefly, how the deported migrants may see their individual cases remedied — constitutional law professor and political commentator Harry Litman applauded Boasberg for stating in his ruling that “violations must be remedied.” “Today's ruling affirms what every American knows: in the United States, people are entitled to due process and no one should be removed from the country without it,” Perryman said.

The tribe has already designated the land as a salmon sanctuary and community forest and plans to eventually put it into a trust and care for it in perpetuity. And so it's our job, our inherent right, to take care of the Klamath Basin and its river.” The removal of the dams enabled coho and Chinook salmon that had been blocked to finally swim upstream to spawn for the first time in more than a century. Josh Kling, conservation director at the Western Rivers Conservancy, said the nonprofit acquired the land in pieces from Green Diamond, a timber company, and paid for it using a combination of private funding, tax credits, carbon credit sales, low-interest loans, revolving loans, federal revolving loan programs, and settlement funds. Kling said the 47,000 acres of land returned to the Yurok Tribe includes redwood forests that help protect against climate change and protect crucial habitat for birds such as the marbled murrelet, Humboldt marten. and northern spotted owl, just as the trees were becoming ripe for a fresh round of logging. “The project was really timely to get in there before a new round of timber harvest and the associated road building,” said Kling. He is particularly excited about how Blue Creek, a cold-water tributary just 16 miles from the mouth of the river, is now protected because of how the tributary provides an essential place for salmon and steelhead to cool off before heading further upstream to spawn. “The importance of Blue Creek to the larger Klamath system really can't be overstated,” he said. James from the Yurok Tribe described Blue Creek as a high prayer area, a village site, and essential fishing grounds. In 2020, it was also where Yurok officials helped persuade PacifiCorp officials to move forward with dam removal after two decades of advocacy. James credited Troy Fletcher, a former executive director of the Yurok Tribe who played a key role in the dam removal campaign and who has since passed away, for helping to initiate the landback project. Kling said the conservancy is increasingly working with tribal nations to facilitate land transfers and hopes to work with more. Studies have shown that conservation goals are more effectively met when Indigenous peoples manage their own territories. “The more that we can partner with tribal stewards to achieve our conservation outcomes, those are durable lasting results,” Kling said. “Here's a model that we can share with the Indian Country,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a decade after casting his last spell, Tom Felton, best known for playing Harry Potter's bleach-blond nemesis, is returning to the wizarding world. Felton, 37, starred in the Harry Potter film franchise from 2001 to 2011, and has remained a fan favourite as one of the series' most notorious characters. “Joining this production will be a full-circle moment for me.” First staged in London in 2016 and written by the Adolescence co-creator Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is based on a story co-devised with JK Rowling. Set 19 years after the original series, it follows Harry – now a Ministry of Magic employee – and his wife, Ginny, as they send their son Albus Severus to Hogwarts. The play's producers, Sonia Friedman and Colin Callender, called the return “a cultural moment charged with nostalgia, evolution, and emotion”. They said: “We can't wait to see him inhabit this role once again with the same depth, gravity, and humanity he has always brought to Draco.” The production has been running on Broadway since 2018, originally in two parts lasting five hours, but since 2021 as a single three-and-a-half-hour production.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend, targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, asked on Thursday what Moscow's response would be, said: “How and when our military deems it appropriate.” Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields, during an unannounced phone call on Wednesday. “It turned out that a Shahed drone hit his house.” But Russian officials have suggested that Moscow has yet to respond to Ukraine's weekend drone attack, which came a day before two bridges collapsed, killing seven people – attacks Moscow blamed on Ukrainian sabotage. After Ukraine carried out its unorthodox operation using drones smuggled into Russia on trucks, pro-Kremlin war bloggers and prominent commentators posted on Russian media to demand retribution, with some calling for nuclear retaliation. Russia's nuclear doctrine permits the use of nuclear weapons in response to attacks that pose a “critical threat” to the country's sovereignty. He argued the operation did not threaten Russia's sovereignty or territorial integrity, nor did it undermine the retaliatory capacity of its strategic nuclear arsenal. A nuclear strike would also be strongly condemned by China, Russia's most influential ally, with Xi Jinping previously warning Putin against the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Instead, as in past responses to Ukrainian military successes, Moscow may launch a wave of deadly ballistic missile strikes – or deploy its experimental Oreshnik missile, which was used at least once last year. Ukraine has intensified its sabotage operations over the past week, including detonating underwater explosives beneath a key bridge linking Russia to the Crimean peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014. “How can we have meetings like this under these conditions? Trump has not publicly commented on the Ukrainian drone operation, but sources who reportedly discussed it with him told Axios he described the attack as “strong” and “badass” and saw it as a setback to his diplomatic initiative to end the war. While the drone strikes dealt a tangible blow to Russia's military capacity and offered a morale boost for Kyiv, the broader picture remains less rosy for Ukraine. Putin's forces have been advancing further into Ukraine's northern region of Sumy, threatening the regional capital after taking more than 150 sq km of the area in less than two weeks. With Putin showing no willingness to agree to a lasting ceasefire, Ukrainian officials and the military are preparing for a Russian summer offensive, with Moscow intent on advancing into the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the UK-based Oxford Russia Fund of conducting a covert influence campaign in Russian universities aimed at undermining national security. The organization had already been declared ‘undesirable' by Moscow, a designation that prohibits its activities and implies involvement in hostile propaganda efforts. While it claimed to provide scholarships and academic resources, its work raised red flags for the authorities. According to the FSB, it nonetheless continued to operate subversively, maintaining covert ties with university staff and facilitating the spread of foreign narratives. In a statement issued on Thursday, the FSB said faculty members in the regions of Volgograd, Novosibirsk, Chelyabinsk, and Tomsk worked with the banned organization to distribute materials promoting “support for sexual minorities and LGBT values” – content considered incompatible with traditional Russian values. Fifteen Russian nationals have received official warnings under criminal statutes related to collaboration with foreign entities deemed a threat to national security. One professor has already been fined for involvement with a banned group. The FSB claimed that British intelligence services have long targeted Russian academia as a channel for ideological influence. Over the past decade, Russia has introduced stricter laws to shield society from LGBT propaganda. In 2013, LGBT content was banned for minors, and by 2022, the ban extended to all audiences. In 2023, the ‘international LGBT movement' was designated as a terrorist organization. The authorities accuse the NGO of serving as a vehicle for British intelligence, using cultural programming as cover to destabilize sovereign states. Russia's ambassador in London, Andrey Kelin, recently denounced Britain's behavior as “belligerent and irresponsible,” calling its support for Ukraine “senseless” and “reckless.” Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Liana Fix is Fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of Germany's Role in European Russia Policy: A New German Power? The first hundred days of Donald Trump's second presidency have turned out worse for Europeans than expected. In addition to Vice President JD Vance's ideological crusade against European liberals, there are fears that the United States will abandon Ukraine and frustration and concern over Trump's initiation of unprecedented tariffs on European countries. In the wake of these disruptions, it is not surprising that the gaze of some European politicians has wistfully turned toward China, which is perceived by some as a potential hedge against an unpredictable United States. And after Chinese leader Xi Jinping declined to travel to Europe for a 50th anniversary summit on EU-Chinese ties, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, skeptical yet pragmatic in dealing with China, announced she will travel to Beijing in late July. This is a change from Trump's first term, when China overplayed its hand and embraced an aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy that backfired. Now, not a day passes in which Chinese officials do not underscore how they share their European counterparts' desire to protect the multilateral trading system from Trump's disruptions. Xi, for instance, has noted that China and Europe are “two major forces for building a multipolar world, two major markets supporting globalization, and two major civilizations championing diversity.” China has even proposed reviving the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which was put on ice in 2021 after Beijing sanctioned several members of the European Parliament who were critical of China. If implemented, the CAI would replace the bilateral treaties that regulate how Chinese investors are treated in European countries and help create a level playing field for European businesses in China. In fact, Trump's disruptions are only magnifying China's economic and security threats to Europe. These low-cost Chinese exports are massively subsidized and undercut European producers who are already facing margin pressures and the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Many of the goods China redirected from the United States to the EU are now competing directly with Europe's core manufacturing industries—the automotive sector, for instance, as well as electronics, industrial machinery and components, home appliances, and clean energy technologies. Europe's security threat from China has not diminished either. The Ukrainian government says it has evidence that Chinese factories inside Russia are producing weapons and that China is exporting gunpowder and artillery to Russia for use in Ukraine. If China is bolstering Russia's military with impunity from both Brussels and Washington, the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end in a cease-fire or a peace agreement in the foreseeable future, and Russia will continue to destabilize not only Ukraine but also the entire European continent. Seeking détente with China, therefore, is still a dangerous game for the EU. Instead, the EU must realize it has other cards to play, including forging more advantageous trade agreements elsewhere in the world and changing China's calculus about supporting Russia. This negotiation has long been stalled because of disputes over market access and tariff reductions, but the United Kingdom recently secured its own agreement with India, which could provide a path for the EU to do the same. Building on momentum from the 2023 Hiroshima G-7 summit, Europe should also deepen coordination on economic and technology security with advanced democracies, particularly Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom. These countries must align their strategies to counter Chinese economic coercion and mitigate the risks of China's civil-military fusion. Collectively, these same allies can also help sustain high-value scientific research, which the second Trump administration is aggressively defunding at top U.S. research universities and government labs. What could become a generational self-inflicted wound for the United States could also become a generational opportunity for Europe—to attract displaced talent, safeguard R & D programs, and reinforce its own innovation base. Although strong security frameworks will be necessary to prevent intellectual property theft, selective cooperation with Beijing will remain crucial for European companies, especially in the automotive sector, where European manufacturers lag behind, and in battery innovation and clean energy technology, where Chinese firms lead globally. Strategic patience and careful design today can lay the groundwork for a renewed transatlantic partnership tomorrow. Insulating itself from trade shocks, however, is only step one: Europe must also stop underestimating China's support for Russia's war against Ukraine, which in turn threatens European security. Beijing has stopped short of delivering weapons directly to Russia, which President Joe Biden warned is a redline. But China's supply of dual-use goods, such as semiconductor chips and weapons parts, has taken on such proportions that it has become the equivalent of providing lethal aid: Carnegie estimates that, in 2023, China was responsible for roughly 90 percent of the goods that Russia needs to sustain its war effort. Yet pressure on China for its obstructive role has almost disappeared. Trump administration officials have declined to push for greater scrutiny of China's role in the war and have instead repeatedly suggested that China can help end the war in a positive way, without following up with any pressure on China to do so. European governments, meanwhile, say they oppose Beijing's involvement while doing little to genuinely punish or deter China: so far, Europe has sanctioned only a few dozen Chinese companies for delivering dual-use goods to Russia. Kyiv has claimed, for instance, that more than 150 Chinese mercenaries are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine and that Beijing has done nothing to rein them in. Ukraine has also pointed to China's willingness to cross the dual-use line, claiming it has evidence of China's direct involvement in weapons manufacturing inside Russia. Yet precisely because China is no longer facing any significant backlash from the United States or Europe, Beijing has moved to take advantage of the newly permissive environment. During a summit last month in Moscow, which coincided with Russia's annual commemoration of the Allied victory in World War II, Putin and Xi pledged to “enhance [their] strategic coordination.” Increasing pressure on China for its support of the war, therefore, is one of the best methods by which the United States and Europe could increase pressure on Russia to agree to a cease-fire. The flip side of Europe's trade dependence on China is China's own reliance on Europe's market to absorb its excess capacity. Since Trump's tariff announcements against China and the diversion of U.S.-bound Chinese goods to Europe, Europe is now an even more important market for China's exports; Europeans should use that leverage to ramp up the pressure on China. Instead of merely sanctioning Chinese companies that trade in goods that are of use to Russia's military, the European Union should apply sanctions on Chinese banks that help Russia circumvent the EU's sanctions regime. And if China truly wants to pursue a revival of an investment agreement with Europe, Brussels should condition any talks on China restricting the flow of dual-use goods to Russia's military. Europeans also have an opportunity to take advantage of China's role on the sidelines of negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. China has invested a great deal of political capital into portraying itself as a potential neutral mediator in the war, albeit with pro-Russian leanings. This is now, ironically, the same role that the Trump administration has assumed, and there are signs that China suspects it is being left out. According to The Wall Street Journal, Chinese officials proposed hosting a Putin-Trump summit and offered to facilitate peacekeeping efforts in Ukraine, but Washington wasn't interested. Europeans should signal to Beijing that it could be in China's interest to take a step back from being so obviously supportive of Russia, while arguing neutrality. Increased pressure on China will not, of course, result in Beijing abandoning Moscow. Nor will more free-trade agreements completely make up for the economic losses in a trade war with the United States and diminishing returns from trade with China. Europe cannot hedge against Trump's disruptions by selling out its own economy and security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow will take into account in negotiations the fact that the Kiev regime is becoming terrorist, Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. It will be taken into account," he replied, when asked whether Russia would suspend negotiations with Ukraine in the event of more terrorist attacks. In the late evening of May 31 and early hours of June 1, the Kiev regime carried out terrorist attacks on railway lines in the Bryansk and Kursk regions. In both cases, overpasses were blown up, causing trains to derail. In the Bryansk region, seven people were killed in the incident involving a passenger train, and 120 victims sought medical assistance. In the Kursk Region, the train driver and two of his assistants were injured. On June 1, Kiev used drones to carry out terrorist attacks against airfields in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan, and Amur regions. Several aircraft caught fire as a result of the attacks, but all fires were extinguished. The Defense Ministry added that there were no casualties among military personnel or civilian personnel. Some suspects involved in the terrorist attacks have been detained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. The Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) reported that the June 1 “Spiderweb” drone operation caused approximately $7 billion in damages and disabled 34% of cruise missile bombers in key Russian airbases. All the steamrollers of history have rolled over it. It has withstood every kind of trial. It is tempered by the highest degree. In today's world, its value is beyond measure,” the SBU wrote, quoting Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko. And if needed, we'll get them from underground too,” the SBU said. This operation targeted aircraft that is used in frequent long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities, and the plan had been in preparation for over a year and a half. According to a Kyiv Independent SBU source, first-person-view (FPV) drones were covertly transported deep into Russian territory and hidden inside trucks before being launched against four major airfields. More than 40 aircraft are known to have been hit, including the A-50, Tu-95, and Tu-22 M3, according to the source. The Tu-95 is a Soviet-era plane that made its first flight in 1952. Each aircraft can carry 16 cruise missiles – either the Kh-55/Kh-555 or the newer Kh-101 and Kh-102 air-launched cruise missiles. Russia has escalated its attacks against Ukraine in recent weeks, amid ongoing U.S.-backed ceasefire talks and negotiations. On May 26, Russian forces launched the most extensive drone attack of the full-scale war, reportedly involving 355 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The number of newborns in Japan is decreasing faster than projected, with the number of annual births falling to another record low last year, according to government data released Wednesday. The data in a country of rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the sustainability of the economy and national security at a time it seeks to increase defense spending. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as “a silent emergency” and has promised to promote more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women. Japan is one of a number of east Asian countries grappling with falling birth rates and an aging population. South Korea and China have fought for years to encourage families to have more children. Also on Wednesday, Vietnam scrapped decades-old laws limiting families to two children in an effort to stem falling birth rates. Related article Japan's population crisis was years in the making – and relief may be decades away The health ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate – the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. Experts say the government's measures have not addressed a growing number of young people reluctant to marry, largely focusing on already married couples. The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to bleak job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that adds extra burdens for women and working mothers, experts say. A growing number of women also cite pressure to take their husband's surname as a reason for their reluctance to marry. Under Japanese law, couples must choose a single surname to marry. Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, with 40% of the population over 65.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The strike reportedly destroyed one Iskander missile launcher and seriously damaged two others. The targeted unit, part of Russia's 26th Missile Brigade, had attempted to fire on Ukrainian territory — likely aiming at Kyiv — before it was hit, according to the military. The agency added that there were no civilian casualties, and assessments of Russian losses are ongoing. The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system used by Russia for precision strikes against military and infrastructure targets. With a range of up to 500 kilometers (some 311 miles) and the ability to carry conventional or nuclear warheads, the system remains a key component of Russia's tactical missile forces. Bryansk Oblast lies just northeast of Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts, making it one of the key Russian regions bordering northern Ukraine. The strike came as part of Ukraine's broader effort to degrade Russia's offensive capabilities. Targeting missile assets there may disrupt Russia's ability to launch precision strikes, particularly in advance of an anticipated new summer offensive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bodies of two Israeli-American hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 were recovered from southern Gaza during a military operation, according to a statement from Israeli military and the Shin Bet security agency. Judy Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Gadi Haggai, 72, were killed near their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz during the Hamas attack on southern Israel in 2023. “Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our deepest condolences to the dear families,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. “We will not rest and we will not be silent until all our hostages – both the living and the fallen – are brought home,” he said. Related vertical video Former Israeli hostage describes seeing torture in Hamas captivity A spokesperson for kibbutz Nir Oz said the bodies of the two hostages had been returned to Israel overnight and would be laid to rest. The couple had four children and seven grandchildren. In a statement the Kibbutz remembered Gadi as “a sharp-minded man, a gifted wind instrument player since the age of three, deeply connected to the land, a chef and advocate of healthy vegan nutrition and sports,” and Judy as “a poet, entrepreneur, creative spirit, and devoted advocate for peace and coexistence.” In this emotional moment, we want to thank the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and security forces who carried out this complex rescue operation and have been fighting for us for over a year and a half, and to everyone who supported, struggled, prayed, and fought for us and for all the people of Israel,” it said. “Still, our hearts will not be whole until all 12 hostages from Nir Oz – and all 56 hostages – are brought home,” the statement added. Twenty are believed to still be alive. In late-March, Israeli forces recovered “findings” related to Manny Goddard, whose body was taken into Gaza after he was killed by members of Islamic Jihad on October 7, according to the IDF and the Shin Bet. Related article ‘It haunts me daily:' Freed Israeli hostages fear for those still held captive by Hamas “Decision-makers must do everything necessary to reach an agreement that will return all 56 remaining hostages – the living for rehabilitation and the deceased for burial,” it added. Bringing back all hostages still in Gaza is among Israel's primary war goals, along with the destruction of Hamas. The release of hostages has been a key point in mediated negotiations aimed toward a ceasefire between Israel and the militant group. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

As Harvard battles Trump's international enrolment ban, hundreds of Canadian students anxiously hold their breath Harvard sued after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on May 22 announced her department was immediately revoking Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows it to enroll foreign students. Her action was almost immediately temporarily blocked by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs. On the eve of a hearing before her last week, the department changed course and said it would instead challenge Harvard's certification through a lengthier administrative process. Opinion: America's talented foreign students could find a home in Canada Wednesday's two-page directive said Harvard had “demonstrated a history of concerning foreign ties and radicalism,” and had “extensive entanglements with foreign adversaries,” including China. The FBI had “long warned that foreign adversaries take advantage of easy access to American higher education to steal information, exploit research and development and spread false information,” the proclamation said. It said Harvard had seen a “drastic rise in crime in recent years while failing to discipline at least some categories of conduct violations on campus,” and had failed to provide sufficient information to the Homeland Security Department about foreign students' “known illegal or dangerous activities.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BUDAPEST, June 5. Russian and Hungary are working on documents on cooperation in trade, science, medicine and other areas ahead of the next meeting of the intergovernmental commission of economic cooperation due to be held in Moscow this fall, Gabor Nagy, head of the Hungarian foreign ministry's department of Russia and Central Asia, told TASS. He recalled that the previous meeting of the commission, which is co-chaired by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko, was held in Budapest in 2024. "The next meeting will be held in Moscow. Working groups are making preparations for it," he said. When asked which areas it is planned to address at the upcoming meeting, he said, "Medicine, trade, science." "Work continues in various areas. Specialists are agreeing various matters, which will be referred to the commission's meeting in the coming fall," he said, adding that the exact date will be agreed upon later. After the previous meeting of the commission in Budapest in September 2024, the sides inked a protocol on cooperation in such areas as energy, agriculture, sport, public health, and culture. Apart from that, Russia's ministry of science signed a cooperation agreement with the Hungarian ministry of culture and innovations, and a memorandum on Stipendium Hungaricum scholarship programs with the Hungarian foreign ministry.</p>
