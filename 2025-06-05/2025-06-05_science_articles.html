                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Deciding to Launch a Nuclear Strike, Humans Are Shockingly Suggestible Surveys show that how nuclear strike options are presented strongly influences the decision a president may make No one has launched a nuclear weapon in war since 1945, when U.S. president Harry S. Truman bombed Japan. Support for that decision—the only use of atomic arms in a conflict—has decreased over time. But new research investigating the attitudes of Americans suggests that, in the right scenario, plenty of people would support another atomic assault. Most U.S. residents have no sway over such a cataclysmic decision. By gaining insight into the minds of the population, these studies illuminate the factors that might affect a leader's choice to conduct a nuclear strike—and ways to make that choice less likely.

The researchers presented study participants with hypothetical scenarios: Would they use a nuclear weapon in a war against Iran to save 20,000 American troops, even if doing so killed either 100,000 or two million Iranians? With smaller casualties, around 56 percent of people would approve an air strike; with larger casualties, around 48 percent would. In both casualty cases, around 59 percent of people would support a president's decision to strike. When split demographically, Republicans, people older than age 60 and those in favor of the death penalty for murder were significantly more likely to give nuclear launch a go. Disturbed by the results, scientist Paul Slovic of the firm Decision Research and his colleagues decided to replicate and extend that paper. In an initial study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in 2020, they posed the same experimental setup: To save 20,000 American troops, would participants support bombing either 100,000 or two million civilians? They interpreted the fact that death-penalty proponents were more likely to support nuclear war as potential evidence of a personality trait: punitiveness, or a desire to penalize those who threatened them in some way. In other words, punitiveness equates to “punishing people who you felt deserved it,” Slovic explains. Slovic and his co-authors wanted to investigate how approval for other punitive domestic policies lined up with nuclear support. Ultimately, they clocked people's views on abortion, guns, immigration and the death penalty. They found a linear correlation: the more someone supported policies to restrict abortion, oppose gun control, deport immigrants and employ the death penalty, the more likely they were to support a nuclear strike. Now, in research by Slovic, Daniel Post—a permanent military professor fellow at the U.S. For instance, they altered the number of American troops who would be saved by a nuclear strike to see how low that human quantity could go and still merit nuclear war in the minds of the respondents. “We found that fairly low numbers would still receive fairly high numbers of support for the nuclear option,” Post says. When the team took American troop numbers out entirely—stating only that a war had been going on for a while and that it had both public opposition and political tensions—some people still supported using a nuclear weapon to end the conflict. Still, as the number of Ajmerican troops spared by a nuclear launch went up, so did support for it. Approval of punitive domestic policies still correlated linearly with nuclear-strike support. And in every condition, Republicans were again more likely to go nuclear. That's relevant to our world because a president's political party may indicate how likely their authorization of a nuclear attack would be. “I think everybody would agree you want the best decision made possible,” Post says, “not the [one that is] most beneficial to your political party, because that's not relevant in the nuclear setting. Surprisingly, in a finding that also arose in Sagan and Valentino's original study, women generally were more likely to approve of nuclear use than men. In comments taken as part of the survey in Slovic and Post's new study, women said they felt more protective of the troops—another factor at play beyond desire for violent punishment. “When the troop loss got higher, even low-punishing women went for the nuclear bomb more than low-punishing men,” Slovic says. In the initial experiment, the choices were to save a given number of American troops by killing either 100,000 or two million Iranians. People who chose not to strike when only given two possibilities often changed their choice, picking the “better bomb” when that was available. “You increase the chances of breaking the nuclear threshold, nuclear use, deterrence failure, etc., just by listing different options,” Post says. And though presidents occupy a position of authority, they still have the same suggestible human brain as those of us without authority who are buying razors and TVs and popcorn because of subtle manipulation. Sharon Weiner, a political scientist at American University, has done related mind-reading nuclear research and has collaborated with Slovic on other projects. She is an advocate for taking these particulars of the human brain into account in nuclear decision-making because humans are never more human than when something hard is happening. Like Slovic and Post, Weiner has been considering how a president's nuclear decisions will be influenced by how their advisers present the options. Let's see: If we give people an option that says, ‘Don't launch,' does it change the ratio of people who launch?” It turns out the answer is yes: in a survey experiment that Weiner presented as part of an event with Slovic and Rose McDermott, who collaborated with Slovic and Post on their new paper, more people choose not to launch when they were directly told that option was available than when they were only given different nuclear death outcomes. I'm not taking any of the three things you presented to me. In a real nuclear crisis, Weiner concludes, whatever nuclear options the president's advisers give at that secret and tense meeting, “there must be an option presented with equal visual and audio support to not launch.” Together this recent research indicates that what insiders call the “nuclear taboo”—the idea that an international norm exists against using nuclear weapons and that this is why they haven't blown up in conflict in 80 years—is not as strong as we think. Apparently, many people require little provocation to approve of a hypothetical strike. Given that, just because humans haven't launched nuclear weapons in 80 years doesn't mean there's a magical stigmatic force preventing them from doing so.

Landauer's principle bridges information theory and thermodynamics by linking the entropy change of a system during a process to the average energy dissipated to its environment. Although typically discussed in the context of erasing a single bit of information, Landauer's principle can be generalized to characterize irreversibility in out-of-equilibrium processes, such as those involving complex quantum many-body systems. Specifically, the relation between the entropy change of a system and the energy dissipated to its environment can be decomposed into changes in quantum mutual information and a difference in the relative entropies of the environment. Here, we experimentally probe Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime using a quantum field simulator of ultracold Bose gases. Employing a dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme, we track the temporal evolution of the quantum field following a global mass quench from a massive to a massless Klein–Gordon model and analyse the thermodynamic and information-theoretic contributions to a generalized entropy production for various system–environment partitions of the composite system. Our results verify the quantum field theoretical calculations, interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our work demonstrates the ability of ultracold atom-based quantum field simulators to experimentally investigate quantum thermodynamics. Information theory and thermodynamics constitute foundational pillars of modern technology and underpin our understanding of computers and heat engines, respectively. Although these disciplines may seem distinct, they are intricately connected. Landauer understood that erasing a bit of information in a computer is not for free but is, instead, accompanied by a minimal energy cost dissipated to the environment. Subsequently, various experimental studies2,3,4 have confirmed this lower bound on energy dissipation for near-reversible bit erasure. Logical operations thus imply irreversibility, which poses a fundamental theoretical limitation on the design of any small-scale energy-efficient information-processing technologies5. However, by extending beyond the case of bit erasure, recent influential work6 has generalized the link between information theory and thermodynamics. Using a quantum statistical mechanics framework, that work reinterprets Landauer's principle as a means of relating the entropy change of a system to the energy dissipated to its environment in general out-of-equilibrium processes, not just erasure. This relation can be quantified by a measure of process irreversibility7. Such a broader formulation of Landauer's principle not only deepens its physical importance but also makes this extension particularly relevant for quantum many-body systems, where contributions to irreversibility remain an area of active research, notably for phenomena such as equilibration and thermalization8,9,10,11. In this work, we employ Landauer's principle to experimentally characterize the irreversibility of an out-of-equilibrium process in the quantum many-body regime by tracking the time evolution of quantum information-theoretic measures. We present a crisp information-inspired interpretation of the correlations present in states of quantum many-body systems in terms of entropic expressions. Concretely, we consider a system–environment composite initially in the state ϱSE(0) and evolving under a global unitary time evolution U to the state ϱSE(t) = UϱSE(0)U†. The reduced state of the system S (environment E) is ϱS(E)(t) = TrE(S)[ϱSE(t)], where TrE(S) is the partial trace over the environment (system). In this case, the entropy production Σ(t), which is a measure of irreversibility6,7,12, can be decomposed as Here, the quantum relative entropy quantifies the deviation of the environment from its initial thermal state. denotes the von Neumann entropy of a state ϱ. Now we move on to a more general scenario in which the system and the environment are initially correlated, and the state of the environment deviates from thermal equilibrium. We thereby introduce the generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0), where the initial correlations and deviations from thermal equilibrium are accounted for by a resource cost \(\varSigma (0)={I}_{{{\rm{SE}}}}(0)+D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0) \|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\) (ref. 13), with βE being the effective inverse temperature14,15. Landauer's principle can then be expressed13 as an equality: which relates the entropy change of the system ΔS ≔ S(ϱS(t)) − S(ϱS(0)) to the energy dissipated to the environment ΔEE: = Tr[(ϱE(t) − ϱE(0))HE]. In this general formulation, depending on the initial state, ΔΣ is not necessarily non-negative16,17. Alternatively, ΔΣ also decomposes into the change of quantum mutual information ΔI = ISE(t) − ISE(0), which expresses how much the system–environment correlations change along the out-of-equilibrium process, as well as the term \(\Delta D=D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(t)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})-D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\), which quantifies how much both the initial state and the final state of the environment are different from the reference equilibrium thermal state. We provide a more thorough motivation for the generalized entropy production ΔΣ in Methods. Expressed in this form, Landauer's principle serves as a means of tracking changes in information-theoretic quantities, which compose generalized entropy production ΔΣ in two different ways with a single equation. Herein lies the power at the heart of thermodynamics: just as knowing the precise microscopic degrees of freedom, such as the position and momentum of each particle in a classical gas, is not useful for drawing meaningful conclusions about its dynamics, knowing the density matrix of a quantum many-body system is, similarly, not descriptive. In traditional thermodynamics, the relevant quantities that effectively characterize the dynamics are macroscopic variables like changes in pressure or volume. Similarly, for the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system, analysing the information-theoretic quantities in Landauer's principle allows a simple characterization of its irreversibility. So far, no systematic experimental pursuit has probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime. Here, we address this gap by measuring the time evolution of the different terms in equation (5) in a (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum field simulator of tunnelling-coupled ultracold Bose gases. This experimental platform has proven to be a suitable test bed for simulating one-dimensional quantum field theories. Previous studies using this set-up have examined the area law of quantum mutual information in thermal equilibrium18 and the propagation of second-19 or higher-order correlations20. In this experiment, two parallel ultracold clouds of 87Rb atoms (Fig. 1a) were confined in highly anisotropic magnetic traps produced by an atom chip21. The clouds were confined in the axial direction (z) by a parabolic trap superimposed with an optical dipole potential to produce hard walls. In the radial directions (x, y), they were confined by a double-well trap with an adjustable barrier between, created by radio-frequency dressing22. The single-particle tunnelling rate can be modified by the amplitude of a radio-frequency field created by two parallel wires on the atom chip. a, The experimental system consists of two tunnelling-coupled ultracold 87Rb gases, with a single-particle tunnelling rate J, initially prepared in an initial state described by a global thermal state of the massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. By ramping up a barrier between the condensates, a global mass quench is performed, and the condensates evolve independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for t ≥ 0. b, The atomic clouds are released, and they interfere as they expand. For each experimental realization, we obtained the integrated two-dimensional atomic density with absorption imaging, from which the relative phase profiles were obtained. An example of a fitted phase profile is given for a slice z=z0. c, Using the measured phase–phase correlations, we dynamically reconstructed the covariance matrix for both quadratures. By successively shifting the observation window, we fitted the covariance matrix Γ(t) for different times t. The covariance matrices for the system S and environment E were defined accordingly and used to calculate information-theoretic quantities. The bosonic quantum field operator for each condensate can be written using the phase–density representation as \({\psi }_{n}(z)=\sqrt{{\rho }_{n}(z)}\operatorname{e}^{\mathrm{i}{\theta }_{n}(z)}\), where θn and ρn denote the phase and density of the respective condensate indexed by n = 1 or 2. These relative degrees of freedom satisfy a similar commutation relation as the original phase and density operators of each condensate, given by [ϕ(z), δρ(z')] = iδ(z − z'). For strong tunnelling-coupling between the two clouds, the relative degrees of freedom are described by a massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian: which models low-energy phononic excitations and is an approximation to an interacting sine-Gordon Hamiltonian23 (see equation (11) and below for further details). In equation (6), ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, m is the atomic mass, g1D is the effective one-dimensional atomic interaction strength, L = 49 μm is the axial length of the condensates, n1D ≈ 70 μm−1 is the average linear density and J ≈ 2π × 0.8 Hz is the tunnelling rate introduced before. Note that a mass term appears only due to the tunnelling-coupling between the pair of condensates. A single condensate can simulate only a massless Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid model24,25 (HKG with J = 0). In our experiments, we prepared the Bose–Einstein condensates in a global thermal state HKG with finite tunnelling-coupling (J > 0). Because we wanted to measure the out-of-equilibrium evolution of information-theoretic quantities, we drove the system out of equilibrium by rapidly quenching J to zero (Fig. We did so by ramping up the barrier between the condensates within approximately 2 ms. This change corresponds to a global mass quench of the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian. The condensates then evolved independently under the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian for times t up to 65 ms. At each time step t, we turned off all the traps and let the atoms fall freely for 15.6 ms. The clouds then expanded and interfered, resulting in absorption pictures like the one shown in Fig. 1b, which allowed us to measure the spatially resolved relative phase φ(z) between them. Because the detection process is destructive, the measurements were repeated to gather statistics. In our current experimental set-up, the relative density fluctuations δρ were not directly measurable, which prompted the development of a dynamical tomographic reconstruction technique18,26 to access all the elements of the covariance matrix: Here, the elements are defined as [Γϕϕ(t)]m,n = 〈ϕ(zm, t)ϕ(zn, t)〉, [Γρρ(t)]m,n = 〈δρ(zm,t)δρ(zn, t)〉 and [Γϕρ(t)]m,n = [Γρϕ(t)]m,nT = 〈(1/2){ϕ(zm, t), δρ(zn, t)}〉, all on a discrete grid with N pixels (m, n ∈ {1, …, N}), which were determined by the resolution constraints of our imaging system, which, thus, introduced an ultraviolet cutoff. The phase–phase correlations for different evolution times after the quench were measured directly from the extracted relative phase profiles. This transformation allowed us to extract information about these eigenmodes by fitting the initial second-order correlation functions for phase–density and density–density with the observed evolution of the phase–phase correlations in momentum space. 1c illustrate our dynamical tomographic reconstruction scheme. We followed the technique in ref. 18 for various input intervals with varying starting points. By scanning the starting points of these input intervals throughout the trapping times, we reconstructed the full covariance matrix at every time t, as depicted in Fig. The interval length (32.5 ms, which is close to L/c ≈ 27 ms, where c is the speed of sound) was selected as it was sufficiently long for the slowest eigenmode to acquire enough dynamical phase for a stable reconstruction, yet short enough to prevent mode interactions from affecting the reconstruction. A detailed overview of this reconstruction process is provided in Methods. The quadratic form of the pre- and post-quench Hamiltonians allowed us to work within the framework of Gaussian quantum information theory27,28. Even if the true dynamics deviates from the Gaussian regime and violates the massless Klein–Gordon theory, a Gaussian extremality argument presented in Supplementary Information Section 4 justifies the Gaussian tomography scheme and provides bounds on the information-theoretic quantities. Thus, based on our dynamical tomographic reconstruction of the covariance matrices, Landauer's principle can also be meaningfully experimentally investigated for interacting models. Having experimentally reconstructed the post-quench time evolution of the covariance matrices, we partitioned the one-dimensional field of length L into two distinct subregions and split the covariance matrix accordingly (Fig. Because the quantum field was isolated from its surroundings, one subregion served as the system S with length LS, while the other subregion functioned as the environment E with length LE = L − LS. We probed Landauer's principle (equation (5)) for various system–environment bipartitions by characterizing the generalized entropy production ΔΣ. To do so, we computed the individual contributions βEΔEE, ΔS, ΔI and ΔD. The results are presented in Fig. 2 as a function of time for different subregion size ratios and in Fig. 3 as a function of subregion size for different times. The timescales are shown in units of ct/L, where \(c=\sqrt{{g}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}{n}_{{{\rm{1D}}}}/m}\approx 1.8\,\upmu\mbox{m}\,\mbox{ms}^{-1}\) is the speed of sound. Overall, a very good fit of the data (circles) was obtained compared to the theoretical calculations (shaded areas), which used the lowest N = 7 modes, considering the imaging resolution of the experiment. The effective inverse temperature of the environment βE with respect to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian was computed using quantum field-theoretic simulations by constructing a global thermal state of the pre-quench massive Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with the initial global temperature estimated from the experimental data. a,b, Quantities of Landauer's principle are shown as a function of time for subregion size ratios LS/L = 0.14 (a) and LS/L = 0.43 (b). For each quantity, the experimental averages are represented by circles with error bars marking the 68% confidence intervals (equivalent to the standard error of the mean) obtained from bootstrapping with 999 samples. The experimental data agree with the quantum field theory simulation results using Neumann boundary conditions and considering the finite imaging resolution. a–d, Quantities involved in Landauer's principle: βEΔEE, (a), ΔS (b), ΔI (c) and ΔD (d), shown as a function of subregion size for various times ct/L = 0.19, 0.38 and 0.57, as indicated in the legend on top by different colours. The circles represent experimental averages. 2 for details of the error bars and shaded areas. The experimental data agree with the quantum field theory simulation results using Neumann boundary conditions. First, we examine the decomposition of the generalized entropy production ΔΣ into βEΔEE and ΔS. The term associated with the energy dissipated to the environment, βEΔEE, revealed that a small amount of energy flowed into (or out of) the environment for small (or large) systems around ct/LS = 1. However, this term contributed only minimally to the irreversible post-quench dynamics of the quantum field. By contrast, the entropy change of the system, ΔS, dominated the dynamics and showed a clear linear increase up to ct/LS = 1, followed by more pronounced growth. 2, we present only ΔΣ defined by this first decomposition. However, we also found good agreement with the second decomposition (Supplementary Fig. 2), thus providing evidence that the assumptions underlying Landauer's principle were well satisfied in our experiment. In comparison to the first, the second decomposition involving ΔI and ΔD shed a slightly different focus on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. The largest contribution to ΔΣ, the change in quantum mutual information, ΔI, exhibited similar behaviour to ΔS but with a higher magnitude. This increased magnitude was accounted for by the additional entropy change in the environment. This made ΔD a particularly interesting quantity for characterizing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the environment experimentally. In our case, ΔD decreased, otherwise mirroring the behaviour of ΔS, due to the small energetic contribution. To interpret the results, we needed to consider the effects of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quantum field, as shown for the quantum field-theoretic simulations in Fig. These boundary conditions can be contrasted with the curved backgrounds that gave rise to the effective boundary conditions discussed in refs. The experimental system exhibited Neumann boundary conditions (∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0) due to the vanishing particle current at the edges. Plots contrasting the scaling with subregion size are shown in Supplementary Fig. a,b, Time evolution of the quantities involved in Landauer's principle shown for Neumann boundary conditions (as relevant in the experiment) (a) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (b), using quantum field-theoretic simulations. We interpreted the post-quench dynamics of the global mass quench using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture, as discussed in the text. c,d, Energy density for Neumann boundary conditions (c) and Dirichlet boundary conditions (d). e, The linear increase in correlations for ct/LS < 1, followed by a plateau, and a linear decrease for ct/LE > 1, can be explained by the linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The effect of the zero mode, present for Neumann boundary conditions, was not captured by the quasiparticle picture for ct/LS > 1. However, we first consider simulations with Dirichlet boundary conditions (φ(z)∣z=0,L = 0), which are simpler to understand. Here, the well-established semi-classical quasiparticle picture35 offers a clear and intuitive model for the post-quench dynamics of global mass quenches36,37. The propagation of short-range initial correlations is depicted as occurring through ballistically moving quasiparticles. Following the homogeneous global quench, the initial massive Klein–Gordon thermal state becomes a non-equilibrium state with excess energy relative to the post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian, which governs the time evolution. This initial state acts as a source of quasiparticle pairs emitted globally from every point across the length of the composite system. Each pair in the bulk consists of two quasiparticles correlated with each other and moving in opposite directions at the same speed. For our set of parameters, due to the finite initial correlation length, there exists a small, localized region where quasiparticles are correlated. In this quasiparticle picture, the change of quantum mutual information ΔI between the system and environment is proportional to the number of pairs of quasiparticles that are shared between the two different subregions. The spread of correlations of short-range interacting models is described by a linear effective light cone originating at the system–environment boundary. The behaviour of ΔI transitions to a plateau value. From a system perspective, the composite system appears to have locally equilibrated to a generalized Gibbs ensemble steady state30,38,39. On the other hand, ΔI behaves differently for Neumann boundary conditions. Neumann boundary conditions introduce a zero mode, whose variance does not evolve harmonically like the other momentum modes but quadratically (phase diffusion41,42). The global fluctuations of the zero mode contribute to entropic quantities43, and as they increase with time after a quench, they eventually dominate the contribution of other modes. Because the quasiparticle picture cannot capture this zero-mode feature, its predictions for ct/LS > 1, when a plateau value should be reached, need to be modified under the present Neumann boundary conditions. The energetic contribution βEΔEE can also be explained using the quasiparticle picture. Initially, βEΔEE remains constant because quasiparticles travelling between the system and the environment carry the same amount of energy, resulting in zero net energy flux. However, a finite-size energy flow becomes apparent when quasiparticles from the edge of the system cross the system–environment boundary. This edge region has a size of the order of the initial correlation length. In this study, we experimentally probed Landauer's principle in the quantum many-body regime following a global mass quench in an ultracold atom-based quantum field simulator. By reconstructing the dynamics of the state of the composite system, we examined the information-theoretic quantities related by Landauer's principle, which we interpreted using a semi-classical quasiparticle picture. Our approach underscores the general utility of Landauer's principle for characterizing the irreversibility of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems. The way we expressed correlations in terms of entropic quantities with an information-theoretic meaning can be viewed as a vehicle to capture many-body correlations not in equilibrium. The Gaussian extremality argument may offer a pathway to extend our methodology to capture features of out-of-equilibrium processes in interacting models, despite the challenges posed by non-Gaussian effects. A recent alternative approach to studying interacting systems calculates classical entropies of marginal distributions instead of quantum entropies44,45, thereby avoiding the need for tomography. Looking forward, progress has already been made towards investigating a local quench involving two Bose–Einstein condensates at different temperatures being joined together46. This protocol represents a crucial primitive towards developing a quantum field thermal machine47, potentially allowing for Landauer erasure as a mechanism to reduce the entropy of a subregion in the quantum many-body regime, hence functioning as an effective cooling mechanism. Our current work demonstrates the potential of ultracold one-dimensional gases as test beds for quantum thermodynamics in the many-body regime, where complexity, quantum effects and finite size play a crucial role. Consider a system S and an environment E with a bipartite Hilbert space \({{\mathcal{H}}}={{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{S}}}}\otimes {{{\mathcal{H}}}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\). Because it is expressed as a quantum relative entropy, Σ is non-negative due to Klein's inequality48, which is a manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics. More generally, as in our work, we start with a resourceful initial state that includes both initial correlations ISE(0) and athermality of the environment \(D({\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}(0)\|{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}})\). Although defining temperature for a non-equilibrium state is ambiguous, we determined the effective inverse temperature of the environment βE by demanding that the energy of the environment is equal to that of a Gibbs state, such that \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\equiv {{\rm{Tr}}}[{\gamma }_{{{\rm{E}}}}^{\;{\beta }_{{{\rm{E}}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\) (ref. This choice also minimized the athermality term. Although there is no unique consensus on entropy production for initial non-equilibrium environment states50 and initial correlations51,52, we define Landauer's principle (equation (5)) in terms of generalized entropy production ΔΣ ≔ Σ(t) − Σ(0) as This can be derived as in ref. One caveat is that ΔΣ may not necessarily be non-negative, which is a necessary criterion for a strictly valid definition of entropy production. However, this makes sense, as ΔΣ may be considered to be a finite-difference version of the entropy production rate \(\Delta \varSigma =\varSigma (t)-\varSigma (0)=\int_{0}^{t}\,\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }\,({\mathrm{d}\varSigma ({t}^{{\prime} })}/{\mathrm{d}{t}^{{\prime} }})\), which also can be negative16,17. The experimental set-up consisted of a pair of tunnelling-coupled one-dimensional 87Rb quasicondensates, following a protocol implemented previously18. The magnetic fields required to trap the gas in a double-well potential were generated by an atom chip21, which achieved transverse trapping frequencies of ω⊥/2π = 1.4 kHz. After preparing a thermal equilibrium state at a temperature of 49 nK, all traps were turned off. Absorption imaging of the atoms was performed during a free-fall time of 15.6 ms and was used to measure the two-dimensional atomic density distributions. Owing to the destructive nature of the detection process, many repetitions of the experiment were necessary to accumulate numerous phase correlation images throughout the time evolution, thereby also ensuring statistically accurate expectation values. As discussed in previous works18,23, two tunnelling-coupled quasicondensates can be used as a quantum field simulator of the one-dimensional sine-Gordon model. The relative degrees of freedom of two conjugate variables, the relative phase (φ) and relative density fluctuations (δρ), in the regime of low-energy collective excitations can be described by the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian: In our experiment, the length of the composite system was set to L = 49 μm, and the mean density n1D = 70 μm−1. The coupling strength between the particles was chosen as g1D = 8.594 × 10−39 kg m3 s−2, and we had an atomic mass m = 1.433 × 10−25 kg. The initial single-particle tunnelling rate was J = 2π × 0.76 Hz. Under these parameters, the experimental system was sufficiently cold and strongly coupled, ensuring that the phase coherence length, Hence, the cosine term in equation (11) can be expanded to second order, thus reducing the sine-Gordon Hamiltonian to the Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian: The post-quench evolution is then described by the massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian with J = 0. The tomography scheme for reconstructing the initial thermal covariance matrix is detailed in refs. Here, we extend this method to dynamically reconstruct the state over time. We provide a brief overview below. Given Neumann boundary conditions, ∂zφ(z)∣z=0,L = 0, then in a box-like potential with length L and average linear atomic density n1D, the relative phase φ(z) and relative density fluctuations δρ(z) can be expanded in Fourier space in terms of the eigenfunctions, fkφ and fkρ, for each mode k: The post-quench massless Klein–Gordon Hamiltonian (equation (14)) is diagonalized as (indices omitted for brevity from now on) The interaction strength g1D is given by where as = 5.2 nm is the three-dimensional scattering length. Consequently, the time evolution of modes (k > 0) in Fourier space is with a non-harmonic time evolution of the zero mode: 1, the covariance matrices can be dynamically tomographically reconstructed by measuring the relative phase profiles using matter interferometry at various times. We then expanded this in Fourier space (equation (15)) and expanded the time-evolved operators to express the measured phase correlation function in terms of the covariance matrix elements before the time evolution: Inserting the time evolution equations, we see that the covariance matrix Γ(t) can be obtained by fitting the elements Γφφ;k,l(t), Γρρ;k,l(t) and Γφρ;k,l(t) using the phase-space correlations: By gathering statistics, we employed the same method as in ref. 18 and simply shifted the window of observation. We obtained the covariance matrix in momentum space for the first N modes that give physical (positive) occupation numbers. The imaging system was accounted for by a Gaussian point spread function with a standard deviation of 3 μm to estimate the initial state. In this way, we also confirmed the global initial thermal state and extracted a pre-quench temperature. We used discrete cosine eigenfunctions to convert the momentum space correlators to real-space correlators, from which we computed the quantities of interest. In this section, we delineate how the quantities in Landauer's principle, as expressed in equation (5), were computed using the full covariance matrix Γ in real space defined on a grid of N pixels. First, the von Neumann entropy S(Γ) was computed using the symplectic eigenvalues λn of the covariance matrix Γ (ref. The von Neumann entropy S(Γ) of a Gaussian state is given by Given two full covariance matrices corresponding to different times, we partitioned them into system and environment subspace covariance matrices (Fig. Next, we illustrate how we calculated the energy of the environment with respect to the post-quench Hamiltonian. To obtain the correct environment Hamiltonian, we needed to proceed with care. The field corresponding to the environment was discretely defined with NE = N(LE/L) pixels. Instead, we started from the environment Hamiltonian of the continuous theory, diagonalized it to obtain a momentum decomposition of infinitely many modes and then truncated the Hamiltonian53 of the environment to a form with a linear dispersion relation while retaining only NE modes: Converting back to real-space operators, we derived an effective resolution scale-dependent Hamiltonian: Here, Δz ≔ L/N is the pixel size and NS(E) is the number of pixels for the system (environment). The energy of the environment can then be calculated27 as \({{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varrho }_{{{\rm{E}}}}{H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]={{\rm{Tr}}}[{\varGamma }^{{{\rm{E}}}}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}]\), where \({\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}\) is a matrix expression given by \({H}_{{{\rm{E}}}}={X}^\mathrm{T}{\tilde{H}}_{{{\rm{E}}}}X\), with \(X={(\varphi ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\varphi ({z}_{N-1}),\updelta \rho ({z}_{{N}_{S}}),\ldots ,\updelta \rho ({z}_{N-1}))}^\mathrm{T}\). Thus, to calculate the energetic contribution βEΔEE, we needed to obtain the inverse temperature of the environment. Subsequently, we constructed the thermal state corresponding to this temperature in the continuum limit simulation. We obtained the inverse temperature of the environment βE for different subregion sizes by demanding that the energy of the environment matches that of a Gibbs state. We then interpolated the profile for each pixel. Note that the post-quench temperature is slightly higher than the temperature measured with respect to the pre-quench Hamiltonian and that βE > 0 is nearly homogeneous across different subregion sizes. Given our experimental parameters, we approximated it as The harmonic-oscillator partition function is which approximates to 1/(2βE) for our experimental parameters. Consequently, we expressed the quantum relative entropy of the environment state ϱE with respect to a Gibbs state at inverse temperature βE as and we obtained ΔD accordingly. 2–4 are available via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15205139 (ref.

Brain connectivity can be estimated in many ways, depending on modality and processing strategy. Here, we present the Krakencoder, a joint connectome mapping tool that simultaneously bidirectionally translates between structural and functional connectivity, and between different atlases and processing choices via a common latent representation. These mappings demonstrate exceptional accuracy and individual-level identifiability; the mapping between structural and functional connectivity has identifiability 42–54% higher than existing models. The Krakencoder combines all connectome flavors via a shared low-dimensional latent space. This fusion representation better reflects familial relatedness, preserves age- and sex-relevant information, and enhances cognition-relevant information. The Krakencoder can be applied, without retraining, to new out-of-distribution data while still preserving inter-individual differences in the connectome predictions and familial relationships in the latent representations. The Krakencoder is a notable leap forward in capturing the relationship between multimodal brain connectomes in an individualized, behaviorally and demographically relevant way. The brain is a vastly complex, interconnected network of neurons (and other types of cells), the healthy function of which enables us to move, think, feel, and observe, as well as interact with our environment. Studying how the brain's connections relate to behavior, so-called brain connectome–behavior mapping, is crucial not only for understanding how the brain works generally but also for identifying biomarkers of disease, predicting outcomes in neurological disorders, and designing personalized interventions. Brain connectivity can be probed through various structural and functional neuroimaging techniques. Structural connectivity (SC) can be captured with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measures of white matter, or the anatomical wiring, that connects different brain regions. Functional connectivity (FC), as measured with blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI), quantifies the temporal similarity between brain regions' dynamic neural activity patterns, irrespective of their structural connection. The association between SC and FC is a subject of intense research, given that it is believed that structural pathways provide the backbone over which functional activation flows. Despite this, correlations of SC and FC are moderate at best. Understanding the relationship between SC and FC is key to deciphering how the brain's physical structure supports its dynamic functions and may offer insights into the neural mechanisms underlying behavior, injury or disease, and recovery1,2,3,4. There are many approaches to modeling the relationship between SC and FC, most of which focus on using SC to predict FC. These methods include biophysical models (for example, linked neural mass models5,6,7,8,9,10), graph theoretical models (for example, communication strategies11,12,13,14,15), statistical models (that is, models of SC and FC topological metrics16,17,18,19) and network control theory20,21,22,23. More recently, machine learning has been used to predict FC from SC24,25,26,27, predict SC from FC28, or to translate a connectivity estimate between parcellations29,30. Many of these studies have shown that metrics of SC–FC relationships vary with age, sex and behavioral variables16,27,31, or disease and/or injury and recovery4,32,33. Among the challenges and considerations in modeling this relationship, the assumption that estimated SC is an objective, fixed constraint on possible FC patterns is increasingly questioned. Evidence suggests that the brain's functional dynamics can be highly flexible and adaptive, and may be driven by geometric factors not measured with SC34. Variability in SC estimation techniques, particularly in their sensitivity to detect faint or indirect connections, further complicates the interpretation of connectivity data. Moreover, the performance metrics and loss functions currently used in connectivity studies often fail to adequately account for inter-subject variability, potentially skewing the results and interpretations. Each connectome flavor may differ in how the brain is parcellated into regions, how potential noise, artifacts, or confounds are removed, and how the connectivity between regions is quantified, among other methodological choices. Furthermore, connectome data from different studies are often shared only in certain flavors, making comparisons between datasets challenging. In this work, our fundamental assumption is that each set of choices in the imaging and processing pipelines provides a different view of the same underlying system. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in multi-view learning40, we develop and share a tool called ‘Krakencoder' that provides a way to combine these choices (that is, connectome fusion), and thus create a more comprehensive representation of the brain's connectivity. Deriving a unified latent representation from within-modality and/or across modality connectome estimates may enable reconciliation of differing views of the same underlying network to overcome limitations and combine benefits from various processing choices. Krakencoder is a ‘universal' brain connectivity encoding architecture capable of transforming connectivity estimates between parcellations, estimation techniques and modalities with high precision. Importantly, the Krakencoder is able to preserve inter-individual differences in a way that is behaviorally and demographically relevant. This element is crucial if we are to use the Krakencoder to improve our understanding of how brain structure and function and their interplay maps to behavior, impairment, or recovery after disease or injury. The Krakencoder architecture consists of a set of encoders and decoders that enable transformation of each connectivity type into every other connectivity type via a common low-dimensional latent representation (Fig. The Krakencoder was trained to optimize for both reconstruction accuracy and preservation of individual differences. The latter was achieved by enforcing latent-space representations of different connectivity types from the same subject to be close to one another and far from other subjects' latent space connectome representations. The model was trained on resting-state FC and white-matter SC data from 683 healthy young adults (366 female, aged 28.6 ± 3.8 years) from the Human Connectome Project, validated during training on 79 held-out subjects (43 female, aged 29.1 ± 3.8 years), and finally tested on 196 subjects (107 female, aged 29.1 ± 3.6 years). Care was taken to ensure that no siblings spanned the divisions, because this data leakage can lead to over-optimistic model performance. Connectivity flavors consist of three parcellations (with 86, 268 and 439 regions), three common FC estimates (Pearson correlation, Pearson correlation following global signal regression, and regularized partial correlation), and two SC estimates (volume-normalized streamline counts from deterministic and probabilistic tractography), for a total of 15. This path begins by stacking the upper triangular portion of each subject's connectivity matrix into input \({X}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{{\rm{edges}}}\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\). A precomputed, fixed PCA transformation normalizes the data and reduces dimensionality to \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{256\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\), equalizing the size of disparate input flavors. A single fully connected layer Encoderi, followed by L2 normalization, transforms \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) into a latent hypersphere surface \({z}_{i}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{128\times {n}_{{\rm{subj}}}}\). Batch-wise encoding loss Lz(zi) controls inter-subject separation in latent space. A single fully connected layer Decoderi transforms zi to \({\hat{X}}_{i}^{{\prime} }\), and batch-wise reconstruction loss \({L}_{r}({X}_{i}^{{\prime} },{\hat{X}}_{i}^{{\prime} })\) and Lz(zi) are backpropagated to optimize Encoderi and Decoderi. This path converting input flavor i to output flavor j begins the same as pathii, transforming \({X}_{i}\to {X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\to {z}_{i}\), then Decoderj transforms \({z}_{i}\to {\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\), and reconstruction loss \({L}_{r}({X}_{j}^{{\prime} },{\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} })\) is backpropagated to optimize Encoderi and Decoderj. The latent similarity loss Lz.sim(zi, zj, zk, …) provides explicit control to ensure that the latent representations of each subject are consistent across connectivity flavors. See Extended Data Table 1 for details about the loss terms. d, Multimodality fusion predictions from averaged latent space vectors. For these predictions we average the encoded latent vector from all input flavors (as in the fusion model), or a subset of input flavors (as in the fusionSC model, which averages latent vectors from only the SC inputs), and then decode this average vector to all output flavors. The fusion-parc model demonstrates cross-parcellation prediction, by averaging inputs from only the other parcellations. We create a separate encoder and decoder for each of the 15 connectivity flavors and then train the model to predict each flavor from each other flavor. There are 225 total training paths, including 15 autoencoders that map between the same flavor (Fig. 1a) and 210 transcoders that predict one flavor from another (Fig. Each encoder is a single fully connected linear layer, followed by L2 normalization that constrains the latent representation to the surface of a 128-dimensional hypersphere. Each decoder is a single fully connected linear layer. Dimensionality of the connectivity flavors varies between parcellations, which could lead to an imbalance in the training to favor higher dimension connectivity flavors. We balanced the contributions of each flavor by reducing each connectivity input to 256 dimensions using a precomputed principal component analysis (PCA), derived using only training data to avoid leakage between train and test sets. Reconstruction loss for each training path includes both Pearson correlation and Euclidean distance (Extended Data Table 1). We include a contrastive component to the correlation and Euclidean loss functions, to explicitly preserve inter-subject variability of predicted connectomes. A contrastive loss term is applied to the latent representation as well, to further promote inter-subject variability of the representations. The term ‘contrastive' here refers to a penalty that attempts to force the same subject's reconstructed and latent space connectomes close to each other and far apart from other individuals' representations. Finally, we include an intra-subject latent space consistency loss to maximize the similarity of the latent representations from each connectome flavor for a given subject (Fig. This combination of loss functions enabled us to fine-tune the trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and inter-subject variability (Extended Data Fig. 1b), and to condition the latent space representation. The model can also combine information from multiple connectomes by averaging their latent space representations to obtain a ‘fusion' representation; this fusion representation can then be decoded to predict all 15 connectome flavors. The encoding and averaging step in the fusion process can include all available connectome flavors, or a subset of flavors to, for example, predict FC flavors from the fusion latent representation of all SC flavors or vice versa (‘fusionSC' or ‘fusionFC', Fig. 1d), or to predict one parcellation using inputs from the averaged latent representations of all other parcellations (‘fusion-parc', Fig. The fusion-parc version is particularly informative if one is using the Krakencoder to translate connectome data to a desired atlas on which it had not been computed. Given the high degree of similarity of measured connectomes to each other and to the population mean, we assess our connectome predictions using complementary measures of prediction identifiability (top-1 accuracy and average rank percentile, or avgrank, equation (4)) and de-meaned correlation (Pearson correlation after subtracting the population mean, or avgcorrdemean, equation (2)). The average rank percentile for FCs predicted from FCs of different parcellations or connectivity estimations (FC → FC) shows near-perfect identifiability (Fig. Inter-modality predictions performed worse than within-modality, but still far exceeding chance (random chance for avgrank is 0.5), with an overall average rank identifiability of 0.82 for SC → FC (lower left block) and 0.85 for FC → SC (upper right block). In general, we find that better avgrank prediction identifiability coincides with connectome sparsity, with higher dimensional parcellations (for example, the Coco439 atlas) and more sparse FC estimates (FCpcorr) being more easily identifiable. 2c) shows an average of 0.38 for FC → FC, and an average of 0.35 for SC → SC. Inter-modality predictions are again more difficult, with an overall avgcorrdemean of 0.16 for FC → SC of 0.16 and 0.09 for SC → FC. Lower dimensional parcellations generally had higher avgcorrdemean. Higher dimensional atlases are likely to be better at capturing inter-individual variability in the functional boundaries within an atlas and thus have higher identifiability, while lower dimensional atlases are likely to benefit from higher signal-to-noise ratio in the measured regional SC and FC and thus have smaller reconstruction error when mapping between flavors. Heatmaps in a–c show connectome prediction performance from each source flavor (row) to each target flavor (column). Flavors consist of three parcellations (the 86-region FreeSurfer atlas (FS86), the 268-region Shen atlas (sh268) and the 439-region CocoHCP439 atlas (coco439 or co439)), three FC estimates (Pearson (FC), global signal regressed Pearson (FCgsr) and regularized partial correlation (FCpc)), and two SC estimates (deterministic tractography (SCdt) and probabilistic tractography (SCpr)). The Fusion row shows predictions from the average latent vector from all 15 connectome flavors (Fig. FusionFC and FusionSC are predicted from the average of nine FC or six SC latent vectors, respectively. Fusion-parc predicts each parcellation from the average of all parcellations except itself. This measures the fraction of test subjects whose predicted connectome is closer to their own measured connectome than to any other subject's measured connectome. Chance level is 1/196 = 0.005. b, Average rank percentile. This measures the fraction of other subjects' measured connectomes that are further from the target subject's predicted connectome than the target subject's own measured connectome. This rank percentile is then averaged across subjects. The chance level is 0.5. c, Average corr(\(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ, \(\hat{\rm{X}}\)subj − μ). This is the average correlation of each subject's measured and predicted connectomes, after subtracting the population mean (avgcorrdemean). d, Baseline using related subjects as prediction. For each subject sa, we select an age- and sex-matched individual sb of a given relatedness (unrelated, sibling, dizygotic (DZ) or monozygotic (MZ) twin, or self-retest) and consider the measured connectome from sb as the prediction for sa. For each relatedness level, we compare the set of pseudo-predictions to measured connectomes using each performance metric, as though they were predictions from our model. Thus, we can observe the reliability and utility of each flavor and performance metric, and provide multiple baselines for evaluating model performance. We also show performance using the population mean for each flavor (‘pop. mean') as pseudo-prediction, which for the avgcorr metric (bottom) exceeds self-retest, but for all other metrics is zero or chance. Predictions of regularized partial correlation FC (FCpcorr) had the highest avgrank, but the lowest avgcorrdemean among FC flavors, which reflects the noise inherent in this estimate, even with regularization, but also an increased sparsity that drives identifiability. SC predicted from FCpcorr yielded consistently better performance than other FC inputs, likely to be due to the increased sparsity and removal of nonspecific correlations. The best single FC input for predicting all SC flavors was the Shen268 FCpcorr, which predicts Coco439 SCpr (probabilistic SC) with an avgrank of 0.99 and avgcorrdemean of 0.19. In assessing the spatial variability of prediction accuracy, we find that regions with higher measurement reliability (for example, default mode) also have higher prediction accuracy (Extended Data Figs. Furthermore, high-level association cortex has higher prediction accuracy than low-level sensorimotor cortex (Extended Data Fig. Conversely, as shown in previous work, regional structure–function coupling is lower for higher level cortex16,19 (Extended Data Fig. This latter relationship primarily reflects the relationship between population-average SC and FC rather than predicting inter-individual variability. 5 shows the Spearman correlation between the measured connectomes' network properties (mean node strength, mean betweenness centrality, characteristic path length and modularity) and the Krakencoder's predicted connectomes' network properties, across 196 held-out individuals in the test set. The three fusion representations are used as input and each of the 15 connectome flavors as output; correlations between measured network metrics from the various familial relatedness groups are shown as comparison. The Krakencoder's predicted connectomes generally preserve the network properties of the measured connectomes as well as or better than the correlation between network properties extracted from identical twins (that is, monozygotic) or two scans of the same individual (self-retest). The fusionSC-parc and fusionFC-parc rows in Fig. 2a–c represent the accuracy of the Krakencoder when predicting an SC or FC connectome flavor from all other SC or FC flavors (excluding those from the predicted parcellation). If we compare this directly with Fig. 2d, we can see how the Krakencoder's predicted connectome accuracy compares with several baseline estimates: measured connectomes from age- and sex-matched individuals who are unrelated, family members (non-twin siblings, dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic (MZ) twins), retest sessions from the same individual (self-retest), or the population mean connectome. 2d heatmaps can be considered as a measurement reliability ceiling, while the ‘unrelated' row shows the performance that can be explained by age- and sex-matching alone. Within a modality, top-1 accuracies (ranging from 0.93 to 1 for fusionFC-parc → FC and 0.83–0.97 for fusionSC-parc → SC) and average rank percentiles (all equal to 1 for fusionFC-parc and fusionSC-parc) in Fig. 2a and 2b are similar to the self-retest identifiability (when connectomes derived from imaging the same person twice are used to perform the identification), and better than the identifiability of individuals who are genetically identical (MZ twins). Similarly, the diagonal entries in Fig. 2c, representing the autoencoder avgcorrdemean for each flavor, range from 0.13 to 0.74, which is comparable to the self-retest noise ceiling (0.15–0.81), and are larger than the ‘MZ twin' row (0.07–0.47, a 40–110% increase). This indicates that the autoencoders with a 128-dimensional bottleneck preserve more inter-subject connectome variability than can be explained by identical genetics, and approximately the same amount of variability as expected when measuring the connectome from the same individual twice. The fusionSC and fusionFC rows in Fig. 2c represent the avgcorrdemean for the unified SC (or FC) → FC (or SC) connectome predictions, with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.16 for SC → FC and 0.16–0.26 depending on the flavor. 2d, indicating that predicting FC from our unified SC representation preserves more inter-subject FC variability than can be explained by age, sex and 50% genetic similarity. We next tested whether the Krakencoder latent space preserves inter-subject variation related to family structure as well as demographic and behavioral features. We examined the inter-subject similarity of latent space representations for pairs of age- and sex-matched unrelated individuals, non-twin siblings, DZ and MZ twins, and self-retest, along with inter-subject similarity of observed connectomes (Fig. By comparing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) separability of each pair of violin plots, we see that separation is greater for the Krakencoder latent space than for the observed connectomes, with statistical significance for unrelated versus sibling, DZ versus MZ twins, and MZ versus unrelated (Pperm = 0 to 0.015, two-sided permutation test with 10,000 permutations, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected across all 30 comparisons). a, Inter-subject similarity of latent space representations and observed SC and FC data, stratified by family relationship. Each violin plot shows the distribution of inter-subject similarity for age- and sex-matched pairs for each familial relationship (n = 60 sibling pairs, 26 DZ, 58 MZ), as well as unrelated pairs (n = 8,694) and self-retest (n = 37). Due to the high baseline similarity in observed data, latent and observed data similarity measures were independently z-scored by the mean and standard deviation of the similarity of unrelated subjects for visual comparison. Separability of each pair of violins within a modality was computed as the area under the ROC curve. Separability estimates for a given relationship pair from the latent space and observed data were statistically compared using a permutation test, where bars show family-level pairs where latent space separability exceeds observed data separability (Pperm = 0 to 0.015, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 30 comparisons). b, Prediction accuracy of demographic and cognitive metrics from different subsets of the Krakencoder's latent space and observed SC and FC data. Variability of prediction accuracy was assessed through bootstrap resampling (n = 100). *Significant difference between prediction accuracy from latent space and the observed data (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 18 comparisons). To demonstrate the preservation of demographically and behaviorally relevant features in the Krakencoder latent space, we trained linear models to predict individuals' age, sex and cognitive scores (‘total', ‘fluid', ‘crystallized' and ‘early childhood' composite scores from the NIH (National Institutes of Health) toolbox) from the Krakencoder latent space, and compared them with the same predictions based on observed connectome data. Linear kernel ridge regression models for each variable were built from the mean latent vectors (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC, each of which is nsubj × 128) or from the average inter-subject cosine similarity of observed data (that is, the average of 9 FC, 6 SC or 15 SC + FC nsubj × nsubj matrices) (Fig. The Krakencoder and observed connectome data predict sex with a similar balanced accuracy of ≥0.93. For age prediction, fusionSC outperformed observed SC, and observed FC outperformed fusionFC (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across all 18 comparisons), but the observed data and fusion SCFC models performed similarly. The Krakencoder latent space predictions significantly outperformed the observed data model predictions for predicting all cognitive composite scores (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test with 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across all 18 comparisons). These analyses demonstrate how the Krakencoder may be used to understand the biological underpinnings of, for example, SC to FC relationships, or which brain networks may play the largest role in predicting cognition. a, Brain network masking and analysis workflow. We estimate the sensitivity of the Krakencoder's prediction accuracy to regions in a given Yeo functional network by replacing all connectome edge values not in that network with the population mean, and feeding these masked connectomes into the connectome and demographic predictions. Upper right panel shows the overall number of edges in each network. bal.acc, balanced accuracy; Cbm, cerebellum; Con, control; DA, dorsal attention; Def, default; Lim, limbic; SM, somatomotor; Sub, subcortex; S/VA, salience/ventral attention; Vis, visual. Connectome prediction identifiability (avgrank, top) and reconstruction accuracy (avgcorrdemean, bottom) using only the connections to and from regions within each brain network shows how much information the model is utilizing from each network when predicting whole-brain connectomes. c, Similarly, predicting subject sex (top), age (middle), and total cognition (bottom) from masked input data shows the relative amount of information that the connections to and from regions in each network contain about those demographic and cognitive features. By examining the mean avgrank and avgcorrdemean when retaining only the individual-level values of those networks' connections, we see that default mode network connections appear important for mapping accuracy, particularly for the fusion → all and fusionFC → SC (Fig. Connections to and from regions in the somatomotor network and subcortex seem to be more informative for fusionSC → FC than for fusionFC → SC. Together, these heatmaps illustrate that although connections to a single network contain much of the information needed to identify an individual's connectome (for example, avgrank from default mode network inputs is 98% of that from the non-masked input), it is not sufficient to numerically recreate all of the missing connections (for example, avgcorrdemean from default mode network retains 66% of the non-masked input). This may arise from a combination of factors including the difficulty of predicting so many missing features, and the measurement noise of those predicted features. 4c we see the largest retention in accuracy for predicting sex when functional and structural connections to and from regions in the default mode network and structural connections to and from the subcortex are retained. Total cognition was best predicted by functional connections to and from regions in default mode and dorsal attention networks, and by structural connections to and from regions in the visual network. To assess generalizability of the Krakencoder to new datasets, we applied our frozen, pretrained Krakencoder model to data from the multi-site Human Connectome Project (HCP) Lifespan study41,42,43, including both the Development cohort (HCP-D) and the Aging cohort (HCP-A). These two studies differ from the original HCP young adult (YA) study in both subject demographics (ages 8–21 years for HCP-D and 36–100+ years for HCP-A versus 22–37 years for HCP-YA) and acquisition parameters, with voxel sizes and scan durations more similar to those used in typical neuroimaging studies. To account for domain shift, we linearly mapped the population mean of each connectome flavor to the population mean of the HCP-YA training subjects before applying the HCP-YA-derived PCA dimensionality reduction and Krakencoder latent space projection. Despite the demographic and acquisition differences, the Krakencoder still predicts connectome flavors with high accuracy and precision (Fig. Within-modality connectome prediction identifiability remained high for both HCP-D and HCP-A (avgrank > 0.96). Inter-modal prediction identifiability was reduced 6–12% compared with held-out HCP-YA subjects, although with avgrank > 0.75 it was still well above chance. Intra-modal avgcorrdemean was reduced by 10–26%, while inter-modal avgcorrdemean was 30–50% lower than that for held-out HCP-YA. Thus, despite the reduction in prediction accuracy due to substantial differences in age and acquisition, the Krakencoder model still performs well above chance and preserves inter-individual differences when mapping between connectome flavors. a–d, Heatmaps of connectome prediction performance for subjects from the HCP-Development study (ages 8–21 years) (a,b) and the HCP-Aging study (ages 36–100 years) (c,d). The Krakencoder model applied was trained on HCP-YA data (ages 22–37 years) and frozen; no retraining or fine-tuning was performed. a,c, Average rank percentile (Fig. This is the fractional rank of the similarity (Pearson correlation) of a subject's predicted and measured connectomes compared with all other measured connectomes, averaged across subjects (random chance, 0.5). Average correlation of each subject's measured and predicted connectomes, after subtracting the population mean. e, Sibling similarity from the HCP-Development study. Connectomes from 76 sibling pairs in HCP-D are more similar than age- and sex-matched unrelated pairs, with the latent space similarity of the sibling pairs being significantly more separable from that of the unrelated pairs than in the observed data. Each violin plot shows the distribution of inter-subject similarity for sibling pairs or pairs of unrelated individuals with matching age and sex disparity. 3a, latent and observed connectome similarity were independently normalized for visualization. Separability was measured using ROC analysis, and significance was assessed using permutation testing. For all three fusion types (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC), siblings were more similar in the Krakencoder's latent space than in the observed data (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across three comparisons). The HCP-D dataset contains 76 sibling pairs (50 same-sex, 26 opposite sex, Δage 0–9 years), therefore we performed a familial similarity analysis similar to that for HCP-YA. 5e we show that siblings were more separable from age- and sex-matched individuals in latent space than in the observed data for all three fusion types (fusionFC, fusionSC, fusionFCSC) (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 3 comparisons). Finally, we performed a regression analysis to predict age, sex and cognition in the HCP-D and HCP-A datasets (Extended Data Fig. New predictive models using the same approach as that for the HCP-YA predictions were fitted and cross-validated for each of the two new datasets. As with HCP-YA, sex was predicted very accurately by both latent and observed data models (balanced held-out test accuracy = 0.86–0.95). Age was predicted with much higher accuracy in HCP-D and HCP-A than in HCP-YA (HCP-D r = 0.84–0.95, MAE = 1.45–1.72; HCP-A r = 0.76–0.85, MAE = 6.13–6.52 on held-out test data), likely to be due to the much larger age range and larger age-related changes during development and aging. Cognitive score prediction performance for the HCP-A data was similar to or better than HCP-YA, perhaps due to larger age-related cognitive effects, but performance was considerably worse for the HCP-D dataset. This decrease in predictive ability was especially pronounced when predicting cognition from SC, in which accuracy (Pearson's r) from latent and observed data models was not significantly greater than 0. For all other predictions, observed data models performed significantly better than those on the Krakencoder latent space (Pperm < 10−4, two-sided permutation test, 10,000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 18 comparisons), although the Krakencoder predictions remained well above chance. We aim to further test Krakencoder's biological plausibility by applying it to connectomic data from individuals with pathological changes in the brain's structural and functional connections. We extracted SC and FC from 100 individuals with multiple sclerosis (age, 22–71 years, 45.5 ± 11.4 years; 66% female; disease duration 12.97 ± 8.07 years), an autoimmune disease that results in lesions primarily in the brain's white matter44. This disease has also been associated with changes in SC and FC that are related to individuals' disability levels45,46. The fMRI and dMRI acquisitions for these patients had substantially lower spatial, temporal and angular resolution than the HCP-YA or HCP-Lifespan data (Extended Data Table 2). We fed the observed, pathological SC and FC into the corresponding arms of the frozen Krakencoder to obtain a fusionSC and fusionFC, from which we predicted the various FC or SC flavors. Higher prediction performance for SC → FC than FC → SC is consistent with our out-of-sample HCP-Lifespan results. Using the current model and a simplistic approach to domain adaptation, our multiple sclerosis FC data appear less well matched to the HCP-YA FC training data than multiple sclerosis SC, or either HCP-Lifespan dataset (Supplementary Fig. This mismatch, due in part to differences in fMRI and dMRI acquisition, may explain the increased difficulty in making predictions from these inputs. Overall, these results show that even though the Krakencoder was trained on young, healthy individuals, it can still represent with good fidelity the relationship between connectomes in individuals with pathology. Importantly, it may indeed better capture the mapping from SC to FC than the observed connectome data itself. This provides evidence of the biological plausibility of the Krakencoder's architecture and hints at its possible clinical relevance in capturing low-dimensional representations of disease pathology. Although the prediction of FC from SC is not the only application of our model, this route of prediction is among the most commonly studied problems in brain connectivity mapping. To compare our current Krakencoder model with this previous literature, we gathered a few recent studies that used different approaches to predict FC from SC. The first is a deep neural network proposed by Sarwar et. al24 (‘deepnet') and the second is a graph neural network from Neudorf et. By both the avgrank and avgcorrdemean metrics, the predictions from our model outperform both the deepnet and graphnet models across all connectome flavors and parcellations (Extended Data Fig. Specifically, the Krakencoder avgrank was 17–86% higher (average 42%) than the deepnet or graphnet models for the same single SC inputs, and 18–90% higher (average 54%) using the fusionSC input to predict each FC flavor. Krakencoder avgcorrdemean was 1–890% higher (average 335%) than either model using single SC inputs, and 25–980% higher (average 450%) using fusionSC. Similarly, the accuracy of network properties for FC predicted by Krakencoder exceeded that from either alternative SC to FC framework. These particular results highlight the special emphasis of the Krakencoder on preservation of individual differences when mapping from SC to FC. Given a new connectivity flavor computed on the same training subjects as the pretrained model, we can train a new autoencoder with an additional loss term to align the new latent representation with the precomputed fusion latent representation (Supplementary Fig. To illustrate this capability we extended our model to new data from a previously unseen parcellation (cc200, ref. 47), with bandpass-filtered time series for FC (original flavors use a high-pass filter) and un-normalized streamline count for SC (original flavors use pairwise volume normalization). Prediction identifiability and reconstruction accuracy are comparable to the original 15 flavors (Supplementary Fig. Unlike the training of the original 225-path model, which takes up to 30 hours on a GPU (graphics processing unit), the addition of each new flavor takes only 1–2 minutes without a GPU. In this example, we used the original 683 HCP-YA training subjects, but this model-extension technique can use any population for which we have already computed the Krakencoder latent representation. Previous work in mapping between connectomes, mostly predicting FC from SC, has largely focused on optimizing accuracy in the model predictions by maximizing the correlation between predicted and measured FC. We argue here that over-emphasis on this metric can result in a model that predicts FC that is close to the population mean and/or does not preserve individual differences. The deepnet model did incorporate into its loss function a term that aimed to reduce inter-subject similarity of predicted FC24. However, it appears that this only pushed the individual FC predictions away from one another and not toward the particular individual's measured connectomes, given that its identifiability was just above chance. The Krakencoder's connectome predictions, however, achieve perfect average rank identifiability within the same connectome modality, and consistently high average rank identifiability when predicting FC from SC. Other modeling work has shown that regional SC–FC coupling follows a functional gradient wherein the coupling is highest in visual and somatomotor networks and lowest in higher-order association networks16,19. The Krakencoder has many novel aspects, including its ability to translate between connectome flavors without requiring raw data. This is useful when researchers only have access to a connectome from a particular pipeline or atlas and need it in another. One previously developed tool called CAROT does enable translation of FC from one atlas to another without requiring the raw data30; however, that tool does not enable translation of connectomes between different processing pipelines or mapping between SC and FC. There is no specific FC or SC processing pipeline that has been agreed upon by the field; many researchers choose one pipeline and replicate on others. The ability of the Krakencoder to predict other flavors within the same modality suggests a common, latent connectomic backbone that gives rise to each FC or SC flavor when a given parcellation or connectome estimation strategy is used. The Krakencoder's fusion functionality removes the burden of having to choose one pipeline or replicate findings on several different pipelines and attempt to make general conclusions. This latter statement is supported by the finding that models predicting cognition from the fused latent space representations outperformed models based on the observed connectome data; age and sex predictions were similar between the models but these are generally easier to predict compared with cognitive scores. As we have demonstrated, the Krakencoder's signal-to-noise ratio boosting effect can be especially useful when the tool is applied to connectomes extracted from lower quality data, which is often the case in clinical populations. The Krakencoder is robust when applied to completely new, out-of-distribution data from individuals across the lifespan (8–100+ years of age) and from adults with pathological changes to their connectomes (individuals with multiple sclerosis). The frozen model (trained on young adult data) still retained a high level of identifiability and explained variance when mapping between connectomes from the HCP-D, HCP-A and multiple sclerosis datasets. The Krakencoder appears somewhat impervious to the sweeping connectomic changes that occur throughout human development, aging and, to a certain extent, disease processes48,49. The inter-modality predictions become more difficult when new datasets are less consistent with the training data, with the current model more sensitive to domain mismatch in prediction inputs than outputs. The drop in demographic predictions of the latent space for the HCP-D, HCP-A and multiple sclerosis data could mean that the Krakencoder may benefit from further training (perhaps fine-tuning) using lifespan and/or disease data. Future work will apply the Krakencoder to predict connectomes under other clinical conditions, and further explore the relationship between the common latent representation and factors of neuroscientific or clinical relevance. We will also create a fine-tuning procedure to further increase the robustness of the Krakencoder when applied to novel datasets, to promote its wider applicability, particularly in datasets that contain pathology such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease. We have demonstrated the ability to train encoding and decoding arms for new connectome flavors, but the Krakencoder could also be adapted to data from other modalities (magneto- or electro-encephalography) or even to explicitly capture demographic and/or behavioral information so that the latent space may be used more effectively for brain–behavior mapping. While we purposefully chose atlases that were derived in varied ways, that is, using anatomical versus functional information, there still may be disagreement in the labeling of regions across subjects. However, by translating between and fusing SC and FC derived from all atlases, the Krakencoder attempts to identify a latent organizational representation that underlies those observed in different overlapping parcellation schemes. In the context of SC–FC coupling, we do not think that these atlas choices prevent its accurate evaluation within an individual, given that we are using the same parcellation for both SC and FC. Finally, while this first proof-of-concept work focused on applying the Krakencoder to static FC, we know that brain activity is flexible and adapts to task demands, varied states, and pharmacological manipulations. Further work will investigate the adaptation of the Krakencoder to better reflect dynamic changes that occur in brain networks. This research was approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board. The data for this study come from the original Human Connectome Project (HCP)50 and the HCP Lifespan studies41,42,43, which together include high-resolution 3 T MRI data for 2,490 healthy participants aged 8–100+ years. Primary model training and testing was performed using data from 958 subjects from the original young adult HCP study (HCP-YA), aged 22–37 years, which includes MZ and DZ twin pairs as well as non-twin siblings. For benchmarking performance, we include a subset of 40 HCP-YA subjects who returned for a complete retest session 1–11 months after their initial session. The HCP-Development (HCP-D, 608 subjects, aged 8–21 years, including 76 pairs of non-twin siblings) and HCP-Aging (HCP-A, 716 subjects aged 36–100 years) cohorts from HCP Lifespan were used to evaluate our pretrained model on out-of-sample, out-of-distribution data. HCP Lifespan data differ from HCP-YA in both age range and acquisition parameters, with Lifespan acquiring less than half as much fMRI and dMRI data as HCP-YA. HCP Lifespan studies were also collected across four different sites using standard MRI scanners while the HCP-YA data were all acquired on a custom MRI scanner at a single site. See Extended Data Table 2 for demographic and acquisition details. For all three datasets, we excluded subjects with incomplete resting-state fMRI or dMRI, and subjects with known acquisition or quality control issues. All resting-state fMRI time series were preprocessed by HCP using the minimal preprocessing pipeline51, which includes motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, coregistration to anatomy and nonlinear template space (FMRIB Software Library (FSL) MNI152 template, 6th generation), as well as automated denoising using ICA-FIX52. We used a custom post-processing pipeline to identify motion and global signal outlier timepoints (global signal > 5σ, motion derivative >0.9 mm), regress out tissue-specific nuisance time series (five eigenvectors each from eroded white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks53) and motion-related time series (24 in total, including six motion parameters, their backward derivatives, and the squares of both54), and temporally filter (high-pass >0.01 Hz for HCP-YA, >0.008 Hz for HCP-A/D, using DCT (discrete cosine transform) projection), and parcellate time series using each atlas. Outlier timepoints were excluded from nuisance regression and temporal filtering. Regional time series for each brain region were obtained by averaging voxels in the denoised time series data. Regional time series for each of the four (for HCP-YA) or two (for HCP-Lifespan) scans were variance-normalized and concatenated, and Pearson correlation between regional time series (excluding outlier timepoints) resulted in a region × region resting-state FC matrix for each subject. We also computed an FC matrix with global signal regression, FCgsr, by regressing the mean gray matter time series and its temporal derivative from each regional time series before computing region × region Pearson correlation. Finally, we computed a Tikhonov-regularized partial correlation FCpcorr (or FCpc) that minimizes the average Euclidean norm between subject FCpcorr and the population mean of the unregularized precision matrices36: A different λ was identified for each atlas, based on the 700 training subjects from HCP-YA. The dMRI data were preprocessed by HCP using the minimal preprocessing pipeline, which jointly corrected for motion, susceptibility distortion and eddy current distortion using FSL's ‘topup' and ‘eddy' tools55,56, before being linearly coregistered to the anatomical image. Preprocessed dMRI were further processed using MRtrix3 (ref. 57; 3.0_RC3), including bias correction, constrained spherical deconvolution (multi-shell, multi-tissue fiber orientation distribution (FOD) estimation, lmax = 8, ref. We performed both deterministic (SD_STREAM59, or SCdt) and probabilistic, anatomically constrained tractography (iFOD2+ACT60,61, or SCpr) using dynamic white-matter seeding62 for both methods, resulting in 5 million total streamlines per subject for each tractography algorithm. SC matrices were constructed for each atlas by counting the number of streamlines that ended in each pair of gray matter regions, normalized by the total volume of each region pair. We used three different whole-brain atlases, covering a range in size and construction methodology. The 86-region FreeSurfer atlas (FS86) combines 68 cortical gyri from Desikan–Killiany and 18 subcortical gray matter regions (aparc+aseg output file63,64). The 268-region Shen atlas (Shen268 or sh268) is an MNI-space cortical and subcortical volumetric atlas based on resting-state fMRI clustering65,66. The 439-region CocoHCP439 atlas (Coco439 or co439) combines 358 cortical regions from the HCP multimodal parcellation67, defined using anatomical and functional connectivity gradients, with 12 subcortical regions from FreeSurfer aseg (further modified by FSL FIRST68; FSL 6.0), 30 thalamic nuclei derived from FreeSurfer 7.2.0 (ref. 69; 50 original outputs included many small nuclei, which were merged into the final set of 30), 27 cerebellar regions from the SUIT atlas70, and 12 additional subcortical nuclei from AAL3 (ref. The FS86 and Coco439 atlases were defined based on each individual subject's FreeSurfer surface and subcortical parcellations, whereas the Shen268 atlas was applied directly to MNI-resampled data for each subject. A key consideration when assessing the performance of a connectome prediction model is the high degree of similarity of measured connectomes with the population mean. The Pearson correlation between connectomes of unrelated individuals can exceed 0.9, depending on the flavor, and a model that simply predicts the population mean for every subject can appear to have a very high prediction accuracy if it uses Pearson correlation as its metric (Fig. One simple solution to this issue is to subtract the population mean calculated from training subjects before correlating measured and predicted connectomes; here, we refer to this metric as avgcorrdemean (equation (2)). However, this metric still cannot determine whether predictions faithfully capture individual variation, particularly when there is clustering within the population (Extended Data Fig. Our goal here is to create individualized connectome predictions to understand the sources and consequences of across-subject variability. Thus, we also consider the identifiability of our predictions: whether our measured connectome for a subject is closer to the predicted connectome for that subject than the predicted connectome of any other subject. The top-1 accuracy (top1acc, equation (3)) is a winner-take-all measure that reflects the fraction of subjects for whom this is true. Specifically, it measures the fraction of subjects whose predicted connectome is more similar (higher Pearson correlation) to their measured connectome than to any other subject's measured connectome (random chance 1/nsubj = 0.005 for 196 HCP-YA test subjects). For a more continuous measure of identifiability, more suitable to assessing imperfect predictions, we use an ‘average rank percentile' measure (avgrank, equation (4)), which is the fractional rank of the similarity (Pearson correlation) of a subject's measured and predicted connectomes compared with all other predicted connectomes, averaged across subjects (random chance, 0.5). Taken together, prediction accuracy and identifiability, as measured with avgcorrdemean and avgrank, convey a more complete picture of how well a model explains individuals' connectomes. The following metrics were used to compare predicted connectomes (denoted \({\hat{X}}_{s}\) for subject s) with measured connectomes (denoted Xs) when evaluating model performance: In addition to these measures of prediction accuracy for the connectivity matrix values, we compute several common graph theoretical metrics to assess how faithfully the predicted connectomes capture the network properties of the measured connectomes. We use the Brain Connectivity Toolbox72 to compute average node strength, average betweenness centrality, characteristic path length, and modularity (Louvain community detection) for each measured and predicted connectome, and compute the Spearman rank correlation between the predicted and measured values for all test subjects for each metric. Each model training epoch consists of two stages: (1) path-wise reconstruction and inter-subject dispersion and (2) latent space consistency. For a given path i → j, we loop through batches of subjects (nbatch = 41), apply Encoderi to transform input flavor \({X}_{i}^{{\prime} }\) (256 × nbatch) to latent representation zi (128 × nbatch), and Decoderj to transform zi to predicted output flavor \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\) (256 × nbatch). Path-wise reconstruction loss and inter-subject dispersion terms (Lr.corrI, Lr.mse, Lr.marg) are computed per batch from \({X}_{j}^{{\prime} }\) and \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\). These reconstruction losses collectively penalize reconstruction error in both absolute MSE and correlation terms, and promote inter-subject separation in the reconstruction space. Path-wise latent space dispersion loss (Lz.corrI, Lz.dist), computed from zi, promotes inter-subject separation in the latent space. This forward pass and backpropagation is repeated for each batch of training subjects, before moving on to the next training path. The order in which paths are selected is randomly reshuffled each epoch. The second stage of each training epoch, latent space consistency, enforces similarity of the latent space representations from each input flavor. We re-compute zi for all input flavors from the encoders updated in the path-wise stage, and then compute Lz.sim as the total MSE between the set of zi matrices for all flavors. Explicit weights were applied to the reconstruction MSE loss term Lr.mse (wrm = 1,000), the combined path-wise latent space dispersion loss Lz (wz = 10), and the latent space intra-subject consistency loss Lz.sim (wzs = 10,000). 8 for pseudocode of training procedure, and Extended Data Table 1 for details of loss function terms. After each training epoch, we compute predicted connectomes for all paths on a held-out set of 80 validation subjects, and the inverse PCA transform (precomputed on the training data only) is applied to compute \({\hat{X}}_{j}\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{{n}_{{\rm{edges}}}}\) from \({\hat{X}}_{j}^{{\prime} }\in {{\mathbb{R}}}^{256}\). Reconstruction accuracy and identifiability are computed in this high-dimensional data space. Loss term weights were tuned empirically to balance the reconstruction (avgcorrdemean) and identifiability (avgrank) performance metrics in the validation dataset. 1b illustrates this trade-off when tuning MSE reconstruction loss. Model weights were regularized by weight decay 10−2, as well as dropout in all encoders and decoders (dropout rate 0.5). The model was trained for 5,000 epochs, which took approximately 36 h on an Nvidia A100 GPU. Validation performance plateaued after 500–1,000 epochs, and we selected the 2,000-epoch checkpoint for further evaluation. To examine how the connectomes (predicted and measured) reflect family structure, we first compute the averaged latent vector in the Krakencoder for each subject from either all 15 flavors (fusion) or the nine FC (fusionFC) and six SC (fusionSC) separately, and then compute an nsubj × nsubj inter-subject latent similarity matrix using Pearson correlation. These pairwise similarities are grouped according to the inter-subject relationship. For comparison, we also compute the inter-subject similarity for all 15 flavors of the high-dimensional measured connectome data, average these 9, 6 or 15 nsubj × nsubj similarity matrices, and group them according to relatedness. Due to the high baseline similarity in observed data, latent and observed data similarity measures were independently z-scored by the mean and standard deviation of the similarity of unrelated subjects for visual comparison. Differences of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) separability of the distributions (for example, separability of DZ and MZ distributions in latent space, compared with separability of DZ and MZ in observed data) was assessed through permutation testing (10,000 matched permutations). For demographic predictions, we used a linear support vector classifier to predict sex, and kernel ridge regression with linear kernel to predict age and cognition73. Regression hyperparameters were selected by nested cross-validation grid search. Variability of prediction accuracy was assessed through bootstrap resampling (n = 100), and significant differences between Krakencoder and observed data models was assessed using two-sided permutation testing of matched bootstrap samples (10,000 permutations). We assessed the spatial variability of prediction accuracy to determine whether certain brain regions are more accurately predicted than others. To simplify visualization and enable comparison across varied size parcellations, each region is assigned to one of seven cortical resting-state networks74 or subcortical and cerebellar networks. The edge-wise accuracies (region × region) are then grouped and averaged into a 9 × 9 network representation for each connectome flavor. In the top block of Extended Data Fig. 2a, the network-averaged edge prediction accuracy is presented for each of the fusion types as input (rows) and each connectivity flavor as output (columns). The bottom block shows the baseline network-averaged edge similarity comparing measured connectomes of unrelated age- and sex-matched subjects and related individuals. Networks with lower Krakencoder predictability (for example, the limbic network), also show low self-retest measurement reliability (bottom row). 3 summarizes the edge-wise prediction accuracy at a region level for each connectivity flavor in its own parcellation, showing a similar agreement between prediction and measurement reliability. To quantify the relationship between SC–FC predictions and cortical hierarchy, we first correlate regional prediction accuracy with an estimate of the cortical hierarchy gradient derived from functional connectivity75. We find a significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.249, Pspin = 0.019, 10,000 spin-test rotations76). Conversely, if we correlate corresponding rows in the square measured and predicted connectome matrices, we find that predicted connections to high-level cortex are less coupled to their measured rows than low-level cortex (Spearman r = −0.191, Pspin = 0.116; Extended Data Fig. Regions were grouped into seven cortical resting-state networks74 or subcortical and cerebellar networks. The fusion latent space representations (fusion, fusionSC and fusionFC) were re-calculated for each individual and used to predict, first, each connectome flavor, and second, age, sex and total cognition using re-fitted kernel ridge regression models. The Krakencoder model incorporates six flavors of SC (two per parcellation) and nine flavors of FC (three per parcellation). These two previous SC–FC prediction frameworks are designed to predict a single flavor of FC from SC. Thus, we trained 12 separate models for each of the two frameworks for all combinations of SC (SCdt or SCpr) and FC (FC or FCpcorr). FCgsr was excluded due to computational constraints and relative redundancy with FC. For comparison, the Krakencoder required only 30 GPU hours to train a model for all 15 × 15 = 225 prediction paths simultaneously. When applying the Krakencoder model to new connectome data, the computational requirements are minimal and can even be done using free cloud-based platforms such as Google Colab.

In this illustration, filled circles represent each subject's measured connectome (Xsubj), open circles represent each subject's predicted connectome (\({\hat{X}}_{subj}\)), and the black star is the population mean of all Xsubj. All three scenarios have the same residual magnitude ∣ε∣ (that is, RMSE), and similar average predicted correlation, but very different measured → predicted identifiability: Predictions for a given subject (\({\hat{X}}_{subj}\)) can be closer to the measured data of another subject than their own measurement (Xsubj). This relationship becomes complementary when observed data are close to the population mean or have distinct clusters. Each point shows the performance (reconstruction accuracy avgcorrdemean, and identifiability avgrank) averaged within prediction categories for a model trained with a different reconstruction loss weight wmse. Intra-modality predictions (SC → SC in red, FC → FC in blue) have high identifiability, and increasing wmse increases reconstruction accuracy without decreasing identifiability. Inter-modality predictions (FC → SC in yellow, SC → FC in purple), have lower accuracy and identifiability, and SC → FC identifiability decreases sharply with increasing wmse. wmse= 1000 was chosen to balance these two factors. Performance of a model trained without using PCA dimensionality reduction (green outlines) shows reduced ‘avgrank' without improving avgcorrdemean. To simplify visualization and compare across parcellations, each region is assigned to one of 7 cortical resting-state networks73 or separate subcortical and cerebellar networks, and the edge-wise accuracies (region × region) are then grouped and averaged into a 9 × 9 network representation. Age- and sex-matched individuals of given relatedness, as well as self-retest, are correlated and averaged in the same manner, in order to provide a baseline for comparing the spatial patterns of edge-wise accuracy. Each network × network heatmap in a is correlated with the corresponding self-retest (bottom row), to show the consistency of the spatial pattern of edge-wise predictions with measurement reliability. For the Krakencoder's fusion predictions made without the parcellation being predicted (fusion-parc, fusionFC-parc, and fusionSC-parc), the prediction accuracy for each region is the Pearson correlation between the predicted and measured edge values for 196 held-out test subjects, averaged across all other regions. Age- and sex-matched individuals of given relatedness, as well as self-retest, are correlated and averaged in the same manner, in order to provide a baseline for comparing the spatial patterns of edge-wise accuracy. Only the left hemisphere is shown, to simplify visualization. Regional SC → FC prediction accuracy covaries with the principal gradient of cortical hierarchy derived from functional connectivity74. a. Edge-wise prediction accuracy, measuring the explained inter-subject variance for each connectome edge, compared to fcgradient01. Regional prediction coupling, computed by correlating each region's row in the measured and predicted connectome, compared to fcgradient01. Red (fcgradient01 > 0) and blue (fcgradient01 < 0) areas on the cortical map correspond to high-level association cortex and low-level sensorimotor areas, respectively. Each dot in the scatter plots represents a region colored according to its assigned Yeo network73. These values were calculated using the held-out set of 196 individuals. Bold entries denote significant correlation (pperm < 10−3, two-sided permutation test, 1000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 120 comparisons per metric).

Top-1 accuracy (top1acc), average rank percentile (avgrank), average correlation of predicted and measured FC after (avgcorrdemean) and before (avgcorr) de-meaning are presented in the top row of panels, one value for each FC flavor as output (columns) and various SCs as input (rows). Network metrics are provided in the bottom row of figure panels. There are three SC inputs for the Krakencoder model: volume-normalized deterministic SC for that parcellation only [kraken:SCdt], volume-normalized probabilistic SC for that parcellation only [kraken:SCpr] and the fusion of all 6 SC inputs in the latent space [kraken:fusionSC]. There are two SC input flavors (deterministic [SCdt] and probabilistic [SCpr] volume-normalized SC) for the deepnet and graphnet models. The same metrics between pairs of measured FC from varied familial relatedness categories is shown as a comparison. Bold entries denote significant correlation (pperm < 10−3, two-sided permutation test, 1000 permutations, FDR-corrected across 72 comparisons per metric). Each model training epoch comprises two stages: path-wise reconstruction and inter-subject dispersion, and latent space consistency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deep in the galactic plane of the Milky Way, within a region of stars shrouded in gas and dust, one star is behaving like no other that has ever been observed before. When scientists at NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory were making observations with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) X-ray imaging instrument, something bizarre appeared—a previously unidentified source of X-rays. Intense X-ray and radio pulses were coming from this source, which is known as ASKAP J1832-0911. The radio wave intensity of ASKAP J1832-0911 cycled every 44 minutes, and was exceptionally bright in radio at the time of observation. Most excitingly for scientists, LPTs had never before been observed emitting both X-rays and radio waves. Astronomer Ziteng Wang from Curtin University in Australia—who led the team of researchers investigating ASKAP J1832-0911—wanted to find out more. But its existence alone is a breakthrough in itself. “ASKAP J1832–0911 is currently the only LPT detected with (pulsed) X-ray emission — perhaps unsurprisingly, given its extreme radio brightness and the potential correlation between the radio and X-ray luminosities,” Wang and his team said in a study recently published in Nature. The researchers believe ASKAP J1832–0911 to be compact and to have strong magnetic fields, which would align with the properties of either a magnetic white dwarf (the corpse of a star that has lost its outer layers of gas) or a pulsar (a rotating neutron star that is highly magnetized). But then, there is the issue of its unprecedented pulses. Its X-ray pulses alone are too variable to line up with the steady flash of a pulsar, and X-ray emissions from white dwarves also tend to be fainter and more stable than those produced by ASKAP J1832–0911. Well, it might be a binary white dwarf system—fast-spinning white dwarfs are sometimes found locked in binary systems with other low-mass stars. The radio emissions from these binaries are usually significantly weaker than those from ASKAP J1832–0911, but Wang suggests that the situation remains possible. These isolated neutron stars have powerful magnetic fields, and the mystery object's properties (including varied pulses and a radio spectrum that is constantly changing)are in line with those of  magnetars that emit strong radio waves. But ASKAP J1832–0911 also differs from the typical presentation of magnetars—its quiescent X-ray luminosity (the opposite of its peak luminosity) doesn't line up with expected magnetar behavior, and its especially low luminosity when its rotation slows down doesn't match either. Older magentars are thought to act more like this, but cannot reach such bright radio extremes as ASKAP J1832–0911. “It could host an unusual core-dominated magnetic field […] requiring a revision to models of magnetic field evolution in neutron stars,” Wang said. “If ASKAP J1832–0911 is an old magnetar, explaining the radio emission challenges existent models.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.
