                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manus is one of the last contenders in the artificial intelligence career in China.

The artificial intelligence sector is encouraging in China with the arrival of new models that are already rivaling with the main US agents and who are shaking the stock market.

One of the last contestants is Manus, an AF agent that some call the next "Deepseek" of China.

However, it is not the only technology that is crossing. In March, companies such as Alibaba or Baidu also presented artificial intelligence models that, according to the companies themselves, in addition to being more efficient, matched or exceeded Deepseek's ability.

With the Chinese AI models, rapidly gaining ground, these are the five key actors to take into account.

1. R1, De Deepseek

Deepseek was the first Chinese artificial intelligence startup in revolutionizing the sector. In January, its new model caused the fall of some American technology companies in the stock market and raised serious doubts regarding whether the United States had lost its leadership in AI.

The company, based in Hang Zhou, was founded in 2023 by the Inverter of coverage funds Liang Wenfeng.

After buying thousands of microchips from Nvidia, Wenfeng developed the Deepseek reasoning model, the R1, on its base model, the V3, training it with around 2,000 NVIDIA H800 chips at a total cost of approximately 5.6 million dollars (about 5.1 million euros at the current exchange rate), as detailed at the time the company itself.

That amount represented just a fraction of what the main agents of the sector are spent, as goal or openai. Mark Zuckerberg has assured that the Facebook matrix intends to invest more than 60,000 million dollars - 54.9 billion euros - this year in its commitment to artificial intelligence.

Its impact on the AI ​​microchips market was immediate: Nvidia shares collapsed almost 17%, taking hundreds of billions of stock capitalization with them.

The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, wrote in X in January: "Jevons's paradox attacks again!", Implying that, as artificial intelligence becomes more efficient and accessible, demand will only shoot.

Marc Andreessen, co -founder of the famous risk capital firm of Silicon Valley, Andreessen Horowitz, went further. Andreessen called the Deepseek R1 "the Sputnik moment of AI", comparing it with the launch of the Soviet satellite that triggered the space race between Russia and the US.

Even so, the Chinese artificial intelligence model has already shown that it has its limits. Although it seems capable of doing much of what Chatgpt can do, it sweates the responses related to issues that are considered especially delicate in China.

2. QWQ-32B, from Alibaba

Alibaba has become an actor to take into account after his model QWQ-32B in early March was public. The organization said that its model needed to use less data than Depseek to function in the same way.

His announcement made the actions of the Aliexpress matrix up 8% in two days, while Nvidia took another hard blow in the stock market.

Alibaba then said that his model, the QWQ-32B, which has a fifth of the Deepseek-R1 parameters, is designed to be efficient.

This AI model is now open source and can be found on platforms such as Hugging Face. Open source models allow for free and open software with any person and for any purpose.

Alibaba's shares in Hong Kong and its secondary price in New York have risen almost 67% so far this year, although their stock market capitalization, of 353.9 billion dollars (324.2 billion euros), is still much lower than the 2.08 billion dollars - 1,91 billion euros - of Amazon.

The company has been on a roll. Last month, their actions rose after announcing an association with Apple to bring artificial intelligence functions to iPhones in China. The price of the Aliexpress matrix also rose after the meeting between Xi Jinping and the main technological magnates of his country, including Alibaba.

Earlier this month, the company announced its intention to invest at least 380,000 million Chinese yuan - 48.1 billion euros - in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next three years.

3. Yuanbao, from Tencent

The artificial intelligence chatbot of Tencent, Yuanbao, managed to place at the head of the iOS App Store in China in early March, thus surpassing Deepseek as the most downloaded free application, Bloomberg reported at the time.

Tencent, based in Shenzhen, manages the largest application of social networks in China, Wechat, a platform that use about 1.4 billion people.

Last month, the organization added a download button for Yuanbao in Wechat, which makes the AI ​​chatbot more accessible to users of that application, as collected by the China Morning Post South.

Yuanbao is now the third most downloaded free application in the iOS App Store of China, behind Depseek and Doubao (by Bytedance). Doubao is a conversational bot similar to chatgpt.

In February, Tencent integrated the Deepseek R1 into several of its products, including Wechat's search function and the virtual partner of his game Peacekeepr Elite, Bloomberg published last week.

The American news agency added that Tencent also launched a Hunyuan Turbo edition that, apparently, would offer even faster answers than Depseek.

4. Manus

Manus has just become the last sensation of artificial intelligence in China.

As published by various media, this tool has been developed by the Chinese startup Monica, which seems to be a butterfly Effect subsidiary. According to Manus's privacy policy, Butterfly Effect would be an entity that would have been registered in Singapore.

Monica's researchers have explained that Manus is the first totally autonomous AI agent in the world. Unlike chatbots that require multiple interactions, this tool can complete complex tasks such as classifying curriculum, analyze actions, collect data and even create web pages with a single request.

According to Manus's website, this technology exceeds Openai's Deep Research model at the Benchmark Gaia, a tool to compare models.

Having debuted last week, some chatbot users wondered if Manus was a chatbot that had really been created from scratch, thus implying that it could be rather an artificial intelligence wrapping that takes advantage of other models, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet of Anthropic.

Through an X post, the co -founder of Manus, Yichao 'Peak' Ji, recognized last Monday that its product uses various models that have been previously adjusted, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet V1 or Qwen, from Alibaba.

Dean Ball, AI policy researcher, also expressed in X this Sunday that it would be "a mistake to call manus 'moment Deepseek'", because this technology would go one step further.

"Deepseek consisted of replicating capacities already achieved by US companies," said Ball. "Manus is really moving the border. The most sophisticated computer that uses artificial intelligence now comes from a Chinese emerging company ... and point."

Instead, others qualify these exaggerated statements. Kyle Wiggers, from Techcrunch, and Alexander Doria, co -founder of Pleias, have indicated that Manus is prone to make de facto mistakes, in addition to presenting execution failures and endless loops during their respective tests.

Luiza Jarovsky, an AI researcher, has also shown some concern in relation to the privacy of the data, asking where Manus stores her data and if China has access to them.

For now, access to manus requires an invitation.

5. Ernie 4.5 and Ernie X1, from Baidu

Google's direct competition in China, Baidu, launched two more recent versions of its artificial intelligence model, Ernie.

Ernie X1 is a reasoning model that, according to Baidu, could "offer a performance similar to that of Deepseek R1 in half of the price."

The model has "greater capabilities of understanding, planning, reflection and evolution", as the technological added.

Ernie 4.5 is a renewed version of the founding model of the organization, which, according to Baidu, "exceeds GPT-4.5 in multiple reference points, at a price that represents only 1% of GPT-4.5".

With the launch of these updated models, the Chinese Google has assured that Ernie X1 and Ernie 4.5 will integrate in its search engine and in its widest range of products.

Ernie X1's reasoning model is significantly cheaper than Openai O1, with prices that represent only 2% of the Chatgpt developer model.

As announced by the company in X, starting next June, Baidu's founding model will be open source.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The president of the United States, Donald Trump, has announced an unexpected tariff that will affect China.

This Monday, Trump has introduced what he has described as "secondary tariffs" to all countries that buy oil to Venezuela. This means that countries that acquire raw and Venezuelan gas must pay a 25% tariff to the United States if they also trade with the North American country.

Trump has signed an executive order on Monday to implement the measure.

The tariff will enter into force on April 2. The objective is to exert pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, very punished for previous sanctions.

"These tariffs seek to cut the financing routes of the corrupt regime of Nicolás Maduro and stop their destabilizing influence on the western hemisphere," says an informative file about Trump's executive order. "The Maduro regime represents an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy of the United States," adds the text.

Crude's futures have risen around 1% after the news was known.

Global energy prices have dropped in recent months due to concern about world economic growth and excess supply.

China, key market for Venezuela

Although tariffs are aimed at all countries that buy Venezuelan oil, analysts point out that the greatest impact will be suffered by China, which exported 55% of the crude and fuels of Venezuela in February, according to Reuters.

Venezuelan oil is sanctioned by the United States, so much of the energy trade is carried out through opaque channels. Venezuela is not one of China's main crude oil suppliers - Saudi and Russia occupy the top positions.

"These secondary tariffs are an indirect sanction aimed at degrading the Venezuelan oil supply capacity and damaging the Chinese independent refinery system," said Mikesh Sahdev, a global head of raw material markets at Rystad Energy consultant.

Sahdev has affirmed that Chinese "teapots" - independent refiners - will have difficulty obtaining oil supply and will be forced to resort to their reserves.

If tariffs are maintained during the summer - when oil demand usually increases due to the use of air conditioning - crude oil prices could rise even more, he added.

Beijing responds hard

The Chinese government has firmly reacted to this new round of tariffs.

"The United States has been abusing illegal unilateral sanctions for a long time and its long arm jurisdiction, interfering flagrantly in the internal affairs of other countries," said Guo Jiakun, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this Tuesday.

"China firmly opposes these types of actions. We urge the United States to cease its interference in the internal affairs of Venezuela, lift its illegal unilateral sanctions against the country and take measures that contribute to peace, stability and development in Venezuela and beyond," Guo said in a press conference.

Investors will continue eyeing shares of automakers after they declined on Thursday following Trump's announcement of 25% tariffs on "all cars that are not made in the United States."

The president's comments this week regarding the upcoming April 2 tariffs, however, have eased some concerns for investors. Recently, Trump mentioned that the tariffs would be "very lenient" and expressed a willingness to lower tariffs on China to facilitate a deal with ByteDance's TikTok.

On Thursday, he also used tariffs as a bargaining tool, warning that he could impose "far larger" duties on the European Union and Canada, if they join forces to oppose the levies.

In November 2023, Jack Ma posted an internal memo at Alibaba , urging the e-commerce giant he helped create to "correct its course." The message was as a rallying cry by one of China's most prominent tech leaders to a company going through one of the most tumultuous times in its history. Alibaba's share price was near record lows, growth was stalling amid intensifying competition, management changes were coming thick and fast, and Beijing was still closely scrutinizing the company. Ma himself was barely in the public view. But his message may have instilled some new hope in Alibaba — the e-commerce giant is now seeing growth in its core business and has become one of the leading artificial intelligence players in China and globally, competing with the likes of OpenAI and DeepSeek. And Alibaba is now back in favor with the Chinese government. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares have quietly risen nearly 60% this year, adding more than $100 billion to the company's valuation. "China tech has awoken being led by Alibaba and investors globally are viewing this as the best way to way China tech ... and we agree. Alibaba is in pole position to benefit from AI and cloud spend," Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC. CNBC spoke to Alibaba's chairman as well as a former executive and analysts, who painted a picture of the changes at the tech firm that have led to the start of the company's comeback.

Alibaba's fall

Alibaba's downfall was swift. Many have credited its beginning to comments made by Ma in October 2020 where he appeared to criticize China's financial regulator. The comments weren't widely picked up on. Days later, Alibaba's share price hit a record high with its market capitalization exceeding $858 billion. Alibaba was riding wave of successes that had seen it grow into the biggest e-commerce player in China, with international expansion on the agenda and its cloud business growing quickly. To top it all off, Alibaba affiliate Ant Group was gearing up for an initial public offering that would raise north of $34 billion, making it the biggest listing in history. Ant Group, which was also founded by Ma, is a financial technology company that is behind Alipay, one of China's two most prominent mobile payment systems. Just two days before Ant Group was scheduled to list in Shanghai and Hong Kong, the IPO was canceled. At the time, Ant cited changes in China's "regulatory environment."

What followed was several years of intense scrutiny on Ma's empire and China's biggest technology companies. Regulators clamped down on practices from giants that they viewed as anticompetitive, dished out billions of dollars of fines on companies including Alibaba, forced changes to Ant Group's structure and brought in a plethora of rules touching many areas of technology.

'Uncertainty and confusion'

Regulatory scrutiny was one of Alibaba's headaches in 2021. But it was also facing a number of other issues, including uncertainty around the strength of the Chinese economy that was trying to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and rising competition. In particular, newer companies like Pinduoduo and even Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, were capturing attention in China in e-commerce. In March 2023, Alibaba — a sprawling company that does everything from food delivery to cloud computing and movies — decided to split into six separate business groups, each with the ability to raise outside funding and go public. Alibaba thought the move would make these units more agile. Then came a leadership reshuffle. Alibaba announced in June 2023 that Daniel Zhang, who had been CEO since 2015 and chairman from 2019, would step down from both roles to focus on the cloud business. But just three months later, Zhang suddenly quit the cloud unit.

Eddie Wu, a co-founder of Alibaba, took over as CEO and the head of cloud. Joe Tsai, another co-founder, stepped up to take on the role of chairman. That was one of the most tumultuous times in Alibaba's history. "During that time period a great sense of uncertainty and confusion hovered over employees. While there was a wait-and-see sort of mentality that set in, the problem was that as time passed, many didn't know just how long that would be," Brian Wong, a former Alibaba executive and author of "The Tao of Alibaba," told CNBC. "While China's economy during the start of Covid initially remained robust, following the lock-downs everything turned and the combination of disrupted supply chains and changes in the economic climate only compounded the concerns of where all of this was headed."

Joe and Eddie steady the ship

Wu sought to return Alibaba's focus to its core e-commerce and cloud businesses and trim down some of the other initiatives the company had plunged into, moving away from the idea of Alibaba as several separate divisions. Artificial intelligence moved front and center, with Wu and Tsai suggesting the company needed to adopt a startup mentality to keep up with the competition. "Large companies move very slow and it's because the decision-making structure is too complicated ... So we really needed to get back to nimbleness and act fast," Tsai said at the CNBC CONVERGE LIVE event in Singapore earlier this month, adding that quick decision-making is key to competing with startup rivals. Tsai said that he and Wu decided the first thing they needed to do was to "streamline the company." "Instead of talking about Alibaba as six different business units, we talked about ourselves as having two core businesses — e-commerce and cloud computing," Tsai said. "That simplified everything and our communication. It's very important that we communicate that to our employees. They need to have a simple structure in their minds in order to move faster."

Younger people in management were also given the power to make decisions, Tsai said. "It means that actually letting them make some decisions and letting them make mistakes and train them so that they can recover from mistakes," Tsai added. Wu and Tsai also scrapped plans to list Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics arm, marking a U-turn on previous commitments. "Eddie is winning plaudits internally for having trimmed the old and built the new. Jack [Ma] and Joe [Tsai] ultimately made the decision to bet on him and it's paying off," Duncan Clark, an early advisor to Alibaba and chairman of BDA, told CNBC by email.

Changing political winds

After the Ant Group IPO was scrapped in late 2020, Ma went out of public view. The billionaire was seen as the poster child of Beijing's move to rein in the power of private companies and entrepreneurs. The tightening of regulation and government scrutiny also hit investment. Billions of dollars were wiped off the value of Chinese tech companies while venture capital investment in startups plunged. In a country where government policy and support is key for sectors and companies, Beijing's apparent antagonism toward private business had dampened spirits in the tech sector. But as China continues to face economic headwinds, the role of the technology sector in boosting the economy is back in focus. And in February this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping held a rare meeting with entrepreneurs urging them to "show their talents," in comments seen as giving support to private businesses.

Alibaba's Ma, among other top Chinese CEOs and founders, were present at that gathering. Ma's attendance was particularly interesting, given that his empire was under the microscope over the last few years and he had not been seen with China's political elite for some time. "Xi's meeting with Jack Ma also sent out a very clear signal on where the Chinese government's priorities are at the moment – AI development and the growth of private enterprises are clearly important to China's economic growth, and we also believe that Alibaba has the support of the Chinese authorities," Chelsey Tam, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC by email. The meeting has helped Alibaba's share price this year. And it appears to have also instilled new confidence in Alibaba to hire and invest. "It gave us the confidence ... to put our earnings back into capex [capital expenditure] and investments and also hire people," Alibaba's Tsai said, referencing a more than $50 billion investment in AI infrastructure over the next three years that the company announced in February.

AI success

A large part of Alibaba's stock rally this year has been driven by the euphoria around DeepSeek and investors looking at tech giants in China to see what they're doing with AI technology. Alibaba is among China's leaders, and in 2023, not long after ChatGPT made a splash, the company launched its first AI model called Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen. The Hangzhou-headquartered company has since aggressively launched numerous models that allow tasks such as video, text and image generation from user prompts. Alibaba has made its models open source, meaning anyone can download them and build upon them. This has been key to its success. Some of the most popular models on Hugging Face, a global repository of AI models, are built on Qwen. "Alibaba has been consistently releasing high-impact open source models on Hugging Face since early 2023," Tiezhen Wang, a machine learning engineer at Hugging Face, told CNBC. Wang said Alibaba's models, which cover features like video, image and text generation, "deliver strong performance across tasks."

watch now

While Alibaba was early in the AI model game, it was the release of a research paper from Chinese firm DeepSeek this year that forced all eyes to focus on what was going on in China. DeepSeek claimed its AI model was trained at a fraction of the cost of leading AI players and on less-advanced Nvidia chips, leading to a global stock sell-off. "DeepSeek was a wake up call that China tech is not just sitting idle on AI and this indirectly benefits Alibaba as the appetite for AI is clear in China," Wedbush Securities' Ives said.

AI competition ramps up

Alibaba's first models actually predate DeepSeek. But competition in China is ramping up. Some of the country's biggest tech firms from Baidu to Tencent continue to release models. But there are questions about how Alibaba will make money off open-source AI models that are free. The answer, according to investors, AI experts and the company executives, is Alibaba's cloud computing business. Open source allows a company to build a community of developers around a particular model, strengthening its capabilities and also its reach globally. More availability of AI and growing demand also means Alibaba could ultimately drive growth in its cloud computing business. Alibaba effectively charges companies to use its servers and computing power which is required to run AI applications, even if it's not Alibaba's models.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The value of Berkshire Hathaway class A shares has first reached 800,000 dollars (about 741,000 euros at the current exchange rate), which marks a new milestone for the conglomerate of Warren Buffet.

Taking into account that on February 4, the shares of the Buffett company were worth around $ 700,000 (648,000 euros), it has cost them only 37 days of contribution to increase that figure by 100,000. To put in context, those same shares took 41 years to overcome for the first time the barrier of $ 100,000 (93,000 euros), a goal they reached in 2006.

In fact, Berkshire Hathaway already reached the amount of $ 700,000 in August 2024, but, during the fourth quarter of 2024, it fell below that level and, in January of this year, it fell again.

In this graphic it can be seen how the value of Berkshire Hathaway class A actions has evolved, which has increased by up to 292,025% since 1982:

The company led by Buffett has been pending it in 2025, with a rise in the price of its 18% shares so far this year, compared to the 3% drop that the reference stock index in the United States has experienced in the United States, the S&P 500.

Investors have made mass to this investment conglomerate, which has a cash amount of 334,000 million dollars (309,000 million euros). In the event that a significant fall in the market occurs, Berkshire Hathaway could take advantage of his growing cash mountain in valuations that are attractive.

The actions of the Buffett company quoted around $ 19 - about 17 euros at the current exchange rate, without inflation - when, in 1965, the businessman took over the bankrupt textile factory that was then Berkshire. The increase in this Thursday shares to 803,346 dollars —744,139 euros - represents an accumulated gain of 4,228,036%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tariff war between Europe and the US has already exploded. Yesterday, the American president, Donald Trump, announced 25% tariffs to all imported light vehicles and their components, including all those that disembark in their ports from Europe. This is something that has caused the drop in the stock market of all brands.

However, it seems that in a scrambled river, the Tesla fisherman will be able to get revenue. According to Bloomberg, Tesla factories located in California and Texas produce all the cars that sell in the US, which does not be affected by tariffs. This is the difference of its main rivals, such as Hyundai, Volkswagen or General Motors.

"There are very few winners," says Sam Fioreni, vice president of world forecasts of AutoForecast Solutions vehicles. "Consumers will lose because they will have fewer options and higher prices."

Tesla is the "less exposed" company to new tariffs due to their national manufacturing operations, says CfFo Research analyst Garrett Nelson. Tesla herself has presumed this week of her US credentials, affirming in a post in X that her models "are the most manufactured cars in the US."

Germany asks for a blunt response to US tariffs to protect their brands

However, it will not be completely unscathed. Elon Musk himself explained in X that tariffs would have a "significant" impact on the company. In a subsequent publication in X aimed at another user, Musk added that tariffs will have a "non -trivial" effect on the prices of imported car parts that Tesla uses.

Trump insisted that there is no conflict of interest despite the outstanding role of the CEO of Tesla in the Administration. "He has never asked me for a business in business," Trump said in an act in the Oval Office by signing the proclamation that starts cars tariffs.

The one that can also be less affected is Ford, since about 80% of the cars it sells in the US are of national manufacture. Logically, foreign brands will be the most affected.

Hyundai runs the risk of being one of the most affected. Although the car manufacturer and KIA have plants in Alabama and Georgia - and announced this week an expansion plan in the US of 21,000 million dollars -, imported more than one million vehicles to the US last year, which represents more than half of their sales in the country, according to figures of Global Data.

Hyundai "remains committed to the long -term growth of the US car industry through localized production and innovation," said the company in a statement, in which it indicated that it employs 570,000 people in the United States.

Both could have to pay about 7,000 million dollars every year that the tariffs are in force, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, SK Securities Co. This accounts for almost 40% of the total operating benefit that the two car manufacturers will obtain in 2024.

On the other hand is Toyota, who has four factories distributed by Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, in addition to engines plants in Western Virginia and Alabama. Even so, the manufacturer imports approximately half of what it sells in the United States.

A Toyota representative explained that the company's operations in Mexico comply 100% with the USMCA free trade agreement. Tariffs could reduce the estimated operating benefit of Toyota for fiscal year 2026 by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts.

However, the one that will happen worse is Nissan, since it could lose 56% of its benefit. For its part, Subaru is studying how to minimize the impact of tariffs, although a company spokesman did not want to give more details about the specific measures he is studying. According to Goldman Sachs's note, Subaru could see its operating benefit reduced by 2026 by 23%.

These tariffs, which will enter into force on April 2, will be applied to the non -American part of the imported vehicles and pieces by virtue of a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.

This will soften the coup for vehicles whose supply lines cross the continent in Zigzag. Tariffs on the pieces from Canada and Mexico that conform to the trade agreement will not enter into force until the US establishes a process to collect those taxes.

Despite being national, the three of Detroit will also be harmed. General Motors imports many of its best -selling cars in the US of Canada, Mexico and China. The same that happens to Stellantis, which also has factories in Italy to produce vehicles that later sell in their native country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla, owned by Elon Musk, has been admitted in Saudi Arabia, the largest economy of the Persian Gulf, at a crucial moment for the manufacturer of electric vehicles.

On Wednesday, Tesla announced that he will celebrate an act of presentation in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on April 10.

"You and your family are cordially invited to our presentation act on the Bujairi terrace on April 10," said the announcement on the Tesla website.

"I experience the future of autonomous driving with Cybercab and know Optimus, our humanoid robot, while we show the next in artificial and robotic intelligence," he adds.

According to the announcement, a Tesla team will be present to answer questions about how to own a Tesla or how to load it at home.

To date, Musk had had a tense relationship with Saudi Arabia.

In August 2018, Musk wrote on Twitter - now x - that he would take Tesla to sib.

"I am considering taking out tesla at 420 dollars. Insured financing," Musk wrote.

In a company's blog at that time, Musk wrote that he had met with representatives of the Sovereign Fund of Saudi Arabia, the Public Investment Fund. The meetings began in early 2017 after expressing their interest in taking Tesla to the private sector, Musk added.

The agreement was not carried out after the FPI did not compromise any financing.

Musk and Tesla were sued by Tesla investors, who affirmed that Musk's premature announcement made them lose money. During the trial, Musk blamed the FPI for "backing" in his plans.

Then, in 2018, the FPI announced an investment of one billion dollars in the rival of Tesla, Lucid Motors.

The opening of the doors of Saudi Arabia to Tesla arrives at a critical moment for the manufacturer of electric vehicles, which has seen the price of its actions more than 40% from the historical maximums achieved in mid -December.

Tesla shares closed about 272 dollars on Wednesday, below the $ 479 they reached in December.

The company has lost its position as the first world manufacturer of electric vehicles, since the income of the Chinese giant byd will exceed those of Tesla in 2024.

Byd has just presented loaders who, as he says, are four times more powerful than those of Tesla and can load an electric car in five minutes.

On Tuesday, the European Association of Automobile Manufacturers said that Tesla sales in Europe have fallen 42% in the first two months of the year.

Tesla representatives have declined to comment to Business Insider.

Blue Orchid Hospitality granted permission to convert Atlas House to a luxury hotel

Image Credit: Integrity International Group

Planning permission has been granted for Atlas House on King Street, Cheapside, currently vacant with prior uses as offices. The landmark Italianate-style property is to be transformed into a high-quality boutique hotel under the ownership of the award-winning Blue Orchid Hospitality group, part of the Integrity International Group, led by renowned hotelier and developer, Tony Matharu.

Atlas House is an elegant Grade II listed building situated at the core of the historic City of London, near to Guildhall, St Paul’s Cathedral and the Bank of England – on the junction of King Street, Queen Street, and Cheapside.

Atlas House joins Blue Orchid’s multi award-winning portfolio of independent hotels, apartments, suites and residences, including the Westminster-based Wellington hotel and the City-based Tower Suites – winners of the 2023, 2024 and 2025 Travellers’ Choice® Award for exceptional guest experience.

Integrity International Group presented plans for the 104-bedroom hotel to also offer a destination restaurant, cocktail bar and health club, spa, pool and gym together with flexible public workspaces for the enjoyment of both guests and the public, adding choice and variety to the City’s offering and to the Destination City agenda. The development will contribute to an identified need for new upscale visitor accommodation in a highly desirable location, activating street frontages along King Street and Cheapside.

Integrity International Group are dedicated to improving the building’s sustainability credentials targeting BREEAM ‘Excellent’ and delivering a Biodiversity Net Gain. Their proposal has minimal structural implications, with enhancements and restoration as key features of their investment into the listed building.

Integrity International Group, owned by award-winning hotelier Tony Matharu, commented:

“I am delighted that we are able to move forward with our proposed plans for this landmark building in the heart of the City, affording us on the opportunity to demonstrate our continued commitment to invest in and breathe new life into London property, particularly those buildings at the end of their previous lives; ensuring that London remains the best place to live, work, visit, and invest.

We look forward to welcoming guests to enjoy this special property and to continuing to make a positive difference to central London and its world-class offering to international and domestic visitors, workers, and residential communities alike.”

Tony and his Integrity International Group recognises that the most sustainable way to create new value in London is to reinvest in existing buildings, particularly heritage sites built for a different demographic. Atlas House provides an exciting opportunity to transform another landmark property into a world-leading hotel, whilst retaining, restoring and enhancing an historic London site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump is a machine to generate news, headlines and, on some occasions, to change the natural state of the things that concern him. It does not leave a puppet with a head.

Now he will give the battle with Tiktok again.

After announcing a 25% tariff to all imports from vehicles to the United States, Trump has dropped that he also plans to use that weapon (even if it is double edge) to press China and solve the future of Tiktok in the United States.

The president of the United States has suggested that it could offer a reduction of tariffs on Chinese products if the Beijing government approves the sale of US operations of the popular social network, owned by the Chinese technological bya Bytedance.

"Maybe it gives them a small reduction of tariffs or something to close the agreement," Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office, according to the statements collected by Reuters.

The statement arrives at a key moment, less than two weeks since the legal deadline set by Washington comes: on April 5, Bytedance must have sold Tiktok to a non -Chinese buyer or face his national prohibition.

The operation, however, is still not closed.

There is no agreement

Since the US Congress approved a law in 2024 that requires divestment for national security reasons, negotiations have encountered an infinity of obstacles.

Among them include the complexity of the agreement, the difficulties in defining the structure of a new American entity with limited participation of Chinese capital and the deep involvement of the White House, which has played an unprecedented role as coordinator of the conversations.

In addition, any transaction must have the approval of China, since the sale of Tiktok entails the sale of sensitive technology - like its recommendation algorithm - and is subject to export controls.

This factor has been decisive so that the sale has not prospered to date.

The Beijing government maintains that any operation must comply with its internal laws.

The United States vice president, JD Vance, in charge of Trump to supervise the negotiations, has recognized that the agreement could be delayed beyond April 5, not for lack of will, but for legal complexity.

"The agreement itself will be very clear, but create those thousands of pages of legal documents ... That is the only thing that worries me that it can be delayed," according to statements to NBC News collected by AP.

Possible buyers

Among the candidates to get Tiktok are US investors such as KKR, General Atlantic, Susquehanna or Coatue, as well as acquisition proposals by Perplexity AI, businessman Frank McCourt or former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Known offers range between 20,000 and 30,000 million dollars (18,500 and 27.8 billion euros).

Trump, who already tried to prohibit Tiktok during his first term, has softened his position during the 2024 presidential campaign and came to recognize that the platform was key to connect with young voters.

Even so, he has reiterated that national security must prevail and that the term of April 5 could be extended if an agreement is not reached "that is the best for the country."

The US tariff policy under President Donald Trump is proving “challenging” for Britain, the business and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds has admitted. Photo: PA

Jonathan Reynolds has refused to rule out cutting the digital services tax on major tech firms, amid the prospect of looming US trade tariffs.

The business and trade secretary insisted the UK government was “committed to ensuring tech companies pay a fair amount of tax in the UK”, but added that the digital services tax was “not something that can never change”.

It comes amid media reports suggesting the government is considering changes to the digital services tax as it bids to avoid the tariffs US President Donald Trump is expected to introduce next week.

Tech firms are obligated to pay a two per cent levy under the tax, which includes major US firms such as Amazon, and brings in around £800m in revenue each year.

Speaking at a trade conference at the Chatham House think tank, Reynolds suggested UK ministers were willing to discuss the issue with their US counterparts.

“We have always been of the view as a country that this has to be something ideally agreed on an international basis, but it’s not that digital services tax has been put in place as something that can never change or we can never have a conversation about it,” he told the audience.

Reynolds stressed that the UK was “committed to making sure tech companies pay a fair amount of tax in the UK”.

He added that the US had expressed “concerns about the specific structure of that”, but said it was not “a major part of the conversation” on tariffs.

Asked about Reynolds’ comments, Downing Street declined to comment on the talks.

Asked if changing the tax was part of ongoing trade talks with the US, a No10 spokesman said: “We’re not going to provide a running commentary on the details of trade talks.”

He added: “We’re just not going to comment on every aspect of the trade talks as they continue.”

Digital services tax was introduced in 2020 in what was intended as a temporary move prior to an international agreement on digital taxation.

Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats have urged the government to rule out cutting or abolishing the tax, with deputy leader Daisy Cooper saying it would be “unforgivable” to “go ahead with cutting taxes for US tech barons to appease Musk and Trump”.

Cooper argued scrapping the tax would cost £5bn over the next five years, and said: “Ministers need to confirm that they won’t bow down to Trump’s threats… the Chancellor needs to categorically rule out cutting the digital services tax in any way.”

Trump announced 25 per cent tariffs on car imports to the US on Wednesday night, due to come in on 2 April when he is also reported to be planning to impose a series of other tariffs.

The government has said talks are still ongoing as the UK attempts to secure exemptions from the tariffs, which the watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast could knock as much as one per cent off the UK’s GDP.

Tariffs exemption?

Duncan Edwards, chief executive of the BritishAmerican Business organisation, a transatlantic trade organisation, said while the new tariffs were a “clear campaign promise” and “should not come as a surprise”, there was a “very strong case” for UK exemption.

He said: “Unlike other trading relationships, the US and UK do not have a trade imbalance, nor is there a significant disparity in wage structures or labour standards.

“We urge the UK not to retaliate, listen carefully to the American concerns, and continue efforts to reach an agreement which provides the exemption that will benefit both economies.”

While Chris Southworth, secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce UK, said: “I think in the last 24 hours, this has been a perfect illustration of the challenges facing the UK and the world that we’re living in.

“Yesterday, we had the spring statement that didn’t mention anything about trade. Within 24 hours, we then have 25 per cent tariffs from the Trump administration.

“It just demonstrates the strains that businesses are under and the impact that has on our economy.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The war between the US and Europe is more open than ever. Although Donald Trump had already warned that cars arrived from Brussels to the country would impose tariffs, yesterday he confirmed that on April 2 some rates of 25% would enter into force to all imported light vehicles and their components that are manufactured outside the US.

Although there has not yet an answer from brands, they have done some European countries, such as Germany, that you see that your teaching will be the most affected, they have requested strong response measures.

The Vice Chancellor and Minister of Economy of Germany, Robert Habeck, has requested a forceful reaction of the European Union to American tariffs on the importation of cars declared by President Donald Trump. "It should be clear that we will not give in to the United States. We have to show strength and confidence in ourselves," said Habeck.

Although Trump states that these tariffs will serve to protect American companies and boost national production, Hayeck considers that they would be "bad news for the US", as well as for German car manufacturers, the German economy and the EU.

European brands are ahead of Trump's tariffs and are already sending cars to the US

When Trump announced these tariffs a few weeks ago, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, described these taxes as "bad for companies, worse for consumers."

In this line, the president of the German Association of the Automobile Industry (VDA) has also been expressed, which affirmed that tariffs will affect car manufacturers and all companies in the world supply chain, "with very negative consequences, especially for consumers, also in North America."

"The consequences will cost growth and prosperity to all parties," said Hildegard Müller in a statement. What is at stake is huge for BMW, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Stellantis and its vast network of suppliers, as well as for the entire European economy, he adds.

In the rest of Europe, the French Minister of Economics, Eric Lombard, said that the "only solution" would be for the EU to raise tariffs to US products in response. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom said he does not plan any reprisal measure "for the moment."

"We want to ensure a better commercial relationship with the United States. I recognize that the week we have ahead is important. Today there are more conversations, so we are going to see where we arrive in the next few days," said Rachel Reeves, British Minister of Economics.

From Spain, it has been Faconauto who has manifested, stating that the "introduction of an additional 25% tariff will foreseeably reduce the competitiveness of European vehicles in the US market, which will affect not only manufacturers, but also to the entire supply and marketing network linked to the sector."

"Spain, as the second vehicle manufacturer of the European Union and with a highly integrated industrial fabric in the European supply chain, will be indirectly but relevant. Investment decisions, "they add.

However, these tariffs will not only harm European brands. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has also warned that these taxes would also affect his company. "To be clear, this will affect the price of the pieces of Tesla cars that come from other countries. The impact on costs is not trivial," Musk wrote in X.

The Center for Automotive Research estimated that US tariffs could increase the price of cars in thousands of dollars and impact employment.

Peter Navarro, Trump's main counselor, ruled out, saying that the "foreign trade cheats" converted the United States manufacturing sector into a "assembly operation of foreign pieces with lower salaries."

The United States is the largest destination of the exports of the European car industry and, in 2023, European car manufacturers exported vehicles and parts worth 56,000 million euros to the United States. The European car industry maintains 13.8 million jobs, that is, 6.1% of the total EU employment.

The most exposed are manufacturers of German and Italian cars, since 24% of German exports and 30% of Italian outside the EU go to the United States. Germany houses large car manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

"This would be a hard blow for a sector that not only maintains millions of jobs, but also contributes largely to the Block's GDP," wrote Clarissa Hahn, an Oxford Economics analyst. Hahn estimates that German exports will decrease 7.1% and Italians, 6.6%.

"The EU and the US must establish a dialogue to find an immediate solution that avoids tariffs and harmful consequences of a commercial war," said the Association of European Manufacturers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump, the president of the United States more obsessed with the idea that his commercial partners are stealing him, wants to impose more tariffs on the European Union and Canada if they do not stop collaborating to cause more "economic damage" to the United States.

"If the European Union collaborates with Canada to cause economic damage to the United States, large -scale tariffs will be imposed, much larger than those currently planned, in order to protect the best friend that these two countries have ever had!" Trump written this Thursday in a publication in Truth Social, his social network.

Trump's statements have occurred just after signing an executive order to impose a 25% tariff on cars imports, a measure that will probably affect European manufacturers.

Since his return to office in January, Trump has also introduced generalized tariffs of 25% into steel and aluminum. Its administration has imposed a 25% tariff to almost all imports from Canada and Mexico, and has increased tariffs to China by 20%.

Canada announced in early March that it would respond with a 25% tariff to US products worth 155,000 million dollars (144,000 million euros). In March, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney decided to make his first visits abroad to France and the United Kingdom, instead of the United States.

During his trip to France earlier this month, Carney described Canada as "the most European country among non -European."

The White House has not immediately responded to a request for comments from Business Insider.

Relations between the United States and Europe cool

The threat of new tariffs comes at a time when Washington's relations with its European allies already cross tensions for Trump's public position on defense cooperation.

The president has repeatedly questioned the United States commitment to the defense of Europe, ensuring that their countries take advantage of the United States and do not assume their part of responsibility.

"It's common sense, right?" Trump told journalists earlier. "If they don't pay, I'm not going to defend them."

Europe depends largely on the US army, which maintains key bases throughout the continent, while many of the European armed forces acquire advanced armament manufactured in the United States.

Some key capabilities, such as the F-35 Lightning II of Lockheed Martin, are pillars of many European armies and depend on US components and technicians.

Leaders from several countries, such as Portugal and Denmark, have expressed concern about that agency, and have pointed out that they could stop considering F-35 as the best option for their armed forces.

Canada's Minister of Defense has also expressed concern in this regard, and has indicated that they are studying "other alternatives" after Trump's comments, which has suggested that Canada could become state 51 of the United States.

The future of foreign sales of this plane could reflect a broader change in the historical confidence of Europe in the American system, a relationship that in the era after World War II was considered almost unwavering.

The rest of the European Union, largely in response to Trump's rhetoric, has proposed a plan to massively increase national defense spending by 840,000 million dollars (778,000 million euros) in an "Age of Rearme".

Twice a year we change the clocks – and twice a year we ask why. We get two writers to argue whether we should abolish daylight saving time for good in this week’s Debate

Yes: British Standard Time is better for our health

This Sunday we will change our clocks to go forward an hour and face around seven months of living in the “wrong time zone” as we enter Daylight Saving Time (or British Summer Time as it is known here in the UK). Many are looking forward to increased evening light and longer days.

However, these longer days are attributable to seasonal changes as we enter summer, not the clock changes. All we are actually doing is moving our schedules by one hour: having an hour more light in the evening comes at the expense of morning bright light. And morning bright light is crucial for helping to regulate our sleep-wake cycles.

In the summer the sunrises are so early that the lack of morning bright light is not so obvious. However, it is quite noticeable in spring and autumn. For example, on the Monday after the switch, the sun will rise between 6:40-6:50am depending on where you are in the UK. Come October, before we switch our clocks back, the sun will not rise until 7:40-8:00am, which hardly gives us much time before work to expose ourselves to bright light and regulate our sleep-wake cycles.

Lack of sleep can have significant impact on our health, both physical and mental, as well as our daytime functioning, academic and work performance. The British Sleep Society therefore recommends getting rid of the clock change, and to abolish Daylight Saving Time. It should be replaced with British Standard Time, where the clocks align with the sun time and we get our morning bright light that is so crucial for our sleep, health, safety and productivity.

Dr Megan Crawford is a researcher at the University of Strathclyde Sleep Centre and a member of the British Sleep Society

No: Synchronisation with the seasonal patterns establishes balance

Many people dislike changing the clocks twice annually but I find it beneficial. Making better use of natural daylight improves our overall wellbeing and lifestyle. The extended evenings after we “spring forward” provide us with additional time to enjoy activities such as walking after work or meeting friends and simply spending time outdoors. The extended day lengthens our daily schedule and creates balance which boosts both mood and energy levels. The extra hour of sleep gained when we “fall back” feels like a present, while the adjustment brings more morning sunlight to help us wake up more easily during the darker months.

There’s also a practical side to it. Evening daylight extension enhances driving and walking visibility which leads to reduced accidents and improved safety. Research indicates that evening light reduces crime rates since criminal activities decline in areas with sufficient lighting. The economy benefits when people choose to visit shops and restaurants during daylight hours which helps support local businesses.

The addition of evening daylight reduces feelings of depression and tiredness that accompany the reduced daylight hours of winter. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) exists as a real mental health condition which improves significantly when people receive additional sunlight. Personally, I find the time change refreshing. The transition into Daylight Saving Time brings me a sense of renewal as it signifies upcoming brighter days while the end of Daylight Saving Time helps me embrace winter’s comforting atmosphere. This synchronization with seasonal patterns establishes a healthier and more balanced feeling for me. The advantages of changing the clocks clearly surpass the hassle of adjusting them.

VERDICT: Let’s (not) do the time warp again

Time and time again (more specifically, twice a year), the daylight savings time (DST) debate rears its head, driven largely by those who wish to see the back of it. And yet here we are still, with the question unsettled.

In putting together this debate, it quickly became clear that, nowadays, advocates for clock-changing are few and far between. It messes up our sleep, depresses us in winter and nobody knows how to change the time on the oven. What was also clear, however, is that many eagerly pledging their support for DST’s abolition mistakenly assume this will result in an eternal British Summer Time. In fact, it is the opposite – permanent British Standard time – that is more likely. In other words, abolishing DST does not mean getting rid of those 4pm sunsets.

Regardless, the science still falls firmly on the abolitionists’ side: biannual time warping is not good for our health. Initially adopted not even for the farmers (as commonly held) but for the war, its use case has long expired.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Euribor today Thursday, March 27, rises slightly to 2,349%, but does not prevent the mortgaged ones who have to renew their mortgage credit this month have ahead of sales that in some cases will reach 1,300 euros a year. The data arrives after a few weeks in which the mortgages looked with concern to the indicator that seemed to ignore the last reduction of the interest rates announced by the European Central Bank (ECB). Now, according to Simone Colombelli, Director of Aiarro Mortgages, the Euribor "experiences a stabilization process" and begins to react to the at its meeting on the 6th. "At the time of that adjustment the Euribor barely flipped himself, but he is doing it now and is rectifying the increases of those days."

This radical change of the Euribor, after a few weeks in which it only climbed, translates into greater peace of mind for the mortgages who renew this month and in greater savings for those who renew and for the new ones looking for the new mortgage. Specifically, who has to make the annual revision of his mortgage loan will have to take into account that in March 2024 the Euribor stood at 3,718%. In this way, in a variable mortgage of 150,000 euros to 30 years, with an interest rate of Euribor plus a differential of 0.99%, the fee drops 109.46 euros each month. But in the event that a semiannual review has to be done, the mortgaged must take into account, the September Euribor data. In savings it is 671.11 euros per month. This also would mean a semiannual reduction of 231.76 euros.

The mortgages who expected the great discounts on the mortgage quotas as it did at the end of 2024 The experts remember that "this indicator experienced very drastic declines a few months ago and, the logical trend, is that little by little it will reduce those falls and maintain a flatter line in the evolution of their monthly average data."

What forecast of the Euribor in March?

The forecast they have in Aiaro is that the "Euribor closes at a value very close to that registered in February (2,407%). The stability in this indicator is what is prevailing right now and we do not believe that there are great changes with respect to what we are seeing these days because there are no market level either." They emphasize that banks are maintaining their stable offers, without great adjustments, and what we expect is that this trend continues for at least a few weeks.

What will the Euribor do in 2025?

What will happen later? Experts point out that "will depend on the decision made by the ECB in April. This body meets in the middle of Holy Week (on the 17th) and, although we believe that it will maintain the official interest rates as they are now (2.5%), if it gives the surprise and reduces them again, the Euribor will be‘ forced ’to continue that road and the bank will also move.

Is it a good time to change the mortgage?

If our situation implies is changing mortgage. Are you interested in launching already? Yes, but with nuances. Sergio Carbajal warns, expert in Hiking Mortgages, which is interesting "as long as the change is of variable to fixed or mixed mortgage, since any offer of a fixed or mixed will be more economical than a mortgage referenced to the Euribor. In the same line, Ricard Garrig Penalty for canceling the mortgage with the Bank of origin, which is usually 0.5% of the pending capital. In December.

Mortgage record month

According to these data, the number of mortgages on homes constituted in Spain in January 2025 stood at 38,058 last January, 18% more than in December 2024 and 11% more than in January of that year, and the average interest rate to which they were formalized fell to 3.08%, a record that was not seen since April 2023. The average interest rate in the new mortgages on homes was 3.08% and the average term in 25 years; constituting 35.8% to variable type and 64.2% to fixed type.

How does the Euribor affect your mortgage?

The Euribor conditions the interests to be returned to the banking entity in variable mortgages and to a lesser extent in mixed mortgages. Its behavior will modify monthly or upward fees. In recent years, the mortgages have suffered monthly increases of up to 600 euros in some cases when the indicator played ceiling. The difference in what is paid in annual or semiannual reviews (they are the most common) of a mortgage depends on the reference index (the Euribor in most cases) and its sum with the differential. The latter is the fixed percentage that is negotiated with the bank.

What is the Euribor?

The Euribor (European acronym for interbank supply) is the interest rate to which the credit entities of the euro zone are purchased and sell the money with each other. That is, it is about the average interest to which the vast majority of European banks are granted short -term loans to, in turn, send that money to both companies and individuals. It began to be used in 1999 and is the index referred to most of the mortgages in Spain.

A key figure in the Championship is being lined up for a top Rugby Football Union (RFU) role, City AM understands.

A key figure in the Championship is being lined up for a top Rugby Football Union (RFU) role, City AM understands.

London Scottish chairman Stephen Pearson is believed to be preparing a bid to become RFU president.

It is not certain whether he will run unopposed but, if successful, will first become junior vice-president and then senior vice-president before ascending to the role of president.

The top job is currently held by Rob Udwin, with Deborah Griffin OBE – the current senior vice-president – set to become the first woman to hold the position when she takes over this year.

Sir Bill Beaumont, who is former World Rugby chairman and interim chairman of the Rugby Football Union, assumed the role of junior vice-president in November.

The role of president is ratified by the RFU Council, of which Pearson is a member, at their AGM before July, and it tends to follow the trodden path of JVP, SVP and then president.

RFU newbie?

It is understood from Championship rugby sources that Pearson is a well-liked figure and his possible elevation to president is seen by some as promising news for England’s second tier, which faces an uncertain future.

Read more Premiership Rugby ringfenced again as Ealing and Coventry fail RFU tests

The news comes as RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney faces a vote of no confidence this evening, to be decided by over 1,000 member clubs.

If CEO Sweeney loses the vote he is not automatically removed, but the writing may very well be on the wall.

A number of clubs have privately told City AM which way they have voted – with postal polling opening two weeks ago – or will vote, with support both for the preservation and removal of Sweeney.

The fiasco was instigated by a £350,000 bonus Sweeney received in the 2023 financial year, in which the RFU lost over £30m.

Sweeney argues he would have got the bonus regardless of the financials due to on-pitch performance, and that the RFU tends to make less money in Rugby World Cup years due to the lack of autumn internationals staged at Twickenham.

Sweeney can be credited, however, with being at the helm while the RFU signed a decade-long commercial deal with insurance giant Allianz to rename their 82,000-seat home in Twickenham. It is believed to be worth £100m to the coffers over 10 years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spring Statement: Watch out for income tax hikes in the autumn

The Spring Statement has done little to reassure markets about the Chancellor’s commitment to fiscal discipline, says Aviva’s Vasileios Gkionakis

The UK government on Wednesday announced cuts in government spending to rebuild ‘fiscal headroom’ after rising government borrowing costs and anaemic economic growth badly damaged its finances.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the mix of cuts in welfare benefits and departmental spending and the indirect effect of higher tax receipts will reduce the government’s total outlays by £14bn by fiscal year 2029/30. That will in turn replenish the so-called headroom to £9.9bn.

The statement was accompanied by news the Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK’s fiscal watchdog, had sliced its 2025 economic growth projection in half to one per cent, although it has increased growth forecasts for subsequent years.

Reeves’s spending cuts come less than five months after her inaugural budget and have essentially been forced upon her by the gilt market, with yields having recently hit their highest level in more than 16 years. Slower growth has also contributed to the worsening outlook for public finances.

Increases in interest rates since October have raised the cost of government borrowing. The OBR expects debt interest spending to total £104.9bn in the current fiscal year. That would represent 8.2 per cent of total public spending and is equivalent to more than 3.7 per cent of national income.

In her October Budget, Reeves had estimated she had £10bn of fiscal headroom but that has been wiped out by rising borrowing costs and a weaker economy. With public sector net debt as a share of economic output at its highest level in more than fifty years, any further rise in bond yields threatens to destabilise the government’s finances.

Read more Chancellor lining up billions in spending cuts as fiscal headroom wiped out

Although Reeves will see her cuts as necessary, they are causing a backlash from some Labour MPs. This means further welfare cuts would be a very hard sell. The chancellor may have to hike income taxes in this autumn’s budget. Alternatively, she might try to alter her fiscal rules, although this is unlikely, as it would most likely be very badly received by the gilt market.

UK government bond yields declined slightly in the aftermath of Reeves’s remarks, although this had less to do with the contents of her speech than news the debt management office expects to issue slightly fewer bonds in the fiscal year to April 2026 than previously anticipated.

Over optimistic?

If the Chancellor’s assumptions turn out to have been too optimistic, the statement arguably has done little to alleviate market concern as to the strength of the UK’s commitment to fiscal discipline.

Despite these cuts, public sector finances remain in a difficult state, not least given sluggish economic growth. After all, the OBR’s downwardly revised economic growth projections still look slightly optimistic. We believe output is likely to expand by closer to 0.9 per cent.

Importantly growth momentum is very weak and hikes in employer taxes will continue to depress employment growth. It is for this reason the Bank of England is likely to cut rates more aggressively than is currently being priced into UK interest rate markets. While inflation is above target and set to rise further, this is largely due to recent rises in utility bills. They are unlikely to lift inflation expectations materially.

Thereafter, the weakness of the economy should ensure inflation begins falling, which will be enough to enable policymakers to begin turning dovish and cutting interest rates.

Premier League clubs will have an extra transfer window to sign players before the Club World Cup

Premier League teams will have two transfer windows this summer to allow those playing in the Club World Cup to make last-minute signings.

The first summer transfer window will be open from 1 June to 10 June, four days before Fifa’s new 32-team competition is due to kick off in the US.

The transfer window is closed for just five days before reopening on 16 June until 1 September. It typically runs from mid-June to the end of August or early September.

Chelsea and Manchester City are the Premier League’s two representatives for the Club World Cup, so could take advantage of the early window.

They could win £97m if they lift the trophy in the MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, on 13 July, organisers Fifa confirmed this week.

Europe is sending 12 clubs, the most of any confederation, including Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain.

One of the four places reserved for clubs from North and Central America and the Caribbean is still to be filled after Club Leon were disqualified for sharing an owner with another Mexican entrant, Pachuca.

Team agree ‘exceptional’ move for Club World Cup

Other sides involved include Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami, Argentinian giants River Plate and Boca Juniors, Brazilian clubs Flamengo, Palmeiras and Botafogo, and Saudi Pro League champions Al Hilal.

The summer transfer dates were agreed by clubs at a meeting of Premier League shareholders in London today.

“Premier League clubs have today agreed the dates for the Summer 2025 Transfer Window,” the league said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reeves ‘lost gamble’ and is likely to raise taxes, IFS claims

Rachel Reeves is doomed to raise taxes in the autumn, the IFS has warned.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is “likely” to raise taxes at this year’s Autumn Budget, Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) director Paul Johnson has warned, as he claimed an extension to income tax thresholds would make for the “easiest political win”.

Reeves’ announced her £40bn tax raid at the last Autumn Budget in October. The bulk of the tax rises, which include increases to employers’ national insurance contributions is set to come into effect from next week.

But Johnson said “big downside risks” may destroy her £9.9bn of headroom within the next six months, leading to fresh tax hikes later this year.

“The easiest political win would be to extend the freezes on national income thresholds,” the IFS director said on Thursday.

“I’m not recommending that as a good policy, but it seems to have come with relatively little political downside.”

The Labour manifesto at the 2024 election said there would be no hike to income tax, national insurance or VAT, making choices more narrow for Reeves.

But Johnson suggested Reeves may have to unveil a major U-turn later this year.

“We don’t know how sacrosanct those promises are,” he said.

“It might be politically very unpopular if she needs to raise really significant amounts – £20bn plus. She’s going to struggle to get a lot from elsewhere.”

The IFS director also suggested the Chancellor should spend less time on “fiscal fine-tuning” and devote more attention to exploring “growth-enhancing policies” such as on planning reform.

“When you’ve got almost no room against your targets, and you’re absolutely set to meet them, then you’re almost inevitably going to have to do this kind of fine-tuning,” Johnson told City AM.

“Rachel Reeves took a gamble in October which was that things would get a little better over time in terms of the forecast. I’m afraid she lost that gamble.

“It feels to me that things will only get worse before they get better.”

He also recognised that the data collection troubles faced by Office for National Statistics (ONS) as well as changing global threats such as President Trump’s tariffs made forecasting harder for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury and the Bank of England.

In a separate event earlier in the day, the left-leaning Resolution Foundation think tank said public spending cuts announced at the Spring Statement had been a “fiscal sticking plaster” that only protected public finances in the short term.

Its research director, James Smith, said that turmoil in the global economy is likely to raise debt interest payments further.

“The effect of higher interest rates on borrowings [will lead to] a £10bn deterioration in borrowing just from that rise in global interest rates,” Smith warned.

Richard Hughes, the OBR’s chair, also appeared at the Resolution Foundation’s event and emphasised that Reeves’ headroom left public finances in a precarious position.

“One of the things we tried to stress is that £10bn [of headroom] is really nothing compared to the risks around the outlook,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Week in Business: Trump’s tariffs add insult to injury after Spring Statement

The Chancellor promised there would be no fireworks in the Spring Statement and, in a way, she delivered on that pledge. No new taxes, no fresh borrowing binge, and some modest cuts to public spending – the details of which had already been released.

So what did we learn? What did the Chancellor actually do?

And has Donald Trump just torpedoed what little chance she ever had of growing the UK economy?

The Chancellor made a serious effort to reinstate the £10bn fiscal headroom that had been wiped out since last Autumn, but the OBR is clear that, given the sensitivity of the UK economy to what happens in America and the EU, we are on a tightrope – and any fresh headwinds could blow us off, wiping out the wafer thin fiscal headroom that the Chancellor so carefully restored yesterday and forcing her to either borrow more or raise taxes in the Autumn.

And those headwinds are already racing over the Atlantic after Donald Trump confirmed his 25 per cent tariff on vehicle imports to the US. The American market accounts for just under 20 per cent of UK auto exports and there’s currently no sign of any special treatment in the Special Relationship.

So, Reeves was right when she said “the world has changed” – the problem is, she’s refusing to change with it. She’s sticking with her damaging tax rises on business and the disastrous Employment Rights Bill which the OBR wasn’t even able to factor into its growth forecasts released yesterday.

As Spring turns to Summer the Chancellor will need a growth miracle to avoid a cold and frosty Autumn.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Investment Fund Permira, one of the main shareholders of the online travel agency Edreams, has sold 7.4 million representative shares of 5.8 % of the share capital to institutional investors, for a total amount of 55.87 million euros, thus reducing its participation in capital to 19.3 %.

Permira had announced yesterday the beginning of an accelerated placement of about 7 million ordinary shares, which represented approximately 5.5 % of its share capital, although it has finally detached from a larger package.

After the announcement of the sale, Edreams has become 17% in stock market to 7.04 euros per title. He closed the day with an 11%setback, up to 7.61 euros. In the last year, the actions of the company directed by Dana Dunne had maintained some stability although with some significant fluctuations: in April 2024 it reached its lowest point (5.9 euros per share) to recover gradually until reaching its peak in February of this year (9.4 euros). In 2025, the deterioration is 9.2%.

The operation was carried out through an accelerated placement to 7.55 euros per share, which represents a 11.9% discount on the closing price of the stock market session on Wednesday (8.57 euros), according to the information sent on Thursday to the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and collecting Europa Press.

Within this transaction, Edreams has repurchased 2,649,006 of its own shares at the same price (7.55 euros per title), disbursing about 20 million euros. This repurchase will impact your sharing repurchase program, announced last November, which will be modified to reduce both the number of titles and the maximum monetary amount.

The sale was carried out on behalf of Luxgoal 2 and Luxgoal 3 - which will maintain 24,611,388 EDREAMS ACTIONS -, investment vehicles linked to funds advised by entities under permira control.

Luxgoal 3 has agreed with Barclays Bank Ireland and Deutsche Bank maintain a blockade of their remaining participation for 90 days, with certain exceptions and the possibility of renunciation by Goldman Sachs, global coordinator of the operation.

Edreams has made it clear that he will not receive income from this sale, since the operation was carried out among institutional investors.

Protesters scale the Royal Exchange, Severance stars join the morning commute and a Treasury typo; catch up on the latest gossip and drama in this week’s edition of The Capitalist

GIVE US SOME RAZZLE DAZZLE

If you want to stop City commuters in their tracks, you’ll need to do a little better than the stunt taking place in the heart of the Square Mile earlier this week, in which two hardhatted protestors from an outfit called Boycott Bloody Insurance could be seen shimmying up an external column of the Royal Exchange. Three further activists stood (a little timidly) in front, holding flags bearing the logos of Axa, Allianz and Aviva with red strikes drawn through for the launch of the group’s latest campaign urging people to boycott insurers with so-called unethical investments.

The Capitalist paused to join the handful of other passersby with enough time on their hands to watch, where reactions ranged from cynicism (“there’s no way they’re going to get to the top”) to underwhelmed – “bit boring isn’t is?” The Capitalist would have to agree, with the climb achieved by a kind of wriggle aided by bands tied around the column. All in all, a little ungainly. A man associated with the group acknowledged the width of the column made it particularly challenging. With protesters practically part of the furniture these days, The Capitalist would urge more showmanship if in want of an audience.

At least they had the Met Police to perform to though, with 12 officers on the scene to take care of the terrifying events. The protesters were later escorted off the scene by police after climbing down themselves, conveniently already clad in their own orange jumpsuits.

SEVERANCE STARS JOIN LONDON COMMUTE

Now a critically acclaimed Apple TV drama exploring the hellscape of the modern office – that’s the sort of thing us rat racers lap up. So could be seen outside City Hall yesterday morning, where commuters were treated to a balloon-filled PR stunt from the cast of Severance, including Adam Scott and Britt Lower. The show, which explores a world in which workers can choose to be ‘severed’ – a procedure which completely separates their work and home lives – offers a dystopian take on the pursuit of the ever illusive ‘work-life balance’. With no memory of their home lives, for the characters’ work selves, every day when they arrive at work, it is as if they never left at all. The Capitalist is sure nobody in the City can relate.

WANTED: TREASURY PROOFREADERS

So keen were ministers to get some good news out ahead of the Spring Statement they appear to have rushed an announcement on affordable homes. The formal Treasury press release boasted a quote from Lloyds Banking boss Charlie Nunn, which including the line (presumably from a Lloyds comms officer, rather than Nunn) “Please could we get confirmation of whether these two quotes will be in the release/will be provided to media separately, so we can let them both know?” Treasury spinners rushed out a new version with the subject “Correction” – which still left the offending comms quote in place. Rachel Reeves wants to trim the civil service; perhaps she should start with Treasury press officers.

INSIDE A TFL THOUGHT SHOWER

What’s in a name? Anglo-Saxon etymology, subgenres of reggae rock and feminist bookshops if you’re TfL, who spent £6m and years of chin scratching to finally settle on the names for the six London Overground lines. The final names – Liberty, Lioness, Mildmay, Suffragette, Weaver and Windrush – were revealed largely to taunts last year, but, thanks to an FOI by London Centric, we now have the full list of names that were under consideration. Spurned ideas included the Saffron line (named for the etymology of Croydon = crocus + valley = saffron, apparently), the Ripple line (to “capture the line’s strong association with water”) and the Rom line (“a geographical nod to the town of Romford”). Reasons cited for rejection included the decision to celebrate groups rather than individuals, the possibility some words could be mistaken for safety-critical words and the risk of other names being abbreviated to slurs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A ‘do nothing’ Spring Statement means Autumn Budget will be a bloodbath

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was “not happy” about the revised figures.

The Chancellor has shied away from tackling the big challenges our economy faces, meaning pressure for tax rises in the Autumn will only increase, says Robert Salter

The autumn budget might be a bloodbath in terms of tax as the government runs out of money and the triple lock could be broken.

As promised, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves made no effort to introduce new taxes in the Spring Statement. Sadly – given the rapidly changing world which the UK economy – and therefore UK taxpayers are now facing, this ‘do nothing’ position from Ms Reeves has left individuals and British business in limbo while they wait for the Autumn Budget.

Although she has talked about introducing various cuts – including the previously announced steps to increase productivity in the Civil Service, it is often very difficult to achieve these improved efficiencies. Ms Reeves may need to increase the government’s borrowing at a time when the cost of debt has become ever more expensive.

While Ms Reeves states that she is taking the difficult decisions to help the UK economy grow and is on the side of working people, the steps she announced in the October Budget achieve the opposite. In particular, the increase in employers’ NICs, which comes into effect from April, will actually undermine economic growth, increase unemployment and push down future wage rises. This is an unwelcome ‘triple tax whammy’ on working people.

Her ideas for tackling tax fraud, which she believes will bring in extra revenue, are the type of thing that every Chancellor in the last 30 years has said they would do. However, it is very difficult to do in a valid way that yields useful returns without significant investment in HMRC staff. HMRC have previously said that a third of their staff are on the National Minimum Wage, so it is no surprise that the performance of HMRC continues to disappoint.

Does Reeves understand the tax system?

Reeves conflated tax avoidance and tax evasion in her speech, using these very different terms interchangeably, which does not instil confidence in her understanding of the UK tax system. This will reinforce concerns that some have raised about her stated plan to ‘force’ HMRC to increase the number of criminal tax fraud enquiries they raise each year by a specific percentage. This raises the risk that taxpayers who make innocent or careless errors could end up in criminal enquiries in the future.

Despite Ms Reeves’s claims that ‘growth, growth, growth’ is at the top of her agenda, it is disappointing that she has done nothing about the restriction on the interest deduction that a corporate group can claim when calculating their Corporation Tax liability. The cap of £2,000,000, introduced under pressure from the EU when UK base rates were 0.25 per cent, is now out of line with interest rates. It is a real barrier to investment in new and major improvements on the buildings on which our economy depends.

Offices, factories and warehouses all need to be fit for the working world of 2025, and reflect not only the way we now work, but also the need to improve energy efficiency. This needs investment, and debt is a major source of investments. If the cost of that debt cannot be claimed, many of these projects are not financially viable, and works will not be started. The net result is a huge drag on the ability of our economy to grow.

Overall, there are real problems with the Chancellor’s plans and she has missed the opportunity to fully prepare the UK economy for the challenges it continues to face.

Unfortunately, her ‘do little’ approach to some key issues will only increase pressure for tax rises in the Autumn budget.

Fintech and insurance firm Acrisure has entered English cricket, striking up a partnership with Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club.

Fintech and insurance firm Acrisure has entered English cricket, striking up a partnership with Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club.

The Michigan-based firm, parent of Nottingham-based Russell Scanlan, will see the Trent Bridge Fox Road stand at the England international level stadium renamed the Acrisure Stand for the next three seasons.

It will add to their sporting portfolio, which includes the naming rights to Pittsburgh Steelers’ NFL stadium in Pennsylvania.

Acrisure also has the naming rights to Thousand Palms’ indoor arena in California, home to the American Hockey League’s Coachella Valley Firebirds.

”We are delighted to welcome Acrisure into our Trent Bridge family,” Nottinghamshire’s chief executive Lisa Pursehouse said. “Having enjoyed a longstanding, mutually beneficial relationship with Russell Scanlan, we’re pleased to be able to strengthen our partnership through their parent company.

“By featuring both as stand sponsor, on the sleeves of The Blaze’s playing shirts, and with aspirations to work alongside the Club to engage with the Nottinghamshire community, Acrisure has shown a real commitment to our sport and our venue and we look forward to working together over the coming years.”

Extended Acrisure deal

The deal will see the firm featured on the sleeves of Nottinghamshire’s women’s team The Blaze’s shirts as well as seeing one of Trent Bridge’s stands named after the firm.

Acrisure will see their branding at Trent Bridge across the County Season but Nottinghamshire’s ground will also open the men’s Test summer as England welcomes Zimbabwe in May.

Trent Bridge will also host a T20 International between England men and South Africa in September and a women’s T20 against India.

Mark McIlquham, Acrisure UK chief, said: “We feel that there’s a strong cultural alignment between NCCC and Acrisure – an international venue, a strong commitment to community outreach and a proactive approach to the development of women’s cricket in the UK.

“Additionally, Russell Scanlan, Nottingham’s longest-established insurance broker – founded in 1881 – is one of Acrisure’s most valued partners, and oldest globally.

“They have had a close supporting relationship with NCCC and Trent Bridge for over 25 years. It seemed wholly appropriate that Acrisure look to expand on that partnership between two heritage brands, build on that shared history, whilst supporting impressive plans for the future of the club and the venue.

“We’re excited for the new season and to be able to promote the sport, the venue and the city.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The landscape is still complicated for H&M. The fashion multinational does not take impulse and its profitability is reduced by half in its first fiscal quarter - compressed between December 1, 2024 and February 28, 2025 -.

Specifically, the Swedish textile giant has registered a benefit of 579 million Swedish crowns, about 53.4 million euros to change, it is 53% less compared to 1,221 million Swedish crowns (112 million in euros) of the same period of 2024, as the multinational has communicated this Thursday.

Sales increased a discreet 3.1% to 55,333 million Swedish crowns. To the change, it is 5,109 million euros compared to 4,954 euros scored a year ago. A billing that the group arrives with 3% less stores.

The billing are somewhat below what was expected by the Bloomberg analysts consensus, which predicted sales of 55,836 million Swedish crowns, about 5.151 to change in euros.

After the announcement of results, the H&M price, falls 1.85% at the start of the day in the Stockholm bag, up to 132 Swedish crowns (12.17 euros) per share.

Its gross margin has fallen 1.7%, to 27,169 million Swedish crowns (2,508 million euros), which represents 49.1% compared to 51.5% of 2024. The current value is also less than predicted by the consensus of analysts, which were waiting for 28,241 million (2,600 euros).

H&M has made Spain a work and digital desert: "People seek a plan B to their future and in this company is not"

"The profitability of the quarter was negatively affected by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors (...) we estimate that the combined negative effect of these factors will be significantly lower already in the second quarter than in the first," explains the company's CEO, Daniel Ervér.

Regarding his store of stores, the manager argues that the optimization continues with the closure of selected stores. "We move on. We enter the quarter with almost 120 less stores compared to the same period last year and we had 40 net store closures during the period." However, the textile group operates 4,213 stores in front of 4,338 a year ago.

The crews participating in this year’s Boat Race have signed Sadiq Khan’s London Rivers’ Pledge after poo in the Thames marred last year’s boat race.

The crews participating in this year’s Boat Race have signed Sadiq Khan’s London Rivers’ Pledge after poo in the Thames marred last year’s rowing regatta.

A number of crew got ill during the preparations for the 2024 Boat Race, held in West London, due to a mix of E. coli, sewage and poo. An Oxford rower said last year: “It would be a lot nicer if there wasn’t as much poo in the water.”

The Mayor of London’s 10-year London Rivers’ Pledge aims to clean up the capital’s waterways.

Khan said: “The annual Boat Race is an iconic event in London, shining a spotlight on the Thames. It’s vital that rowers can train and race on the river safely, and that everyone is able to access and enjoy our waterways

“London’s rivers have been neglected for too long, and I’m pleased to be delivering funding and working with partners on an ambitious plan to clean them up and turn things around.

“We’ve made great progress in cleaning up our air in London, now we plan to do the same with our rivers. Together we can ensure our rivers are safer for all as we continue to build a greener, fairer, better London for everyone.”

Boat Race row

Recurring worries about the quality of the Thames is the latest issue for the Boat Race, which will this year be sponsored by Chanel, after a row erupted between the two universities – Oxford and Cambridge – over the eligibility of a number of competitors.

Cambridge, who have had the upper hand in both the men’s and women’s races in recent years, has seen a number of its rowers disqualified for not doing degrees, instead working towards a Postgraduate Certificate in Education.

An independent interpretation panel, not organisers the Boat Race Company themselves, made the final decision which led to the triple exclusion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Sheridan's Western universe does not stop growing: another Yellowstone spin-off is on the table to facilitate the return of another protagonist of the series.

Last December, we said goodbye to Yellowstone, the acclaimed Taylor Sheridan neo-Western drama. The series touched its end prematurely, because the idea was to continue. Kevin Costner got off the ship and the series lost its main asset and a half to survive. Six episodes served as an epilogue, although they promised to explore other options.

Before Kevin Costner's drama was unleashed within Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan already had several projects, such as 6666, set in the Texan Rancho, or 2024, a project that was going to serve as a sequel to Yellowstone, but which seems to have forced in several series.

Skyshowtime from 4.99 euros per month This platform is one of the best price of the market, and also has a wide catalog of original series and films. Discharge

The Madison, with Michelle Pfeiffer in front, is the first of them and will arrive this 2025 Skyshowtime and Paramount+. There is also the series centered on RIP (Cole Hauser) and Beth (Kelly Reilly), formally announced just at Yellowstone. That without counting another prequel in 1883 and 1923, but set in 1944.

To these projects seems to join another contemporary that will focus on Kayce Dutton and will have procedural cut, in addition to leaving the Paramount+frame.

Kayce Dutton will have his own Yellowstone spin-off

According to Deadline, the CBS has been working with Taylor Sheridan for some time and one of the Seal Team showrunners, Spencer Hudnut, to shape a new series derived from Yellowstone.

It also seems that Luke Grimes, the actor who embodied Kayce Dutton during Yellowstone's five seasons, is willing to put his hat again to resume his role as livestock commissioner. In addition, Kayce's past as Navy Seal fits the previous experience of Spencer Hudnut.

There are still no signed agreements and, as is obvious, no official announcement, so the project may take its own to arrive or, directly, never materialize. To do it, another main star of Yellowstone would remain hot after the end of the original series.

Naturally, in Hobby Cine we will be aware of the options of seeing the light this new spin-off of the Yellowstone universe, in addition to telling you all the details that arise from the other series in emission in Paramount+ and Skyshowtime or in development to arrive soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The price of light today March 27 goes up, but leaves more than seven hours at a price that starts from zero euros and even negative in some sections. On average the price rises to 54.59 euros Megavatio Hora (MWH), according to the data published by the Iberian Electricity Market Operator (OMIE). They are very good news for customers whose contract is linked to the regulated price because throughout the day they can save on the monthly electrical bill more than in other days since from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. the price starts from zero euros and even less. This will be the best time to use the appliances that consume the most, such as the washing machine, to save. This is the price for the hours of the light this Thursday.

The light will rise again

The increase in the cost of the MWH coincides, as usual, with the improvement of time, with the withdrawal of the rains and the wind, which is expected for the next days, whose presence usually reduces the final invoice for the greatest weight in the energy ‘mix’ of renewables such as wind energy, which are cheaper to produce. What will happen for the rest of the month? The foreseeable thing is that in the next days new pricing rebounds are experienced. This could happen to the improvement of time with the withdrawal of the rains and the wind that is expected for the next days, whose presence usually reduces the final invoice due to the greatest weight in the energy ‘mix’ of renewables such as wind energy, which are cheaper to produce.

The appliances that most consume

Thus, it is interesting to remember the appliances that you consume the most to see if it is in our hand to try to use it less or selecting the most economical hours. It will be necessary to provide special to the washing machine, which in addition to trying to use it in cheap hours you can look for short washing or that it will be launched with not very hot water in order to increase savings. The dishwasher is another of the appliances that consume the most from the home, next to the hob plaque.

Why the price of light rises in 2025

During this year the increase in the electrical invoice is due, in addition to the price of each day, that since January VAT has returned to 21% after the end of the extraordinary measures taken to stop the energy crisis. In figures, this has meant an increase in customer invoices in the free market of almost 56 euros per year for an average profile (about 4.6 euros per month). In the regulated market, the tax increase would increase the receipt by about 74 euros, according to data calculated by Kelisto.

How to save on the light bill

The comparator emphasizes that adopting some habits can help in the reduction of the electrical invoice. One of them has to do with identifying the cheapest hours of the day. It can be saved by concentrating the use of the most energy intensive appliances (dishwasher, washing machine, air conditioning ...) in the cheapest schedules. We must also monitor the power we have hired.

Regarding the use of the appliances that consume the most, specifically washing machine or dishwasher, they insist from Kelisto that "it is saved by choosing the programs that work at low temperatures (when heating the water is when they consume more)." Regarding the fridge, it must be taken into account that about 5 degrees for the refrigerator and about -18 degrees for the freezer "are enough." If we can choose where to place this appliance you have to try to flee from heat sources. An advice to save when using the oven is to use its residual heat.

Another advice is to monitor the standby. "The electronic devices that remain plugged in and waiting to consume unnecessary electrifice, since we are not using it," they indicate. We can also adjust the contracted power. Finally, it is an obvious advice, but we don't always do it: turn off the light when you don't need it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spring Statement 2025: Reeves misses trick ignoring sport and Old Trafford

Standing at the dispatch box on Wednesday, Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered her much anticipated Spring Statement.

Just months after her autumn fiscal plan, where she hiked taxes by £40bn and confirmed funding for a football regulator which continues to divide the game, the member of parliament for Leeds West and Pudsey – and one of the most powerful people in the country – returned to the Commons to offer little to the sports sector.

With the UK’s growth forecast downgraded by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) this week, sport could have been the white rabbit to get the chancellor out of a financial hole.

Earlier this year Ineos co-owner and Manchester United shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe called on the government to help finance a “New Trafford” project, which includes a 100,000-seat stadium for the Red Devils and a surrounding redevelopment of commercial and residential property. United cite a study claiming it would generate over £7bn for the economy annually. No11 clearly didn’t agree with the figures.

During the autumn Reeves announced changes to non-domicile status for those who live in the UK but are registered, for tax reasons, overseas. These changes could impact the very best foreign athletes plying their trade in England’s Premier League or Gallagher Premiership. Those reforms weren’t rolled back on today.

And there were no positive announcements about supporting developments at Wimbledon’s All England Club and the London Lions’ planned new basketball arena, or to steamroll NIMBY councillors’ opposition to Rugby Football Union wishes to bring more events to Allianz Stadium in Twickenham.

Lay of the land

Matthew Allen, macroeconomic expert and lecturer in economics at the University of Salford, told City AM: “The omission of financial support for Manchester United’s proposed ‘New Trafford’ stadium in the Spring Statement could be seen as a missed opportunity to bolster the UK’s soft power. Manchester United is a globally recognised brand and a state-of-the-art 100,000-seat stadium could enhance the UK’s international profile in sports and tourism.

“Government backing might have signalled a commitment to leveraging cultural assets for global influence. The proposed stadium is part of a broader plan to revitalise the Old Trafford area, potentially creating approximately 90,000 jobs and significantly boosting the local economy.”

Allen admits, however, that the need to kickstart economic growth must be balanced against public sentiment, adding that some would argue that money should be targeted at essential services.

Housing for many, however, is seen as crucial. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, World Athletics president Lord Coe and former United player Gary Neville all advise on the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force, and, given the Labour mayor’s need to secure housing for the area, it is surprising that the housing provision element of United’s redevelopment was not pushed by the council to the Treasury.

Spring Statement uplands?

Dr Jonathan Carr-West of the Local Government Information Unit concurs, stating that there are some bright spots in the Spring Statement, which could benefit local communities.

“The OBR’s projection that we are on track for 1.3m of the promised 1.5m houses by the end of the parliamentary term is very positive news,” he said. “However, it was not clear how central councils actually are in the Chancellor’s plans for delivery, which is very concerning.”

What is the result, though? Another fiscal event where sport has been overlooked by consecutive governments.

Sheffield Hallam’s Sports Industry Research Centre calculates that the UK sports sector is worth £100bn to the economy. Overlooking it is a mistake.

Reality for Reeves

Shadow sport minister Louie French hit back at Rachel Reeves following the parliamentary statement, insisting the government “missed an open goal” to give sport the support it needed.

“Instead of engaging with sports clubs across the country, the Government continues to knock on increased operating costs and regulations to clubs, from the grassroots to the elite level,” he added.

“With unemployment set to rise and growth forecasts halved this year because of Labour’s budget choices, this Sunday league government needs to wake up quickly to the economic realities facing sports clubs.”

It appears clubs and the wider sport industry will need to wait until the next economic statement for some relief, then.</p>

Heathrow Airport, British Airways Airbus A380 come in to land,

The UK aviation watchdog is to review Heathrow Airport’s financial model after stakeholders raised concerns over how it intends to fund a third runway.

Some of Heathrow’s biggest airlines submitted a request to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in February demanding “an urgent and fundamental review” into the way the airport is regulated amid soaring passenger costs and sub-par service.

In an open letter to stakeholders on Thursday, the CAA said it intended to respond to these requests to “support capacity expansion and protect the interests of consumers.”

The review will explore options to ensure Heathrow’s regulatory model, which has been described as monopolistic, provides “strong incentives for the efficient delivery of the substantial costs involved in expansion.”

It will also “consider the potential impact on the regulated asset base and airport charges,” which have sparked criticism from airlines for being some of the most expensive in the world.

“We will consult widely on these issues and where it is appropriate will work jointly with

the Department for Transport on these matters,” the letter reads.

Heathrow’s long-delayed, highly controversial third runway will be financed entirely by the private sector should it receive planning approval.

The boss of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark, warned in February that any further hikes to landing charges to pay for construction would raise the possibility of legal challenges.

Heathrow has repeatedly clashed with its airlines over the level it sets landing charges, with the dispute previously going all the way to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Airlines say they are being forced to shell out £1.1bn more per year on landing charges than rival European hubs.

Since the third runway returned to the agenda, hotel operators, business travel groups, and the aviation industry’s global trade body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), have joined calls for a re-assessment of Heathrow’s regulatory model.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FTSE 100 retail giant Next passes £1bn profit milestone for the first time

Next has reported pre-tax profit at £1.11bn

Next has joined a small group of UK retail companies in reporting more than £1bn in annual profit.

The high street bellwether told markets this morning that its profit before tax for the year to January 2025 was £1.01bn, up 10.1 per cent year on year.

Its share price rose more than eight per cent in early trades.

It will return £286m of this to shareholders via ordinary dividends – the board proposed a final ordinary dividend of 158p, to be paid on August 1.

Total sales rose by 8.2 per cent to £6.32bn last year, with just under two-thirds of those sales generated in the UK.

Next also upgraded its sales and profit guidance for next year by 6.5 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively. It expects £1.06bn in pre-tax profit in 2026.

Next is well-known for its steady string of solid results, having witnessed a resurgence in recent years. It has upgraded its profit guidance for the last eleven trading updates in a row.

It has adapted to changing post-pandemic retail conditions by shifting its focus from in-store to online and by zeroing in on overseas expansion.

Next said in September that the significant changes that occurred during and after the pandemic have now largely stabilised and that “this year feels like the start of a new phase in the Company’s development.”

“Next has spent seven years changing course and is, for now, clear in its direction of travel,” the company said in today’s trading update.

But as usual, the company was cautious about its results.

“There has been quite a lot of comment, both within and outside the Group, about NEXT passing the £1bn profit mark,” Next said.

“To some it may seem an important milestone, even a cause of celebration. We do

not share that view, not least because profits can go down as well as up. In fact, we think it would be a big mistake to view the Company differently just because it has passed any milestone.

“The pitfalls of being overly impressed with this number are worth discussing, because they go to the heart of what a business is for, and the type of business we strive to be.”

Next’s message for the taxman

Next took the opportunity of its full-year results to speak directly to the government.

“There is, perhaps, also a message here for those who might believe that “big business” is a collection of a few very rich people with “broad shoulders”; shoulders that can afford to take on the burden of paying for excessive regulation and government financing.”

The chief executive of retail giant Next, Lord Wolfson, has previously backed an attempt in the House of Lords to change the planned change to employer’s National Insurance Contributions (NICs) by phasing the tax in rather than having it hit all at once in April.

He has also warned that tax rises announced in the Budget will make it “harder and harder for people to enter the workforce”.

“Corporations are in fact vast networks of collaboration; networks that connect hundreds of thousands of customers, employees and savers – few of whom individually have broad shoulders. We are not saying that businesses should not pay tax – they absolutely should.

“But policymakers should not allow themselves to believe that burdening ‘big’ business does not impact the lives of millions of ‘ordinary’ people: it does – consumers through higher prices, workers through fewer jobs, and savers through lower pension income.”

‘The envy of the retail sector’

Next has consistently managed to buck the gloom in the retail sector, which has suffered from high tax, low footfall, and intense competition.

“Next is the envy of the retail sector,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell said.

“Next is typically a cautious outfit, preferring to under-promise and over-deliver, which makes its latest optimism a surprise given the fragile market backdrop.”

“The foundations have been laid and the strategy is humming along nicely. For Next, being in a strong position means it is better placed than many rivals to cope with market turbulence. The weakest could fall to the wayside, while Next could gain market share,” he added.

Peel Hunt analysts rated the stock a ‘Buy’ with a target price of 11,000p. Next currently trades at 974p.

“There are no big targets or proclamations; instead, Next remains relentlessly focused on the consumer and [capital returns]. With double-digit shareholder returns looking locked in, Next remains a key long-term sector holding for us,” analysts said.

Russell Pointon, Director of content at Edison Group, said: “The results highlight Next’s disciplined approach to stock management, cost control, and its increasingly diversified business model, which includes a thriving third-party brand platform.

“However, Next remains cautious about macroeconomic challenges, particularly the impact of higher interest rates and slowing consumer spending in the UK. Despite these risks, the company’s international expansion and focus on efficiency position it well for sustainable growth. Investors will be looking for further signs of resilience heading into 2025/26 financial year.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a conversation with Leight Henderson, 43 and general director of Hrmanifest in San Antonio. The following text has been edited to be shorter and more clear.

In the United States and in Spain, there are many questions that entrepreneurs cannot do legally during a job interview, but that does not mean they do not.

As someone who worked in human resources for almost 20 years and now directs Hrmanifesto, a community in Tiktok, I have seen this happens. I would say that anyone who has gone through an interview has probably asked him an illegal question at least once.

When this occurs, it is often due to a lack of training by the interviewer. In other cases, they ask these questions intentionally to get the hiring they want. Whatever motivation, these questions are illegal and have no place in a job interview.

Here is five of the most important and what to do if they arise in the conversation:

1. How old are you?

You believe it or not, it is illegal to ask the interviewees: "How old are you?" or "In what year were you born?"

Some interviewers ask these questions because they think you seem young. You can ask you: "Are you old to work?"

These questions can be used to belittle an interviewee, and the interviewer can erroneously associate to seem young with not having experience.

In the case of an older interviewee, he could be asked for fear that he is not able to follow the pace of technology or an accelerated environment, or not to fit a younger business culture.

Now, employers can ask how many years of relevant professional experience has a candidate. Focusing on labor history is a legal and habitual part of hiring. Candidates must feel comfortable sharing their experience in relation to the position.

If you ask you directly for your age, you can redirect the question with elegance saying: "I prefer to focus on my qualifications and the value I contribute to this position. I have x years of experience directly related to this position, including [key skills or relevant achievements]. I will be delighted to explain them in more detail."

Before an interview, you can counteract age discrimination by eliminating your date of birth from your curriculum and the year you graduated.

2. Are you married?

Not only is it illegal to ask about marital status, but interviewers should avoid these types of questions, since they are personal.

An interviewer may wonder if he will really have the candidate what he is worth, assuming he has a spouse who works and can keep him. Or you can fear that the candidate is distracted with issues such as courtships, an important wedding, a honeymoon and, over time, children.

The best answer is to focus the conversation, in an educated, but firm way, on your qualifications. For example: "I prefer to keep my personal life in private, but I would love to talk about how my skills and experience align with the needs of this position." Something like this will establish a limit while maintaining a professional tone.

3. Do you have children?

This question touches my sensitive fiber because they have also asked me in an interview.

An employer can ask this to calibrate how much time someone can dedicate to your work in the office. They may not want to hire someone with commitments outside work.

Other interviewers can try to start a trivial conversation at the beginning of the interview, but you have to be careful. Although it may be easy to commit a slip, it is still illegal, and the trivial talk must stick to neutral issues such as time. As interviewee, it is not illegal for you to offer that information yourself.

4. Where are you from?

Questions like "Where are you from?" "Where is your accent?" "What is your mother tongue?" And "Do you speak English or Spanish at home?" They are prohibited, and there is no reason to ask them.

Sometimes, an entrepreneur can see a difficult name to pronounce and ask for him by establishing a trivial conversation. Once again, trivial conversations are not an excuse. This can be especially delicate, since it may seem a conversation, but it can also become inappropriate if it refers to ethnicity or national origin.

A blunt answer would be: "I am excited about the opportunity to work here and I would love to focus on my professional career, which includes [relevant experience]. I will be happy to answer any questions about how I can contribute to your team."

This redirects conversation while avoiding personal revelations.

5. What religion practices?

Religion is protected. An interviewer cannot ask: "Are you going to church?" Normally, this does not happen to the interviewer.

A candidate could ask the interviewer: "What holidays are covered?" The interviewer can answer about the company's holidays.

If a company gives you any of these questions, it is a great alarm signal. Faced with inappropriate or illegal questions during an interview, the key is to keep calm, professionalism and trust, while gently directed by the conversation towards the qualifications and value of the candidate.

If the questions become persistent, uncomfortable or discriminatory, candidates must document the incident and consider whether they must report it to human resources, climb it within the company or denounce before the Labor Inspection.

In short, what matters are the skills, experience and qualifications of the candidate, not personal details that have nothing to do with their ability to perform work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After losing IOC election, how about Seb Coe for chair of football regulator?

Seb Coe missed out iun the IOC election, but could he chair the football regulator?

It was, with hindsight, not a “keep Seb Coe out” but a “get Kirsty Coventry in” campaign that determined the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidential election outcome.

I was as guilty as most British observers in believing that Seb Coe would take it to the wire. Unconscious bias and all that.

In the event, eight votes and a distant third place ranks just above the Football Association’s humiliation in mustering only two votes to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup and, most years, the UK’s scores at the Eurovision Song Contest.

Coe was a board member of the FA bid that attracted such derisory support back in 2010. The subsequent inquests had many missteps to pick over – not least the gift of handbags to voters which was whipped into a storm by one indignant recipient. England a two-faced, holier-than-though nation?

Away from the specifics, there was much breast-beating speculation as to whether there was something about the Brits that engendered deep-seated resistance when it came to bid processes in sport. A hangover of Empire or reaction to the presumption that comes with our “universal” language? There was a sense the world was against us. Nonsense, obviously.

It was – and still is – an irony that Coe led Britain’s victory in securing the hosting of London 2012. But that success back in 2005 soon became cited as the exception that proved a rule.

UK Sport, its resources boosted by government on the back of the Olympic bid, has invested consistently in an “international influence” programme ever since. Its aim is to improve the chances of Brits securing high sporting office, and of Britain hosting major events. The conundrum of global attitudes towards the UK and its sporting leaders is much debated.

Coe’s IOC campaign will have received UK Sport backing. His surprising (to British eyes) share of the vote will doubtless prompt renewed introspection within the agency about nationality. Those handling the inquest at UKS will do well to resist the temptation to view the IOC result as either a reaction to Coe’s Britishness or evidence of a well-orchestrated plot to block him.

If anyone should be bitter at outgoing president Thomas Bach’s ill-concealed favouring of victor Kirsty Coventry over the past few months, it is runner-up Juan Antonio Samaranch who mustered 28 votes to Coventry’s 49.

Like the Zimbabwean swimmer-turned-sports minister, Samaranch has done his time at the IOC. He’s been a member since 2001, whereas Coe has been in the gang for just four years. Still only 41 years old, Coventry has already served since 2013.

Those on the ground report that Coe’s team thought their man had 26 votes in the bag on the eve of the election. Rival camps had him at 20. Them’s the breaks.

Outsiders may criticise the IOC with apparent good cause – I do – but it is easy to understand why those inside the club believe it well placed to ride out the obvious challenges ahead of it. Change, given that mindset, will be organic and incremental.

Four years inside the tent is no time at all for an organisation that has had just nine presidents in 130 years. Not when there are no overt crises – or at least no issues that the leadership would admit to being worthy of that label.

Coe’s nationality was less important, then, than his clubbability, or lack thereof in IOC circles. There are, of course, Brits in sport quietly pleased with his defeat last week. Such is the territory for any politician, sporting or otherwise. He did not get where he is today… etc.

UK Sport’s analysis will doubtless conclude that, for the very highest offices, the race is very much an ultra-marathon not a middle-distance dust-up.

“The result is a demonstration of good governance,” Thomas Bach said. Added IOC member Dick Pound: “[It] makes the Vatican conclave look like it’s open house.” Pound is described by the IOC itself as “likely the most influential member who never succeeded to the presidency.”

One week on, I reckon Coe taking time out to appear at the unveiling of Manchester United’s new stadium plans a mere 10 days before the IOC election should have told us that, deep down, he was resigned to losing out.

Had there been any votes that could have been swung with an extra day of canvassing, surely Jim Ratcliffe would have given him a pass to skip the trip.

Coe’s chairing of the stadium taskforce might give us a clue as to his future, Chelsea FC fan or not. With just two years left at the helm of World Athletics, his other roles such as this take on greater significance.

These include a seat on the board of the new National Lottery operator as its senior independent director. A reactivation of his relationship with Nike, on ice while at World Athletics, is surely on the cards. The LA 28 Olympics organisers may well sign him up as an ambassador too.

Interviewed about the planned replacement of Old Trafford, Coe cited the project’s cross-party political support. Although a Conservative peer, he has long been able to skate across the political spectrum in the interests of sport.

If he has had his fill of international governance, perhaps the chair of the Independent Football Regulator might be passed under Coe’s nose. He’s no more conflicted within football than other names recently cited as having made the government’s short list.

The history of such processes shows that they are often halted and restarted so that a favoured candidate can be shooed in.

Would Coe be acceptable to the majority of football fans as chair of the IFR? Of course not, but you can be sure that absolutely no-one would be. It’s whether he would be acceptable to No10 that matters.

And there’s probably only one person’s vote needed to bag that post – definitely doable, even if that single voter is a Gooner.

Art for art’s sake

I was introduced to the concept of art anxiety by a friend last week. Not the well-recognised anxiety of artists struggling either to complete their work or to accept its validity. Nor the anxiety of those overwhelmed by artistic beauty (Stendhal syndrome).

Instead, the anxiety engendered by lists of films to watch, TV series to binge, art to see, music to hear, that grow longer and longer in the notes on your phone, accompanied by the realisation that life is too short to experience all the art you feel you should.

“I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence… Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty… I had palpitations of the heart… Life was drained from me… I walked with the fear of falling.” Stendahl, 1817

There is a read across to sport, although given its vagaries there are some events that are on my list but may never happen, let alone with me there as witness. In particular, a first ever cup triumph for my favourite team (frankly, any cup will do given my shrinking football-watching life expectancy).

The diversity of art far outstrips that of sport. It’s relatively easy to get a taste of each of the latter’s formats. I’ve only a few left to tick (of those that appeal to me). But sporting geniuses are a different matter. The likes of Bolt, Gascoigne, Williams, Ballesteros, Mauger and Stokes stand tall in my memory.

Every year and every season throw up new talents that can only truly be appreciated in the flesh. So many shining stars, so little time. I can feel the palpitations again…

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European manufacturers have already submitted their 2024 accounts and we can say without any doubt that everyone has signed a year for oblivion. Some problems that will drag in 2025.

All traditional brands have seen how their benefits fell because of several factors. However, something that has hit all of them is the low demand for cars in China and the strong impulse of Chinese brands, where Byd has led, even, above the Almighty Tesla.

Specifically, Byd has registered an annual sales record, selling 1.76 million electric cars in 2024, according to the figures published on Wednesday. In general, China has sold almost 2.5 million vehicles, adding pure electric and hybrids.

However, the problems derived from the demand and competence that comes from China has not been the only thing that has hurt traditional manufacturers. Electric cars are still their worst nightmare.

Sales of electric vehicles have also stagnated in 2024. According to the latest data provided by the European Association of Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA), in the first eleven months of the year, the European Union exceeds nine million tourism enrollments, falling 1.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.

With these data on the table, it can be said that sales have suffered a new brake in its recovery process. And more if we compare them with the figures that the sector had five years ago when, at the end of September, the same employer presumed from sales of 11.7 million cars - 3.7 million more than those sold at this point of the year -, which continued to rise up to 15 million at the end of 2019, a year prior to the burst of the COVID.

New cars are a luxury article but, more than before?

In fact, this is something that has caused a lot of concern to brands, since, for the moment, all its investment to make the leap to mobility is not being profitable. In addition, all closing the year with Damocles' back of the Coffee regulations on them.

Until just a few weeks ago, the European Union was very clear that all those manufacturers whose maximum average of the set of the models sold exceeded 93.6 grams per kilometer would be sanctioned. Specifically, fines were shuffled up to 15,000 million euros.

Luckily, Brussels has decided to reverse, because they only comply with this new regulations, the builders that exclusively manufacture electric cars or those that have made them and the plug -in hybrids are a majority in their enrollments.

This fine would have been a very strong wands for European car brands.

Sales resist, but profit margins collapse

The first who raided the way for annual results presentations were Ford, Renault and Mercedes. The French brand lost more than 60% of its benefit, until obtaining net profits of 752 million euros. One of the reasons was the deterioration of his participation in Nissan, which made him lose 2,000 million.

In fact, analyzing the data, if there was no participation in Nissan and all its consequences, the net result of Renault would have promoted to 2.8 billion euros compared to 2.3 billion euros in 2023. Perhaps it is for that reason that the brand capitaneada by Luca de Meo is working to sell its participation in Nissan, which currently amounts to 35.71% of the capital of the Japanese manufacturer.

However, Renault sales in 2024 have been very positive, increasing 7.4% compared to 2023, to 56.2 billion euros.

The same fate ran Mercedes. The German announced a profits of 10,409 million euros in 2024, 28.4% less than in 2023. Among the reasons it accuses for this decrease is its delicate situation in China, where sales have collapsed.

The billing of Mercedes-Benz stood at 145.6 billion euros, which represents 4.5% less than the previous year, and its operational result (EBITDA), at 13,599 million, 30.8% below.

"Mercedes-Benz has obtained solid results in a very complicated environment thanks to a range of exceptional products and a strict cost discipline," said Ola Kaellenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, at the press conference after the presentation of results.

"To guarantee the future competitiveness of the company in an increasingly uncertain world, we are taking measures so that the company is more efficient, faster and stronger, while preparing an intense product launch campaign for several new vehicles," he added.

Among these measures is a new downward review of its forecasts, which adds to those already made between last year and the beginning of this. In this way, Mercedes awaits a sales growth of between 6% and 8% in its tourism division, below 8.1% of 2024. In addition, it plans to cut costs.

For its part, Ford is the only one who has managed to save the furniture. The American origin brand closed 2024 with an increase in the net benefits of 35.2%, to 5,879 million dollars (about 5,659 million euros) and revenues of 184,992 million, the highest in its history. In addition, he sold 4.4 million vehicles.

The net exploitation result in 2024 stood at 10.2 billion dollars (9,845 million euros), 0.2% less than in the previous year.

In addition, Ford said that, in the last quarter, its income increased by 5%, to 48.2 billion dollars, above the 43,000 million that analysts had predicted. The net profit grew to 1.8 billion, with an increase in sales of 3%, to 1,188,000 vehicles.

However, not everything has been positive for Ford. Specifically, its electric cars business has registered losses of 5.5 billion dollars (5.3 billion euros), a figure very similar to the previous year. This confirms the serious difficulties in reducing costs in battery -driven models. Something that does not believe that it will improve in 2025, since it predicts a global profitability lower than last year.

Ford losses in the electric cars segment include significant investments in future models, as well as an increase in volume and a cost cut of 1.4 billion dollars (1,350 million euros), according to Sherry House, new Ford financial director.

However, Ford has been an oasis in the desert. The next one that presented results was Stellantis, which closed 2024 with a benefit of 5,520 million euros, which represents a 70%drop. In addition to the crisis that plagues the rest of brands, the departure of Tavares in December has also disrupted the company at the economic level.

The income also fell by 17%, up to 157,000 million, because it has lost sales share in all its markets. Specifically, turnover in Europe was reduced by 11%, up to 59,010 million, while in North America the adjustment was 27%, with 63,350 million.

The group is immersed in a transition plan, or shock, with which it seeks more efficiency and centralize efforts in certain releases, something necessary if you want to lift the business. The profit margin also fell to 5.5%, with a collapse from 12.8% of 2023.

The adjusted operational benefit was also contracted, 64%, up to 8,650 million. And the cash flow was negative, in about 6,000 million, for lower income and the highest expense for production adjustments.

Volkswagen showed in the same line, that its economic results only reflected even more the difficult situation they are going through. The German closed the year with benefits of 10,721 million euros, 32.8% less than the previous year.

The billing of the German giant, however, remained 0.7% above the one registered in 2023, to 324,656 million, while its operational margin after taxes fell from 5.5% to 3.8%.

Remember that Volkswagen, after many negotiations with the unions, reached the agreement that they would cut their workforce in 35,000 people and decrease their production capacity by 734,000 vehicles annually until 2030.

As for their sales, these fell 2.3%, to 9,027 million units, including tourism and commercial vehicles. The main sales problem of the group is its weak Chinese demand, which are being taken by local brands. In fact, only in China they stopped selling 307,000 units.

More luck has had the Spanish brand of the group, Seat, which has managed to endure the pull. The truth is that the Seat and Cupra binomial came out in 2024, since they had a positive net result, from 625 million in 2023 to 633 million euros, 1.28% more.

Seat and Cupra managed to market 637,000 vehicles in the year, 5.8% more than in 2023. Both brands contributed to the group a turnover that amounted to 14,530 million euros, showing a slight increase of 1.37% compared to the 14.3 billion they presented in 2023. The Operational Margin of Seat and Cupra remained at 4.36%.

The last European brand that presented its results was BMW, which also closed to losses. BMW's net benefits collapsed more than a third in 2024, due to the "continuous weakness of demand in the Chinese market."

Specifically, the manufacturer has closed the year with a fall in the net benefit of 36.9% per year, to 7,680 million euros. A figure that London Stock Exchange analysts had already predicted. On the other hand, group billing has also been reduced to 142,380 million euros, that is, a 8.4% drop compared to 2023.

BMW's deliveries were around 2.45 million units last year, slightly below 2.55 million 2023. The company largely attributed the descent to the stops of deliveries related to a defective braking system supplied by Continental, which last year led the automobile manufacturer to reduce its perspectives for the whole year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Spring Statement takes us back to square one

It might not have been a Budget, but the Chancellor may well wish that it had been. Constrained by her fiscal rules and her own insistence that yesterday’s statement would not constitute a major event, Rachel Reeves was left shuffling the few cards she held in search of a better hand.

The search was in vain.

Despite deploying the kind of rhetoric normally associated with a full-fat fiscal event, by the time the Chancellor sat down it was hard to see what had changed. It’s true that relatively modest policy changes (such as a few billion shaved off a welfare budget that’s expected to reach £70bn by 2030) will have political ramifications for Labour, and it’s also true that the government does appear to be moving the dial on house building, contributing to future growth.

But when it comes to the bigger picture, just consider a few sobering facts.

Public spending as a percentage of GDP will still be higher in the years ahead than at any time since 2010 (having been on a downward trajectory, until the pandemic hit) and the OBR made clear yesterday that public sector net borrowing will still be £8bn higher, on average, over the next five years than was forecast last Autumn. Public sector net debt will also come in around £30bn higher by 2030 than was predicted at the time of the last Budget, due to additional borrowing. The fiscal watchdog also said that growth in output between 2023 and 2029 will now be half a percentage point lower than in October’s forecast and the level of trend productivity will be more than one per cent lower by the end of that period. Economic growth will be a pathetic one per cent this year, and is not forecast to hit even two per cent ahead of the end of this decade.

That’s the backdrop against which the Chancellor made considerable effort to reinstate a modest £10bn of fiscal headroom, which had been wiped out by low growth and high borrowing costs since last October. She’s put us back to square one.

If £10bn wasn’t enough room six months ago, it’s unlikely to prove sufficient for the next six months, either. Indeed, the OBR says that, given the state of our domestic economy – and global uncertainty – it won’t take much to turn that surplus into a deficit. And how would Reeves manoeuvre herself back within her fiscal rules? The smart money’s on tax rises.</p>

What was your first job?

At 16, my first job was cold-calling for a double-glazing window company, generating leads for the experienced salesmen to close. It was a crash course in resilience – learning how to handle rejection and keep people on the line long enough to make my pitch. Later, I took another cold-calling role for bookmakers, which sharpened my ability to read people over the phone and make a sale.

What was your first role in the City?

After university, where I studied economics, my first proper role was in investment management. I spent my early days learning the ropes – drowning in spreadsheets, understanding global markets and trying to make sense of money management. It was intense and the perfect training ground for what came next.

When did you know you wanted to build a career in fintech?

The moment I realised that technology could level the playing field in financial services. The industry had relied on outdated processes and unreliable technology for too long, creating unnecessary complexity and a suboptimal experience.

With Fundment, the mission has always been to make wealth management smarter, more accessible and more human. Advisers and investors shouldn’t have to navigate clunky systems or outdated platforms – technology should empower them, not slow them down. Being part of that shift and helping drive real change is what makes this journey so rewarding.

What’s one thing you love about the City of London?

The energy. I’ve always loved its unique blend of history and high finance. One moment, you’re walking past a 17th-century church; the next, you’re stepping into a glass tower. It’s where tradition and ambition collide in a way you don’t find anywhere else.

And one thing you would change?

The City is well connected, but navigating within it isn’t always easy. More pedestrian-friendly areas and smarter transport options would make a real difference.

What’s been your most memorable business lunch?

A lunch where our collaboration was essentially agreed before the starters arrived. The conversation flowed so well that, by the time we got to the main course, we were already discussing next steps rather than negotiations. It’s always a good sign when the food takes a backseat to the ideas – it means something bigger is happening at the table. Either that, or I have an uncanny ability to pick restaurants where nobody remembers what they ate.

And any business faux pas?

I once scheduled two important meetings at the same time and only realised when both calls rang in simultaneously. For a moment, I just stared at my screen, weighing my options. In the end, I picked one, joined the other late, and perfected the art of the strategic apology.

What’s been your proudest moment?

Seeing the impact of our work in fintech – helping advisers and clients benefit from technology that genuinely makes their lives easier. The moment you hear someone say ‘This changed the way I do business’, you know you’re doing something right.

And who do you look up to?

I admire people who build things that outlast them. Jeff Bezos for his relentless focus on customers, Steve Jobs for redefining innovation, Muhammad Ali for unshakable self-belief and Winston Churchill for resilience and perseverance.

But beyond the big names, I have the deepest respect for the unsung entrepreneurs – the ones who turn an idea into something real against the odds, without fanfare but with sheer determination.

What’s the best business advice you’ve ever been given?

Never get too comfortable. The moment you think you’ve ‘made it’ is the moment you stop growing.

And the worst?

“Just follow your passion.” Passion is great but, without discipline, strategy and a willingness to adapt, it won’t take you very far.

Are you optimistic for the year ahead?

Cautiously so. The industry is evolving, challenges remain, but there’s incredible innovation happening. The key is staying adaptable – those who do will thrive.

We’re going for lunch, and you’re picking – where are we going?

Somewhere lively with great food but no pretentiousness – probably a classic steakhouse or a hidden gem with a buzzing atmosphere.

And if we’re grabbing a drink after work?

A speakeasy-style bar with good whisky – low lighting, well-crafted cocktails, and an Old Fashioned that actually does the name justice.

Where’s home during the week?

London.

And where might we find you at the weekend?

If I’m not at the Emirates watching Arsenal, I’m probably travelling, finding a new restaurant to try or taking my classic car out for a drive.

You’ve got a well-deserved two weeks off. Where are you going and who with?

Somewhere warm, with the right mix of adventure and relaxation – either unwinding in the Caribbean or a road trip through the American West. Good company is key, so I’d go with close friends or family.</p>

ChatGPT will make you dumber – if you use it incorrectly. Lewis Z Liu outlines how to use the tech to make you more intelligent, not less

I’m writing this column just after visiting the Taj Mahal in India this past weekend. The experience, far more powerful in person than in photographs, stands as one of the most magnificent manifestations of human genius.

Unfortunately, the human species appears to be becoming “dumber”; or at least, our demonstrated mental faculties have been steadily declining worldwide since around 2012. Metrics around cognitive challenges, reading skills and quantitative skills have all worsened precipitously across the world. This decline aligns closely with the rapid rise of smartphone usage (2012 marked the year when global smartphone adoption surpassed 50 per cent), reduced engagement with reading and growing information overload, including from social media.

More concerning, however, is that this assessment doesn’t yet factor in the accelerating role of AI, which, based on current trajectories, will most certainly exacerbate this decline, negatively impacting human creativity and productivity. This raises a critical question: how can we leverage AI to enhance our cognitive abilities rather than diminish them?

Did calculators make us worse at maths?

When dining out, my companions often turn to me at the end of the meal, expecting that my “PhD in Physics from Oxford” qualifies me to quickly split the bill. Ironically, and to their surprise, I’m usually the worst in the group at performing long division mentally. Instead, I promptly use my iPhone’s calculator app. In fact, most mathematicians and physicists I know struggle with basic arithmetic; our expertise lies primarily in dealing with complex differential equations, analysing prime number distributions or exploring similarly abstract concepts.

Yet I vividly recall, as a diligent child of Chinese immigrants, repeatedly working through countless Kumon math exercises until I had memorized all the arithmetic combinations, only to eventually forget them. What endured from that rigorous drilling wasn’t the rote memorization, but a deeper understanding of arithmetic’s underlying patterns and the relationships between numbers. In fact, if you ask most physicists or mathematicians to explain something as seemingly simple as long division, you’ll likely end up in an hours-long conversation about the intricacies of number theory or calculus.

One of the remarkable aspects of mathematics is its layered structure, building logically from one concept to the next. Counting progresses naturally into arithmetic, arithmetic into algebra, algebra into geometry, geometry into trigonometry, then calculus, enhanced by linear algebra, ultimately leading to the fundamental principles underpinning neural networks – the foundation of the very LLMs we use today. Indeed, I can trace a direct connection from my current understanding of LLMs back to counting on my fingers, even recalling specific pages from textbooks or particular math classes where each of these concepts first clicked for me.

The existence of tools such as calculators, Excel and computer-based mathematical simulations doesn’t diminish my mathematical knowledge or abilities. Instead, these tools enhance my capabilities, freeing me to explore new frontiers by eliminating the burden of repetitive calculations.

How can we use ChatGPT to make us smarter?

Now let’s consider LLMs, specifically chatbot interfaces themselves, rather than the wide range of applications built upon them. Unlike math, language is deeply intertwined with our notions of consciousness, making it challenging to construct a clear, hierarchical “technology tree” similar to mathematics. Consequently, it’s less clear precisely how to integrate LLMs effectively into writing, analysis or tasks like creating presentations. Should LLMs help structure initial thoughts, or are they better suited to refining content at the end? Or perhaps the steps in between?

Last week, I was jamming on the latest GPT 4.5 with Ajay Agrawal, the founder and CEO of Sirion (the company that acquired mine), and he said something that struck me as profoundly insightful: “ChatGPT is like Socrates, if you have a sharp mind, it is immensely powerful. If not, then it is utter garbage.” In many ways, it’s just a tool, like a calculator. If you don’t understand the broader problem you’re trying to solve, punching in square roots or subtraction sequences is meaningless. But if you have a clear grasp of the underlying issue, a calculator, Excel or other computational tools can save you hours, or even millennia, of human effort.

What this means is that, regardless of whether we use LLMs or not, the human mind must remain sharp, logical and focused, just as it must when using a calculator. Just as my Kumon long division drills helped build mathematical intuition, consistent, thoughtful writing without the aid of LLMs together with genuine introspective thinking from childhood through adulthood is essential for training and strengthening the mind.

Don’t let ChatGPT make you lazy

This has significant implications for educators and for parents like me. As a society, we have a choice: we can take the lazy route and allow unchecked use of LLMs in our children’s education, almost certainly accelerating the decline of our collective cognitive abilities. Or we can adopt a more deliberate, structured approach, much like we did with calculators. Just as we wait until students fully grasp arithmetic before handing them a calculator, we should ensure children first learn to write, read, reason and debate without relying on AI.

My boys, aged six and seven, still do math worksheets the old-fashioned way and write out their thoughts by hand. I expect them to keep doing so for years. Only once they’ve built a solid intellectual foundation should tools like LLMs enter the picture: not to think for them, but to amplify a mind already trained to think clearly on its own.

Standing before the Taj Mahal, a monument of astonishing architectural beauty, immense craftsmanship and mathematical precision, I was struck by what it represented: human intellect, love and physical creation fused into something transcendent. Its chief architect, Ahmad Ma’mar Lahori, worked without 3D modelling software, without AI, without modern machinery. He didn’t lack tools because he mastered fundamentals. Had he lived today, I’m convinced he would have used AI not as a crutch, but as a multiplier, perhaps to build something even grander, even more magnificent. That’s the mindset we need. That’s the point: LLMs should serve to expand human ingenuity, not replace it. We must not let laziness allow these tools to diminish what makes us human.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"There is no bluf, on the contrary. Artificial intelligence is exploiting."

Mercedes Oblanca is clear that artificial intelligence (AI) is not a passing fad. Although in Spain the level of deployment is low - with the exception of large companies - is on everyone's lips. And everyone looks next to you for fear of being left behind.

Accenture, the consultant who presides over and directs Oblanca, has been in Spain for 60 years. In this period, he has accompanied the private sector - 83% of Ibex 35 companies are their clients - and the administration on their way to modernization, digitalization and internationalization. Now, seek to do so in the transition to the new world that defines AI.

"In an economic context with a rhythm of vertiginous change, with uncertainties of all kinds and disruption, it is necessary to generate resilient environments and businesses that grow. And AI is a catalyst of change," says the president of Accenture in Spain and Portugal.

Its objective is to help Spanish companies in their reinvention towards "more resilient, efficient companies that develop experiences and business models within a cybersagidery digital nucleus and with a prepared workforce." In figures, adopting the generative AI on a scale in Europe can generate 2.3 billion euros of additional economic value in 15 years.

The directive, which argues that "artificial intelligence is only intelligent and useful if it accesses the data, experience and culture of a company," defends a triangle with business, AI and talent as vertices. With special emphasis on the last: "Training can be the brake."

The consultant already works in this process with clients such as Repsol, which two years ago defined her AI strategy, but aspires to print faster speed. A new paradigm that redefines not only the business of its customers, but also yours.

According to its calculations, artificial intelligence can generate an additional 50% to the Professional and Consulting Services market. And offers an capacity to improve its activities of 60%.

"The data is enriched with AI and this is put at the service of employees, which allows us to create more tangible value for the client," he explains. Hence, the traditional collection model for its services is obsolete: "We begin to work on the possibility that the services are not cited on the basis of hours or professionals, but also for the value delivered (time, budget ...)".

Reinforcement in defense and commitment to diversity and inclusion

Accenture, who in February 2023 announced that it would invest 3,000 million dollars (2,790 million euros) in artificial intelligence, employs 3,000 people in this area in Spain and has doubled its business in this area.

Within the framework of its strategy, it has made 25 acquisitions since 2012 - three in the last year and a half - to reinforce in data, cloud or cybersecurity: "We integrate capacities that are advanced to the needs of the clients," says Oblanca. In the next six months, there will be no more purchases.

The door is open to adding talent in defense: "It is fundamental, with technology and cybersecurity; they will play a key role and there we will be to support both the public and private sector. We are defining our strategy at European level and also each subsidiary, aligned with the country."

In fiscal year 2024, completed in August, Accenture billed 1,791 million euros in Spain, 2.4% more. It is the most growing market in Europe. 55% come from the consulting business, compared to 45% of managed services (outsourcing or outsourcing). In the latter, it is where AI is generating a relevant impact.

"That relationship between both areas remains constant over the years because it reflects that the consultancy is transformed and the value promised to customers is delivered," says Oblanca, which leads Spain and Portugal since September 2023.

With more than 18,000 employees in Spain and advanced innovation centers in Madrid, Barcelona, ​​Málaga and Bilbao, Accenture will continue to comply with the Spanish norms regarding the recommended percentages of the presence of women in the templates and executive bodies, in contrast to the replacement of many US companies in their diversity and inclusion policies after the return to the US government of Donald Trump.

At present, 43.6% of the workforce are women and, among the partners, they are 30%. "We will continue to promote our values," says Oblanca.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Mark Cuban, there are certain parts of the narrative that are intrinsically human.

"Artificial intelligence can propose a million things in a second, but then someone has to review them and decide what their money will invest," said this American businessman during the recording of an episode of the Pódcast YMH.

People who dedicate themselves to creativity are especially concerned with the possibility of companies using AI to eliminate humans from the creative process in an effort to reduce costs. Some actors are already being forced to accept jobs that lead to feed the models that one day could be used to replace them.

The America writers union (WGA), together with the American actors union, the SAG-AFTRA, paralyzed Hollywood in 2023, when they convened a joint strike, in part to reinforce the protections of its members against the "existential threat" that artificial intelligence supposed.

Despite these concerns, Cuban considers that AI alone is not enough to produce viable work.

"Artificial intelligence does not go to, you know, fill your bank account and produce a movie for you, produce a podcast or whatever," said this billionaire when asked about the subject.

In a conversation held through email about these issues, Cuban has indicated Business Insider that, despite the skill that has already been shown to have, AI should not have the last word in the creative process.

"I think artificial intelligence is only one more creative tool," Cuban explained to this media. "It's like a writing or creative partner, but not a responsible for decision making."

The United States tycoon, who owned the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA and is currently owner of the film and entertainment company 2929 Entertainment, pointed out that the success of a creative product often depends on the instinct, which cannot be replicated by a machine.

"There is a reason why some people succeed after success, regardless of whether it is music, books, poetry, movies or television," said Cuban. "They have an idea of ​​what the public wants at that time."

If organizations use AI to try to stop their way to box office successes, their situation will not be different from attempts to apply reverse engineering to success through metrics, this expert has defended, which expects the first to fail as it did the second.

"I have seen companies that use analysis to determine what a record or record seal must launch, fail again and again," Cuban said. "It is the same as using artificial intelligence to replace everyone. It can be a novelty, but it will not work."

The correct way to see this technology, according to this entrepreneur, is like an incredibly efficient time savings, not as a generalized substitute for human talent.

"It is part of the natural progression of the CGI drawing and now from the text to the video, with new tools that arrive to take it even further," as he has declared to this means of communication. "However, the underlying ability that any creative needs is to be able to create for its audience. AI cannot replace that feeling."

Veterans creatives, those who are able to take advantage of the power of artificial intelligence to improve their own performance, will continue to obtain important benefits, Cuban has defended, who hopes that "the best are even better", offering them the possibility of making "rapid storyboards" and "creating tests" more quickly, among other things.

"I understand why there is fear. I understand the discomfort of AI," said the billionaire. "People have spent decades learning [to use] the best technology and now they will have to learn much more. And with the rapid change. You have to be up to date, but, like all previous technologies, it will be worth it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the last six years, the technology company Dataiku, specialized in artificial intelligence (AI) for companies, has organized a “study trip” for the executives of its client base.

In September, several CEO attended the event at the Boston Four Seasons hotel seemed restless. The AI ​​was gaining ground in the business world and many wondered if they had the right strategy to take advantage of their potential.

Dataiku's CEO, Florian Douetteau, has shared with Business Insider some of the notes he took during the event.

Douetteau reported his conversation with a CEO that expressed concern: "Openai is our brain, but tomorrow Google or any other company could launch something new. If we bet everything for GPT Enterprise or Co -pilot, we will be trapped in a single ecosystem. I don't want that!".

Another manager commented: "If we cannot completely customize AI or govern it to adapt it to our needs, it is as if we were letting another company decide how our business should work. That is a level of risk with which I do not feel comfortable."

Among the more than 120 executives who attended the event, Douetteau received "some stress" on how to transform the "broad concept of AI" into concrete business benefits.

Dataiku, which helps companies manage data, create AI applications and display automatic learning models, wanted to deepen how CEO perceives the transformation of work into the era of artificial intelligence.

A few days ago, the company published the results of a study conducted by The Harris Poll to more than 500 CEO from the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and France.

All of them direct companies with more than 500 million dollars (465 million euros) in annual revenues and more than 500 employees. A quarter of companies are technological and the rest, what Dataiku calls "non -technical."

Dataiku had special interest in analyzing how the non -technological companies face the AI, since they represent most of their client base.

In the survey, 74% of the CEO acknowledged that, if it does not get significant advances promoted by AI, it could lose its position in the next two years. And 94% said that an AI agent could offer better strategic tips than a human member of the Board of Directors.

The AI ​​has also increased the concern of the managers for the competition.

More than 70% believe that, before the end of 2025, some CEO could be dismissed by a failed artificial intelligence strategy. In addition, 54% consider that a competitor has already implemented a more advanced the AI ​​strategy.

One of the main risks that Dataiku identified in his report is what he calls the "trap of the merchandise", that is, the belief that the agents of the pre -designed "are ready to use" are as effective as those developed to measure for the key operations and the specific sectors of a company.

IA governance is also a reason for concern for CEOs: 94% suspect that their employees are using generative AI tools without official approval. Douetteau said Dataiku has expanded its governance tools to help companies better manage this technology.

For years, companies have tried to differentiate themselves through talent, culture, operations or marketing. However, in the new technological era, "part of what will make a company will be the type of AI system that has," Douetteau concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discreet, but constant. Uniqlo's offensive in the Spanish market is not new, but scale positions. The last movement materializes this Thursday, March 27, with the opening of its store on the Paseo de la Castellana, full financial axis of the capital.

In the number 83 of the imposing avenue that crosses much of the capital, the Japanese group inagures its third store in Madrid. His first establishment continues in Barrio de Salamanca, the second, and the largest in Spain, in the busy Gran Vía.

"This is a convenient store," they move from Uniqlo. The intention, they explain, is to gestate a concept of point of sale that catches a very specific audience: "a more familiar, but also more local profile."

Thus, surrounded by the main skyscrapers of the city, the store, the seventh in Spain, it will occupy an area of ​​1,200 square meters distributed in 3 floors, which will host fashion of men, woman and children.

With this movement, the Japanese company, owned by Fast retailing, strengthens its presence in Europe, a market with potential, where Uniqlo has a total of 84 stores.

"We don't run. We chose our locations very carefully." They don't lie. Since the opening of the Gran Vía store, in October 2022, Uniqlo had not starred in any other inauguration - the rest of its commercial offer is made up of its 4 stores in Barcelona.

And, despite the fact that Uniqlo's premise is firm - high quality and timelessness - space, which opens its doors today, plays, explores and, what is more important, confirms that Uniqlo is close to fashion, but the right thing not to forget its precept: create useful, essential and for a lifetime clothes.

Who is who in the textile universe: Uniqlo, the little Japanese tailoring turned into a giant who seeks to gain inditex ground with timeless and affordable clothes

More financial Madrid: more shirts

Business Insider Spain

Almost nothing is casual in Uniqlo. Its commercial philosophy is no exception. The store, which will use 50 people, is in full economic lung of Madrid. Only 300 meters separate the establishment of the AZCA complex, where the main skyscrapers of the city, such as Torre Picasso or Castilian 81 - are raised.

In Uniqlo's mind, this immersion has more social than purely geographical. "We seek to be an option for people who work in these offices and do not have time to lose. We pretend to buy what you need and continue with your life."

The movement, in any case, marks distances against its establishment of Gran Vía. Its 2,000 square meters, distributed in 4 floors, ratify it. "It is evidence, with this store we are less central, we are more north and we aspire to be more local," they explain.

"We seek to be the most convenient store for the public we aspire to in each space," they insist.

One glance confirms the focus: rows of shirts, perfectly bent and placed by chromatic order, decorate the entrance of the store. And they do it despite having a plant, the second, dedicated only to man, where even anti -wrinkles garments are included: "We seek to be useful."

In the kingdom of the kings of 'retail': Zara, El Corte Inglés and Nike ...

Not everything is easy for Uniqlo. Because the company, which does not obviate its commitment to sportswear, will share building with the sector giant, Nike, who explodes, from 2024 and door with Puerta, a 1,000 square meters store.

But there does not end everything. Prime streets live in a permanent game of thrones among textile companies. The financial epicenter of the capital is no exception. Less than 5 minutes, separate the establishment of the Japanese two key pieces of the Spanish retail: Zara and El Corte Inglés (ECI).

In image, the English Court of the Castilian. The English Court

Inditex, with its star firm, operates one of its largest global stores: a space of 6,000 square meters opened in 2017, which borders the commercial macrocomplex of ECI of La Castellana: 70,000 square meters raised on a glass construction that makes it the guardian of the entire district.

Uniqlo faces, therefore, two giants of national trade, but makes it supported by a growing business. In its first fiscal quarter (from September to November), the international income of UNIQLO, where Europe is included, grew by 13.7%, to 3,071 million euros. It represents 56% of the total turnover –5,479 million euros - of its matrix, Fast retailing.

... With a key weapon: virality and design without falling into the 'Fast Fashion'

In Uniqlo's proposal there is listening and daring. Many of these articles, they explain, are the product of listening to a customer need and working on it. "We are focused on what we call back the products," they detail.

In Uniqlo, stores function as their particular call-center-in addition, of their own. This, they maintain, makes the store itself locate a product need and transfer it to the internal team in charge of it.

Proof of all this exercise is evidenced in its viral bags-riñonera, turned into the best-selling accessory of Uniqlo. The versatility and great capacity of the bag generated a whole persecution in social networks for taking a copy that ended up deriving in a demand against Shein for the imitation of the product.

Its shooting fame has caused the company to have formed a whole design team only for this bag. He also explains that he occupies a large part of his new commercial space.

Business Insider Spain

But with virality or not, it is impossible to understand the discreet transformation of Uniqlo without Claire Waight Keller. Considered one of the most influential people in the world by the acclaimed Time magazine, the British designer was appointed creative director of the entire Uniqlo at the end of last year. Before he went through Chloé and Givenchy.

"His presence is evident," they confirm. Thus, neutral colored sweaters and versatile feathers, unnegociable within the Uniqlo universe, resist, but have been giving ground to the satin skirts and dresses of floral motifs. A change that insists, neither alters nor moves them away from their priority mission: "Make clothes that improve people's day to day."

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman on Thursday announced that viral use of ChatGPT's new image-generation AI, introduced earlier this week, is overloading the company's servers.

While it is "super fun seeing people love images" in ChatGPT, "our GPUs are melting," Altman posted on social media site X on Thursday, adding that the company will temporarily limit the feature's usage as it works to make it more efficient.

The rate limits affect OpenAI's Tuesday debut of native image generation within ChatGPT. The company debuted the "high-quality" image-generation tool as a way to produce everything from diagrams, infographics and logos to business cards and stock photos. The feature can also use an image as a starting point for art, such as a custom painting of a pet or editing a professional headshot.

The image-generation feature began rolling out to ChatGPT PLUS, Pro and Team users on Tuesday, as well as users of the chatbot's free tier when they use OpenAI's 4o model. ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users will receive access next week, the company said.

Images of anime-style renderings of users' uploaded photos have been going viral on X and other social media apps since the feature's Tuesday launch. Altman, for example, changed his X profile photo to an image generated by the new feature.

One of the company's first hit products was the Dall-E model launched in 2021. That was one of the first artificial intelligence image generators, and was integrated into ChatGPT in 2023.

Users of ChatGPT's free tier will soon be able to generate three images per day, Altman wrote.

A Las Vegas man has been arrested on charges related to the Molotov cocktail arson attack on Tesla vehicles in that city in mid-March, authorities said Thursday. The incident was one of the highest-profile acts of vandalism in a series of attacks on Tesla locations around the country related to company CEO Elon Musk's role in the Trump administration heading DOGE, the effort to slash federal spending and employee headcount. The FBI has called those incidents "domestic terrorism" and launched a task force to address the attacks. Paul Hyon Kim, 36, faces state and federal charges for the attack at Tesla Collision on West Badura Avenue in Las Vegas at 2:45 a.m. on March 18.

Five Teslas were damaged from Molotov cocktails and or bullets fired at them, according to a criminal complaint. Kim was arrested in connection with the Las Vegas incident on Wednesday, two days after a police bomb squad found multiple incendiary devices at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas. Federal authorities said Kim had a flight booked for Thursday out of Las Vegas to Milwaukee. Authorities identified Kim as the suspect in the Las Vegas attack from surveillance video of a Hyundai vehicle that was seen leaving near the scene of the incident, as well as other evidence, including bullet fragments, and cell phone tower records and the complaint said. The complaint said that less than three hours after the attack, at 5:30 a.m., Kim filed an insurance claim that said the tires of his own car had been slashed, and that his car had been stolen and then recovered.

But a query of local police reports did not show that Kim had notified police that his car had been stolen or recovered, the complaint said. A search of Kim's residence found a black backpack with pink paint, a black hoodie, face masks, ammunition, holsters, gun parts, an AR-style rifle, an AK-style rifle, and a handgun, the complaint said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday suggested the market may not be as grim as some on Wall Street fear, pointing to gains attained by stocks across a range of sectors.

"It's terrific to see such a broad mixture of stocks winning here, from ones that can run in a recession to ones that can rally hard in a robust economy," he said. "What it tells me is that the market may be far healthier than we think, and this backdrop simply isn't as bad as many would have you believe."

The indexes finished another day in the red as investors respond to new tariff policies from the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.37%, while the S&P 500 dropped 0.33% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.53%.

Cramer noted the decline of Big Tech names, but he's not ready to "say goodbye" to the sector because stocks have been such long term winners. When he looks at this year's high-performing sectors, he said he's "struck by how they represent a wide array of groupings that aren't tethered to any particular economic worldview."

For example, energy stocks like Chevron have notched gains. Cramer thought the group would be hurt by President Donald Trump's efforts to expand drilling as well as any economic slowdown. He acknowledged that the demand for natural gas remains strong. Plus, the power needed for energy-guzzling data centers is also propelling these stocks, he speculated.

Cramer also pointed to runs in healthcare stocks like CVS , Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Cencora , which he called "textbook slowdown stocks." Their performance could be indicative of fears that tariff policies will cause a recession, Cramer said.

On the other hand, financial stocks like Brown & Brown , Arthur J. Gallagher and Intercontinental Exchange are also doing well, Cramer pointed out. He concluded that their rally supports his theory that the market's theme isn't strictly recession because many of these companies rely on credit, which sours during a recession.

"The leaders for the year, indeed, are very strange," Cramer said. "Counterintuitive."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNBC's Jim Cramer spent the past week highlighting stocks he thinks can work right now, and on Thursday, he pinpointed Uber . Among the company's strengths is the potential to actually benefit from the rise of autonomous vehicles, Cramer said, instead of losing out, as some investors have feared.

"Uber's another example of what's working in 2025, though it's more of a one-off success story than a participant in a broader theme, like the others I've mentioned," he said. "Still, I'm glad I defended this one after the last quarter, and I don't think it's done going higher."

When Uber reported in February, Cramer said investors did "some nitpicking on the guidance." He claimed such criticism wasn't enough to justify the stock's sell-off in the immediate aftermath of the quarter. But since then, the stock has rallied, currently up a little over 16% since earnings, according to FactSet. Cramer was impressed that Uber beat gross bookings estimates for its main arms, mobility and delivery, even though its smaller segment, freight, missed.

Cramer pointed out that Tesla and CEO Elon Musk seem to have fallen out of favor on Wall Street, with the stock down more than 32% year-to-date. But this development is a positive for Uber, he suggested, because it means fewer people are worried about the threat robotaxis could pose to business. But to Cramer, these worries are unfounded. Tesla or other companies that start selling robotaxis will have to "make their peace" with ridesharing apps if they want to do business, he suggested, noting the way the Uber managed to largely wipe out business for cab companies.

Cramer also pointed to remarks from management, who suggested that robotaxies will face challenges in the commercial driving space, and Uber is "the player with the scale and expertise to run AV operations at the highest efficiency." The rideshare giant is well-positioned to help companies manage business and issues that come with operating large fleets, the company continued. Cramer remarked that Uber can assist in servicing and charging the cars, as well as deal with common problems like fare disputes, lost items, and insurance claim resolution.

Cramer said he also likes other ventures currently underway at the company – including the continued growth of its "Uber Teen" and "UberX Share" programs, as well as its new shuttle service to and from a few New York City airports.

"While all the focus is on the future of autonomous driving, it's easy to forget that Uber has a lot of other innovation going on that it's finding success with," he said.

Uber did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"If APP is not deplatformed, logically, numerous competitors will start copying APP's techniques because there is little technology involved," the firm wrote.

The report said that AppLovin's ad tactics "systematically" violate app stores' terms of service by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta , Snap , TikTok, Reddit , Google , and others." In so doing, AppLovin is funneling targeted ads to users without their consent, Muddy Waters said.

But Muddy Waters Research on Thursday became the third short-selling firm to publish a report meant to raise significant investor skepticism. The stock is down 19% in 2025 after Thursday's drop.

AppLovin tumbled $65.92 to close at $261.70. The stock soared more than 700% last year, the biggest gain among U.S. tech companies, due to enthusiasm surrounding AppLovin's artificial intelligence technology and the growth it was spurring in its ad business.

Shares of AppLovin sank 20% on Thursday, their steepest drop on record, as another short-selling firm raised concerns about the company's digital ad technology and claimed that it's violating app store rules.

Last month, Fuzzy Panda Research was one of two firms, along with short-seller Culper Research, that critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, which drove its earnings growth and stock surge. The shares dropped 12% on Feb. 26, the day of the short reports. Earlier in February, AppLovin reported a revenue and earnings beat.

After the short reports were published last month, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi wrote a blog post, defending his company's technology and practices, and taking aim at the short sellers trying to profit from AppLovin's decline.

An AppLovin spokesperson didn't provide a comment on Thursday, referring CNBC to Foroughi's post.

"It's disappointing that a few nefarious short-sellers are making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock price for their own financial gain, rather than acknowledging the sophisticated AI models our team has built to enhance advertising for our partners," Foroughi wrote. "It's also noteworthy that the short reports emerged after our earnings report, where we would be in a period of being unable to respond with financial performance."

Earlier this month, Fuzzy Panda penned a letter to the S&P 500 inclusion committee reiterating its claims of fraudulent ad tactics and alleging that AppLovin didn't meet the committee's "gold standard." The firm encouraged the committee to keep AppLovin out of the S&P 500.

"AppLovin's recent revenue growth has been based in data theft, revenue fraud, and the exploitation of our country's laws protecting children," the firm wrote to the S&P committee.

One of Muddy Waters' central claims is that e-commerce advertisers are bailing on AppLovin. The firm said that it analyzed 776 advertisers active early in the first quarter and noted that the churn rate was about 23%, while Foroughi "reportedly claims there has been no churn," according to the report.

Muddy Waters said it conducted the churn analysis by looking at e-commerce websites that, on Jan. 3, had AppLovin's AXON pixel. The firm then re-ran those checks from March 24-26, and said it found 21 sites with "broken links," and another 171 that no longer contained the pixel.

The 23% "churn rate is based only on those customers who removed the pixel," the firm wrote.

A representative for Muddy Waters declined to comment.

Auto stocks are digesting President Donald Trump's announcement that he would place 25% tariffs on "all cars that are not made in the United States," as well as certain automobile parts. Trump's administration had been telegraphing plans to put tariffs on the auto industry, but the effect of those moves and mechanism for enforcement are starting to take shape. The President's executive order said the tariffs would take effect for vehicles on April 3 and for auto parts by May 3. Shares of the "Detroit Three" all fell. General Motors stock dropped move than 7%, while Stellantis and Ford Motor shares lost roughly 1% and more than 3%, respectively. Shares of Tesla , however, were mostly unchanged. "In our coverage, for [original equipment manufacturers], Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. "GM has the most exposure to Mexico."

Trump said Wednesday he would not put a tariff on vehicles that are built in the U.S. The tariffs apply to imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts including engines and transmissions, the White House said in a fact sheet. Some aspects of the tariffs are still getting worked out. Auto parts that are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement will remain tariff-free until the commerce secretary can consult with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to figure out how to apply tariffs to non-U.S. content.

The United Auto Workers union cheered Trump's announcement. "These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S.," UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement Wednesday. Former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council — which represents Ford, GM and Stellantis — said in a statement that the AAPC was "committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans." Still, Blunt cautioned that tariffs should be implemented in a way "that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector." Vehicles are made up of tens of thousands of parts, many of which cross back and forth over the U.S. border before a final product is completed. Data and forecasting firm S&P Global Mobility reports there are on average 20,000 parts in a vehicle when it is torn down to its nuts and bolts. Parts may originate anywhere from 50 to 120 countries. The firm also reports that 25 automakers on average produce 63,900 light-duty passenger vehicles in North America per day. A majority of those, roughly 65%, are assembled in the U.S., followed by 27% in Mexico and 8% in Canada.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Intrator, co-founder and CEO of CoreWeave, speaks at Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Nov. 13, 2024.

CoreWeave on Thursday priced shares at $40 in the company's IPO, raising $1.5 billion in the biggest U.S. tech offering since 2021, CNBC has confirmed.

The company, which provides access to Nvidia graphics processing units for artificial intelligence training and workloads, had planned to sell shares for between $47 and $55 each. At the top end of the range, that would've valued CoreWeave at about $26.5 billion, based on Class A and Class B shares outstanding.

The offering is down from 49 million shares to 37.5 million, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the announcement hasn't been made public yet. Bloomberg was first to report on the $40 price. At that level, CoreWeave's valuation will be closer to $19 billion, though the market cap will be higher on a fully diluted basis.

Earlier on Thursday, CNBC reported that Nvidia, one of CoreWeave's largest shareholders, was targeting a $250 million order at $40 per share.

CoreWeave's shares are set to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday under the ticker symbol "CRWV."

The IPO is a major test for tech startups and the venture capital market after an extended lull in new offerings dating back to the beginning of 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. Other tech-related companies that have filed to go public in recent weeks include digital health startup Hinge Health, online lender Klarna and ticketing marketplace StubHub. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that chat app maker Discord is working on an IPO.

The last venture-backed tech company that raised at least $1 billion for a U.S. IPO was Freshworks in 2021. Last year Reddit and Rubrik each raised about $750 million in their offerings.

After Donald Trump's election victory in November, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said he expected renewed IPO activity, but President Trump's imposition of tariffs in recent weeks added uncertainty to economic forecasts and led to increased volatility to tech stocks.

CoreWeave counts Microsoft as its biggest customer by far. Other clients include Meta , IBM and Cohere. Revenue soared more than 700% last year to almost $2 billion, but the company recorded a net loss of $863 million. CoreWeave's model is capital intensive, requiring hefty purchases of equipment and expenditures on real estate.

A week after filing to go public, CoreWeave announced a contract with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion over five years. OpenAI agreed to buy $350 million in CoreWeave stock as part of the deal.

CoreWeave is trying to compete with some of the biggest tech companies in the world, including Amazon , Microsoft and Google , the three leading providers of public cloud infrastructure in the U.S.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ferrari logo is seen outside the Ferrari headquarters in Maranello, Italy.

Ferrari said Thursday it will raise prices by 10% on certain models after April 1 in response to new U.S. auto tariffs, adding up to $50,000 to the price of a typical Ferrari.

The Maranello, Italy-based sports car maker said prices will remain unchanged for all cars imported before April 2. After that, the "commercial terms" for three of its model families — the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma — will "remain unchanged," the company said in a release.

Yet, its more popular models, including the Purosangue SUV, the 12Cilindri and the F80, will get price increases of up to 10%.

For the Purosangue, which starts at about $430,000, that price hike amounts to about $43,000. For the limited edition F80, which starts at more than $3.5 million, the increase will add more than $350,000 to the price tag.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced tariffs of 25% on all cars not made in the U.S. Ferrari produces all of its cars at its Maranello factory.

Last year, Ferrari produced 13,752 cars. The company plans to launch its first all-electric Ferrari in October.

It is unclear what effect the tariffs will have on Ferrari sales, since there is already a waiting list of more than a year for most of its vehicles. Ferrari buyers are generally wealthy enough to easily absorb the price hikes.

Ferrari also said Thursday it "confirms its financial targets for 2025" but added that there is a "potential risk of 50 basis points on profitability percentage margins."

In an interview with CNBC this month, Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said even though Ferrari buyers are wealthy, the company has to be sensitive to passing on too much of the added cost of tariffs.

"When we look at the client, we consider that these people to buy a Ferrari, they have to work," he said. "We have to respect them. Because for us, the most important thing is the client. So we need to make sure that we treat them in the right way."

Shares of Ferrari were slightly higher Thursday morning, while shares of the U.S. "Big Three" automakers were largely lower.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GM logo is seen on a water tank of the General Motors assembly plant in Ramos Arizpe, in Coahuila state, Mexico, on Feb. 11, 2021.

The divergence stems from the amount of vehicles that GM imports, and its exposure to Mexico in particular.

Shares of GM fell more than 7% in Thursday trading, far underperforming the likes of Ford and Stellantis , which shed more than 3% and roughly 1%, respectively. Tesla stock was essentially unchanged for the day.

As auto stocks reacted to the latest tariff announcement out of Washington, D.C., on Thursday, General Motors took the brunt of the hit.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced his administration would impose 25% tariffs on "all cars that are not made in the United States" and some automobile parts. The executive order signed Wednesday allows for some leniency for components that are compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but it was not immediately clear what relief that might offer the North American automotive industry.

"Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. "GM has the most exposure to Mexico."

Mexico accounted for 16.2% of vehicle imports into the U.S. as a percentage of sales in 2024, according to GlobalData. That was the largest share of any country, about double the shares of South Korea and Japan, which ranked second and third in terms of import volume, respectively.

Roughly 52% of GM vehicles sold in the U.S. during the first three quarters of 2024 were assembled in the U.S., according to research by Barclays analyst Dan Levy. That leaves 30% assembled in Canada and Mexico, and another 18% brought in from other countries.

Levy also pointed out that GM relies heavily on Mexico and South Korea for production of some of its small crossovers, including its Equinox and Blazer vehicles.

"Roughly half of GM's US sales are produced in the US, but imported parts are a concern," he said.

During the same period, 57% of Stellantis vehicles and 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled stateside. Levy reported Stellantis assembled 39% of its U.S.-sold units in Canada and Mexico, and Ford, just 21%.

Wolfe Research's Emmanuel Rosner said the tariffs primarily affect foreign-brand automakers, but noted that 15% of GM's U.S. vehicles come from South Korea.

John Murphy from Bank of America said in comparison to the broader automotive market, GM is "relatively exposed to the tariffs" and may need to rebalance.

GM stock is down 13% year to date. Shares fell sharply in late January after investors worried that the automaker did not address concerns about tariffs in its most recent earnings report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's steep new tariffs on imported cars will likely jack up prices for U.S. buyers of both foreign and locally made vehicles, according to Wall Street analysts.

Trump on Wednesday said he will slap 25% tariffs on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as on key auto parts including engines, transmissions and powertrain components.

Prices that consumers pay on the lot could increase by $4,000 to $15,000 per vehicle, depending on how much of the car is imported, according to several analysts' estimates.

The tariffs will kick in at midnight on April 3, and Trump has said they will be "permanent."

There are some caveats: Importers of cars covered by the North American trade deal known as the USMCA will only face the tariff for the "non-U.S. content" of their vehicles. And those USMCA-compliant auto parts will be tariff-free until the Trump administration creates a process to apply the piecemeal tariffs.

While Trump's tariff agenda has been a wellspring of uncertainty for Wall Street, many analysts were quick to warn that his latest step could have major impacts to the auto industry.</p>

Oil executives are warning that President Donald Trump's tariffs and his "drill, baby, drill" message have created uncertainty in energy markets that is already affecting investment.

The executives, shielded by anonymity, bluntly criticized Trump in their responses to a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas from March 12 to March 20.

"The administration's chaos is a disaster for the commodity markets," one executive said. "'Drill, baby, drill' is nothing short of a myth and populist rallying cry. Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn't have a clear goal. We want more stability."

Several executives said Trump's steel tariffs are raising their costs, making it difficult to plan for future projects.

"Uncertainty around everything has sharply risen during the past quarter," another executive said. "Planning for new development is extremely difficult right now due to the uncertainty around steel-based products."

They also criticized the suggestion by White House advisors such as Peter Navarro that Trump's "drill, baby, drill" agenda aims to push oil prices down to $50 a barrel to fight inflation.

"The threat of $50 oil prices by the administration has caused our firm to reduce its 2025 and 2026 capital expenditures," an executive said. "'Drill, baby, drill' does not work with $50 per barrel oil. Rigs will get dropped, employment in the oil industry will decrease, and U.S. oil production will decline as it did during COVID-19."

CNBC has asked the White House for comment.

The Dallas Fed Energy Survey is conducted every quarter with about 200 firms responding. The survey covers operators in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana.

The scathing criticism in the Dallas Fed survey stood in contrast to major oil companies' public comments at the industry's big energy conference in Houston earlier this month.

Executives mostly praised Trump's energy team during the event and welcomed the administration's focus on increasing leasing and slashing red tape around permitting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Niche ocean carrier Atlantic Container Line is warning the fines the U.S. government is considering hitting Chinese-built freight vessels with would force it to leave the United States and throw the global supply chain out of balance, potentially fueling freight rates not seen since Covid.

"This hits American exporters and importers worse than anybody else," said Andrew Abbott, CEO of ACL. "If this happens, we're out of business and we're going to have to shut down."

The United States Trade Representative held its second day of this week's hearings on the fines that would be levied under Section 301 of U.S. trade law on Wednesday, with over 300 trade groups and other interested parties warning the government across comments letters and in testimony that the U.S. is no position to win an economic war that places ocean carriers using Chinese-made vessels in the middle. Soon, Chinese-made vessels will represents 98% of the trade ships on the world's oceans.

The policy proposal, begun under the Biden administration and culminating in a January report concluding China's shipbuilding industry had an unfair advantage, would allow the U.S. government to impose steep levies on Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports. For Chinese-owned operators (such as Cosco), a service fee of up to $1 million could be charged on each vessel. For non-Chinese-owned ocean carriers with fleets containing Chinese-built vessels, the service fee would be up to $1.5 million for each U.S. port of call.

In ACL's submitted commentary to the USTR, Abbott laid bare the economic difficulties his company would face, saying that if the U.S. government went ahead with the fines, it "would render us totally uncompetitive versus the other carriers in the US trades."

ACL, which is the oldest continually operating container line in the world and is owned by Grimaldi Group of Italy, is the only operator of combination container-roll-on-roll-off ships between North America and North Europe.

If ACL abandoned the U.S. market, domestic manufacturers would lose their only U.S.-headquartered North Atlantic carrier, and primary North Atlantic carrier of oversized and project cargo to Europe. ACL handles vehicles, construction equipment, aircraft including Airbus wings, and project cargo, including more than half of the American construction equipment, agricultural equipment and oversized machinery moving from the ports of New York, Baltimore and Norfolk to Europe.

"All the Airbus wings are made here in the U.S. and we carry those to the UK," Abbott told CNBC. "If we disappear, you'd have to find another brake bulk ship."

Abbott made clear to CNBC that his company's situation is unique and the largest ocean carriers will be able to better mitigate the impact of the potential fines. "I'm going to end up hitting a customer with a $2,000 to $2,500 charge, where the big guys might only have $800, so in today's world, that is an enormous amount of money, and potentially could put us out of business. So we'd be forced to pull our ships out of the Atlantic, out of the U.S. trades, and probably stick them in Asia, that's what we would do."

The goal of the policy proposals are to revive the U.S. domestic shipbuilding industry, but many commentators have argued that these fines are the wrong way to pursue that goal. Abbott said this is why he went public with his company's situation. "The Chinese operators that they're trying to go against because of the way they operate their ships, and the number of ports that they're calling, are probably going to be among the least affected by this new setup. So the guys you want to target are getting off scot free, and the guys who were in your own country get nailed," Abbott said.

The closing of ACL's U.S. offices would impact 300 employees in addition to the supply chain pipeline that supports them, such as truck drivers and warehouse workers.</p>

When SuRo Capital CEO Mark Klein brought up the name CoreWeave to Wall Street tech analysts last summer, he would sometimes get looks of confusion. They'd never heard of the company. Klein, meanwhile, was building a big position in a startup that he viewed as becoming a key player in artificial intelligence infrastructure. In May, his firm invested $15 million in the company, and by the end of the year it hat a put in a total of $25 million, accounting for 17% of its fund. It was SuRo's biggest bet in its14-year history, even topping the $17.5 million it invested in OpenAI. On his firm's earnings call in May, after the initial transaction, Klein called out CoreWeave's access to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and said the company was providing the technology necessary for AI developers to train their high-powered models. "Over the last few months, CoreWeave has cemented itself as a leader in AI infrastructure," Klein said on the call. Ten months later, Klein and his fellow AI bulls have turned their attention to the Nasdaq, where CoreWeave is set this week to become the first pure-play AI company to hit the stock market. The company's IPO is a landmark event for an industry that has exploded since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 — and has also attracted billions of dollars in capital from tech giants, hedge funds, private equity firms and venture capitalists. But there are ample reasons for skepticism. The IPO market has been very slow to reopen after slamming shut more than three years ago, when rising interest rates and soaring inflation pushed investors out of risky assets. And tech stocks have been particularly volatile to start 2025 due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country's top trading partners, and concerns that massive government cost cuts will push the economy into a recession. The Nasdaq is down more than 7% so far this year, on pace for its worst quarterly performance since mid-2022. Chipmaker Cerebras was slated to be the first AI IPO, but that deal got caught up in a national security review soon after the company filed to go public in September. It remains on the sidelines. "This is a very important IPO for the overall market," said Tim Guleri, managing partner at Sierra Ventures, referring to CoreWeave. "We've had a very dry spell." Guleri's AI investments include Weav.ai, which develops tools for insurers.

CoreWeave has sizable ambitions as it brings its story to Wall Street. The company, which was founded in 2017 to focus on crypto mining infrastructure before pivoting to AI, plans to raise up to $2.7 billion at the top end of its range of $47 to $55. The deal would value the company at well over $25 billion and potentially lift CEO Michael Intrator's net worth to $3.5 billion. If the underwriters exercise their full purchase options, the IPO could top $3 billion, which would make it one of the top 10 U.S. tech IPOs on record, and the largest in at least four years. CoreWeave said in its IPO prospectus earlier this month that revenue in 2024 soared more than 700% to $1.92 billion, with over 60% coming from Microsoft. The largest institutional investor in CoreWeave is Magnetar, a hedge fund based outside of Chicago, which will own about 29% of the Class A shares after the offering. SuRo's biggest stake in CoreWeave was acquired through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), called CW Opportunity 2, that Magnetar raised last year. That fund invested in CoreWeave at a $19 billion valuation. "When we made our investment initially, what was attractive to us was the growth rate of the industry in its totality, the acceleration of spend, and the fact that they had such a high degree of contractual revenue," Klein said. He added that "the supply-demand imbalance between the need for compute and the availability of compute" was unlike anything he'd seen before. In addition to Microsoft, CoreWeave provides data center AI technology and services for companies including Meta, IBM and Cohere.

'Picks and shovels'

According to Forge Global, which tracks private market transactions, private AI companies have increased in value by 60% over the past six months. The Nasdaq is little changed over that stretch. CoreWeave is among the most highly valued AI startups, but it's not at the top. That position is held by OpenAI, which was valued at $157 billion in October and, as of last month, was finalizing a deal that would up that number to $260 billion. Anthropic is next at $61.5 billion, followed by Elon Musk's xAI at $50 billion. Those companies are all very different from CoreWeave in that they develop models that power the generative AI apps and chatbots used by consumers and businesses. CoreWeave is supplying some of that critical technology, pulling together Nvidia GPUs into large data centers and providing access via the cloud. The company said in its prospectus that it wrapped up 2024 with 32 data centers, which housed more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs. In October, CoreWeave announced a $650 million credit line to expand its business and data center portfolio. CoreWeave says its top competitors include Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM and Oracle . On a past SuRo earnings call, Klein said he's investing in the "picks and shovels of the AI universe." Klein told CNBC that CoreWeave is gearing up to lead an "IPO parade," clearing out some of the backlog of tech companies that would have gone public already if not for the market conditions. One name he mentioned was online lender Klarna, which filed its prospectus earlier this month. On his firm's earnings call this month, Klein said, "This is as large of a pipeline of pre-IPO businesses as we can recall in the fund's history." PitchBook analyst Navina Rajan told CNBC that towards the end of 2024, valuations improved and set the stage for an "IPO window" this year. OpenAI also has a financial interest in the outcome of CoreWeave's debut. Earlier in March, OpenAI signed a five-year deal to use the company's infrastructure. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will receive a stake in CoreWeave tied to the IPO worth about $350 million.

Igor Taber, founder and general partner of Cortical Ventures, said CoreWeave's debut is "definitely a bellwether" for the broader tech IPO market. But valuing the business isn't straightforward. Pure software companies command a higher multiple than data center companies, which sell equipment that wraps up technology from other vendors. CoreWeave falls more into the latter camp, Taber said. "At its core, CoreWeave is a reseller of GPUs -- so they buy infrastructure from companies like Nvidia, and then they rent out those GPUs to customers," Taber said. "Their gross margin is significantly below what you would typically expect from a pure software company." But looking at large-cap tech companies, CoreWeave's profit margin compares favorably. In 2024, the company's gross margin, or the percentage of revenue left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, was 76%. At Microsoft, that number was 70%, while Alphabet recorded a gross margin of 58%. Those numbers are much lower at Dell , Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro , which all sell servers with GPUs inside. Dell's gross margin was about 22%, while HPE's was 34% and Super Micro's was 14%. However, CoreWeave recorded $8.7 billion in property and equipment costs for the year, and the business contains high operating costs, including depreciating infrastructure, and interest expenses. CoreWeave had a net loss of $863.4 million for the year with net debt of $8 billion. "In short, the core service is high-margin, but the heavy infrastructure investments and financing costs currently outweigh those gains," wrote Matt Turck, a partner at venture firm FirstMark, in a blog post after the prospectus was released. CoreWeave declined to comment. CoreWeave announced in early March that it was acquiring Weights & Biases, a developer platform for AI models and applications. According to the IPO prospectus, the purchase price will primarily be 20.4 million shares of CoreWeave stock, which is equivalent to about $1 billion at the mid-point of the range. Taber said the acquisition could help CoreWeave's efforts to show investors it's a software company.

Market will change

Julie Brewer, the executive vice president of finance at EdgeCore, said her company is watching closely how CoreWeave performs on the market. EdgeCore offers leases on its data center campuses to companies that rent out GPUs. CoreWeave is "ultimately an extension of what EdgeCore is doing, in terms of the products that we are serving and ultimately delivering," Brewer said. "We're very much watching CoreWeave to understand how investors and the public markets are thinking about their assets, their contracts, their revenue stream." Guleri of Sierra Ventures used the metaphor "AI infrastructure cake," and said CoreWeave is the bottom layer, a logical place to see the first IPO. That layer is "a very important part of the overall ecosystem that enables the production of these large language models and advanced AI infrastructure," Guleri said. One potential concern for Wall Street is that it's not clear how CoreWeave's business model will hold up when the GPU market shifts. The boom in AI of the last couple years has created such high demand for GPUs that big suppliers like CoreWeave have built-in business and a level of pricing power. "Their model works really well in a GPU-constrained environment where the demand for GPUs significantly outpaces supply," Taber said. "How does the business model scale when you may not be in a GPU-constrained environment?" When ChatGPT launched, GPU prices spiked. CoreWeave locked in long-term enterprise contracts with big tech companies, so it hasn't felt the price fluctuations that have taken place since. However, as prices come down, CoreWeave will have to adjust to a flattening supply-demand curve and some price normalization. Steve Jang, managing partner at Kindred Ventures, said CoreWeave should be well-positioned for the next few years. But competition is on the way from both hyperscalers and startups, and the company will have to be flexible, building out more applications and tools to maintain its early lead. For many public market investors, the decision of whether to buy into CoreWeave may come down to whether it's better to take the risk or funnel more money into Nvidia. Even with its growth slowing from historic rates a few quarters ago, analysts still expect Nvidia's revenue to increase by almost 60% this fiscal year. "The big winner here is Nvidia — they're going to have GPUs in the hyperscalers, the neoclouds or the regional data centers," Jang said. "We think that growth is going to be astronomical."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., US secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, March 24, 2025.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to slash 10,000 full-time employees across different departments, as he works to reshape the nation's federal health agencies, the department said Thursday.

Those job cuts are in addition to about 10,000 employees who opted to leave HHS since President Donald Trump took office, through voluntary separation offers. Combined, they will lead to the federal health department shedding about a quarter of its workforce, shrinking it to 62,000 employees.

HHS is a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees vaccines and other medicines, scientific research, public health infrastructure, pandemic preparedness and food and tobacco products. The department also manages government-funded health care for millions of Americans – including seniors, disabled people and lower-income patients who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act's markets.

The department will cut jobs at divisions responsible for offering insurance to the poorest Americans, approving new drugs, and responding to disease outbreaks, according to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the cuts.

The major restructuring comes as the U.S. grapples with one of the worst measles outbreaks in more than two decades, and as bird flu spreads in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry and U.S. dairy cows, with several recent human cases.

HHS will also drop five of its 10 regional offices, but it said essential health services won't be affected.

"We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic," Kennedy said. "This Department will do more – a lot more – at a lower cost to the taxpayer."

The department said the cuts will save the government about $1.8 billion per year. The federal government spent roughly $6.8 trillion in fiscal 2024.

Here are the employees the Trump administration plans to cut, according to the Journal:

3,500 full-time employees from the Food and Drug Administration, or about 19% of its workforce

2,400 workers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or roughly 18% of its staff

1,200 employees from the National Institutes of Health, or about 6% of its workforce

300 workers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or roughly 4% of its employees

As part of the restructuring, Kennedy is consolidating the department's 28 current divisions into 15 new ones, which HHS said will "centralize core functions" such as human resources, information technology, procurement, external affairs and policy.

Among them is a new subdivision called the Administration for a Healthy America, which will combine offices in HHS that address addiction, toxic substances, mental health and occupational safety, among others, into one central office. That includes the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. stock futures were little changed on Thursday night as investors grappled with ongoing tariff uncertainty and awaited the release of a key inflation measure.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 8 points, 0.02%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively.

In extended trading, Lululemon shares tumbled 10% after the athleisure company issued a weaker-than-expected outlook for the first quarter and 2025.

Wall Street is coming off a losing session for the major averages. On Thursday, the 30-stock Dow fell about 155 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 slid 0.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%.

Those moves come after President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on "all cars that are not made in the United States," the latest tariff development to roil the market. Investors — concerned that rising signs of weakening consumer sentiment are heightening the risk of a slowdown — are hoping April 2 will bring some much-needed clarity.

"I don't expect that market volatility is going to calm until we have more policy [certainty]. And a lot of us are looking to see if we get that next week," New York Life Investments' chief market strategist Lauren Goodwin said on CNBC on Thursday. "I'm not really seeing it. I anticipate that this volatility is here to stay with us."

On the economic front, February's personal consumption expenditures price index due Friday could confirm whether investors should be concerned about sticky inflation, especially after the Federal Reserve recently raised its inflation forecast. Economists polled by Dow Jones see the headline PCE price index reading rising 0.3% in February and 2.5% from 12 months earlier.

As of Thursday's close, Wall Street was headed for a second straight week of gains. The Dow is on track for a 0.8% advance week to date. The S&P 500 is up 0.5% for the period, while the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a 0.1% gain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lululemon beat Wall Street expectations for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, but issued 2025 guidance that disappointed analysts.

On an Thursday earnings call, CEO Calvin McDonald said the athleticwear company conducted a survey earlier this month that found that consumers are spending less due to economic and inflation concerns, resulting in lower U.S. traffic at Lululemon and industry peers. However, he said, guests responded well to innovation at the company.

"There continues to be considerable uncertainty driven by macro and geopolitical circumstances. That being said, we remain focused on what we can control," McDonald said.

Shares of the apparel company fell more than 10% in extended trading.

Lululemon was only the latest retailer to say it expects slower sales for the rest of this year as concerns grow about a slowing economy and President Donald Trump's tariffs.

Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was expecting for the quarter ended Feb. 2, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $6.14 vs. $5.85 expected

$6.14 vs. $5.85 expected Revenue: $3.61 billion vs. $3.57 billion expected

Fourth-quarter revenue rose from $3.21 billion during the same period in 2023. Full-year 2024 revenue came in at $10.59 billion, up from $9.62 billion in 2023.

Lululemon's fiscal 2024 contained 53 weeks, one week longer than its fiscal 2023. Excluding the 53rd week, fourth-quarter and full-year revenue both rose 8% year over year for 2024.

Lululemon expects first-quarter revenue to total $2.34 billion to $2.36 billion, while Wall Street analysts were expecting $2.39 billion, according to LSEG. The retailer anticipates it will post full-year fiscal 2025 revenue of $11.15 billion to $11.30 billion, compared to the analyst consensus estimate of $11.31 billion.

For the first quarter, the company expects to post earnings per share in the range of $2.53 to $2.58, missing Wall Street's expectation of $2.72, according to LSEG. Full-year earnings per share guidance came in at $14.95 to $15.15 per share, while analysts anticipated $15.31.

CFO Meghan Frank said on the Thursday earnings call that gross margin for 2025 is expected to fall 0.6 percentage points due to higher fixed costs, foreign exchange rates and U.S. tariffs on China and Mexico.

Lululemon reported a net income for the fourth quarter of $748 million, or $6.14 per share, compared with a net income of $669 million, or $5.29 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2023.

Comparable sales, which Lululemon defines as revenue from e-commerce and stores open at least 12 months, rose 3% year over year for the quarter. The comparison excludes the 53rd week of the 2024 fiscal year. Analysts expected the metric to rise 5.1%.

Comparable sales in the Americas were flat, while they grew 20% internationally. Lululemon has been facing a sales slowdown in the U.S., although McDonald said its U.S. business stabilized in the second half of the year and partially attributed the improvement to new merchandise. He added that Lululemon will expand its stores to Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic this year.</p>
