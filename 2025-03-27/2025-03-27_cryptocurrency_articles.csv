GME fell to just above $21 during the session, trading at its lowest price since October and down over 28% from its Wednesday peak of nearly $30.

The price action happened after the company unveiled plans late Wednesday for a $1.3 billion, 0% convertible note offering to raise money for its BTC acquisition plan. After an initial wave of euphoria among the crypto crowd, the hype died down on Thursday after investors took a closer look at the financing.

""Many existing shareholders dislike the move, so a switch is happening with large volume,"" Louis Liu, chief investment officer of Mimesis Capital, said in an X post.

The sharp sell-off may also have to do with the convertible bond pricing period, as prospective bond buyers might be selling or shorting the stock. James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk, noted that MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Semler Scientific (SMLR) shares also declined during pricing periods of their convertible note offerings.

""We suspect that GameStop's share price will drift lower prior to the issuance of the convert, particularly given that a convert investor will receive a zero coupon and will be required to have faith that the GameStop meme phenomenon will persist for another five years,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who has an underperform rating on GME.

Pachter argued that the company is following Strategy’s playbook, but MSTR trades at less than twice the value of its bitcoin, while GME trades at more than twice its cash holdings.

""We expect the offering to fall flat,"" Pachter continued. “We find it hard to understand why any investor would pay more than 2x cash value for the potential for GameStop to convert that cash into BTC, particularly since the same investors can invest in BTC or a BTC ETF themselves.”

GME is only the latest Wall Street firm to convert some of its cash into bitcoin. The trend started with Strategy, the company led by bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, which years ago announced it would use its cash reserves to buy the cryptocurrency. MSTR’s success following the transition caused many other companies to follow, especially recently as U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to make the U.S. the center for digital asset development.

While Saylor has long vouched for more companies, especially those with large cash reserves, and even the U.S. as a country, to adopt bitcoin as a reserve strategy, not everybody agrees.

“Gambling on companies buying Bitcoin is not a good investment strategy,” said well-known bitcoin gadfly Peter Schiff in a post on X. “$GME has lost all of yesterday's Bitcoin-inspired 15% gain. Shares are now down 2% over the two days combined. Now that all the fools have already rushed in, smarter investors are selling as they realize that wasting cash buying Bitcoin is not a viable long-term business model.”",coindesk

The company initially sought to raise $4 billion at a $35 billion valuation, reporting $1.9 billion in revenue last year but still seeing a net loss of nearly $900 million.

AI powerhouse Nvidia, an investor in CoreWeave, is anchoring the IPO with a $250 million order, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

CoreWeave is closely tied to bitcoin miner CoreScientific, which struck a multi-billion deal with the New Jersey-based firm to expand its artificial intelligence capabilities.

""If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post in early Asian hours Thursday, ""large scale Tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had!""

""Liberation day in America is coming, soon,"" Trump wrote in a separate post. ""For years we have been ripped off by virtually every country in the world, both friend and foe. But those days are over — America first!!!""

The post comes days after reports that concerns of tariffs were overblown, and that overall impact would be more measured than expected.

Earlier this month, Trump had imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, alongside a 20% levy on Chinese goods, citing national security concerns over immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Now, with the EU and Canada in his crosshairs, markets could be bracing for another jolt.

Tariffs, by their nature, disrupt economic stability — increasing costs for imported goods, stoking inflation, and pressuring central banks like the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.

Such moves could spell trouble for BTC and other tokens in the short term, as the crypto market often moves in tandem with equities, which tend to falter under trade uncertainty. A stronger U.S. dollar, bolstered by tariff-driven capital flows, might further depress BTC prices, as investors flee to safe havens like gold or cash.

Trump's post dampened a bullish mood in Asian hours, with majors showing a brief sell-off. XRP and SOL fell 2%, ether (ETH) and BNB Chain's BNB remained little-changed, while dogecoin (DOGE) retracted gains from a 3.5% move higher in the past 24 hours.

SUI shines, analysts remain bullish

Outside of the top ten tokens by market cap, Sui Network's SUI posted a 7% surge ahead of the Walrus Network, a data availability protocol built on Sui, going live on mainnet later Thursday.

Meanwhile, some say Asian developments could provide a catalyst for bitcoin prices amid U.S. focused headwinds.

""While US regulators begin to cut back on restrictive policies, institutions in Asia have been making waves by releasing new funds, products, and innovations that have been supported by pro-crypto regulations in key jurisdictions,"" Jupiter Zheng, partner at HashKey Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

""The next leg of the bull market may find its footing in Asia as the center for growth in the industry,"" Zheng added.

BTSE's Jeff Mei had a more optimistic view as of Thursday morning.

""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have recovered over the last few days, even as stock markets dropped in response to US President Trump's announcement of auto tariffs. This shows that the worst could be over for crypto markets this year, and that we could see an upward trajectory in prices as US inflation fears subside and as we move closer towards rate cuts,"" Mei said in a Telegram message.

Now that Trump has secured the cabinet-level echelon of his government, the White House is working on shepherding top agency chiefs through the Senate confirmation process. While many of the crypto headlines are coming from the administration and Congress these days, those running the regulatory agencies will ultimately be the ones writing the regulations the industry will have to conform with.

Atkins is seeking to be the successor of ex-Chair Gary Gensler, whose years at the agency established him as the digital assets sector's most prominent nemesis. But Trump's nominee is already positioning himself in stark contrast to Gensler, who criticized the industry's history with swindlers and contended that current securities law was sufficient to treat much of the space as if it were in active violation of registration requirements.

""A top priority of my chairmanship will be to work with my fellow commissioners and Congress to provide a firm regulatory foundation for digital assets through a rational, coherent, and principled approach,"" Atkins said in his prepared testimony for Thursday.

Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina Republican who chairs the committee, said Atkins will ""provide long-overdue clarity for digital assets.""

But even before the hearing began, Atkins was being slammed by Senator Elizabether Warren, the Massachusetts lawmaker who is the committee's ranking Democrat, who registered doubt about his ability to be impartial to the digital assets sector he's served as an adviser.

At the hearing table beside Atkins, Gould made his case for taking over the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator for national banks. The OCC has been a significant player in the digital assets sector's campaign against U.S. banking oversight that's pressured banks to keep the industry at an arm's length. Crypto firms and insiders have struggled to maintain banking relationships and have argued that the regulators authored that ""debanking"" strain.

The first question to Gould was on that situation, with Scott asking whether he'd commit to reversing that previous stance, to which Gould responded, ""absolutely.""

For the crypto industry, Atkins' responses on crypto matters are potentially more urgent. But he wasn't questioned on his views about next steps for cryptocurrency oversight, nor about the legislative efforts poised to remake U.S. crypto policy.

SBF

At one point, Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana raised the topic of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who he said looks like a ""fourth runner-up in a John Belushi lookalike contest,"" and asked Atkins whether the SEC appropriately looked into SBF's parents for their involvement in his fraudulent activities.

""I look forward to getting to the SEC to find out what happened,"" Atkins said. ""Like you, I'm concerned about those reports.""

But Kennedy took it further, suggesting a lack of accountability that signals ""two standards for law and punishment"" in the U.S.

""I don't think the SEC has done a damn thing,"" Kennedy said. ""They're crooks!"" he shouted. ""And I expect the SEC to do something about it.""

Few other senators delved into wider crypto matters, and those that may have been expected to, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, weren't present. The hearing only lasted two hours and included four nominees for various offices, causing some Democrats to lament that this wasn't enough time to speak with each person.

Atkins' most difficult moments revolved around his tenure as an SEC commissioner in the run-up to the 2008 meltdown and the agency's failings in policing the mortgage securities that contributed to that crisis. Atkins deflected the primary responsibility of the crisis as belonging to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The next step in the confirmation process is for the committee to vote on the nominees and forward them for potential approval by the overall Senate.

A flurry of Ghibli-themed cryptocurrencies are doing the rounds on Ethereum and Solana blockchains, with ""ghiblification"" (GHIBLI) emerging as the biggest one yet with a $21 million market cap as of Asian morning hours.

Inspired memecoins often go viral and tend to rack up bets because they tap into internet culture’s love for humor, absurdity, and community. Their low entry cost and wild price swings draw speculators chasing quick gains, amplifying buzz.

It has racked up nearly $70 million in trading volumes in just 24 hours of going live from a little over 250,000 individual trades. The token’s liquidity pool has just over $330,000 worth of Solana’s SOL (meaning the max a GHIBLI holder can exchange their holdings for, minus price declines).

President Donald Trump ramped up the trade-war hyperbole, threatening to increase import tariffs levied on the EU and Canada if they keep on working to “do economic harm” to the U.S. after announcing a 25% tariff on vehicles and foreign-made auto parts.

Despite the threat, crypto markets remained stable, with bitcoin holding steady at about $87,500. Over 24 hours the largest cryptocurrency is down about 0.6% and the broader CoinDesk 20 Index some 2%.

The growing threats not only raise concerns about economic growth, but also widen the gap between the U.S. and Europe, whose leaders are meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky today to work on long-term security guarantees. The summit comes after the U.S. persuaded Ukraine and Russia to agree to a Black Sea ceasefire.

Cryptocurrency prices are being influenced not only by macroeconomic factors, but also by the forthcoming expiry of around $15 billion worth of BTC and ETH options contracts on Friday. The uncertainty has stalled BTC’s price rally, even after video-games retailer GameStop moved to raise $1.3 billion to accumulate the cryptocurrency.

Still, the U.S. House of Representatives has released a bill that’s set to help reduce systemic risks associated with stablecoin usage. Blockchain development is also progressing steadily, with Ethereum’s final Pectra test going live on the Hoodi network.

Looking ahead, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee will today hold a hearing on the nomination of Paul Atkins — who holds up to $6 million in crypto-related assets — as the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stay alert!

A viral AI art trend fueled by OpenAI’s new 4o model sparked a surge in Studio Ghibli-themed memecoins, blending nostalgia with cryptocurrency speculation as fans create Ghibli-style images and traders capitalize on the hype.

The ghiblification (GHIBLI) token, the largest, boasted a $21 million market cap and $70 million in trading volume within 24 hours driven by over 250,000 trades on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

The trend, marked by the #GhibliAI hashtag amassing millions of hits on X and Instagram, reflects internet culture’s love for humor and absurdity, attracting speculators with low-cost, high-volatility tokens.

Smaller Ghibli-inspired tokens like Ghilbi Doge, NoFace and Yutaro lag behind GHIBLI in trader interest, while the latter’s liquidity pool holds just over $330,000 in Solana’s SOL.

Derivatives Positioning

While BTC, ETH CME futures yields stopped falling early this month, there has been a noticeable lack of progress, particularly in the wake of continued corporate adoption of bitcoin. The divergence suggests sophisticated market players remain cautious.

BTC, ETH perpetual funding rates on offshore exchanges are barely positive, another sign of cautious sentiment.

TRX, XMR, TON and SUI are the only top 25 coins with positive net cumulative volume deltas for the past 24 hours. The positive value indicates net buying in the perpetual futures market.

BTC and ETH short-end options-based implied volatility indexes continue to drift lower, with investors still pricing bigger swings in ETH relative to bitcoin.

Deribit-listed options continue to show a bias for short duration puts in BTC, ETH, SOL and XRP.

Crypto has come a long way over the past decade. Mainstream adoption, institutional interest, and regulatory clarity helped the industry gain increasing credibility. And meme coins also carved out an exciting niche in this sector, which reflected creativity and community engagement. Yet, political meme coins could ruin this decades-worth of progress very quickly.

A promotional post from Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, caused LIBRA investors to lose over $250 million in just hours. His endorsement sparked a buying frenzy that pushed the price from near zero to almost $5 in a matter of minutes. Insiders quickly cashed out, dumping over $107 million in tokens before the price collapsed. Argentina’s fintech chamber labeled this classic rug pull without mincing words.

The Anatomy of a Meme Coin Scam

Unfortunately, the LIBRA scandal was not an exceptional case. Bubblemap analysts traced LIBRA’s origins back to the team behind the MELANIA token and other pump-and-dump schemes. The same group launched several coins that swelled in price before crashing.

President Milei, a self-proclaimed libertarian and Bitcoin enthusiast, used his platform to share information about LIBRA. His tweet ignited a rush among investors eager to capitalize on his reputation.

It’s still staggering that influential figures have yet to understand the true impact of their statements on an industry largely driven by speculative interest. As the token’s value soared, insiders began unloading their tokens. Within hours, the coin’s market cap fell from $4.5 billion to just a fraction of that amount.

However, on-chain analysis shows that LIBRA was fundamentally designed to potentially scam investors. The founders held 70% of the token supply, which allowed them to profit massively while leaving retail investors vulnerable. When insiders cashed out, many traders lost nearly everything they had invested.

Such pump-and-dump schemes always follow the same playbook: a high-profile personality sparks investor interest, insiders pocket their profits, and the token collapses. This pattern played out with LIBRA in a textbook fashion.

Political Endorsements and Market Manipulation

Political endorsements used in these schemes add a disturbing twist to the story. Milei’s tweet did more than spread a message; it lent credibility to a high-risk asset. When a sitting president supports a project, many assume there is underlying merit. This assumption helped drive the buying frenzy around LIBRA. Similar episodes occurred in the United States with the TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. Politically-linked meme coins have morphed from mere speculative plays into tools for financial manipulation.

Galaxy Research Analyst Alex Thorn describes LIBRA as the latest example of a series of Solana-based meme coin implosions. During this crash, Solana’s transaction volumes plummeted to mid-2024 levels, and there is growing concern over a $1.5 billion FTX token unlock. These factors combine to put additional pressure on Solana’s price.

Meme coins, which dominated headlines in 2024, now face harsh market realities in 2025. Many of these tokens have already lost 30-60% of their value. Activity on platforms such as Pump.fun has cratered, and overall trading volume in the sector is in freefall.

The trend of politically-endorsed tokens creates an environment where hype easily overrides fundamentals. Political figures lend their names to projects with little oversight. This practice allows groups of insiders to generate large profits at the expense of everyday investors.

The situation exposes a troubling trend in crypto markets. When prominent figures use their influence to spark buying frenzies, they turn volatile tokens into weapons for financial manipulation. Such practices risk undermining trust in the entire crypto ecosystem.

A Much-Needed End to the Chaotic Meme Coin Cycle?

The $LIBRA debacle should serve as a harsh lesson for retail investors. Many of those who lost money had a high level of technical knowledge, as they needed Solana wallets and SOL tokens to participate.

However, the overall appeal of politically charged tokens often attracts investors who believe that an endorsement from a political heavyweight guarantees success. Reality proved otherwise. When high-profile insiders exploit their inside knowledge to exit early, the outcome is disastrous for retail participants.

As institutional investors shift their focus to more stable markets like Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the appetite for meme coins might be waning. Political meme coins remain the lawless frontier of crypto. Their volatile nature and inherent manipulation make them a poor choice for risk-averse investors. The recent fallout suggests that market excitement has finally run far ahead of sound fundamentals.

Political meme coins represent a clear symptom of a larger problem. They expose vulnerabilities in a market that still lacks a solid regulatory framework.

The overall stablecoin market, which includes tokens with prices pegged to fiat currencies and commodities, climbed above $231 billion market cap this month, growing for the 18th consecutive month, the report said.

Tether's USDT, the largest stablecoin on the market, also increased to a record supply of $144 billion. However, its market share dropped to the lowest level (62.1%) since March 2023 as the stablecoin landscape is getting increasingly competitive. Circle's USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, grew 7% in a month to near $60 billion.

Decentralized finance protocol Ethena's recently launched dollar stablecoin USDtb, which uses BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL as a reserve asset, quickly gobbled up over $1 billion of assets to become the 8th largest by market cap.

In terms of trading volumes on centralized exchanges, USDT's dominance slightly declined, but still stood above competition at 75.7% through the month among the top ten stablecoins. Meanwhile, USDC and Hong Kong-based First Digital's FDUSD saw their trading market cap dominance rise to 13.6% and 10%, respectively.

Regulatory shifts have been reshaping the market of euro-denominated stablecoins, as exchanges moved to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Kraken delisted USDT and other non-compliant stablecoins for European users, following the footsteps of other exchanges such as Coinbase and Crypto.com.

A separate story from Bloomberg said CoreWeave is now looking to raise only $1.5 billion.

CoreWeave is in close partnership with bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which was expected to profit from the IPO if the results are positive and sustain strong revenue growth over the next few years.

In early U.S. trading, CORZ is up fractionally, but down sharply over the past month and for 2025 as a whole. AI-related tokens NEAR, ICP, RENDER have added modestly to earlier losses.

CoreWeave saw $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 amid surging demand for AI services. However, some believe that CoreWeave’s new $12 billion deal with AI giant OpenAI could have bigger implications for the company than its IPO plan.

CoreWeave’s pullpack comes as tech stocks have lagged other market sectors since the start of this year, partially as a result of on-and-off tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and concerns about the spending of AI companies.

CoreWeave will debut on the Nasdaq on Friday, becoming the first AI company to hit the stock market. A representative from the company could not be reached for comment at time of publication.",coindesk

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

Grug's company Warlock Labs just raised $8 million in venture funding for what he believes is the solution: a proprietary trading firm that uses on-chain data to prove it is processing order flow responsibly.

The two-year old company is set to enter the complex blockchain pipes that facilitate trading on Ethereum. Here, an army of savvy operators offer kickbacks to protocols in exchange for the chance to process their order flow, which they can squeeze for tens of millions of dollars a year.

But there's no guarantee those players aren't giving protocols a raw deal, says Grug. The world of maximal extractable value (MEV) creates myriad opportunities to manipulate yet-to-settle trades in ways detrimental to the protocol and its traders.

""We're building out order flow tooling and a builder with some zero-knowledge guarantees where we can essentially prove after the fact that none of the order flow that gets submitted to us, whether it's via users or searchers, has ever been tampered with,"" Grug said.

Warlock Labs will start with a focus on on-chain activity but Grug says he sees opportunities to scale the business to market make for CEXes too. He pointed to the recent controversy within Binance over a market maker that took illicit profits from MOVE tokens — at traders' expense.

""We're going to live in a future where order flow is alpha, and proving you didn't abuse it is as valuable as actually receiving it,"" said Grug. ""If you can prove that you will never tamper with order flow, it's more and more likely that more and more people will submit their order flow to you.""

Then came the mighty ASIC in 2013, and with it, the “shoebox” form factor that has become emblematic of the bitcoin mining industry.

What comes next? Will the shoebox design persist as standard for bitcoin mining ASICs? Or will another form factor that more resembles traditional datacenter servers win out?

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

This article first appeared on Blockspace Media, the leading Bitcoin industry publication dedicated to covering Bitcoin tech, markets, mining, and ordinals. Get Blockspace articles directly in your inbox by clicking here.

ASIC manufacturers are increasingly betting on the latter – or at least, that a hydro-cooled server rack design will become a substantial portion of bitcoin mining fleets. Moreover, they’re leaning into the “direct-to-chip” cooling for further efficiency gains.

Auradine's new AH3880, released March 2025.

Last September, Bitmain announced its model U3S21EXPH (a bit of a mouthful, eh?) developed in a partnership with Hut 8. Its U3 design means that one unit takes up three spaces in a traditional server rack. MicroBT soon followed with its M63 Hydro series, as did Bitdeer’s Sealminer A2 Hydro unit.

Following suit, Auradine released its server rack model, the AH3880, this March. Its U2 design, which occupies two server slots, is a bit smaller, but it packs more hashrate per unit of space at 600 TH/s (or 300 TH/s per slot) versus Bitmain’s 860 TH/s (286.66 TH/s per slot).

Shoebox out

So, what’s with the switch up from the traditional shoe box? For Auradine, it’s all about customer demand.

“[Our new model is] based upon a lot of feedback that we got from our miner customers … we've been working with the miners even throughout the design process,” Auradine CSO Sanjay Gupta said on the most recent Mining Pod. “They indicated to us that they were looking for a quality hydro based miner.”

In its partnership with Bitmain for the U3S21EXPH, “Hut 8 was instrumental in the custom design for the infrastructure, particularly the U form factor which is compatible with HPC style architecture,” Hut 8 Head of Investor Relations Sue Ennis told Blockspace last September. (More on the high performance computing angle later).

The benefit of a server rack ASIC lies in standardization. Bitcoin miners are increasingly marching in step with the traditional datacenter industry, and that industry could see 40% adoption of direct liquid-to-chip cooling by 2026, according to data center developer Cyrus One.

If miners adopt this design, then theoretically, they can optimize their supply chains by converging on server designs that are becoming best practice in the big-boy data center sector.

This could make building and repairing bitcoin mines easier. And it could also make mining companies more nimble if they want to flex out of bitcoin mining and into other forms of compute.

Enter AI and HPC

As with so much mining news today, of course the spectre of AI is looming in the background.

If miners construct their data centers with traditional server rack designs, there is one less pain point if they want to retrofit these sites for AI and HPC loads. Of course, they’d still need to augment the sinews, muscles and veins of their operations with more robust networking and electrical infrastructure, but server racks would provide a backbone for AI/HPC services that requires less restructuring than legacy bitcoin mines. As Ennis put it, “the U form factor … is compatible with HPC style architecture.”

Echoing this, Gupta said in our Mining Pod interview that “[The U form factor has] been used for the AI data center. It’s easy to adjust. It’s got a high [power] density to it … [it] is extremely relevant for AI data centers as well, and we are looking at a joint strategy between AI for HPC and Bitcoin mining. So the U form factor works well with that.”

Who’s buying it?

Perhaps needless to say, the server rack form factor for bitcoin mining is still in its infancy, and while there is promise that such a design could win out, there’s no guarantee.

To start, bitcoin miners will not only need to rework the innards of their mines but also completely rewire their electrical infrastructure (which is unlikely to happen at existing mines).

Cholla’s Brad Cuddy, which operates hydro-cooled ASIC miners, told Blockspace last September that “he’s excited to see the shift from the shoebox design to the [server rack] form factor.” But he said the U3S21EXPH’s voltage range is incompatible with certain electrical infrastructure that miners use with other Bitmain models.

“The restricted range of 380 to 415 volts reduces its compatibility for retrofitting. I would have liked to see the voltage range go all the way up to 480 volts to allow for more interoperability with current infrastructure deployments,” he said.

As such, it’s likely that we’ll see miners integrate these units at new sites. Hut 8 is taking this approach with plans to host 15 EH/s of U3S21EXPH units for Bitmain (with an option to purchase) at its Vega, Texas site, which is due to start operating in Q2.

So far, Hut 8 is the only public buyer of Bitmain’s U3S21EXPH. Gupta did not reveal which miners are under contract for its AH3880, but he did say they include several industrial scale private and public miners. It wouldn’t be surprising to see MARA, one of Auradine’s key partners which has also invested upwards of $50 million in the company, adopt the model.

Should Hut 8’s Vega site run smoothly on Bitmain’s model, and if we assume that MARA will deploy Auradine’s, public miners may lead where others will follow, and we could see a new form factor slowly seep into modern mine design.

According to the FBI, more than $1.5 million in crypto — largely in the form of donations from Hamas supporters around the world — has flowed through the seized wallets and exchange accounts since last October. The wallet addresses were allegedly promoted in a group chat claiming to be associated with Hamas, a U.S. and European Union-designated terrorist organization, and donations were subsequently laundered through a series of crypto exchanges and transactions.

“These seizures show that this office will search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas, wherever it is found, and in whatever form of currency,” U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. of the District of Columbia said in a statement. “Hamas is responsible for the death of many U.S. and Israeli nationals, and we will stop at nothing to stop their campaign of terror and murder.”

Approximately $90,000 in crypto was seized from an undisclosed number of wallets, and another $112,000 was taken from three exchange accounts, according to the FBI’s release, and the accounts were registered to Palestinian individuals living in Turkey “and elsewhere.”

The U.S. Treasury Department and other foreign governments have previously sanctioned Hamas-linked financial networks and facilitators of crypto transfers, seized Hamas-linked crypto accounts. In April 2023, Israel’s Defense Ministry’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) seized nearly 200 cryptocurrency accounts tied to Palestinian currency exchanges. According to a report from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs, the NBCTF has seized “tens of millions” of dollars in crypto from Hamas-linked accounts over the last few years.

В ходе сессии GME упала до чуть более 21 доллара, торгуясь по самой низкой цене с октября и упав более чем на 28% по сравнению с пиковым значением среды почти в 30 долларов.

Ценовое действие произошло после того, как компания представила планы в среду поздно вечером по предложению конвертируемой облигации на $1,3 млрд, 0%, чтобы собрать деньги для своего плана по приобретению BTC . После первоначальной волны эйфории среди Криптo толпы ажиотаж стих в четверг, когда инвесторы более внимательно изучили финансирование.

«Многие существующие акционеры не одобряют этот шаг, поэтому переключение происходит в больших объемах», — сказал Луис Лю, главный инвестиционный директор Mimesis Capital, в своем заявлении.X пост.

Резкая распродажа также может быть связана с периодом ценообразования конвертируемых BOND , поскольку потенциальные покупатели BOND могут продавать или шортить акции. Джеймс Ван Стратен, старший аналитик CoinDesk, отметил, что акции MicroStrategy (MSTR) и Semler Scientific (SMLR) также снизились в периоды ценообразования их предложений конвертируемых облигаций.

«Мы подозреваем, что цена акций GameStop снизится до выпуска конвертируемых акций, особенно с учетом того, что конвертируемый инвестор получит нулевой купон и должен будет верить, что феномен мема GameStop сохранится еще пять лет», — сказал аналитик Wedbush Майкл Пахтер, имеющий рейтинг ниже среднего на GME.

Пэчтер утверждает, что компания следует стратегии Strategy, но MSTR торгуется по цене, которая менее чем в два раза превышает стоимость ее Bitcoin, в то время как GME торгуется по цене, более чем в два раза превышающей ее денежные активы.

«Мы ожидаем, что предложение не будет иметь успеха», — продолжил Пэчтер. «Нам трудно понять, почему какой-либо инвестор будет платить больше, чем двукратная денежная стоимость за возможность GameStop конвертировать эти деньги в BTC, особенно с учетом того, что те же инвесторы могут сами инвестировать в BTC или BTC ETF».

GME — это всего лишь последняя фирма с Уолл-стрит, которая конвертировала часть своих наличных в Bitcoin. Тенденция началась со Strategy, компании под руководством Сторонник Bitcoin Майкл Сэйлор, которая несколько лет назад объявила, что будет использовать свои денежные резервы для покупки Криптовалюта. Успех MSTR после перехода побудил многие другие компании Социальные сети, особенно в последнее время, когда президент США Дональд Трамп пообещал сделать США центром разработки цифровых активов.

Хотя Сэйлор давно призывает больше компаний, особенно те, у которых большие денежные резервы, и даже США как страну, принять Bitcoin в качестве резервной стратегии, не все с этим согласны.

Публикация появилась через несколько дней после сообщений о том, что опасения по поводу пошлин преувеличены и что общее воздействие будет более сдержанным, чем ожидалось.

Ранее в этом месяце Трамп ввел 25%-ные пошлины на импорт из Канады и Мексики, а также 20%-ный сбор на китайские товары, ссылаясь на проблемы национальной безопасности, связанные с иммиграцией и торговлей фентанилом.

«Главным приоритетом моего председательства будет работа с моими коллегами-комиссарами и Конгрессом над созданием прочной нормативной базы для цифровых активов посредством рационального, последовательного и принципиального подхода», — заявил Аткинс.его подготовленные показанияна четверг.

Сенатор Тим Скотт, республиканец из Южной Каролины, возглавляющий комитет, заявил, что Аткинс «внесет давно назревшую ясность в вопрос цифровых активов».

Но еще до начала слушаний Аткинс подвергся резкой критике со стороны сенатора Элизабет Уоррен, законодателя Массачусетса, которая является высокопоставленным демократом в комитете, которая выразила сомнения относительно егоспособность быть беспристрастнымв секторе цифровых активов он работал консультантом.

За столом слушаний рядом с Аткинсом Гулд изложил свои доводы в пользу захвата Управления контролера денежного обращения, регулятора национальных банков. Управление контролера денежного обращения было важным игроком в кампании сектора цифровых активов против банковского надзора США, который давил на банки, заставляя их KEEP отрасль на расстоянии вытянутой руки. Криптo компании и инсайдеры боролись за сохранение банковских отношений и утверждали, что регуляторы создали эту «дебанковскую» напряженность.

Первый вопрос, заданный Гулду, касался этой ситуации: Скотт спросил, готов ли он изменить свою предыдущую позицию, на что Гулд ответил: «Безусловно».

Для Криптo ответы Аткинса по вопросам Криптo потенциально более актуальны. Но его T спрашивали о его взглядах на следующие шаги по надзору Криптовалюта или о законодательных усилиях , направленных на переделку Криптo США.

СБФ

В какой-то момент сенатор-республиканец Джон Кеннеди из Луизианы поднял тему бывшего генерального директора FTX Сэма Бэнкмана-Фрида, который, по его словам, LOOKS на «четвертого финалиста в конкурсе двойников Джона Белуши», и спросил Аткинса, расследовала ли SEC надлежащим образом деятельность родителей SBF на предмет их причастности к его мошеннической деятельности.

«Я с нетерпением жду возможности обратиться в SEC, чтобы узнать, что произошло», — сказал Аткинс. «Как и вы, я обеспокоен этими сообщениями».

Однако Кеннеди пошел дальше, указав на отсутствие ответственности, что свидетельствует о «двух стандартах закона и наказания» в США.

«Я T думаю, что SEC сделала хоть что-то», — сказал Кеннеди. «Они мошенники!» — закричал он. «И я ожидаю, что SEC что-то с этим сделает».

Немногие другие сенаторы углубились в более широкие вопросы Криптo , а те, от кого можно было ожидать этого, например, сенатор Синтия Ламмис, T присутствовали. Слушание длилось всего два часа и включало четырех кандидатов на различные должности, заставив некоторых демократов сетовать, что времени было T , чтобы поговорить с каждым.

Самые трудные моменты Аткинса были связаны с его пребыванием на посту комиссара SEC в преддверии кризиса 2008 года и недостатками агентства в контроле за ипотечными ценными бумагами, которые способствовали этому кризису. Аткинс отклонил основную ответственность за кризис, сказав, что она лежит на ипотечных гигантах Fannie Mae и Freddie Mac.

Следующим шагом в процессе утверждения станет голосование комитета по кандидатурам и направление их для возможного одобрения всем Сенатом.

Несмотря на угрозу, Криптo Рынки оставались стабильными, Bitcoin держался на уровне около $87 500. За 24 часа крупнейшая Криптовалюта упала примерно на 0,6%, а более широкий Индекс CoinDesk 20 около 2%.

Растущие угрозы не только вызывают обеспокоенность по поводу экономического роста, но и увеличивают разрыв между США и Европой, лидеры которых встречаются сегодня с президентом Украины Владимиром Зеленским, чтобы обсудить долгосрочные гарантии безопасности. Саммит состоится после того, как США убедили Украину и Россию согласиться наПрекращение огня на Черном море.

На цены Криптовалюта влияют не только макроэкономические факторы, но и предстоящее истечение в пятницу опционных контрактов BTC и ETH на сумму около $15 млрд. Неопределенность остановила Rally цены BTC, даже после того, как ритейлер видеоигр GameStop предпринял попытку собрать $1,3 млрд. для накопления Криптовалюта.

Тем не менее, Палата представителей СШАвыпустил законопроектэто должно помочь снизить системные риски, связанные с использованием стейблкоинов. Разработка блокчейна также неуклонно продвигается, и финальный тест Pectra от Ethereum запущен в сети Hoodi.

Забегая вперед, Банковский комитет Сената США сегодня проведет слушания по выдвижению Пола Аткинса, который владеет активами, связанными с криптовалютой, на сумму до 6 миллионов долларов, на пост председателя Комиссии по ценным бумагам и биржам. Будьте бдительны!

Вирусный тренд на ИИ-арт, подпитываемый новой моделью OpenAI 4o, спровоцировал всплеск мемкоинов на тему Studio Ghibli, смешав ностальгию со спекуляциями на Криптовалюта , поскольку фанаты создают изображения в стиле Ghibli, а трейдеры наживаются на шумихе.

Крупнейший токен ghiblification (GHIBLI) достиг рыночной капитализации в 21 миллион долларов США и объема торгов в 70 миллионов долларов США за 24 часа благодаря более чем 250 000 сделок на блокчейнах Ethereum и Solana .

Тенденция, отмеченная хэштегом #GhibliAI, собравшим миллионы просмотров в X и Instagram, отражает любовь интернет-культуры к юмору и абсурду, привлекая спекулянтов недорогими и высоковолатильными токенами.

Менее крупные токены, вдохновленные Ghibli, такие как Ghilbi DOGE, NoFace и Yutaro, отстают от GHIBLI по интересам трейдеров, в то время как пул ликвидности последнего составляет чуть более 330 000 долларов США в SOL Соланы.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Hardware Wallets: Bitcoin’s Biggest Adoption Barrier,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/hardware-wallets-bitcoins-biggest-adoption-barrier,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 11:40:48 GMT","There are roughly half a billion crypto users around the world and, at the most generous estimate, only 2.5% are using hardware wallets. That’s a tiny number, but I’m relieved it’s not higher.

Why? Because I want people to on-board to Bitcoin by the billion, and I want to see everyone self-custody securely. The consumer hardware wallet industry is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving this goal. And not just to Bitcoin adoption: the whole decentralization revolution is at risk if we don’t address the fatal flaw at the heart of the world’s most popular wallets.

Wallets are treading water

Last year in these pages, Lucien Bourdon celebrated “10 years of the wallet revolution”. There’s a lot I agree with, but one glaring omission. Almost without exception, the ‘leading’ consumer hardware wallets on the market today have barely innovated in a decade. And as every security expert knows, if you’re not constantly advancing, you’re moving backwards.

The problem isn’t simply that new threats are constantly emerging, it’s that Bitcoin use cases are rapidly evolving. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are no longer ‘just’ stores of value; they are now a medium for all kinds of increasingly complex transactions. Yet hardware wallets’ underlying technology is essentially unchanged from the days when their primary utility was as a secure, offline keysafe. It’s the same with UX, with users still expected to write down their seed words and then squint at a tiny screen every time they want to approve a transaction.

This isn’t just a Bitcoin problem. The future of security will see everyone safeguarding our most valuable digital assets and sensitive data with cryptographic keys. In fact, the whole decentralized economy depends on what’s inside these wallets – so let’s take a peek.

Trust, Don’t Verify?

Lucien was right to stress that Bitcoin’s strength comes from its commitment to open-source principles. Where I profoundly disagree with him is that open-source has been adopted by “most of the wallet industry”.

The fact is, the leading hardware wallets continue to be built on closed-source, proprietary systems that users cannot fully inspect. If they can’t inspect, they can’t verify; if they can’t verify, why should users take manufacturers’ claims on trust?

I suspect the reason so many hardware wallets remain “black boxes” is because they have something to hide – like the decades-old smart card technology used by so many of the wallets to which bitcoiners entrust their keys. This tech isn’t fit for today’s crypto use cases, and certainly not for a future of decentralized security, where we’ll need keys to safeguard everything from our digital identities to access credentials.

A Barrier to Innovation…and Adoption

Hardware wallets’ continued reliance on closed, proprietary systems is not just a security nightmare: it’s also terrible for Bitcoin innovation and adoption.

Today’s wallets are effectively walled gardens, where developers must follow restrictive rules and can’t offer any degree of customization for users. This isn’t just control freakery for its own sake; often, it’s a function of the underlying technology. Devices like Ledger need to give every app access to the master seed; obviously, that means they have to be painstakingly reviewed before they are approved (if they ever are).

If that’s how the App Store worked, we’d still be carrying Nokia 3310s round in our pockets. Instead, we got open ecosystems, a thriving developer community, competition, and a galaxy of brilliant apps.

That’s what I wish for wallets. When developers can build permissionlessly, they will not only deliver novel functionality and enhanced user experience, but will play an essential role in wallets’ evolution to support (and secure) the ever-growing complexity of bitcoin applications.

Wallets should be a hub of innovation, a place for developers to build the killer apps that will compel people to adopt Bitcoin and blockchain-based services. In reality, an ecosystem like Ledger is the “anti-App Store”, holding back decentralized innovation instead of driving it forward.

Open Your Wallet

The solution is both simple and essential: transparency. Just as strong encryption relies on publicly tested, open-source algorithms to ensure security, the devices that store cryptographic keys must follow the same philosophy. Open-source hardware and software enable security researchers, developers, and even individual users to audit and verify security measures, reducing reliance on manufacturers’ claims and increasing overall trustworthiness.

Newer, more secure alternatives already exist. Hardware wallets based on open-source microkernel architectures provide a more robust security foundation, allowing independent verification of their safety. These systems ensure that no single company controls the security of users’ cryptographic keys, reducing the risk of hidden vulnerabilities and fostering innovation.

The good news is that only one in 40 crypto users currently owns a hardware wallet. Let’s make sure we give the other 39 a truly secure way to self-custody their digital future – and support the innovation that will attract billions more to adopt.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Proposed Bipartisan Legislation Recognizes Bitcoin As A Technology That Supports Democracy,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/proposed-bipartisan-legislation-recognizes-bitcoin-as-a-technology-that-supports-democracy,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:14:49 GMT","On Wednesday, the office of Rep. Gabe Amo issued a press release stating that Rep. Amo and Rep. Kim (R-CA) reintroduced a bipartisan resolution supporting the use of distributive ledger technologies (DLT), including blockchain, to “support democratic governance, human rights, freedom of information, transparency, and innovation around the world.”

The resolution (the full text of which was not linked to in the press release) urges federal agencies to explore and support DLT and expresses Congress’ commitment to advancing responsible innovation on this technological front.

Rep. Kim commented on the importance of this technology in the press release.

“U.S. leadership in emerging technologies like blockchain not only improves Americans’ lives but also helps us advance transparency in U.S. foreign assistance, human rights, and freedom across the globe,” said Rep. Kim.

“This legislation is vital, especially as we see the Chinese Communist Party exporting its surveillance technologies and authoritarianism abroad. I am proud to join Congressman Amo to lead this bipartisan resolution to ensure the United States shines as a beacon of hope, freedom, and innovation on the world stage,” she added.

The press release also cited how, in Screven County, Georgia, the Bitcoin blockchain was used to safeguard election election results and provide transparency to voters, linking to this article, which tells the story of the event.

Simple Proof, the company that helped Screven County officials commit its vote tallies to the immutable Bitcoin blockchain also recently helped Republicans in Williamson County, Tennessee do the same with the results of its Republican leadership vote.

Simple Proof put itself on the map when it helped to secure the results of the most recent presidential election in Guatemala, the story of which is told in the short documentary Immutable Democracy. Thanks to the vote tallies from the election being safeguarded on the Bitcoin blockchain, the integrity of the election was upheld, despite efforts made to tamper with physical votes once voting had concluded.

The work that the company has done both in the U.S. and abroad is a testament to a point Rep. Amo made in the press release.

“Innovative technology like blockchain helps promote transparency and strengthen democratic institutions around the world,” said the congressman.

While the press release provided evidence of the Bitcoin blockchain being used to preserve democratic values, it didn’t differentiate between Bitcoin and other blockchains, many of which, by design, are less secure.",bitcoinmagazine

New York, New York, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

Zeus Network announced the official launch of APOLLO, its flagship decentralized application and the first on-chain Bitcoin exchange built on Solana. Alongside APOLLO, Zeus Network has introduced zBTC, the first fully permissionless Bitcoin asset on Solana. Unlocking cross-chain Bitcoin liquidity, Bitcoin holders can now access Solana’s DeFi ecosystem—without reliance on centralized wrapped solutions.

APOLLO allows users to lock native BTC and mint zBTC at a 1:1 ratio directly on Solana, adding Bitcoin liquidity in a fully decentralized, non-custodial environment. Traditional wrapped Bitcoin models rely on centralized custodians and opaque systems, but APOLLO and zBTC deliver a trustless, transparent experience with no KYC requirements or custodial risks. The platform has demonstrated significant traction during the private mainnet phase, recording over $40 million in on-chain volume and successfully minting 50 zBTC ahead of launch.

The launch of APOLLO ushers in Bitcoin Finance—or BTCFi—on Solana, with a suite of decentralized financial services that leverage Bitcoin’s unmatched liquidity and security to integrate with modern DeFi infrastructure. Through zBTC, Bitcoin holders can now participate in a multitude of DeFi strategies across Solana, including trading zBTC on Jupiter, providing liquidity on Meteora, HawkFi, and Raydium. Vault strategies for yield optimization—such as depositing zBTC on Drift and Neutral Trade—are also set to launch in the near future.

Zeus Network also provides on-chain visibility into Bitcoin reserves through ZeusScan, a custom-built Proof of Reserves system that ensures every BTC transaction remains fully auditable. This tool reinforces user confidence and maintains the integrity of APOLLO’s trustless architecture.

In the coming months, Zeus Network plans to introduce new features that further modularize Bitcoin liquidity. APOLLO will soon enable users to swap between zBTC, cbBTC, and wBTC and withdraw any version back to native Bitcoin—making it easier than ever to manage Bitcoin positions across protocols and formats. This modular framework will enhance market efficiency and give users more flexibility and control. In addition, users will be able to engage in borrowing and lending activities on Drift and Save Finance, and many more.

Zeus Network’s future priorities include onboarding institutional liquidity partners, integrating more UTXO-based assets such as DOGE, LTC, KAS, and evolving ZPL-assets to strengthen liquidity coverage. The launch of more Bitcoin-native applications on Solana are also in the works, as Zeus continues to develop BTCFi on Solana.

About Zeus Network

Zeus Network is a multi-chain layer built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling permissionless interoperability between Bitcoin and major blockchain ecosystems. It seamlessly integrates liquidity from Bitcoin and other UTXO-based blockchains such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Kaspa into the Solana ecosystem, creating secure, scalable cross-chain interactions.

Through its flagship dApp, APOLLO, Zeus Network demonstrates the decentralized, trustless integration of native Bitcoin via a lock-mint mechanism, empowering the Solana-native asset, zBTC, to unlock Bitcoin finance (BTCFi) opportunities on Solana.

San Francisco, USA, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

Kinto, the modular exchange designed to provide secure, compliant, and seamless access to decentralized finance (DeFi), today announced the upcoming listing of its $K token. Scheduled for March 31st, 2025, the token will initially be available on Kinto’s native exchange, Gate.io, MEXC, and Uniswap.

The $K listings mark a major milestone in Kinto’s growth, following a successful token launch that raised $3.84 million from over 2,700 participants. The sale, which used a Dutch auction model—a transparent price discovery mechanism where the bidding starts high and gradually decreases until all tokens are sold—cleared at $15 per token, ensuring fair market valuation by minimizing speculative volatility. Unlike traditional token sales that often prioritize insiders and early investors, this approach allowed for broad community participation at a price determined by market demand. This launch reflects the growing demand for transparent and sustainable token distribution models in an industry often dominated by high-FDV, insider-driven tokenomics.

Kinto’s momentum has also been reinforced by strong institutional backing. Brevan Howard Digital, the digital asset arm of global hedge fund Brevan Howard, recently deployed $20 million into the Kinto ecosystem, signaling confidence in Kinto’s model for compliant, institutional-grade on-chain finance. SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci has also publicly endorsed Kinto, stating: “I’m an early investor and supporter of Kinto through SkyBridge. Kinto’s modular exchange opens up tremendous possibilities for institutional investors to deploy capital on-chain without counterparty risk.”

Kinto’s ecosystem is built to provide a secure, on-chain financial environment while maintaining the fundamental advantages of DeFi. Unlike traditional exchanges, Kinto integrates KYC and AML at the blockchain level, ensuring that institutions and individual users can access decentralized finance in a legally compliant manner. By default, Kinto requires all participants to be KYC verified and continuously runs AML monitoring on transactions across its network. The exchange’s non-custodial smart wallet also provides advanced security features, addressing risks that have plagued centralized platforms such as the recent Bybit hack.

Kinto’s tokenomics are designed for transparency and long-term sustainability. Seventy percent of the maximum token supply is allocated to community members, reinforcing a decentralized and equitable distribution model. The $K token plays a critical role in governance, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes regarding key protocol upgrades, fee structures, and treasury allocations. Additionally, staking incentives provide users with reduced trading fees, priority access to liquidity pools, and enhanced governance privileges, further reinforcing long-term ecosystem growth. In the future, subject to governance, it would be possible for revenue-sharing mechanisms to be enabled, ensuring that token holders would benefit directly from exchange fees and protocol-generated revenue, aligning incentives between users and the network.

With a modular design that allows seamless movement of assets and liquidity across various protocols and exchanges—both centralized and decentralized—Kinto presents a new model for on-chain financial infrastructure. The forthcoming $K token listing exemplifies Kinto’s commitment to financial sustainability, security, and user choice at a time when the broader market is shifting away from speculative tokenomics and toward real utility.

“Kinto is built to enable long-term, sustainable growth in decentralized finance,” said Ramon Recuero, CEO of Kinto. “The $K listing is not just a token launch—it’s proof that fair tokenomics and real financial utility can exist in crypto. This industry needs to move beyond speculative short-term gains and toward building financial infrastructure that genuinely empowers users.”

About Kinto

Kinto is a modular exchange and on-chain financial ecosystem designed to provide seamless access to decentralized finance while prioritizing security, compliance, and user control. Built with a smart contract wallet architecture and modular design, Kinto enables users to interact with DeFi, chain abstracted without compromising on security or usability. Kinto is the first blockchain network to feature native [email protected] and AML enforcement at the blockchain level, along with native wallet insurance and institutional-grade safeguards. Its non-custodial exchange model ensures users retain full control over their assets while benefiting from deep liquidity and efficient market access. By eliminating intermediaries and aligning incentives, Kinto is redefining what a modern financial network can be.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The U.S. SEC on Thursday dismissed enforcement actions against three major crypto firms, filing joint stipulations to drop the cases with prejudice, making the decisions final and not subject to refile.

Kraken, ConsenSys, and Cumberland DRW LLC all saw their respective lawsuits terminated simultaneously, marking the latest reversal in the agency's regulatory approach toward digital assets.

The regulator has also officially closed its case against the exchange Crypto.com.

Disclaimer: ConsenSys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.

The dismissals form part of a broader pivot in U.S. crypto regulation under the Trump administration, following similar ends to cases against Coinbase, Robinhood, Uniswap Labs, and OpenSea.

In a statement following the dismissal of civil enforcement action against Coinbase, acting SEC Chairman Mark T. Uyeda said these decisions were part of the agency's ""ongoing efforts"" to ""rectify its approach” and develop crypto policy in a “more transparent manner.""

Notably, the SEC emphasized that these dismissals do not ""necessarily reflect the Commission's position on any other case.""

The decision ends a ""wasteful, politically motivated campaign,"" Kraken said in a statement when the resolution for their case with the regulator arrived.

Kraken further characterized the SEC's move as something that lifted ""uncertainty"" over what could have ""stifled innovation and investment.""

The exchange provider later revealed its prospects of going public, potentially coming in as the second crypto firm to do so after Coinbase.

The resolution ends a tumultuous period for the industry. Each of the three companies had faced serious allegations under the prior Gensler regime.

Kraken was charged in November 2023 with operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency.

ConsenSys faced accusations in June 2024 of unlawfully offering securities through its MetaMask Staking service.

Cumberland DRW, a Chicago-based trading firm, was sued in October 2024 for allegedly acting as an unregistered dealer handling over $2 billion in crypto assets.

Under acting Chairman Uyeda, the SEC has established a task force and actively engaged with the crypto industry, signaling a departure from the previous administration's enforcement-focused approach.

https://decrypt.co,How a Solo Bitcoin Miner Beat the Odds and Banked $266K,https://decrypt.co/312068/how-solo-bitcoin-miner-beat-odds,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:19:38 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

The solo miner of Bitcoin block 888,737—won last week with a $266,000 BTC reward—shared their story with Bitcoin mining hardware creator FutureBit, whose Apollo miners helped lead to the sizable score.

The anonymous miner, who took home more than 3.15 BTC or around $266,000 last week between the fixed reward and transaction fees, did so with a home setup composed of three FutureBit Apollo miners and one Bitmain SK19pro, according to the shared email posted to X.

“I usually have the Apollo miners set on efficiency mode,” the email reads. “During the colder months, I run the SK19Pro at 60TH during the day and 100 at night,” it continues, adding that other than some scheduled tasks that stop hashing during the peak electricity times, “everything else is the default settings.”

That setup was enough to get the ultimate reward for a solo miner. It’s also a highly unlikely win, given that large-scale publicly traded firms and mining pools dominate the industry.

“I scrolled through the Apollo website on my phone, still in the comfort of my bed,” the miner wrote. “I looked at the SOLO Mining User’s panel. What appeared next stopped me cold.”

Moments later, launching the BlueWallet app on their iPhone, the miner confirmed their suspicions that they had successfully “found a block.”

“‘We found a block! We found a block!’ I yelled, my voice echoing through the house,” wrote the anonymous miner. “I bolted from bed, racing downstairs to my computer… there, in bold, beautiful letters were the words: block accepted. A grin spread across my face—victory was mine, and it felt incredible.”

Despite multiple solo scores in recent months, the energy-intensive nature of mining typically leads to industrial-sized setups or mining pools taking home the vast majority of block rewards—the new Bitcoin supply that is created to reward those who verify and validate the network.

FutureBit offers various mining products on its website for individuals looking to pursue a home mining rig. Its cheapest product starts at $376 after a discount, with other miners ranging up to a price of $2,100.

The firm did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

The U.S. Department of Justice has seized $201,400 in cryptocurrencies earmarked for Palestinian militant group Hamas, the agency announced on Thursday.

Authorities took control of a cryptocurrency wallet holding $89,900, in addition to three accounts holding digital assets worth $111,500, the Justice Department said Thursday in a statement. The wallet addresses have been used to launder more than $1.5 million in digital currencies for Hamas since October 2024.

“These seizures show that this office will search high and low for every cent of money going to fund Hamas, wherever it is found, and in whatever form of currency,” U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia said Thursday in the statement.

Since the early 2010s, cybercriminals and militant groups have used privacy-focused blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies to launder their ill-gotten gains and finance their operations. But over the past few years, U.S. authorities have cracked down on the practice, frustrating bad actors’ attempts to operate undetected.

According to the DOJ, a group chat with alleged ties to Hamas enabled Hamas supporters to donate cryptocurrencies to at least 17 wallet addresses through an encrypted communications platform. Financiers and over-the-counter brokers laundered the funds through several crypto exchanges.

It is not immediately clear which crypto exchanges were used for the alleged money laundering.

The Justice Department did not immediately reply to Decrypt's request for comment on the matter.

The FBI Albuquerque field office assisted in the latest investigation.

“Disrupting funding mechanisms and seizing cryptocurrency from Hamas is one of the FBI’s many tools that we use in the fight against terrorism,” Assistant Director David J. Scott of the FBI Counterterrorism Division said.

The DOJ is not the only agency that has cracked down on campaigns to fund Hamas and other militant groups. Between 2021 and 2023, Israeli counter-terrorist authorities seized dozens of digital asset accounts with suspected ties to Hamas and two with alleged connections to Daesh, also known as ISIS, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Tether revealed Thursday it is investing in a pair of firms unrelated to the crypto industry, continuing an investment spree that has only intensified since the company reported record profits earlier this year.

The El Salvador-based company snapped up 49,596,510 shares of Latin American-focused agricultural firm Adecoagro, growing its stake in the business to 70%, according to an SEC filing published Thursday.

""Our investment aligns with Tether's broader strategy to back infrastructure, technology, and businesses that advance economic freedom and resilience, especially in regions where these values are most needed,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.

Adecoagro is a sustainable production company with interests in Argentina, Brazil and Argentina.

Separately, Ardoino announced on X that his company would also be investing in Italian media company Be Water. By the end of March, Tether will hold a 30.4% stake in the company via a €10 million capital increase and equity acquisition.

“While often Media companies are bullied into kneeling to sponsored narratives simply to survive, Tether's investment in BeWater ensures that the group will continue to remain solid, visionary and especially independent,” Paolo wrote in the X post.

The private company's latest investments come a few months after it reported record-smashing profits for 2024. Tether said in January that its yearly net profits hit a new all-time high of more than $13 billion last year, citing an assurance opinion for the fourth quarter of 2024 issued by global accounting firm BDO. The stablecoin issuer also reported $7 billion in excess capital.

Tether has used its funds over the past few months to increase its stake in the Bitcoin mining company Bitdeer, in addition to upping its control of companies such as the video platform Rumble and Italian football club Juventus.

Last year, it also invested $19 million in XREX Group, a firm that also has backing from the Taiwanese Government National Development Fund. USDT is the third-largest cryptocurrency, and the largest stablecoin, in the world with a market capitalization of $144 billion, according to CoinGecko data.

Miami, Florida, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

TokenFi has officially eliminated the 0.3% buy/sell tax on its native token, TOKEN, following a unanimous vote from the Floki DAO.

“The Floki DAO proposal to remove the 0.3% buy/sell tax on $TOKEN received 100% support from the community,” the project team announced. “In line with the decision of the Floki DAO, the buy/sell transaction tax on $TOKEN has been removed.”

The vote signals a clear consensus within the Floki and TokenFi communities that lowering friction in trading is essential to increasing accessibility and unlocking broader utility for the token.

The tax removal is already live across both Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.

The original proposal, published via Snapshot, received full backing, making this one of the rare DAO votes with absolute alignment.

With the buy/sell tax now set to 0%, TokenFi aims to drive further adoption by reducing barriers for both new and existing holders. The move could also help boost TOKEN's liquidity across decentralized exchanges and improve market efficiency.

TokenFi, which is connected to the Floki ecosystem, is working to position TOKEN as a utility and governance asset across DeFi platforms. Removing transaction friction is one of several steps being taken to expand the token’s real-world use cases and trading appeal.

The change is effective immediately.

TokenFi is a no-code, all-in-one tokenization platform that allows users to create tokens and will allow users tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) in just a few clicks using a WYSIWYG interface — no coding required. Positioned to tap into the $16 trillion tokenization industry by 2030, TokenFi aims to simplify and accelerate the process of bringing assets on-chain.

Backed by the Floki ecosystem, TokenFi is governed by the Floki DAO and led by the same core team behind the globally recognized Floki token. The platform includes a suite of tools like TokenFi Launchpad, AI Smart Contract Auditor, RWA Module, and more — all powered by its utility token, TOKEN.

New York City, New York, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

A report from leading research firm Messari shows that Gravity - an ultra-fast parallel EVM Layer 1 blockchain being developed by Web3 “Super App” Galxe - is approaching industry-leading speed, processing, and security.

On March 3, 2025, Galxe announced Grevm 2.0: a major upgrade to Gravity’s execution engine. Currently, Gravity boasts sub-second finality and can process between 7,000-8,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) in its Devnet 1.0 environment. This compares to just 300-400 TPS on Ethereum and around 3,000-4,000 TPS for Solana.

Built using Aptos architecture, which has achieved over 12,000 TPS, Gravity believes it will eventually average around 10,000 TPS. Alongside huge gains in computational efficiency that see Gravity consuming 95% less CPU than competitors, this speed will make the chain a scalable solution for more demanding use cases like DeFi, gaming, and traditional finance.

Commenting on the development of Gravity, Galaxy’s CTO Yumin Xia says: “With Gravity, we want to build a chain that is fast, scalable, composable and open-source. Our closest competitor - Monad - is achieving similar speeds, but in a closed environment. The two of us are, effectively, building the sports cars of blockchain, but Gravity will be available to any developer to build the next generation of web3 projects - not just a select few.”

In addition to developments at Gravity, Messari’s report also highlights the progress of Galxe’s Earndrop program, which, since its launch in January, has partnered with projects such as XRP, Solayer, Jambo, and Diam to distribute rewards to its users. It also highlights the super app’s integration with Soneium - an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs to enhance scalability, interoperability, and accessibility. Developments in the ease of payments through Galxe’s g-domain names and the growth of Galxe Rewards Hub are also highlighted.

Gravity also launched “Get G,” a dedicated portal designed to simplify G token acquisition by aggregating all available access points in one place without the friction of navigating multiple platforms.

Discover SCENE

San Francisco, USA, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

Kinto, the modular exchange designed to provide secure, compliant, and seamless access to decentralized finance (DeFi), today announced the upcoming listing of its $K token. Scheduled for March 31st, 2025, the token will initially be available on Kinto’s native exchange, Gate.io, MEXC, and Uniswap.

The $K listings mark a major milestone in Kinto’s growth, following a successful token launch that raised $3.84 million from over 2,700 participants. The sale, which used a Dutch auction model—a transparent price discovery mechanism where the bidding starts high and gradually decreases until all tokens are sold—cleared at $15 per token, ensuring fair market valuation by minimizing speculative volatility. Unlike traditional token sales that often prioritize insiders and early investors, this approach allowed for broad community participation at a price determined by market demand. This launch reflects the growing demand for transparent and sustainable token distribution models in an industry often dominated by high-FDV, insider-driven tokenomics.

Kinto’s momentum has also been reinforced by strong institutional backing. Brevan Howard Digital, the digital asset arm of global hedge fund Brevan Howard, recently deployed $20 million into the Kinto ecosystem, signaling confidence in Kinto’s model for compliant, institutional-grade on-chain finance. SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci has also publicly endorsed Kinto, stating: ""I'm an early investor and supporter of Kinto through SkyBridge. Kinto’s modular exchange opens up tremendous possibilities for institutional investors to deploy capital on-chain without counterparty risk.""

Kinto’s ecosystem is built to provide a secure, on-chain financial environment while maintaining the fundamental advantages of DeFi. Unlike traditional exchanges, Kinto integrates KYC and AML at the blockchain level, ensuring that institutions and individual users can access decentralized finance in a legally compliant manner. By default, Kinto requires all participants to be KYC verified and continuously runs AML monitoring on transactions across its network. The exchange’s non-custodial smart wallet also provides advanced security features, addressing risks that have plagued centralized platforms such as the recent Bybit hack.

The $K token logo.

Kinto’s tokenomics are designed for transparency and long-term sustainability. Seventy percent of the maximum token supply is allocated to community members, reinforcing a decentralized and equitable distribution model. The $K token plays a critical role in governance, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes regarding key protocol upgrades, fee structures, and treasury allocations. Additionally, staking incentives provide users with reduced trading fees, priority access to liquidity pools, and enhanced governance privileges, further reinforcing long-term ecosystem growth. In the future, subject to governance, it would be possible for revenue-sharing mechanisms to be enabled, ensuring that token holders would benefit directly from exchange fees and protocol-generated revenue, aligning incentives between users and the network.

With a modular design that allows seamless movement of assets and liquidity across various protocols and exchanges—both centralized and decentralized—Kinto presents a new model for on-chain financial infrastructure. The forthcoming $K token listing exemplifies Kinto’s commitment to financial sustainability, security, and user choice at a time when the broader market is shifting away from speculative tokenomics and toward real utility.

“Kinto is built to enable long-term, sustainable growth in decentralized finance,” said Ramon Recuero, CEO of Kinto. “The $K listing is not just a token launch—it’s proof that fair tokenomics and real financial utility can exist in crypto. This industry needs to move beyond speculative short-term gains and toward building financial infrastructure that genuinely empowers users.”

About Kinto

Kinto is a modular exchange and on-chain financial ecosystem designed to provide seamless access to decentralized finance while prioritizing security, compliance, and user control. Built with a smart contract wallet architecture and modular design, Kinto enables users to interact with DeFi, chain abstracted without compromising on security or usability. Kinto is the first blockchain network to feature native KYrachel@angle42.coC and AML enforcement at the blockchain level, along with native wallet insurance and institutional-grade safeguards. Its non-custodial exchange model ensures users retain full control over their assets while benefiting from deep liquidity and efficient market access.

DeCharge, the next-generation EV charging network, has raised $2.5 million seed funding, in a round led by Lemniscap, with participation from Colosseum, Daedalus Angels, EV3 Labs, Echo Fundraiser Chainyoda Jedis, and Levitate Labs. The round was also backed by several notable angels including Nom (Creator of Bonk), Shek (Superteam/Solana), Arnold Lee, Co-founder and CEO of Spherelabs; Vibhu Norby (Founder and CEO of DripHaus), Manan Patel, Founder of DeSights AI; and Mathieu Baudet, Founder of Linera.

Today, for every 33 EVs, there is only a single charger – a bottleneck that is being exacerbated by the ongoing proliferation of autonomous drones and robots. Traditional chargers lack the scalability, efficiency, and intelligence needed to support this exponential growth. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, electric vehicle sales in the first quarter of 2024 increased by approximately 25% compared to the same period in 2023, maintaining a growth rate similar to the year-on-year expansion observed in early 2022.

As electric vehicle (EV) adoption increases worldwide, the need for efficient and widely accessible charging solutions continues to grow.

DeCharge is expanding EV charging infrastructure with a network of DC fast chargers and DeCharge Beast chargers, designed to provide high-speed, accessible, and intelligent charging solutions. By combining ultra-fast DC charging for highways and urban hubs with decentralized DeCharge Beast chargers for everyday use, DeCharge is building a user-first energy network that eliminates range anxiety and ensures seamless, affordable charging for EVs, fleets, robots, and future autonomous vehicles. DeCharge’s AI-powered dynamic pricing and smart routing system is also designed to optimize grid loads, reduce congestion, and enhance the user experience.

DeCharge’s permissionless, community-driven deployment model also enables anyone to become a host, accelerating nationwide access to reliable charging, while giving hosts the chance to earn from charging, advertising, digital displays, and commercial leasing opportunities.

This funding milestone accelerates DeCharge’s mission to expand to 3,000+ locations across the U.S., Europe, Middle East, and emerging economies. As part of DeCharge’s next-generation EV charging network, the company will be extending the reach of VoltBox (Fast Charging DC Chargers) across key highway corridors, logistics hubs, and urban centers, ensuring charging stations are available where drivers actually need them. DeCharge’s H3 Spatial Indexing will also ensure that chargers are deployed in underserved regions, filling gaps in high-demand areas before they become a problem.

Future plans also include the launch of the DeCharge Energy Marketplace, a fully tokenized energy marketplace where EV owners, businesses, and grid operators participate in a self-sustaining energy economy. DeCharge will also be scaling tokenized incentives for charger hosts, fleet operators, and EV users to drive adoption and participation.

Roderik van der Graaf, Founder and Managing Partner of Lemniscap, said: “DeCharge is in prime position to disrupt the traditional EV charging landscape by creating an autonomous, intelligent, and accessible charging network that supports the growing number of electric vehicles worldwide. We wholeheartedly support the team’s mission to create a more sustainable and efficient EV charging network that will accommodate the expanding ecosystem of EVs, autonomous fleets and electrified logistics systems.”

Dr. Prakash Kamaraj, Co-Founder of DeCharge, said: “Our vision is to build the most efficient, intelligent, and future-ready EV charging network. Securing financial backing from some of the most reputable Web3 investors is a huge endorsement for our platform, giving us the financial runway to scale rapidly and continue to integrate renewable energy sources, creating a seamless, cost-effective charging experience for all EV owners.”

Mohan Kuldeep Ponnada, Founder & CEO of DeCharge said: “At DeCharge, we firmly believe the future of mobility will be electric, decentralized, autonomous, and community-powered. We are not just an EV charging company; we are building the energy infrastructure of the future, where anyone can own, deploy, and benefit from energy assets. Sincere thanks to our investors for supporting this important mission.”

https://decrypt.co,What Is ‘Off the Grid’? The Avalanche Shooter Game and GUN Token Plans,https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-off-the-grid-battle-royale-shooter-avalanche,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 21:59:55 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

If you’ve been on the online shooter video game portion of the internet recently, then you’ve likely heard of Off the Grid, a battle royale game that is picking up serious steam with players. Off the Grid topped the Epic Games Store’s list of the most popular free-to-play games soon after release, plus it commanded huge crowds on Twitch. In short: It’s a hit.

But what you might not know is that Off the Grid is a blockchain game built on Avalanche, with plans for a crypto token and the ability to trade rare items as NFTs. While these features aren’t yet fully implemented, it’s fair to say that Off the Grid has already made a bigger splash with mainstream gamers than any previous blockchain game—and the future looks bright.

Here’s what you need to know about Off the Grid, the current early access release, and the crypto and NFT plans ahead.

What is Off the Grid?

Off the Grid is a third-person battle royale shooter that has launched into early access on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store.

Set in a fictional future where cybernetics can augment humans to make them even more deadly, you and two teammates will jump onto the sizable city map and fight it out against other trios to be the last ones standing, just like any good battle royale game.

However, Off The Grid touts itself as an Extraction Royale, adding in some extraction shooter style mechanics as well. In matches, you can find what are essentially loot boxes, and if you either hold them as you win, or manage to extract them at certain locations on the map, then you can use them to unlock cosmetic items or new weapons and skills for your loadouts.

Off the Grid is developed by Gunzilla Games, a studio co-founded by “District 9” and “Chappie” film director Neill Blomkamp—and as the studio’s chief creative officer, his style is strongly felt throughout the game.

The game is built around a future competition that essentially turns the battle royale premise into a televised competition between cybernetically-augmented humans. And unlike battle royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends, Off the Grid promises 60 hours of narrative-driven gameplay, with cinematics that bookend matches and provide added flavor and motivation to the experience.

How do I play Off the Grid?

To play Off The Grid in early access, you simply need to download the free-to-play game on your chosen platform and boot it up, but it’s not quite as simple as it sounds.

Once you have the game downloaded, you simply need to boot it up and play your first game. It’s pretty easy to pick up if you’ve ever played a battle royale before, and there’s already a ton of guides available on the web.

The early access version contains just one mode (Extraction Royale) and the single, but very large map, though the future full release is expected to pack more modes and content. Recently, Gunzilla Games added non-playable characters in specific zones of the map for players to fight with in exchange for loot or even a hex.

Where does crypto come in?

In the initial early access build, there’s no obvious crypto integration. But it’s apparently humming along in the background, and there’s more coming on the horizon.

Off the Grid is being built on GUNZ, a dedicated L1 (or subnet) on the Avalanche blockchain network. Currently, GUNZ is on testnet and the network’s GUN token has yet to go live on mainnet, but those moves are on the horizon. Items in the game are denominated in GUN, which you can also earn by completing missions, however it’s effectively an in-game currency for now.

A screenshot from Off the Grid in early access. Image: Decrypt

However, the game is racking up some serious numbers on the GUNZ testnet, with millions of wallets created during the first week of early access alone, along with millions of daily transactions.

GUNZ will launch its mainnet on March 31, landing right at the tail end of the previously revealed Q1 2025 target. The GUN token will launch on that date and be tradable via Binance, with 400 million tokens—or 4% of the 10 billion token supply—being offered to Binance token stakers via its Launchpool program.

Once live, players will be able to trade and sell in-game items as NFTs on marketplaces and within the game itself. Already there is a thriving black market for Off the Grid skins, with many collectors believing the scene will explode once mainnet hits.

Gunzilla created the GUNZ network to let other developers utilize the tech, as well, so the ambition is for the GUN token to be usable across multiple games in the future.

What's next for Off the Grid?

As mentioned, the GUNZ mainnet will launch on March 31 alongside the GUN token and NFT trading. But that’s not all that’s in the pipeline for Off the Grid.

Agranat told Decrypt in December that the game is looking to add ranked and solo queue modes, as well as open up the remaining 80% of the map to kick off its storyline. As of March 11, only a solo queue has been temporarily added, and a small section of the map was opened up—nowhere near the 80% figure. Interestingly, he also said that he wanted these features to not just be live, but extremely polished before the game hit mainnet. The clock is ticking.

Once the GUNZ network is live, Gunzilla Games will be looking to onboard third-party developers to the ecosystem. Following the hyped launch of Off the Grid, the studio plans to pass on its wisdom to other developers in the industry. Agranat even left the door open for a possible Telegram mini app to be launched as a tool to onboard users to the soon-to-launch Avalanche L1.

We’ll see whether Off the Grid can hold onto its momentum as the game evolves and expands in the near future, and whether mainstream gamers take kindly to the ability to mint and trade NFTs and utilize the future GUN token.

Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton may have lost his longshot bid to dethrone anti-crypto Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts last fall, but the former GOP candidate is already considering another Senate run.

This time he wants to tangle with the state's three-term Junior Sen. Ed Markey.

The political hopeful—a self-identified pro-abortion independent who only recently allied himself with the Republican Party— believes he can use his newfound “name recognition” to launch a successful campaign against Markey, a beloved career politician with deep roots in New England. The challenge, Deaton told Decrypt, will be convincing digital assets industry donors with deep pockets that a pro-crypto newcomer running on a Republican platform can pull off a major political upset in deep-blue Massachusetts.

“It’s a race I can win, quite frankly,” Deaton said, speaking of a potential matchup against Markey, who plans to run for a fourth Senate term in 2026. But, “it depends if the crypto industry has written off Massachusetts.”

Asked which donors he would like to court during his next potential political run, Deaton named Club for Growth and Fairshake. “Obviously, the big players,” he said.

Last year, crypto industry players emerged as some of the largest corporate donors of the U.S. election cycle, wielding outsized influence on congressional races across the country.

Pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake’s $300 million blitz helped catapult more than four dozen digital asset industry allies to victory in congressional races across the country. Since then, the organization has added more than $100 million to its coffers for the 2026 Midterm elections.

The support of Fairshake, which did not bankroll Deaton in the 2024 election cycle, might help Deaton’s longshot bid to unseat Markey. But to court donors, the political hopeful will first have to prove that he can court the vote.

“No one wants to donate to a lost cause,” Deaton said. “[Donors] are in the data.”

Although midterm elections are more than a year away, Deaton is planning to launch an “all-issues” podcast on various kitchen-table topics within the next month—a move that could raise his profile among voters in Massachusetts. The former GOP candidate is also exploring a radio show opportunity with a Massachusetts-based station, he told Decrypt.

“Politically speaking, [there’s this idea that] a Republican will never win so we’re not going to spend any money on them,” Deaton said. But, “if they all see that I can win and get behind it, then we could win.”

An XRP Lawyer Jumps into the Political Ring

Deaton, a 57-year-old social media personality and XRP holder with nearly 400,000 followers on X, entered the political scene last year, shortly after moving to the Bay State with ambitions of running against Sen. Warren in a race that most critics deemed unwinnable.

“She literally announced her plans to run on an anti-crypto army,” Deaton told Decrypt, adding that Warren had “gaslighted” the crypto community.

“It offended me,” he said. “So I got in the race.”

Initially known to many of his peers in the Massachusetts Republican Party as “that crypto weirdo,” Deaton nevertheless clinched the party’s nomination for the U.S. Senate last fall. He bootstrapped his campaign with a $1 million loan issued by himself, in addition to accepting donations from more than half a dozen crypto industry allies, including Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

The funds didn’t make much of a difference. “I got beat,” Deaton recalled.

But Deaton says that challenging Warren was important partly to expose her views on issues where he feels she is out of touch, including digital assets.

“No one was gonna beat her,” Deaton said. “But, I didn’t want her to have a free pass.

Advocating for Pro-Crypto Policies

Deaton told Decrypt he intends to continue raising his voice on issues that matter within and beyond the crypto community, whether from the halls of Congress or on X.

On the crypto front, he cited the importance of U.S. regulators enacting more protections for retail investors in a way that supports innovation stateside. He also stressed the need for the crypto community to maintain its focus on “meat and potatoes” issues, such as revamping decades-old securities laws and advancing a crypto markets structure bill through Congress, even as President Donald Trump issues a flurry of executive orders that reduce oversight on the crypto industry.

“I am worried that we’re going from one extreme to the other extreme,” Deaton said on the U.S.’ regulatory environment for crypto. “I love the fact that the boot of the government is off the neck of the industry…let’s make sure that we don’t just go to the other extreme without any real legislation.”

Deaton also shared his thoughts on the Trump-affiliated Official Trump meme coin.

“I really wasn’t a fan of that, personally,” Deaton said.

When it launched, “I literally put my head down,” he recalled. “This is just not a good look.”

Asked about Layer-1 blockchain Solana’s conference advertisement that evoked culture war tropes and became the object of ridicule on Crypto Twitter earlier this month, he said, “I think that technology needs to stay as neutral as possible and stay away from politics.”

“For the last four years… the crypto industry has been fighting for its survival,” he added. “The next four years, we’re fighting for our legitimacy.”

As Bitcoin mining grows more competitive and challenging, industry leaders are looking to cash in on AI data centers—but it’s no easy feat.

At the Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida this week, leading miners said navigating the shift to AI requires skill and care.

“In the long-term, [AI] is a big trend,” Paul Li, CEO of mining technology provider Fog Hashing, said during a talk. “We cannot miss that. You [miners] need to go far this year, as the demand for compute power AI compute is huge.”

In recent months, following the last halving which cut mining rewards in half, and amid a crypto markets slump, Bitcoin miners have been trying to slim down their costs.

Bitcoin miners had already been eyeing AI for some time. Both industries use huge amounts of energy—and are constantly on the prowl to get it cheap. Bitcoin was recently trading at about $87,202, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, although it is well off its record high above $108,000 set in January, according to data provider CoinGecko.

When Bitcoin’s price falls and minting new digital coins isn’t generating enough revenue, some miners have pivoted their infrastructure to address AI demand.

As they are familiar with running data centers, they can be faster and more efficient than other facilities serving AI. “It’s similar to mining to a degree,” Hiveon Energy boss Andrii Garanin told Decrypt. “A data center is a data center.”

Finding staff is easy as well—the industry has been around for a long-time while Bitcoin mining is new—although there are headwinds, miners say.

“In terms of infrastructure, it’s completely different,” Shanon Squires from Compass Mining told Decrypt. “A Bitcoin mining farm is like a chicken coop compared to a tier three data center—it’s not even close,” he continued, noting that the set-up was more complex, with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning essential for setting up an operation.

Bitcoin miners may sometimes turn off, when they want to relieve pressure on the power grid. Shutting down operations temporarily doesn’t matter, because the network is decentralized.

But this is a no-go when running an AI data center, said Squires. “We’re interruptible [as Bitcoin miners], whereas a traditional data center needs (to be) on 100% of the time,” he said, adding that this ups costs big time.

Off the Grid creator Gunzilla Games will debut its Avalanche L1 blockchain GUNZ Network and its native GUN token on March 31, living up to its earlier Q1 2025 launch estimate.

Alongside the network launch, the chain’s native gas token GUN will be immediately tradable on Binance with the seed tag applied, indicating that it comes from an “innovative project” and that the token may be subject to greater volatility and risk.

“The biggest AAA gaming ecosystem in Web3 is heading to Binance— the world’s leading exchange,” the GUNZ network’s official X account posted.

Introducing $GUN on Binance Launchpool! 🦾 The biggest AAA gaming ecosystem in web3 is heading to @Binance— the world’s leading exchange. 🔗Read More: https://t.co/DeZeHCCc7s — GUNZ Official (@GUNbyGUNZ) March 27, 2025

GUN will have a total supply of 10 billion tokens, 400 million or 4% of which will be allotted for rewards for token stakers via Binance Launchpool.

The GUNZ Network launch comes just three months after Gunzilla Games teamed up with investment firm Delphi Ventures to aid in the creation of the GUNZ Foundation, a nonprofit designed to oversee the network launch and its token.

Given the late-month announcement as the Q1 window faded, the news led to a drastic shift in prediction market odds on MYRIAD, where traders were wagering on whether or not Off the Grid would hit mainnet by the end of Q1. (MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt’s parent company, DASTAN).

At 7:00am ET on Thursday, MYRIAD odds stood at nearly 75% in favor of “No”—but quickly flipped to 73% “Yes” by 10:00am ET, after the news broke. Currently, however, users appear doubtful that the launch will happen as planned, with only 43% of MYRIAD users picking ""Yes"" as of this writing.

Once the mainnet is live, players of the game will now be able to freely trade in-game assets like weapons and skins, as well as openly trade the GUN token.

“GUNZ is the first-ever platform in a triple-A game that gives you the option to turn your items into tradable NFTs inside the game’s marketplace or elsewhere,” says the network’s website.

Prior to mainnet, users playing Off the Grid have been interacting with the GUNZ testnet, accruing GUN tokens and in-game items by playing the battle royale shooter. It’s expected that testnet GUN token balances will be reset when mainnet launches, but unique assets will be kept.

Some users have already begun trading of those assets, opting not to wait for mainnet launch and instead utilizing unofficial “black markets” to buy or sell rare items, sometimes for thousands of dollars each. Soon they won’t need to do so.

Gunzilla Games’ Off the Grid, which is available via PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, burst onto the scene in early access in October 2024, garnering attention from gamers in crypto and beyond. The GUNZ network will also be utilized by other studios for their own games, with the GUN token used across titles.

A representative for Gunzilla Games did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.

Discover SCENE

FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried isn’t killing time with Sean “Diddy” Combs in New York anymore.

Following a behind-bars appearance on the “The Tucker Carlson Show” earlier this month, the one-time crypto wunderkind has been shipped to Oklahoma.

Bankman-Fried is currently being held at FTC Oklahoma City, a transfer center with around 1,450 inmates, according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons. Days ago, he was at Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, where the former hip-hop mogul awaits trial. It is likely the penultimate stop for SBF before he lands in a prison where he will serve the rest of his 25-year sentence for defrauding users of the exchange he co-founded.

Instead of taking a long bus ride, often described by inmates as “diesel therapy,” Bankman-Fried likely hitched a ride via “Con Air,” according to Sam Mangel, a white-collar prison consultant.

“You’re shackled on an airplane,” Mangel told Decrypt. “It is a usually very old [McDonnell Douglas] DC-9 that has no amenities whatsoever.”

The disgraced 33-year-old, who celebrated his birthday around the time of his unsanctioned jailhouse interview, was awoken around 3 a.m. Eastern Time before saying goodbye to MDC, The Wall Street Journal first reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.

For Bankman-Fried, the facility’s “barrack-style” living space for high-profile inmates had been home since August 2023, when his bail was revoked over witness tampering concerns.

Bankman-Fried was sentenced after a Manhattan jury found him guilty on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. To this day, he maintains his innocence, recently saying, “I don’t think I’m a criminal,” as he works toward appealing his conviction.

Bankman-Fried’s trial exposed a sweeping fraud scheme at FTX, which involved secretly siphoning billions of dollars in customer funds to finance risky investments, donate to U.S. politicians, and purchase luxury real estate in the Bahamas—where the firm was based.

It’s unlikely that Bankman-Fried will be held in Oklahoma for long, Mangel said. Most of the consultant’s clients are held there for less than two weeks before being sent elsewhere.

Bankman-Fried recently broke his silence on X, formerly known as Twitter. Last month, he mused about the difficulty of firing employees and corporate management.

Bankman-Fried’s legal team has pushed him to serve out his sentence closer to his parents’ home near Stanford University in California, per The Wall Street Journal.

Bankman-Fried will likely end up in a minimal-security facility, possibly in Lompoc, California, Mangel said. Last May, he was told he was heading to prison in Mendota, California, according to a separate report from The Wall Street Journal.

Though his parents are reportedly pursuing a pardon from U.S. President Donald Trump, Bankman-Fried’s name still serves as a wedge on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren hurled it toward Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, during the former commissioner’s confirmation hearing.

“Mr. Atkins has spent almost his entire career helping billionaire CEOs like Sam Bankman-Fried, who committed one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history,” she said, referring to work done previously by Atkins’ consultancy firm.

https://decrypt.co,Wyoming Stablecoin Is Just a State-Issued CBDC by Another Name: Rep. Tom Emmer,https://decrypt.co/311969/wyoming-stablecoin-cbdc-another-name-emmer,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 16:44:00 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) laid into Wyoming’s accelerating plans to issue its own stablecoin Thursday, issuing a rare rebuke of a fellow Republican crypto initiative.

“I respect the vote of the Wyoming people, however, I personally am vehemently against any government issuing a tokenized version of its currency,” Emmer told Decrypt. “At the federal level, this would be considered a central bank digital currency.”

Central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs—digital versions of a state’s fiat currency—have in recent years become a favored boogeyman of Republican politicians. GOP governors and President Donald Trump alike have worked to ban the development of CBDCs in the United States, given their perceived threat to user privacy. Many Republicans have taken to dubbing CBDCs as “Big Brother’s digital dollar.”

That’s because central bank digital currencies, unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are managed by a central issuer that could have the ability to freeze funds or otherwise control how these currencies are spent. And while lacking the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin, CBDCs come with all the transparency: Every transaction made with a “digital dollar,” for instance, would be available to the central issuer for scrutiny.

And yet, on Wednesday, Wyoming’s Republican governor, Mark Gordon, announced that his state is planning to issue a cryptocurrency as soon as July: its long-planned stablecoin, WYST.

Those involved with the project insist that the stablecoin, even if it is issued by the Wyoming government, is nothing like a CBDC. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies generally pegged to the price of the U.S. dollar, which allow users to trade in and out of crypto without exiting digital assets completely. They also serve as dollar equivalents in markets where dollars are restricted.

Anthony Apollo, executive director of Wyoming’s Stable Token Commission, maintained Thursday that even though he too is opposed to the notion of a state-backed CBDC, WYST is an entirely different type of product.

“Wyoming cares significantly about privacy,” Apollo told Decrypt. “We're going to have rules in place about what we can and can't collect, how we can treat that data, and how we can act on that data.”

The director added that the exact nature of such policies is still being ironed out internally. Wyoming’s government is also weighing relying on a third party like a centralized crypto exchange to handle data collection for WYST.

One of the chief criticisms levied against government issued tokens, though, is that whatever rules one administration makes about them, could always be changed by future ones.

Apollo went on to argue that unlike CBDCs, which are digitally issued by a central bank the same way cash is created, Wyoming’s stablecoin will be fully backed by reserves like U.S. Treasuries, and so does not pose inflationary risk.

“Wyoming is not a central bank,” Apollo said. “We are not issuing any cash.”

But why is a solidly red state attempting to issue any form of government-backed digital asset?

Backstage at the DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, Gov. Mark Gordon and Apollo made the case that a public stablecoin could offer key benefits private issuers—such as Circle, the issuer of USDC—would balk at, including lower fees and flexibility on touchier transactions like firearms purchases. Interest accrued from the token’s Treasury reserves would also fund the state’s school system.

But the token’s rollout has certainly brought with it questions about the role of government in issuing such a product. Apollo said it's fairly common for him to have to field questions about whether WYST is a CBDC or not at public hearings and even in conversations with state legislators.

The topic is currently front of mind in Wyoming. Just weeks ago, Gordon signed a bill into law prohibiting the development of a CBDC in the state. The bill’s sponsor said a key purpose of the legislation was “to send a clear message to Congress: that Wyoming rejects the idea of essentially controlled digital currency.”",decrypt

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a noted crypto skeptic, scrutinized Paul Atkins’ connections to the digital assets industry on Thursday, accusing U.S. President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman of lackluster transparency.

The former SEC commissioner has “breathtaking” financial conflicts, Warren said during Atkins’ confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, arguing there are steps he can take to “commit to a higher standard of government ethics.”

Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, critics say the regulator took an overzealous approach, pursuing enforcement actions against a long list of crypto firms when rules are unclear.

Atkins, if confirmed, has vowed to follow a different approach. During Atkins’ previous stint at the regulator, he scrutinized enforcement activities, and said crypto guidelines currently are “ambiguous and nonexistent” on Thursday.

In 2017, Atkins founded the risk consultancy Patomak Global Partners, which has advised several crypto firms, including the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. Atkins’ stake is worth $25 million to $50 million, per Reuters.

Atkins plans on selling his Patomak stake, but Warren asked if he’d disclose “who the buyers are and how much they pay,” to ensure people aren’t buying access to Wall Street’s top cop.

Atkins demurred, saying he’s “abided by” White House guidance.

“Some people might call that a pre-bribe,” Warren countered.

Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda has adopted a crypto-friendly stance in Gensler’s shadow, retreating from enforcement cases and working on clearer guidance through a specialized task force. On Thursday, Atkins vowed to craft a “rational, coherent and principled approach” to regulating crypto.

As lawmakers weigh digital assets regulation on Capitol Hill, Warren has raised other red flags, recently saying a stablecoin bill is an attempt to “enrich” the president.

On Thursday, Warren repeatedly cited FTX’s disgraced crypto mogul, describing it as part of a larger pattern of benefiting the world’s corporate power players.

“Mr. Atkins has spent almost his entire career helping billionaire CEOs like Sam Bankman-Fried, who committed one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history,” she said, adding his inability to foresee the 2008 financial crisis would make him a “dangerous” regulator.

https://blockonomi.com,Pepe (PEPE) Price: 11% Surge Signals Potential for Additional 25% Growth,https://blockonomi.com/pepe-pepe-price-11-surge-signals-potential-for-additional-25-growth/,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:49:32 GMT","Pepe, the world’s third-largest meme cryptocurrency, has seen an 11% price increase over the past 24 hours. The frog-themed token is showing strong signs of recovery after breaking through a key resistance level.

On March 26, PEPE recorded an 11% gain as the overall crypto market began to rebound. This price surge followed PEPE’s breakout from a descending trendline that had been in place since early February 2025.

At press time, PEPE is trading at approximately $0.0000087. The price jump comes despite a 10% drop in trading volume, which indicates lower participation from traders compared to the previous day.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis suggests that PEPE remains in bullish territory as long as it stays above the $0.0000080 level. If this support holds, the token could see another 25% price increase in the near term.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PEPE currently stands at 59. This reading signals a strong bullish trend while leaving room for additional upside potential.

PEPE’s recent performance marks a major turnaround from earlier in the month. The token experienced a 35% decline in the first half of March, bottoming out at $0.000057 on March 10.

Since mid-March, PEPE has erased all of these losses. The recovery appears to be gaining momentum as on-chain metrics show decreased selling pressure across the market.

Data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment reveals growing investor confidence in PEPE. There has been a marked increase in holders with balances between 100,000-1,000,000 and 1,000,000-10,000,000 tokens.

Social media sentiment around PEPE has also improved. The sentiment score has risen from -0.77 at the start of March to +0.387 currently, reflecting growing optimism among traders and investors online.

According to IntoTheBlock, PEPE’s holding time of transacted coins over the past two weeks has jumped to 2.67 trillion. This metric indicates that investors are holding onto their tokens rather than selling them.

The In/Out of Money Around Price (IOMAP) indicator shows strong support near the $0.0000080 level. Over 10,000 addresses hold approximately 26 trillion tokens at this price point.

This support level exceeds the unrealized loss volume between $0.0000090 and $0.000010, suggesting that PEPE is well-positioned to break above the $0.000010 mark in the short term.

From a technical standpoint, PEPE has broken above a prolonged downtrend on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reading has bounced into positive territory, further confirming the bullish outlook.

If current trends hold, analysts predict PEPE could climb to $0.000014 around the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Should market conditions continue to improve, the token might reach as high as $0.000020.

However, if PEPE fails to breach the $0.000010 resistance level, the price could fall back to $0.0000053.",blockonomi

Ethereum recently tested the $1,980 support level after failing to break above $2,100

ETH is trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average with resistance at $2,050

Technical patterns show a potential bearish flag formation on the daily chart

Some analysts predict a possible breakout beyond $2,100 based on chart patterns

Long-term comparisons suggest similarities to the 2018-2020 pattern before ETH’s major rally

Ethereum has entered a consolidation phase following a recent price pullback. The second-largest cryptocurrency tested the $1,980 support level after failing to maintain momentum above $2,100. Currently trading around $2,064, ETH shows mixed signals as traders watch key technical levels.

The price recently bounced from a low of $1,982 and moved back above the $2,000 level. This recovery represents a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the decline from the $2,097 swing high.

ETH is now trading below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Technical indicators show a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,050 on the hourly chart.

The cryptocurrency faces hurdles near the $2,040 level. This coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,097 high to the $1,982 low.

On the upside, ETH must clear several key resistance levels to gain upward momentum. The first major resistance sits at $2,050, followed by a stronger barrier at $2,100.

If Ethereum breaks above the $2,100 level, it could potentially target the $2,150 zone. Further strength could push the price toward $2,250 or even $2,320 in the coming sessions.

On the downside, ETH has key support at the $2,000 level. The first major support level is at $1,980, which recently prevented further decline.

If Ethereum breaks below $1,980, the next support levels are at $1,920 and $1,880. Beyond that, the $1,810 level would become an important zone to watch.

Looking at the broader picture, Ethereum’s weekly chart shows concerning patterns. ETH formed a triple-top pattern around the $4,000 level, with tests in March, May, and November of last year.

The cryptocurrency has broken below the neckline of this pattern at $2,138. It has also fallen below an ascending trendline that connected the lowest swings since July 2022.

Adding to the bearish signals, ETH has dropped below both the 50-week and 200-week moving averages. Some analysts suggest this could lead to a decline toward $1,140 based on technical projections.

The daily chart reveals that ETH has stabilized recently, moving from a low of $1,763 to a high of $2,130. However, it remains below the 50-day moving average, suggesting bears still have control.

A bearish flag pattern has formed on the daily chart. This continuation indicator often leads to a bearish breakdown when confirmed.

Market Analysis

Some market watchers also point to a rising wedge pattern with two ascending and converging trendlines. This formation typically precedes a downward move, with a potential target at $1,763.

Not all analysts share the bearish outlook. Some experts believe Ethereum could break beyond $2,100 soon based on chart patterns and price action.

Analyst Crypto Patel identified a setup suggesting upward momentum. He noted that ETH is bouncing off a key area around $2,064, which he calls a “mitigation block” showing strong buying interest.

Patel targets $2,128 as a swing high liquidity zone that could trigger a sharp move upward. His analysis includes a stop-loss at $2,027 to limit potential downside.

Another analyst, TimeFreedomROB, compared Ethereum’s current weekly pattern to what happened between 2018 and 2020. He suggests the current pattern resembles the setup before ETH’s massive rally from under $100 to nearly $4,800.

For Ethereum to confirm a return to an upward trend on the weekly chart, it needs to climb back above the $2,200 to $2,400 range.

As of the latest data, Ethereum has gained 6% over the past week. Its market value stands at approximately $250 billion, with daily trading volume around $11.71 billion.",blockonomi

The Blockchain Group has purchased 580 Bitcoin worth approximately $50 million

The company’s stock has jumped 226% since beginning its Bitcoin strategy in November

This is the largest of three Bitcoin purchases made by the organization

The Blockchain Group now holds 620 BTC total, valued at around $54 million

GameStop also announced plans to purchase Bitcoin on the same day, with shares jumping 12%

The Blockchain Group, a France-based company, has added 580 Bitcoin to its treasury. This purchase is worth about $50.64 million with Bitcoin trading at $87,311. This marks the largest Bitcoin purchase for the company since it began collecting the cryptocurrency.

The company started its Bitcoin strategy in November 2024. Since then, its stock price has risen 226%.

The Blockchain Group made its first Bitcoin purchase on November 5. This was the same day Donald Trump won the US presidential election. This timing put the company in position to benefit from Bitcoin’s rally to $100,000 in December.

The second purchase came on December 4. The company bought 25 Bitcoin when the price was around $96,000. Bitcoin reached six figures the next day.

Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Expansion Pays Off

The latest purchase of 580 Bitcoin brings their total holdings to 620 BTC. This is worth approximately $54 million at current prices.

The company funded this purchase through a convertible bond issue announced earlier in March. Swissquote Bank executed the transaction.

The Blockchain Group is listed on Euronext Paris. This is Europe’s second-largest stock exchange by market capitalization.

The company describes itself as a “global umbrella” of businesses. These focus on data intelligence, AI, and decentralized technology.

Since beginning its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the company’s stock has risen to 0.48 euros ($0.52). This represents a 225% increase in share price.

The latest Bitcoin purchase announcement came after market close on March 26. This coincided with news from another company making similar moves.

GameStop announced plans to purchase Bitcoin on the same day. Following this news, GameStop shares jumped nearly 12%.

GameStop plans to finance its Bitcoin purchase through debt financing. After markets closed, the company announced a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

The Blockchain Group has introduced new key performance indicators. These include “BTC Yield,” “BTC Gain,” and “BTC € Gain.” These metrics track the company’s Bitcoin Treasury strategy performance.

Since the beginning of the year, the group reports a BTC Yield of approximately 710%. They also report a BTC Gain of 283.9 BTC.

The company’s strategy draws inspiration from Strategy. Strategy is currently the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury firm, holding over 506,137 Bitcoin. Strategy maintained a 12-week consecutive Bitcoin buying streak between November and January.

Alexandre Laizet serves as Deputy CEO and Director of Bitcoin Strategy at The Blockchain Group. In an interview, he described their approach: “The essence of our strategy is simple: accumulate Bitcoin, never sell it, and hold it indefinitely.”

The company aims to maximize Bitcoin per share over time. This involves accumulating Bitcoin through excess cash flow and capital raises.

Laizet believes Bitcoin offers a unique opportunity. He sees it as a way to engage in mergers and acquisitions every few months. The asset delivers approximately 60% annualized growth over four years without typical M&A execution risks.

The goal is to enhance long-term shareholder value through capital-raising activities. Laizet predicts institutional Bitcoin adoption will take 10-15 years to achieve widespread acceptance.

“The next phase is to establish necessary links between traditional finance and the emerging Bitcoin-driven financial ecosystem,” Laizet explained. This includes adding Bitcoin to corporate treasuries and enabling transactions through stablecoins and blockchain-based money market funds.

The Blockchain Group is backed by Adam Back. It was founded in 2008 and became the first European company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy when it launched this initiative on November 5, 2024.",blockonomi

Cardano (ADA) price currently hovers around $0.74 after recovering over 4% this week

Long-to-short ratio reached a monthly high of 1.15, indicating increased bullish sentiment

Stablecoin market cap on Cardano hit an all-time high of $30.77 million, showing growing DeFi adoption

Technical analysis suggests potential for 13% gains if ADA breaks above $0.77 resistance

Exchange outflows of $13.75 million worth of ADA in 24 hours suggest accumulation by whales

Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of bullish momentum this week as on-chain metrics point to growing trader confidence in the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

The digital asset is currently trading at around $0.74, having recovered more than 4% so far this week. This recovery comes after weeks of consolidation in a tight range between $0.69 and $0.75.

Data from Coinglass shows that the long-to-short ratio for Cardano has reached 1.15, its highest level in over a month. A ratio above one means more traders are betting on price increases rather than decreases.

Another positive signal comes from Cardano’s stablecoin sector. According to DefiLlama, the total market capitalization of stablecoins on the Cardano network reached an all-time high of $30.77 million earlier this week.

This rise in stablecoin activity indicates growing utility and adoption of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications on the Cardano blockchain. More users are turning to Cardano-based financial tools, which could boost demand for the native ADA token.

Technical Analysis

From a technical perspective, Cardano is approaching a key resistance level. The cryptocurrency faced rejection around its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.77 on Wednesday, resulting in a 2.16% decline.

Chart analysts point to $0.77 as a crucial level to watch. If ADA breaks above this resistance and maintains a daily close above it, the price could rally by 13% to test the next resistance at $0.83.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 49 and is moving upward toward the neutral level of 50. This suggests fading bearish momentum in recent trading sessions.

Further supporting the bullish case, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart showed a bullish crossover on Tuesday. This technical signal often indicates the start of an upward trend.

On-chain data from Coinglass reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of $13.75 million worth of ADA tokens in the past 24 hours. Such outflows typically indicate that investors are moving tokens to private wallets for long-term holding rather than selling.

These exchange outflows can reduce selling pressure in the market and potentially trigger upward price movement as supply available for immediate trading decreases.

However, traders should exercise caution despite these positive signals. Data from Santiment shows a spike in the Age Consumed metric, indicating movement from previously dormant wallets.

This activation of dormant tokens could lead to increased selling pressure if long-term holders decide to take profits at current price levels.

Looking at lower timeframes, some analysts have identified an ascending triangle pattern forming on the 4-hour chart. This pattern, bounded by horizontal resistance at $0.775 and a rising trendline below, often precedes breakout movements.

A successful breakout above the triangle pattern could accelerate buying pressure and push Cardano’s price up by 15% to challenge resistance at $0.90, with a potential further rise toward the $1 mark.

The Bollinger Bands indicator on the 12-hour timeframe appears to be squeezing, which typically signals an impending increase in volatility. This could result in a strong price move in either direction once the consolidation phase ends.

Trading volume for ADA has dropped by 18% in the past 24 hours, suggesting some hesitation among market participants ahead of a potential breakout. Lower volume during consolidation is common before major price movements.

For now, Cardano remains in a decisive phase, with technical indicators and on-chain metrics suggesting building momentum for a potential upward move if key resistance levels can be overcome.",blockonomi

Technical indicators show BNB faces resistance at $630 with support at $622 and $615

BNB is up 13.4% in the 14-day charts despite a 0.3% daily dip

CoinCodex predicts BNB could reach $1,000 by April 10 and potentially hit $1,610 by May 11

BNB price is showing strong recovery signs after finding solid support around the $600 level. The cryptocurrency is now trading above the $620 resistance zone as the broader market enters what appears to be another bullish phase.

The price movement comes as Bitcoin has reclaimed the $88,000 price point. This follows BTC’s recent drop to levels below $79,000.

BNB is currently experiencing mixed performance across different timeframes. The asset shows a small daily decline of 0.3% and a 1% drop in monthly charts.

However, the bigger picture reveals more positive momentum. BNB has gained 2.5% in weekly charts and an impressive 13.4% over the 14-day period.

Since March 2024, BNB has increased by 6.4%. This recovery is part of a broader market trend that has pushed the global cryptocurrency market cap back to $3 trillion.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows BNB broke above several key resistance levels including $618 and $610. The price even recovered above $625, following similar patterns seen with Ethereum and Bitcoin.

BNB managed to break above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. This level is calculated from the recent downward move from the $645 swing high to the $615 low.

Currently, BNB trades below $630 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. The price faces resistance near the $628 level on the upside.

A bearish trend line is forming with resistance at $627 on the hourly chart. Additional resistance sits near the $630 level, which corresponds to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level.

If BNB can break clearly above the $630 zone, the price could move higher toward the $638 level. A successful close above $638 might set the stage for a larger move toward the $650 resistance.

Should BNB fail to clear the $630 resistance, another decline could begin. The first support on the downside is near $622, with major support at $615.

The main support remains at $600. A break below this level could take BNB toward $585 or potentially $565 in a larger decline.

Technical indicators provide additional insight into BNB’s current state. The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone, while the RSI remains above the 50 level.

BNB reached an all-time high of $788.84 in December last year. The current price represents a 20% drop from that peak.

According to predictions from CoinCodex, BNB may enter another bullish phase in the coming weeks. The platform anticipates continued rally for the foreseeable future.

CoinCodex forecasts BNB to breach the $1,000 mark by April 10. Their most bullish prediction suggests BNB could hit a new peak of $1,610.24 by May 11.

If realized, this would represent a 154.64% price increase from current levels. However, CoinCodex doesn’t expect BNB to maintain prices above $1,000 for long, predicting a correction shortly after reaching the peak.

The broader crypto market recovery appears linked to several factors. The SEC dropping its litigation against Ripple and announcing four more crypto roundtables may have improved sentiment.

Additionally, the US announcement about easing tariffs might have boosted overall investor confidence. These developments collectively appear to be driving the current market recovery.

For BNB, the immediate focus remains on whether it can clear the $630 resistance level. This will likely determine if the recovery continues toward higher targets or faces another pullback.",blockonomi

The U.S. Senate voted 70-28 to repeal an IRS rule that would have required DeFi platforms to report taxpayer information

The resolution now heads to President Trump, who is expected to sign it

Critics argued the rule was “fundamentally unworkable” since DeFi platforms operate through automated code without human oversight

The White House’s AI and crypto czar David Sacks has expressed support for killing the rule

Industry groups like the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund opposed the rule through lobbying and lawsuits

President Donald Trump is expected to sign a resolution that will repeal a Biden-era IRS rule requiring decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to report taxpayer information. This comes after the U.S. Senate voted 70-28 on Wednesday to approve the measure, delivering a victory for crypto industry advocates.

The rule would have expanded the definition of “brokers” to include DeFi platforms. Under this definition, these platforms would need to collect and report information about users and their transactions to the IRS.

Critics of the rule argued it was impossible to implement. DeFi platforms operate through automated code on blockchains. They function without human intervention.

These platforms often have no way to identify their users. This makes compliance with traditional broker reporting requirements extremely difficult.

The resolution to overturn the rule passed with strong bipartisan support. Many Democrats joined Republicans in voting against the rule.

Industry Celebrates as Congressional Pushback Succeeds

The House of Representatives had earlier passed a similar resolution with a 292-132 vote. The measure needed to start in the House due to constitutional rules about budget matters.

There was some procedural delay in the process. The Senate initially passed a version of the resolution in early March.

However, the House cited constitutional concerns over how budget matters are handled. This led to a restart of the process with the House passing its own version.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated his office plans to work with the IRS and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. They aim to “rescind and amend” related crypto tax rules affecting digital asset firms.

The White House’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, has publicly supported the resolution. He stated that the Trump administration “strongly supports” the passage of the measure.

Industry groups have been fighting against the rule since it was introduced. The Blockchain Association, DeFi Education Fund, and Texas Blockchain Council filed a joint lawsuit in December.

These groups claimed the Treasury went beyond its authority by expanding the definition of “broker.” They argued that DeFi interfaces don’t control transactions or user funds.

Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith praised the Senate vote. She stated the group looked forward “to taking this harmful rule off the books for good.”

Not everyone supported repealing the rule. Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett opposed the resolution. He argued it creates a “loophole that would be exploited by wealthy tax cheats, drug traffickers and terrorist financiers.”

Doggett called the repeal a “special interest exemption” from IRS disclosures. He claimed it would make tax evasion and money laundering easier.

The rule was part of the Biden administration’s effort to close tax gaps related to crypto transactions. It aimed to increase visibility into blockchain-based financial activity.

If President Trump signs the resolution as expected, the expanded definition of brokers will be formally removed from IRS enforcement policy. This would prevent DeFi platforms from having to implement traditional reporting requirements.

Industry experts believe this move aligns with the Trump administration’s more crypto-friendly approach. The administration has signaled its intention to support innovation in the blockchain space.",blockonomi

SHIB burn rate jumped by an astounding 8,400% as anonymous wallet destroyed tokens

Technical indicators show strong bullish momentum with RSI at 61

Analysts predict potential 2x gains with price targets between $0.0000134 and $0.0000297 by end of March

SHIB futures open interest increased 30% to over $166.74 million, signaling strong trader demand

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has jumped 16% this week, trading at $0.00001553 as of March 26, 2025. This price movement comes alongside a spike in trading volume and a massive token burn event.

The cryptocurrency has seen its trading volume increase by 228% over the past 30 days. This surge in market activity indicates growing interest from traders and investors alike.

One of the key drivers behind this price action is an extraordinary 8,400% increase in the SHIB burn rate. An anonymous wallet destroyed a large number of tokens, reducing the circulating supply.

When tokens are burned, they are permanently removed from circulation. This reduction in supply can have a positive effect on price if demand remains steady or increases.

Technical indicators are supporting this bullish move. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits at 61, showing strong upward momentum without yet reaching overbought territory.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has formed a bullish crossover. This signal typically indicates continued upward price movement in the near term.

SHIB has broken above a key downtrend line that now serves as major support. This technical breakthrough often precedes further gains as it confirms a shift in market sentiment.

Market Analysis

Analysts suggest that if SHIB maintains support at the $0.000012 level, it could soon reach $0.000016. A breakout above current resistance could push prices toward $0.000019.

For SHIB to continue its bull rally, it needs to breach the $0.00002341 resistance level. Success here could see prices reach $0.00002606, with $0.00003306 as the next major target.

The ecosystem supporting SHIB is also expanding. ShibaSwap 2.0, a decentralized exchange on the Shibarium network, has contributed to improved market participation and liquidity.

SHIB’s long-to-short ratio has reached 1.08. This metric indicates more traders are betting on price increases even during temporary dips.

Looking ahead, price predictions for 2025 suggest SHIB will trade between $0.0000134 and $0.0000297 by the end of March. This represents a potential return on investment of 74.7%.

By December 2025, analysts expect SHIB to trade between $0.0000193 and $0.0000243. This would yield an estimated ROI of 42.9% from current levels.

The 2026 outlook is even more optimistic, with predictions ranging from $0.00005489 to $0.00008854. This represents a potential 485% return on investment from today’s prices.

Some market watchers are drawing parallels to SHIB’s 2021 trajectory. They suggest the token could be on the verge of a parabolic rally similar to what occurred when it reached its all-time high of $0.00008854 in October 2021.

Chart analysts have identified a cup-and-handle pattern forming since the 2021 peak. The “cup” completed with SHIB’s March 2024 peak at $0.00004567, while current price action is finalizing the “handle” portion of this bullish formation.

According to data from ShibariumScan, the Shibarium network’s total block count has crossed 10 million. This milestone demonstrates increasing adoption of SHIB’s underlying blockchain technology.

Some market analysts anticipate a potential 200% rally for SHIB. If realized, this move could boost the token’s market capitalization to approximately $27 billion from its current $9 billion.

Lucie, Shiba Inu’s marketing lead, recently reiterated the ambitious long-term price target of $0.01 per SHIB. However, she emphasized that reaching this milestone will take time and continued ecosystem development.

Recent burn metrics offer additional support to SHIB’s price. According to Shibburn’s data from March 27, the burn rate surged by 57,291.91% in a single day, with over 1 billion coins permanently removed from circulation.

Despite the overall bullish outlook, some technical indicators suggest caution in the immediate term. The daily chart shows SHIB price has already surpassed the upper Bollinger Band, indicating heightened volatility.

This current level could trigger either a sharp upward move or a temporary pullback for consolidation. Traders should be prepared for either scenario in the short term.

Meanwhile, amid ongoing optimism in the SHIB community, Lucie has floated the idea of a Shiba Inu ETF. This comes as ETF analyst James Seyffart predicted a 75% chance of ETF approval for SHIB’s rival Dogecoin.

SHIB futures open interest has increased by 30%, surpassing $166.74 million according to CoinGlass data. This metric indicates strong demand among futures traders and often precedes continued price movement.

With a current market capitalization of $9 billion, SHIB is approaching entry into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value. Continued price appreciation could cement its position among the largest digital assets.",blockonomi

Analysts predict Dogecoin could reach a new all-time high of $0.80 to $6.00

DOGE whales have accumulated over 200 million coins in the past two weeks

The cryptocurrency has broken through a three-month descending trendline

Current price is around $0.20, up 42% from recent low of $0.1432

Little resistance expected between $0.20 and $0.31 if current support holds

Dogecoin is showing signs of a strong recovery after months of downward movement. The popular meme cryptocurrency is now trading at around $0.20, up over 4% in the last 24 hours.

Several market analysts believe DOGE is setting up for a big move upward. TradingShot recently noted that Dogecoin broke above the Lower Highs trend line that began two months ago.

This technical breakout could be the start of a new bullish phase. TradingShot suggests that while the natural resistance remains at the 1-day MA50 (around $0.30), the recent price action and rebounding from lows indicates a new upward leg has started.

Technical Analysis

The upward momentum is backed by data from Glassnode showing that 7% of DOGE supply is clustered around the $0.20 price level. This concentration could act as a resistance, but if broken, there’s little supply until $0.31.

That gap creates the potential for a sharp 55% increase. The lack of resistance between these price points could allow for quick price movement once volume picks up.

Large holders appear to be betting on this upward move. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that Dogecoin whales have accumulated over 200 million DOGE in the past two weeks alone.

These large investors, holding between 1 million and 10 million DOGE, have increased their holdings to 10.5 billion DOGE. This accumulation is worth approximately $2.14 billion at current prices.

The timing of this whale activity is worth noting. These large buys often happen before price surges, showing confidence despite recent market volatility.

On March 24, the newly formed House of Doge announced “The Official Dogecoin Reserve” with an initial purchase of 10 million DOGE tokens. This corporate wing of the Dogecoin Foundation aims to create a payments ecosystem.

The announcement helped fuel positive sentiment in the Dogecoin community. The foundation has stated that the purchased tokens will be moved to a holding account that will be made public for transparency.

From a technical standpoint, analyst Trader Tardigrade points out that Dogecoin has breached a three-month descending trendline that formed over the course of 2025. This breakout could set up a short-term relief rally.

The more ambitious price predictions are remarkable. Some analysts believe DOGE could reach $0.80 this cycle, surpassing its previous all-time high of $0.73.

Others, like Kamran Asghar, suggest much higher targets. Asghar compared current price action to previous bull cycles where Dogecoin surged over 20,000% and 44,000%. Based on these patterns, he projects a 2,852% rally to $6.

Analyst Doge Lord agrees with the $6 target, citing Elliot Wave theory. According to this analysis, Dogecoin is in the third wave of a five-wave structure on the 7-day timeframe.

After retracing 70% from its December high of $0.4846 to a low of $0.1432, DOGE has rallied 42% from the dip to its current price around $0.20, showing an impressive recovery in a short time frame.",blockonomi

SUI price has surged 6-7% in early trading hours, breaking out of a falling wedge pattern

Walrus Protocol mainnet launch is driving momentum as a major catalyst

VanEck predicts SUI could reach $10 in 2025, with current price around $4.67

SUI has seen 639% increase over the past year and 910% rise from August 2023 lows

After a 30% drop from $2.36 to $1.69, analyst LA𝕏MAN suggests this may be a new buying opportunity

Sui (SUI) cryptocurrency has been making waves in the market with a strong price breakout and promising growth potential. The token is gaining momentum after rebounding from local lows near $2.5, showing healthy accumulation patterns with decreasing volatility.

The price has surged by 6-7% in early trading hours. This move has pushed SUI past larger cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Hedera in market performance.

A key driver behind this growth is the Walrus Protocol mainnet launch. This popular decentralized storage network is powered by the SUI blockchain and serves as a major catalyst for the token’s rising value.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows SUI recently broke out of a falling wedge pattern. This breakout occurred during the previous trading day and signals potential for further upward movement.

The bullish start above the wedge resistance is expected to maintain rally momentum. Both the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Directional Movement Index (DMI) display positive signals with a bullish crossover in the DMI.

However, the Average Directional Index (ADX) continues to decrease. This indicates a drop in rally strength that could lead to consolidation around the local resistance zone of $2.8-$2.85 until more buying volume enters the market.

The current breakout suggests SUI price could trigger a 25% upswing. Analysts believe it may rise above $3 before the end of the month, potentially reaching new all-time highs in the coming days.

Looking at longer-term projections, VanEck has released an optimistic outlook for SUI. The investment firm predicts the token could surpass $10 in 2025, positioning it as one of the top layer-1 cryptocurrencies.

VanEck’s confidence in SUI is reflected in their recently launched Exchange-Traded Note (ETN). This investment product has already shown strong performance with 10.82% growth since its November 2024 launch.

For SUI to reach the $10 mark, its market capitalization would need to expand to $29.3 billion. Analysts consider this feasible when compared to established cryptocurrencies like Tron ($26 billion) and Cardano ($38 billion).

The SUI ecosystem has shown remarkable growth over the past year. Its market capitalization has expanded from under $1 billion to $14 billion, with its DeFi sector reaching $1.8 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Recent strategic partnerships have also bolstered SUI’s position. A collaboration with Ant Digital Technologies focuses on real-world asset tokenization, emphasizing sustainability and innovation in the blockchain space.

For investors who missed earlier opportunities, some analysts see the current price as a potential entry point. After experiencing a 30% decrease from $2.36 to $1.69, crypto analyst LA𝕏MAN has identified key levels to watch: $1.54 as a potential bounce area and a buying zone between $1.36-$1.30.

The token’s overall performance remains impressive despite recent pullbacks. SUI has increased by 639% over the past year and risen 910% from its August 2023 bottom to its current trading level.",blockonomi

A whale manipulated JELLY token’s price on Hyperliquid, causing a $12M unrealized loss to the platform’s liquidity vault

Hyperliquid delisted JELLY perpetual futures and forcibly closed all positions, avoiding losses but raising centralization concerns

Critics including Bitget CEO Gracy Chen compared Hyperliquid to “FTX 2.0” due to its handling of the situation

The HYPE token (Hyperliquid’s native token) dropped nearly 10% following the incident

Total value in Hyperliquid’s liquidity pool (HLP) fell from $283M to $190M after the attack

On March 26, 2025, Hyperliquid, a leading decentralized derivatives exchange, found itself at the center of controversy after taking emergency action to delist JELLY token perpetual futures following what appears to be a calculated price manipulation attack. The incident has sparked heated debate about the true nature of decentralization in crypto trading platforms and caused a sharp decline in Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token.

The trouble began when a whale trader, using wallet address 0xde95, opened a massive $8 million short position on the JELLY token through Hyperliquid. This position, equivalent to 126 million JELLY tokens, represented a substantial portion of the token’s small market cap, which had been hovering between $10-20 million.

The trader then removed the margin collateral needed to maintain the position. This triggered an automatic liquidation protocol, forcing Hyperliquid’s liquidity provider vault (HLP) to take over the massive short position.

With the trap set, the same whale began aggressively purchasing JELLY tokens in the spot market. This buying pressure pushed JELLY’s price dramatically higher, causing its market cap to surge from $10 million to over $50 million in less than an hour.

As JELLY’s price climbed, Hyperliquid’s HLP vault faced an unrealized loss that grew to approximately $12 million. According to analyst Abhi, if JELLY’s market cap had reached $150 million, Hyperliquid could have faced complete insolvency.

Essentially forcing… pic.twitter.com/AI01q7KnZR — Abhi (@0xAbhiP) March 26, 2025

Adding to the drama, a new wallet (0x20e8) opened a large long position on Hyperliquid during the price surge. This account quickly accumulated an unrealized profit of about $8.2 million as JELLY’s price rose.

Major centralized exchanges Binance and OKX added fuel to the fire by listing perpetual futures for JELLY amid the volatility. Some observers, including investigator ZachXBT, suggested that wallets involved in the incident might be connected to these centralized exchanges, though these claims remain unverified.

Facing a growing crisis, Hyperliquid’s validator group held an emergency meeting. They voted to delist JELLY perpetual futures from the platform, adjust JELLY’s oracle price to $0.0095 per token, and forcibly close all open positions related to the token.

These swift actions allowed Hyperliquid to avoid major losses. In fact, the platform secured a net profit of $700,000 from the incident. The Hyper Foundation announced plans to compensate affected users, though wallets suspected of involvement in the manipulation would be excluded.

The Decentralization Debate

While some praised Hyperliquid for taking decisive action to protect the platform and most users, others raised serious questions about the exchange’s claims of decentralization. The ability of a small validator group to delist a token and force-settle positions struck many as contradicting the core principles of decentralized finance.

Gracy Chen, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitget, delivered perhaps the harshest criticism. She compared Hyperliquid to “FTX 2.0,” referencing the failed exchange run by convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried.

#Hyperliquid may be on track to become #FTX 2.0. The way it handled the $JELLY incident was immature, unethical, and unprofessional, triggering user losses and casting serious doubts over its integrity. Despite presenting itself as an innovative decentralized exchange with a… — Gracy Chen @Bitget (@GracyBitget) March 26, 2025

“Despite presenting itself as an innovative decentralized exchange with a bold vision, Hyperliquid operates more like an offshore centralized exchange,” Chen stated. “The decision to close the $JELLY market and force settlement of positions at a favorable price sets a dangerous precedent.”

Chen emphasized that “trust—not capital—is the foundation of any exchange,” adding that once lost, trust is “almost impossible to recover.” She described Hyperliquid’s response as “immature, unethical, and unprofessional.”

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes offered a more cynical take on the situation. “Let’s stop pretending Hyperliquid is decentralized. And then stop pretending traders actually care,” Hayes posted on X (formerly Twitter). He predicted the HYPE token would recover quickly because “degens gonna degen.”

The market impact was clear and immediate. Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token dropped nearly 10% in the 24 hours following the incident, trading below $15. More alarmingly, the total value locked in the HLP fund plummeted from $283 million before the attack to $190 million.

This is not the first time Hyperliquid has faced this type of challenge. On March 12, the platform dealt with a similar crisis when a whale trader intentionally liquidated a $200 million long Ether position, costing HLP depositors around $4 million in losses.

After that earlier incident, Hyperliquid increased collateral requirements for open positions in an attempt to “reduce the systemic impact of large positions with hypothetical market impact upon closing.”

The JELLY token itself has had a volatile history. Launched in January by Venmo co-founder Iqram Magdon-Ismail as part of a Web3 social media project called JellyJelly, the token initially reached a market cap of roughly $250 million before falling to single-digit millions in the weeks that followed.

Concerns about Hyperliquid’s governance model have been growing. According to L2Beat, Hyperliquid has only two main validator sets, each comprising four validators. By comparison, competing blockchains like Solana and Ethereum are supported by approximately 1,000 and 1 million validators, respectively.

This small validator set makes Hyperliquid more vulnerable to governance concerns, as decisions can be made by a very limited group. Many crypto purists argue that more validators reduce the risk of a small group of insiders manipulating a blockchain.

Hyperliquid has defended its actions, stating that the validators had a responsibility to intervene for system integrity. However, the exchange acknowledged the need for greater transparency in its voting process.

Despite the controversy, Hyperliquid remains the most popular leveraged perpetuals trading platform, controlling roughly 70% of market share, according to a January report by asset manager VanEck.

As the dust settles on this incident, Hyperliquid faces the challenging task of rebuilding user trust while preventing future manipulative attacks. The exchange must find a balance between protecting its users and maintaining the decentralized principles that many crypto traders value.

The JELLY token manipulation serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in decentralized finance platforms, especially when dealing with low-liquidity tokens. For Hyperliquid and the broader DeFi ecosystem, this incident highlights the ongoing tension between true decentralization and effective risk management.",blockonomi

Pi Network (PI) price has fallen below $0.8, representing a 3% drop in the last 24 hours

Market analysts predict further decline to around $0.6 due to upcoming token unlocks

Over 105 million Pi tokens worth approximately $85 million will be unlocked in the next 30 days

Community members express frustration over delayed mainnet launch and Binance listing

Despite current decline, some analysts remain optimistic about potential recovery to $3-5 range

Pi Network’s cryptocurrency (PI) has continued its downward trend, trading at approximately $0.79 as of March 27, 2025. The price represents a decline of about 3% in the last 24 hours, with trading volume increasing by 33% to $327 million.

Several factors are contributing to the declining price. Market watchers point to the significant number of Pi Coins scheduled to be unlocked in the coming weeks. According to PiScan data, approximately 105.96 million Pi tokens will be unlocked over the next 30 days.

This influx of tokens, valued at around $85 million at current prices, is expected to place additional downward pressure on Pi’s market value. The daily average unlock stands at about 3.5 million coins.

The selling pressure doesn’t appear to be easing anytime soon. Looking ahead to the next 12 months, 1.6 billion Pi Coins are scheduled for unlocks. This represents an average of 129 million coins per month.

Trading Analysis

Analyst bullstraders7 on TradingView has predicted Pi Network price could fall to around $0.61 or even $0.6 in the coming days. The prediction has further dampened market sentiment, particularly among investors hoping for a price recovery.

Pi’s current market capitalization stands at approximately $5.47 billion. Its fully diluted valuation is estimated at $8.42 billion, indicating the total value if all tokens were in circulation.

The Pi Core Team has faced criticism from community members. Many are questioning the team’s silence regarding key updates and urging them to take more decisive action to support the coin’s price.

Several promised developments have faced delays. The mainnet launch, Binance listing, and Pi domain auction have all been postponed, causing frustration within the community.

Some community members have expressed concern that the Core Team is deviating from their original promise of full decentralization. Critics suggest the team is now focusing on attracting large institutions instead of maintaining their initial vision.

Despite the current downturn, not all analysts are pessimistic about Pi’s future. Expert Coinvo sees the recent dip as a buying opportunity, pointing to Pi’s RSI divergence as a “massive buy signal.”

Cryptocurrency analyst Moon Jeff, while acknowledging the potential drop to $0.6, remains optimistic about recovery. Jeff suggests that if the price bounces back from that level, it could trigger a spike up to $5.

$PI is going to $0.6

Dr. Altcoin, a prominent community figure, encouraged investors to hold their Pi tokens. “Let’s HODL and buy patience and Pi while it’s still available. Don’t be surprised if in the next few weeks Pi jumps to $3.14, or even hits $10 in the coming months,” he stated.

Reports also indicate plans to list Pi token on crypto exchange Upbit in the near future. Such a listing could potentially provide the liquidity boost needed to catalyze a recovery.

The token unlock schedule is expected to continue until May 2028 with minimal changes. To counter the potential price pressure, Pi enthusiasts are urging the Core Team to implement measures to reduce circulation.

Suggested measures include burning mechanisms or smart contract features that would decrease the number of tokens in active circulation. These steps could help maintain price stability despite the ongoing token unlocks.",blockonomi

Bitwise predicts XRP could reach $29.32 by 2030 in the best case or fall to $0.13 in the worst case

Resistance levels are currently between $2.50-$2.80, with support at $2.24-$2.30

Ripple recently settled with the SEC, reducing its fine from $125 million to $50 million

XRP has been showing unusual price stability in recent months. The cryptocurrency has maintained its position above the $2 mark for nearly three months, a pattern that differs from its previous market cycles. This extended consolidation period has caught the attention of market analysts who see it as a potential sign of strength.

The current price action comes after XRP rallied to $3.40 earlier in the cycle. Since then, it has been trading in a tightening range, with technical analysis suggesting a breakout may be approaching. Fibonacci time analysis points to March 30 as a key date, with the .618 Fibonacci time extension correlating with the current cycle.

If a breakout materializes as predicted, XRP could head toward several resistance levels. These include $2.70, $3.08, and potentially $3.80, which would test its all-time high. The cryptocurrency is currently facing immediate resistance between $2.50 and $2.56, with further resistance in the $2.65 to $2.80 range.

Looking at the short-term picture, XRP is experiencing a pullback on the 8-hour timeframe. This could lead to a test of support levels between $2.24 and $2.30. If the price breaks below this area, the next support zone would be between $1.95 and $2.05.

Market Analysis

Market analyst Dom has noted that XRP’s current behavior differs from past cycles. In previous market tops, XRP experienced rapid spikes followed by immediate declines. For example, in December 2013, it climbed to $0.0614 before falling to $0.00281.

Similar patterns occurred in December 2014 and January 2018, with the latter seeing XRP reach its all-time high of $3.80 before a major decline. More recently, XRP hit $1.96 in April 2021 and $0.95 in July 2023, but experienced swift pullbacks both times.

$XRP There's one reason I will be pretty surprised if $XRP does not go higher this year, read along – Every time $XRP has historically put in a multi month or year top, it did it quickly (as shown below) Essentially, it never showed any mid term acceptance at those higher… pic.twitter.com/RahjM2xHwz — Dom (@traderview2) March 24, 2025

The current stability above $2 is seen as a bullish indicator by some analysts. Dom stated that “the longer price spends time at a level, it’s always just reflective of how much market participants agree on that price.”

Volume trends also support this view. Past XRP cycles featured high trading volume during price spikes, followed by rapid drop-offs as selling pressure increased. Currently, volume remains steady, suggesting traders are still engaged at these price levels.

April 8 aligns with another major time extension, which could trigger a test of the all-time high of $3.80. Further out, April 25 is the 1.0 Fibonacci time extension, which some analysts believe could mark the macro top for this wave cycle.

Historical price action suggests that a breakout from the current consolidation could bring substantial growth. The 1.618 Fibonacci level intersects with a target of $16.50. Some projections based on previous bull runs even suggest triple-digit figures, with estimates exceeding $100 in certain scenarios.

Bitwise, a cryptocurrency fund manager, has offered its own long-term price predictions for XRP. In their most optimistic scenario, XRP could reach $29.32 by 2030 if it captures a large share of the payments and tokenization markets. This would increase its market cap to $2.9 trillion, surpassing Microsoft’s current valuation.

In their “bull” scenario, Bitwise predicts XRP could reach $12.70 by 2030 with steady growth. However, in a “bear” scenario where XRP struggles to gain traction and institutional support fades, its price could drop to just $0.13.

The legal landscape for XRP has also been evolving. Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP, recently reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The agreement reduced Ripple’s fine from $125 million to $50 million and included the removal of restrictions on institutional XRP sales.

This legal clarity could potentially impact market sentiment toward XRP. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, confirmed this development, calling it his “final update on the lawsuit.”

As the countdown to March 30 begins, investors and traders are watching closely. The technical setup suggests XRP’s next move could be one of its most important in years.",blockonomi

BTC is facing technical resistance at the $88,200 level with support at $85,500

GameStop announced plans to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset

Several companies are following Bitcoin treasury strategies similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy)

Bitcoin’s price has been hovering around $87,000 in recent days. This comes amid new global market uncertainty after President Donald Trump announced plans for 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is trading near $87,315 as of March 27, 2025. This represents a 10% increase from its early March lows but remains well below its January peak of nearly $110,000.

Technically, Bitcoin has maintained support above the $85,500 zone. The cryptocurrency appears to be forming a base for potential upward movement if it can overcome key resistance levels.

The price is currently trading above the 100 hourly Simple moving average. This suggests a slightly bullish short-term outlook despite the broader market concerns.

Bitcoin faces immediate resistance near the $87,700 level. This marks the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent downward correction from $88,259 to $85,853.

The key resistance level sits at $88,000. Above that is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $88,200 on the hourly BTC/USD chart.

If Bitcoin manages to close above the $88,200 resistance, it could move higher. In this scenario, the price might test the $89,500 level before possibly approaching the psychologically important $90,000 mark.

On the downside, Bitcoin has support near $87,000. The first major support level below that sits at $86,500, followed by stronger support around $85,500.

The MACD indicator is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for BTC/USD remains above the 50 level, suggesting moderate buying momentum.

President Trump’s recent announcement about auto tariffs has created broader market concerns. He plans to impose a 25% tariff on all foreign-made cars and auto parts starting April 2.

This policy aims to boost domestic car manufacturing. However, it has raised investor worries about a potential global trade war, creating a risk-off sentiment in financial markets.

During such periods, investors typically move away from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. The announcement led to a sell-off in global stock markets, with the S&P 500 declining 1.1% and the NASDAQ Composite dropping 2%.

In contrast to the downturn in equity markets, gold prices rose. This reflects the classic shift to safe-haven assets during times of market uncertainty.

Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Accelerates

In other news, GameStop has announced plans to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The company said it will use some of its $4.75 billion cash reserves as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy Bitcoin.

GameStop’s stock climbed almost 20% following the announcement. Traders are betting GameStop could follow in the footsteps of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which has seen its stock rise 3,000% since it started buying Bitcoin in 2020.

Strategy now holds around 500,000 Bitcoin worth $42 billion. Its founder, Michael Saylor, recently predicted a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying Bitcoin.

Other companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have also adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies. This growing trend could create additional institutional demand for the cryptocurrency.

The broader altcoin market has seen mixed performance. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, fell 1.6% to $2,025.96, while XRP dropped 4% to $2.3661.

Investors looking for new prospects usually converge on crypto presales that balance purpose and profit. Hexydog, having just hit a $300K presale mark, has been getting a lot of brewing interest lately.

By advocating for animal welfare issues along with revolutionary blockchain capabilities, Hexydog brings an open-ended roadmap within reach of a broad client base. The sole question is: how does it differentiate itself amidst a crowded sector of sky-high promises in this space?

Preaching Animal Welfare from the Beginning

Hexydog’s central mission is in the use of a portion of transaction fees to support animal shelters, rescue facilities, and other charities related to animals. A socially conscious business introduces moral contributions to real-world impact along with typical utility tokens.

With so many new players emphasizing sustainable and ethical investment, it’s no wonder the presale has been so warmly received and arguably one of the best crypto to invest now.

Also, the project’s focus on supporting animals is something that appeals to an ever-growing group of crypto users seeking meaningful projects. Rather than chasing speculative concepts, Hexydog positions itself as leading crypto presales by creating a clear use case that appeals to both seasoned traders and new users.

With transparent documentation of the funds allocation, early supporters can track their contributions and confirm that the token’s philanthropic purpose goes beyond rhetoric.

Security and Multi-Chain Benefits

Too many cryptocurrency projects fail because they lack proper protection or are shrouded in mystery governance. Hexydog addresses these concerns straight out of the gate, with liquidity locks, KYC checks, and constant smart contract audits.

These guardians reduce such threats as rug pulls, giving fans confidence who hunger for responsibility on all levels. Along with multi-chain support, the outcome is inexpensive, open space for mainstream liftoff.

By employing a multi-chain platform, Hexydog allows user-friendly ease to prevent obstacles such as high gas fees or delayed transactional speed. The structure not only assists price-conscious traders but also brings potential future cross-chain interactions to the table.

As new blockchains with varied characteristics are launched regularly, Hexydog’s cross-chain capability may make it agile. Long term, a wide user base and smooth transfers are critical to any project looking to be the best crypto presale of 2025.

Incentives for Holders: Staking, NFTs, and Governance

Hexydog builds upon standard digital asset listings with staking rewards that provide holder rewards for holding. Stakers receive passive income, securing tokenomics of the project and deterring dumping.

Its roadmap also includes special NFTs celebrating the token’s underlying cause of animal welfare. The collectibles may be an interesting way to increase awareness and provide owners with more utility in the space.

Core to Hexydog’s future is a DAO-governance model that enables token holders to propose or vote on major decisions. This investor-oriented model allows input from investors to be reflected in updates, charity donations, and protocol upgrades.

For some, decentralized governance just makes sense for the nature of blockchain, adding another layer of trust for the project. Therefore, there are already some who refer to Hexydog as one of the best crypto to invest in today, particularly for those who appreciate open development and high user interaction.

Why the $300K Presale Matters

A presale in excess of $300K means more than capital locked down. It means real traction, that the project has social mission as well as technical interest which merits ongoing support down the line. Early backers presumably anticipate Hexydog still being around after being listed on the big exchanges—a hurdle for the majority of tokens, once early mania wears off.

Combined with humanitarian connections, Hexydog’s consistent fundraising proves higher-order involvement from donors seeking more than raw speculation.

The high number of individuals on this early is indicative of a strong level of conviction in Hexydog’s future. Given that most presales in cryptocurrency are vying with each other, a solid foundation indicates the project’s value proposition is resonating in a crowded space.

Hexydog’s Path Forward: Merging Profit and Philanthropy

If Hexydog continues to grow and integrates certain guaranteed features—spanning from multi-chain compatibility through additional incentives when staking—it has the potential to be evidence that blockchain can marry tangible advantages in mainstream economies and token-based economies.

By doing so, it has become one of the best crypto to invest in today for investors who wish to merge profit with philanthropy. Currently selling at 0.0024 USD and with a $300K presale goal and busy roadmap demonstrate a project positioned to satisfy increasing needs for mission-driven, transparent blockchain technology.

By combining security, multi-chain capability, staking rewards, and philanthropic efforts into a single product, Hexydog is appealing to investors at all levels. If one is interested by its ethical mission, its technology horizon, or its community-based model, Hexydog provides several entry points to investment.

https://blockonomi.com,TokenFi Removes TOKEN Buy/Sell Tax After Unanimous DAO Vote,https://blockonomi.com/tokenfi-removes-token-buy-sell-tax-after-unanimous-dao-vote/,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 20:08:42 GMT","Miami, Florida, March 27th, 2025, Chainwire

TokenFi has officially eliminated the 0.3% buy/sell tax on its native token, TOKEN, following a unanimous vote from the Floki DAO.

“The Floki DAO proposal to remove the 0.3% buy/sell tax on $TOKEN received 100% support from the community,” the project team announced. “In line with the decision of the Floki DAO, the buy/sell transaction tax on $TOKEN has been removed.”

The vote signals a clear consensus within the Floki and TokenFi communities that lowering friction in trading is essential to increasing accessibility and unlocking broader utility for the token.

The tax removal is already live across both Ethereum and BNB Chain networks.

The original proposal, published via Snapshot, received full backing, making this one of the rare DAO votes with absolute alignment.

With the buy/sell tax now set to 0%, TokenFi aims to drive further adoption by reducing barriers for both new and existing holders. The move could also help boost TOKEN’s liquidity across decentralized exchanges and improve market efficiency.

TokenFi, which is connected to the Floki ecosystem, is working to position TOKEN as a utility and governance asset across DeFi platforms. Removing transaction friction is one of several steps being taken to expand the token’s real-world use cases and trading appeal.

https://blockonomi.com,Hedera (HBAR) Down at $0.198 As HBAR Faces Competition From Coldware’s Interoperable Blockchain For IoT Micro Transactions,https://blockonomi.com/hedera-hbar-down-at-0-198-as-hbar-faces-competition-from-coldwares-interoperable-blockchain-for-iot-micro-transactions/,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 19:25:36 GMT","Hedera (HBAR) has been under mounting pressure in recent weeks, with its price dipping below $0.20, now trading around $0.193. Despite efforts to maintain a bullish outlook, the token faces significant resistance and increasing liquidation risk. As reported, Hedera (HBAR) saw over $230,000 in liquidated long positions and an open interest drop of 6.6%, signaling reduced investor confidence.

Once a favored option among institutional investors, Hedera (HBAR)’s slow transition toward a permissionless model has left many seeking more nimble alternatives—enter Coldware (COLD).

Coldware (COLD) Emerges With Interoperable Infrastructure

Coldware (COLD) is fast becoming a standout in the Web3 landscape by offering a Layer-1 blockchain with built-in interoperability for IoT micro transactions. Unlike Hedera (HBAR), which still relies on a permissioned validator model, Coldware (COLD) delivers a fully decentralized Proof-of-Stake ecosystem focused on real-world usability.

Its integration of PayFi and IoT-ready architecture enables seamless micro payments between smart devices—a growing market as Web3 expands into logistics, energy, and mobility. The Coldware ecosystem includes powerful tools like Freeze.Mint, enabling developers to launch Layer-2 assets and dApps effortlessly.

HBAR vs. COLD: Who Wins in Real-World Application?

Hedera (HBAR) may boast past partnerships with tech giants, but Coldware (COLD) is building its momentum from the ground up—driven by community, developer incentives, and practical infrastructure. As Hedera (HBAR) fails to break through its $0.20 resistance, Coldware’s presale gains traction with over $2 million already raised.

The $COLD token underpins decentralized gaming, financial services, NFT marketplaces, and more, with ultra-low fees and mobile accessibility at its core. This functionality is especially important for IoT applications, where millions of micro transactions occur without high network costs.

IoT Integration Gives Coldware a Technological Edge

Coldware’s Larna 2400® and ColdBook® devices are designed to function as light nodes in its blockchain. This allows for IoT devices to directly participate in the Coldware network, validating transactions, earning rewards, and supporting applications—all while staying energy efficient.

Hedera (HBAR), despite its speed, lacks this kind of vertical hardware integration. The Coldware (COLD) advantage lies in the merging of blockchain with devices, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where real utility defines token value.

Market Sentiment Signals a Shift Toward Coldware

Hedera (HBAR) is expected to drop as low as $0.178 in coming weeks according to current technical analysis. Meanwhile, Coldware (COLD) continues to gain retail and institutional interest thanks to its developer-friendly tools, security-first architecture, and inclusive ecosystem. The growing sentiment is that Hedera (HBAR) may no longer represent the future of Web3 infrastructure, especially as investors demand decentralization and utility at scale.

Conclusion: Coldware Replaces Hedera as the Future of IoT Transactions

Coldware (COLD) is positioned to lead the way in IoT blockchain transactions with a network designed for scalability, decentralization, and real-world application. As Hedera (HBAR) struggles under bearish pressure and enterprise fatigue, Coldware (COLD) captures investor confidence with a model built for long-term success.

With Hedera (HBAR) still mentioned for its historical partnerships, it’s Coldware that offers a fresh path forward for a truly connected Web3 economy.

Despite some market volatility, Toncoin has managed to consolidate around $3.59, with whales seizing this opportunity to stake a position in the network’s mobile-friendly blockchain with gaming utility. In this article, we dive deeper into the factors driving Toncoin’s position in the market and how it compares to Coldware’s (COLD) emerging DeFi platform, which is set to challenge Toncoin’s gaming utility focus.

Coldware (COLD) and Its Growing DeFi Ecosystem

Coldware (COLD) is not just another blockchain platform focused on mobile utility; it’s positioning itself as a strong contender in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Coldware’s ecosystem combines secure hardware devices, PayFi technology, and Web3 integration to offer privacy-focused, decentralized financial services. Its presale momentum, already surpassing $2 million, reflects a growing investor interest in its long-term utility and real-world adoption.

While Toncoin’s scalability in mobile gaming is impressive, Coldware’s focus on bridging real-world applications with DeFi services is attracting a broader range of investors. Coldware aims to solve privacy concerns and financial inclusion issues that are becoming increasingly important in today’s digital economy.

The Impact of Toncoin’s Upcoming Layer-2 Solution

Toncoin’s (TON) upcoming Layer-2 solution promises to enhance its scalability, which could help attract more decentralized finance (DeFi) and mobile gaming applications to the network. This makes Toncoin a key player in the growing sector of decentralized apps (dApps) and blockchain gaming. Its ability to offer fast and secure transactions on mobile platforms places it in a favorable position as the gaming industry continues to explore blockchain integration.

However, while Toncoin’s focus on scalability and mobile gaming is gaining traction, other emerging platforms, such as Coldware (COLD), are presenting alternatives that offer more comprehensive solutions in the DeFi space.

Toncoin’s Resilience Amid Market Volatility

Toncoin (TON), powered by the Telegram team, has stood out as a promising contender in the blockchain space, particularly due to its strong scalability and high transaction speed. While many other cryptocurrencies have faced market pressures, Toncoin (TON) has consolidated around $3.59, showing resilience amid global economic uncertainty and crypto market fluctuations.

Whales, who hold substantial amounts of Toncoin (TON), have been steadily accumulating more, signaling confidence in the network’s long-term prospects. As Toncoin positions itself to benefit from the upcoming Layer-2 solutions, which are aimed at enhancing scalability for decentralized applications (dApps), its utility within mobile gaming is becoming more apparent. These developments have further cemented Toncoin’s place as one of the top players in the blockchain space.

Toncoin vs. Coldware: Two Blockchain Giants with Different Approaches

As Toncoin (TON) continues to strengthen its position in mobile-friendly blockchain gaming, Coldware (COLD) is gaining traction by offering more comprehensive solutions within the DeFi ecosystem. While both projects share a focus on scalability and transaction speed, Coldware’s potential to drive real-world adoption and offer innovative financial solutions makes it a potential rival to Toncoin in 2025.

Investors are closely watching both Toncoin (TON) and Coldware (COLD), but as Coldware continues to break presale records and expand its utility, it’s becoming clear that the project is a force to be reckoned with in the world of decentralized finance.

https://blockonomi.com,GPT-4o Image Feature Creates Studio Ghibli-Style Art Amid Legal Uncertainty,https://blockonomi.com/gpt-4o-image-feature-creates-studio-ghibli-style-art-amid-legal-uncertainty/,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:13:39 GMT","TLDR

OpenAI’s GPT-4o includes a powerful new AI image generator that’s gone viral for creating Studio Ghibli-style images

The tool can replicate studio styles like Studio Ghibli but raises copyright concerns as courts debate whether AI training on copyrighted works is legal

Several lawsuits against AI companies like OpenAI claim copyright infringement for training on works without permission

The new image generator excels at text rendering, precise prompt following, and maintaining consistency across multiple images

OpenAI’s tool produces more accurate style replicas than competitors like Google’s Gemini and xAI’s Grok

OpenAI recently launched a new image generator as part of its GPT-4o model, and it has quickly gone viral on social media. Users have flooded their feeds with AI-generated images mimicking the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli, the famous Japanese animation studio behind beloved films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.”

In just 24 hours since the feature went live, people have created images showing Studio Ghibli versions of Elon Musk, “The Lord of the Rings,” and President Donald Trump. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appears to have changed his profile picture to a Ghibli-style image likely created with the new tool.

The feature allows users to simply upload existing images into ChatGPT and ask the system to recreate them in various styles. This ease of use has contributed to its rapid spread across social media platforms.

This release follows Google’s similar feature in its Gemini Flash model, which sparked its own viral moment earlier in March when users discovered they could remove watermarks from images. Both tools make it easier than ever to recreate the styles of copyrighted works with simple text prompts.

These new AI image tools have reignited concerns about copyright infringement. Several lawsuits against AI companies claim these systems were trained on copyrighted works without proper permission or compensation.

AI Art & Legal Gray Areas

Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer at Neal & McDevitt, explains that these AI image generators operate in a legal gray area. While style itself isn’t explicitly protected by copyright law, the way these systems learn those styles might be problematic.

“I think this raises the same question that we’ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,” Brown said in an interview. “What are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?”

The New York Times and several publishers have active lawsuits against OpenAI. They claim the company trained its AI models on copyrighted works without proper attribution or payment. Similar claims have been made against other AI companies, including Meta and Midjourney.

OpenAI stated that while ChatGPT refuses to replicate “the style of individual living artists,” it does permit recreating “broader studio styles.” However, this distinction becomes blurry when considering that living artists like Hayao Miyazaki, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, pioneered their studios’ unique styles.

studio ghibli is out, dr seuss is in pic.twitter.com/4ECxwLLkoj — Jordi Hays (@jordihays) March 26, 2025

Users have also been able to recreate styles from other well-known sources. Examples include portraits in the style of Dr. Seuss and wedding photos reimagined in Pixar’s distinctive look.

Tech journalists compared several popular AI image generators, including Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok, and Playground.ai. They found that OpenAI’s new tool created the most accurate replicas of Studio Ghibli’s animation style.

According to OpenAI, the new image generator was designed to be both “beautiful and useful.” The company claims their tool excels at accurately rendering text, following prompts precisely, and leveraging GPT-4o’s knowledge base.

A key advantage is the generator’s ability to maintain consistency across multiple images in a conversation. This makes it easier to refine images through natural dialog, ensuring that elements like characters remain coherent as users make adjustments.

The model also demonstrates strong “instruction following,” handling detailed prompts with up to 10-20 different objects while maintaining their traits and relationships. This allows for better control than previous systems, which typically struggled with more than 5-8 objects.

OpenAI has implemented safety measures in the new tool. All generated images include C2PA metadata identifying them as AI-created. The company also blocks requests that may violate their content policies, with heightened restrictions when real people are involved.

The new image generator is now available to Plus, Pro, Team, and Free users as the default image generator in ChatGPT. Access for Enterprise and Education users is coming soon. Developers will be able to generate images with GPT-4o through an API in the coming weeks.

OpenAI acknowledged some limitations with the current system, including occasional image cropping issues, inaccuracies with multilingual text rendering, and challenges with precise editing. The company says it is working to address these limitations in future updates.

The success of this new image generator seems to be driving high demand. OpenAI delayed the rollout to free-tier users on Wednesday, citing the overwhelming number of people trying to use the feature.

While the technology represents a major advance in what AI can create, we’ll have to wait for court decisions to determine if these systems violate copyright laws.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,GameStop to Raise $1.4 Billion for Bitcoin Treasury Investment,https://blockonomi.com/gamestop-to-raise-1-4-billion-for-bitcoin-treasury-investment/,"Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:06:24 GMT","TLDR

GameStop plans to raise $1.4 billion to invest in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset

The company will fund purchases through convertible senior notes with 0% interest rate due in 2030

GME stock initially surged 12% but later dropped 8% as traders reacted to the Bitcoin investment plan

GameStop joins other corporations like MicroStrategy (now “Strategy”) adopting Bitcoin on their balance sheets

The company currently holds $4.8 billion in cash and generates about $220 million in interest annually from Treasury bills

GameStop, the video game retailer and meme stock sensation, has announced plans to raise $1.4 billion to invest in Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserve strategy. This marks a major shift in the company’s financial approach as it joins a growing list of corporations adding the leading cryptocurrency to their balance sheets.

On March 26, 2025, GameStop’s board of directors unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The company’s stock initially rose nearly 12% following the announcement but later dropped more than 8% in after-hours trading as investors digested the news.

The investment committee, led by executive chairman Ryan Cohen, will oversee the allocation of funds toward Bitcoin acquisitions. According to reports, GameStop has not placed a cap on how much Bitcoin it may purchase in the future, indicating a long-term commitment to digital assets.

To fund this Bitcoin initiative, GameStop plans to issue $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2030. These notes will carry a 0% interest rate, providing the company with financial flexibility without the burden of traditional debt financing.

The notes give buyers the option to convert their holdings into shares at $28.46 or cash. GameStop also mentioned it might increase its cash-raising effort by up to $200 million.

Balancing Treasury Management with Crypto Investment

In addition to the convertible notes, GameStop may use some of its existing cash reserves to further its Bitcoin investment strategy. The company reported $4.775 billion in cash at the end of the fourth quarter.

This move comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On February 8, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) CEO Michael Saylor, sparking speculation about GameStop’s interest in cryptocurrency.

Strategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has become known for its heavy investment in Bitcoin, now holding more than 447,000 tokens according to a February filing. The company even rebranded from MicroStrategy earlier this year to emphasize its focus on Bitcoin.

While Strategy’s Bitcoin investment has worked well, with its stock up over 84% in the past year amid rising Bitcoin prices, some Wall Street analysts remain skeptical about GameStop’s new direction.

Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter noted,

“The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks.”

GameStop’s recent financial performance shows some challenges in its core business. In its fourth quarter earnings report, the company posted $1.28 billion in net sales, marking a 28% decline from the same period last year.

For the full fiscal year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million the previous year. The company’s turnaround efforts have shown some positive results through cost cuts, store closures, and a pivot to collectibles like trading cards.

These measures have helped reduce net operating losses to less than $10 million in each of the past two fiscal years. GameStop has also been generating income by investing its cash in Treasury bills, earning approximately $220 million in interest annually.

Adding Bitcoin to the mix introduces both opportunity and risk. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency could either boost GameStop’s bottom line if Bitcoin’s value increases or potentially reduce the stable returns currently generated by Treasury bills.

GameStop’s Bitcoin investment follows other recent developments in corporate and government adoption of cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a federal Bitcoin reserve using tokens already owned by the government.

The growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption signals increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. However, it also raises questions about how traditional retailers like GameStop will balance cryptocurrency investments with their core business operations.

As GameStop moves forward with this new financial strategy, investors and industry observers will be watching closely to see how the company executes its vision and whether the Bitcoin investment pays off in the long run.",blockonomi
