                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. As a psychologist who studies couples and as a husband, I've found that people in the happiest, most resilient relationships treat their weeknights as opportunities that don't go wasted. Here are the seven things these couples consistently do before bedtime. You can't always expect your partner to walk through the door ready to cook, talk, or be cheerful. Healthy couples build in 15 to 30 minutes of guilt-free alone time for each partner — one decompresses while the other handles a light task, then they switch. By protecting each other's battery early in the evening, they preserve the bandwidth they'll need to connect later on. Some nights, even after a decompression session, you may still feel drained. They start their evening together, but quietly: sitting on the balcony, lying side by side, taking a slow walk. In psychological research, this is a form of co-regulation: the process of two people syncing up emotionally, allowing the emotions of the day to rise and fall until they feel like themselves again. Not every weeknight has room for deep emotional check-ins. So the happiest couples keep it simple: each person shares one thing about their day, good or bad. It could be venting some frustration, sharing a little win they had at the office or even just something funny that happened. This light, consistent sharing keeps them emotionally updated without draining what's left of their workweek energy. Even on nights when both partners want to zone out, they stick to one small shared ritual they never skip. For most, it's something ridiculously simple: eating dinner together without their phones, making a nightly cup of tea, or doing a word game together. The ritual becomes a daily anchor — something predictable, comforting, and theirs alone. Research shows that partners who cuddle regularly report higher relationship satisfaction and commitment, even compared with couples who emphasize "quality time" together. It's the easiest, fastest biological boost your relationship can get. That's why they end the evening with 5 to 10 minutes of shared tidying, wiping counters, packing tomorrow's lunches, loading the dishwasher. Instead of rehashing the day, heathy and happy couples look ahead. This is a brief, gentle way for working couples to stay in sync without needing to fully rehash the emotional weight of their day. You get a sense of what your partner might need tomorrow, whether it's encouragement, space, or just a little extra support. Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has relinquished its ambition of joining the NATO military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of talks with U.S. envoys in Berlin. The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join NATO as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia's war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the U.S., European, and other partners' security guarantees, instead of NATO membership, were a compromise on Ukraine's side. "From the very beginning, Ukraine's desire was to join NATO, these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction," he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat. "Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries — Canada, Japan — are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion," Zelenskyy said. "And it is already a compromise from our part," he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10% of Donbas, which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no NATO troops can be stationed in Ukraine. Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a "written" pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the U.S.-led NATO alliance eastwards — shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics. Zelenskyy had earlier called for a "dignified" peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again as he prepared to meet U.S. envoys and European allies in Berlin to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II. Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow's demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine's power and water supplies. Although the exact make-up of the meetings on Sunday and Monday has not been made public, a U.S. official said Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is hosting Zelenskyy and European leaders for a summit in the German capital on Monday, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe. Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the U.S. proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces. European allies have described this as a "critical moment" that could shape Ukraine's future, and sought to shore up Kyiv's finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv's military and civilian budget. Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as "constructive," although no major breakthroughs were reached. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from NATO and European leaders that Putin would not stop there. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that NATO should be "prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured" and asserted that "we are Russia's next target." "They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr. Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about," Peskov added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering borrowing costs for the third time in 2025. Given the lower interest rate backdrop (which reduces the appeal of fixed-income investments) and a volatile stock market, some investors might want to consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income and enhance overall returns. The stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend-paying companies. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first dividend pick is Devon Energy (DVN), an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. In the third quarter of 2025, Devon returned $401 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Recently, JP Morgan analyst Arun Jayaram upgraded Devon Energy stock to buy from hold, though he lowered the price target to $44 from $49. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on DVN stock with a price target of $43. Jayaram explained that his rating upgrade was based on DVN's compelling valuation compared to its peers, supported by free cash flow gains from the company's $1 billion business optimization plan. The 5 star analyst noted that Devon achieved about 60% of its $1 billion goal in a little over half a year following the plan's formal rollout. The analyst noted that Devon's Delaware Basin well productivity was adversely impacted by the company's focus on completing a higher proportion of Wolfcamp B wells. Overall, Jayaram is bullish on Devon, given that it has a top-quality acreage position in the most important parts of the Delaware Basin, Bakken, and Eagle Ford shale regions. "We believe DVN's core franchise assets have the potential to provide a large inventory of lower-risk, high rate-of-return development drilling opportunities that are critical given the depleting nature of an E&P's asset base," said Jayaram. 655 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. In the third quarter of 2025, EOG paid $545 million in regular dividends and repurchased shares worth $440 million. Last month, EOG announced a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share, payable on January 30, 2026. Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The stock also scores an "outperform" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst, with a price target of $127. Sorbara views EOG as a "premier" large-cap company with the ability to navigate through commodity cycles, supported by its solid balance sheet and strong inventory. Notably, Sorbara highlighted EOG's commitment to return at least 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders annually through dividends and share buybacks. In fact, the energy company has the flexibility to return 100% of free cash flow based on its balance sheet strength. The 5-star analyst also noted EOG's efforts to leverage advanced technology to capture further opportunities in the Delaware Basin, with the company now identifying more than nine different development targets. Among other positives, Sorbara also mentioned that EOG is tracking ahead of its target for the first year with regard to the $150 million synergies from its Encino acquisition. More savings are expected from factors like improved infrastructure, production efficiency, and marketing deals through EOG's midstream network. 225 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

At its Investor Day event on December 9, CVS Health provided positive updates and stated that it expects to achieve a mid-teens adjusted earnings per share (EPS) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. Following Investor Day, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes reiterated a Buy rating on CVS stock and raised her price target to $95 from $88. "CVS is our top pick in our coverage universe," said the 5-star analyst, and cited structural improvement in retail earnings forecast as the reason for her revised price target. Hynes noted that CVS' mid-teens adjusted EPS CAGR target does not take into account any additional share buybacks, which she expects to take place once the company achieves its leverage targets, possibly by the end of next year. This ratio is expected to decline by about 50 basis points in 2026 due to better pricing, reduced benefits under Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and the company's decision to exit the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) business. Hynes also noted the improvement in CVS' Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness (PCW) segment outlook, with the company now expecting flat adjusted operating income growth compared to the previous guidance of a mid-single-digit decline. This improvement is driven by market share gains, a better reimbursement backdrop, and cost savings. 733 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 12 people were killed and almost 30 wounded when gunmen fired on a Jewish holiday event at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday in what Australian police and officials described as a terrorist attack. One suspected gunman was killed and another was in a critical condition, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference. At least 29 people injured, including two police officers, were taken to the hospital, he said. Police were investigating whether a third gunman was involved in the shooting, and a bomb-disposal unit was working on several suspected improvised explosive devices, Lanyon said. Mike Burgess, a top Australian intelligence official, said one of the suspected attackers was known to authorities but had not been deemed an immediate threat. Sunday's shootings were the most serious of a string of antisemitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023. Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world's safest countries. "At this dark moment for our nation, our police and security agencies are working to determine anyone associated with this outrage." Witnesses said the shooting at the famed beach on a hot summer's evening lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets and parks. Police said around 1,000 people had attended the Hanukkah event alone. "I was just getting ready to go home, and, like, I was packing my bag, got my flip-flops, was ready to catch my bus, and then I started hearing the shots," said Bondi Junction resident Marcos Carvalho, 38. "We all panicked and started running as well. We just ran through the hill," he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting and that Australia's government must "come to its senses" after countless warnings. One of the world's most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists. "If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it's something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It's a horrific thing," Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack. Bondi resident Grace Mathew said she saw people running past her and heard gunshots. "Initially you just think, it's a beautiful day down by the beach," she said. "You sort of think that people are just having a good time. Then more people ran past and said there's a shooter, there's a mass shooting and they're killing people." "These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society. "Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all those who witnessed or were affected by this deeply traumatic attack." Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard. Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff. "Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi," said Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party.
