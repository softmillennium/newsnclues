Dakota Johnson made a surprise appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live, joining the Grammy-nominated singer onstage during a performance of ‘Madeline' from Allen's new album West End Girl. During Saturday's episode, which was hosted by Josh O'Connor, Allen also performed her song ‘Sleepwalking', in addition to making a cameo in a sketch inspired by her music. Johnson's surprise appearance comes after she hosted SNL for the second time last year with musical guest Justin Timberlake. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The greater glory for Zootopia 2 is offshore with an overall global haul of $1.13 billion making it officially the No. 1 MPA global release of the year (besting Disney's own Lilo & Stitch), and the 7th highest grossing MPA animated title overall. 2 MPA release in China with $502M behind only Avengers: Endgame (reported, unadjusted total is $632.1M). 'Zootopia 2' Crossing $1 Billion Global Box Office Today; Fastest Hollywood Animation Ever To Milestone 1 Again Before 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' Lights Up The Box Office Disney is the first and only studio to cross that mark YTD, and the only studio to achieve such a feat in back-to-back years. It's also Disney's third time since 2018; no other studio has reached $5B in that span. In general, this weekend before the big Christmas tentpole, historically excels with a wide family entry (Jumanji, Wonka, Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse). We already have Zootopia 2 and Five Nights at Freddy's 2 doing well, so, none needed. But Disney decided to go wide with James L. Brooks' seventh directorial, Ella McCCay, at 2,500 theaters, which sadly didn't find an audience with a Disney-reported $2.1M. It's also the octogenarian's worst reviewed movie ever at 22% on Rotten Tomatoes and his lowest wide release opening as director (his Terms of Endearment back in 1984 debuted to $3.5M at 260 theaters). The opening here is even lower than Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis' Tom Hanks-Robin Wright re-team last year, Here, which really pressed on moviegoers' nerves with its fixed camera shtick, opening at $4.8M. Disney selected this date as Brooks' canon historically has gone in the mid-to-late December corridor (Broadcast News, How Do You Know, Spanglish, etc). If reviews were good, the hope was that an older female audience would show up. While you could say that the director shouldn't have gambled entirely on a fresh face to star in the movie in the sublime Emma Mackey, even if this movie starred a more bankable name, i.e. Anne Hathaway, it would still have an uphill battle ala Brooks' failed $120M Reese Witherspoon-Owen Wilson romcom, How Do You Know which opened to $7.4M, topped off at $30.2M domestic and north of $48M global. What remains true then, remains true now and that is prestige drama/dramedies, which audiences use to find in theaters thanks to Brooks, are too prevalent on TV at home. It stands to reason that they'd fully support the guy's passion projects, especially, if it's a new Simpsons movie they crave. Once upon a time, Ella McCay, would have clicked. Ella McCay gets a B- Cinemascore, which is better than How Do You Know‘s C- and the same as Brooks' 1994 I'll Do Anything. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak audiences were hard on the film with 2 stars, 62% and a 39% definite recommend. Though an even play across the country, it's very light. Highest grossing venue was AMC Lincoln Square with $5K. Social media analytics firm RelishMix counts a reach of 65 million across TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, X and Instagram which is -59% other drama/comedies before opening, i.e. Reports RelishMix, “Mixed-negative leaning chatter for Ella McCay zeroes in on script, tone, and casting logic. Others critique the aesthetics and character logic, from ‘Too many cliches' to ‘a 29-year-old British French actress playing a 34-year-old state Governor of Rhode Island, yep sounds about right.' Hard pass sadly' and ‘Can't say I'm looking forward to that one, despite the great cast' underline the skepticism toward Ella McCay.” Five Nights at Freddy's 2 (Uni) 3,579 (+167) theaters, Fri $5.6M (-81%), Sat $8.4M Sun $5.37M 3-day $19.5M (-70%), Total $95.4M/Wk 2 Wicked: For Good (Uni) 3,480 (-505) theaters, Fri $2.27M (-50%) Sat $3.65M Sun $2.6M 3-day $8.55M (-51%), Total $312.1M/Wk 4 Dhurandhar (Moviegoer) 377 (-13) theaters, Fri $939K (=81%), 3-day $3.5M (+78%), Total $7.9M/Wk 2The Aditya Dhar directed movie, starring Ranveer Singh is putting up impressive numbers in NYC, Toronto, Austin, DC, Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco and Dallas to name a few.

Nelson directed redo of the 1984 cult horror movie which originally grossed $2.5M. FRIDAY PM: A quiet pre-Christmas weekend at the box office, though still commendable as two movies could clear $20M+; Disney's Zootopia 2 in its third weekend definitely is with $25M at 3,835 sites, -40%, for a running cume of $257.6M. Nancy already reported that the Disney threequel is the third movie of YTD after Ne Zha 2 ($1.9M) and Lilo & Stitch to clear $1B. 2 with $19.6M at 3,579 theaters, -69% for a running cume of $95.7M. As we told you, ala anime, it's a front-loaded type of crowd, even though this sequel was pure theatrical unlike the first chapter's day-and-date on Peacock and multiplexes. Five Nights at Freddy's fell -76% in its second frame, and that was after massive views on Peacock. Hence, a better hold this weekend for part 2. 3 with the fourth frame of Wicked: For Good with $2.1M today at 3,480 theaters, $8M for the weekend, -54%, and a running total of $311.6M. Wicked 2 crossed the three-century mark on Tuesday, becoming the fifth title to do so YTD after A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch, Superman, and Jurassic World: Rebirth. However, next Wicked through its fourth weekend, Wicked: For Good is pacing -13% behind that's pic's cume at the same point in time. Fourth is 20th Century Studios' James L. Brooks directed dramedy Ella McCay which is no good at $800K today, $3M opening at 2,500 theaters. We heard previews which began at 2PM yesterday were around $200K. We'll assess more as the weekend goes for this latest title from the 3x Oscar winner of Terms of Endearment. Seventy-six reviews just don't get it at 21% Rotten (I, however, did get it; and enjoyed it).Let the record show that the latest from the 85-year old filmmaker is cheaper with a $30M production cost before P&A than his previous movies, 2010's How Do You Know ($120M), 2004's Spanglish ($80M), 1992's As Good As It Gets ($50M uninflated), and his 1994 initially shot musical turned dramedy, I'll Do Anything ($40M unadjusted for inflation). Fifth goes to Gkids' second weekend of Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution with $600K today, $2.1M for the 3-day, -79%, and a ten-day total by Sunday EOD of $14.5M. Coming up solid is Uni's re-release of the Jim Carrey starring, Ron Howard directed, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas at 2,250 sites with $600K today and $1.8M for the weekend for a running cume of $264.2M.

If Superman or Captain America had done in China what Zoo is, they'd both be hailed as successful but are both bombs because they didn't. the break even point was 425 million for both films so they are major successes Given that part 2 will make 2-300M less and pretty much kill any chance at a potential part 3, I doubt anyone will consider Wicked For Good a success. Yikes, Wicked has fallen off a cliff. Probably won't even break even given how much it cost to make and the insane amount of money they spent on promotion. Every sequel and now two remakes can't come close to the original at all. At least this remake was better than the previous films but still doesn't hold a candle to the original was torn between seeing silent night or the shining …chose silent night cuz of the season and I have a soft spot for the original… this movie was really entertaining and well acted and had solid lead characters.. should have been better promoted.. all the nods to the original series were fun too and other Christmas horror films .too bad it bombed… anyway the shining did well.. happy about that No Christmas slasher does well at the box office in December. That's like saying Halloween horror movies shouldn't be released in October. Also, KRAMPUS and VIOLENT NIGHT say hello.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's never a good sign when the United States' national security plan is praised by Russia as being “largely consistent with our vision.” But that's the bizarro world we're living in, where Donald Trump and his administration continue to embolden our autocratic adversaries and alienate our democratic allies. It is a red, white, and blue middle finger to the free world. Literally no American administration — from Truman to Reagan to Obama — has believed that “permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country.” That is, however, a frequent Russian talking point, parroted by useful idiots on the far-right and far-left. China gets to dominate Asia, with Taiwan a tempting target on Chinese president-for-life Xi's to-do list. Russia gets eastern Ukraine and a weakened NATO, dovetailing perfectly with the musings of J.D. Vance's right-wing Svengali Curtis Yarvin, whose stated foreign policy vision for Europe is to “give Russia a free hand on the continent.” Dictators throughout history have claimed the pursuit of peace is their only aim. But now we see the rise of what might be called “code pink conservatives” who embrace an isolationist view of the world that doesn't really give a damn what happens past our shores, as Vance infamously proclaimed regarding the fate of Ukraine.

There is no real security in the ostrich-like isolationist impulse to ignore aggression or empower aggressors via appeasement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a wild night at the Hallmark Christmas Experience for fans of Hallmark's long-running series “When Calls The Heart” (WCTH). Series regular Jack Wagner hosted the panel, which featured stars Erin Krakow, Kevin McGarry, Pascale Sutton, Kavan Smith, Viv Leacock, Chris McNally, and Ben Rosenbaum. But the crowd was in for another big surprise when Krakow announced Lori Loughlin, whom Hallmark recently announced will return to the show for season 14, was backstage. After the cast members fielded a host of questions from Wagner — with Krakow frequently rubbing her baby bump as her real-life husband, Rosenbaum, sat behind her — he asked which cast member would be most likely to eat all the vanilla cookies from the WCTH set's catering crew. “I think it would be one of our favorite friends and co-stars, who we are so lucky is joining us for season 14,” Krakow replied. “And, do you think maybe we should bring her out?” Loughlin then walked out onto the stage as the audience erupted in screams and applause, overcome with joy to see her hugging her former castmates and taking a seat next to Krakow, who has remained a close friend. As Krakow wiped tears from her eyes, someone in the audience yelled, “We love you Lori!” “I love you too,” Loughlin beamed back, holding Krakow's hand. When Wagner asked Loughlin to describe how her return to WCTH feels and when she got news, Loughlin replied, “It feels amazing. And my girl here has been championing this for a long time.” Krakow, who plays series lead Elizabeth Thatcher Thornton, has often said in interviews that she hoped Loughlin would be brought back to the show in her role as Elizabeth's dear friend Abigail Stanton. “I mean, you guys all know it — we have such a special cast and such a special bond, and it's just so nice to be back with my family.” Later in the panel discussion, Krakow said she couldn't quite think straight because she was basking in the joy of having Loughlin, her “first-ever scene partner” on WCTH, with them on stage, calling herself “thrilled and over the moon.” Following their 2019 arrests, Loughlin and her now-estranged husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty in 2020 to charges of mail and wire fraud, per Us Weekly, after they and dozens of other parents were charged with paying to help ensure their teenage children were admitted to the colleges they wanted to attend. In early October, Loughlin was back in the headlines as news broke of her splitting from Giannulli, her husband of 25 years. Weeks later, her “Full House” castmate and longtime friend John Stamos called Loughlin an “angel” and slammed Giannulli during an appearance on Peck and Ben Soffer's “Good Guys” podcast, claiming the actress “put up with a lot over the years of this guy.” In recent years, many fans and former castmates have expressed hope that Loughlin would be forgiven and allowed to return to Hope Valley. As recently as November 8, Krakow told Us Weekly that Loughlin's return to WCTH was “something I've been hoping for for years and years.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Cena fought in what he promised was his final WWE match Saturday, with the wrestler tapping out to end his illustrious career in the ring. His retirement tour continued sporadically throughout this year, culminating in “The Last Time” he took the ring Saturday, for a match versus Gunther in the Saturday Night's Main Event XLII in Washington, D.C. Cena's wrestling career was celebrated in a celebrity-filled tribute video featuring the likes of Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Jimmy Fallon, and Jelly Roll. Man, thank you for all these years,” Jelly Roll said in the video. Thank you for being the role model that we all needed. The farewell match itself ran for nearly 25 minutes, with the usual ebbs and flows of a WWE match, with Cena showcasing his repertoire one last time. However, the match ended — to the dismay of fans who were chanting “Don't give up!” — with Cena losing by submission after Gunther put him in a sleeper hold.

Two current WWE champions, Cody Rhodes and CM Punk, symbolically presented their belts to Cena before a tribute video was shown to the Capitol One Arena crowd. As always with retired wrestlers, it's possible Cena might still participate in WWE events albeit outside the ring. However, for the time being, he'll focus entirely on his acting career, which currently includes Peacemaker, Matchbox, and recent surprise cameos in both The Bear and Pluribus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Something that's genuinely unpredictable, sort of fun, and occasionally disorienting about Saturday Night Live's current cast size is how the screentime balance can shift so much from episode to episode. This week's episode felt as if we had suddenly fast-forwarded a year or two, to a time when Ashley Padilla had gone from the cast member with the strongest fundamentals to a Kate McKinnonesque “just do let her do whatever, it'll get laughs” baroque-stardom period—and then mixed that with an episode from a couple of years ago when it might feel like Bowen Yang would appear in the majority of the night's sketches. This form of time travel also randomly Butterfly Effected Marcello Hernández into a demotion, sending him back to Update for one of those barely-veiled bits where the new guy who hasn't been getting much airtime gets to do some of his stand-up at the desk. There's no shame in that, exactly, but I would have thought Hernández was way too popular to do such a grab-baggy routine in his third season, when there's a bunch of other less established stand-ups probably eyeing that spot. Regardless, it's not hard to imagine a version of the show dominated by Padilla and Yang; they're both naturally funny in sometimes-complementary ways. It's also a helpful reminder that simply shoving great performers to the foreground to take big swings isn't always enough. This time, the eventually-revealed deal was that a Dating Game-style show has recently abolished its age limits, allowing an octogenarian played by Padilla to slip in as the third of three potential matches for a thirtysomething bachelor. The very next live sketch let Yang do pretty much the same thing: a weirdo who charges into a familiar situation and doesn't do what they're supposed to! It was especially familiar because he was reviving his somewhat more hyperactive version of the classic Will Ferrell patient-vexing doctor bit (and frankly, this isn't too far removed from his Barry the Midwife character). Again: Some individual laughs but it felt like shtick on shuffle. And then later in the show, Padilla and Yang teamed up for a sketch about a twelve-year-old genius (Yang) attending college and nagged by his overbearing mother (Padilla) as he tries to fit in with more traditionally college-aged kids. This sketch combined premise overload with the verbal overload of their back-and-forth, hot-and-cold screaming matches, with Yang petulantly calling his mother “Heather” a solid two-dozen times. Despite the hit-and-miss results, all this noise made strategic sense for an episode hosted by Josh O'Connor. He's more than capable as a leading man in the movies, about to be widely streamed stealing the new Knives Out movie out from Daniel Craig, but his persona is still quiet and inward, something spoofed by this week's sketch about sensitive male strippers. Those less recurring-character-style sketches didn't have all be super-relatable, observational, or even fresh. Did enough people hear Lily Allen's latest record, or get the general idea from context, for that sketch about people's inner monologues reshaped into Allen-style songs to scan? No idea, but directly making some (light) fun of the musical guest's highly specific style, ornamented with oddball character details made the sketch charmingly specific. (It's telling that Mikey Day's character refers to them as Fleet Foxes.) As for O'Connor himself, he was charming in a low-key way that sometimes turned the dial down to muffled, like in that monologue where it felt like his Ratatouille fixation was a runner cut to the bone. Far less easy, given the apparently divisive reactions she prompts, but just as much of a layup: Jane Wickline's song about destroying the Stranger Things kids on Weekend Update. Update was particularly full of cheap laughs this week, and in general has veered toward reporting an outlandish situation and then making up something else outlandish to top it—like, this week, reporting about teenagers caught making a swastika formation and then elaborating that even worse, it was a skydiving accident. It was a cute idea with a real nothing of an execution; in light of how lacking even the superficial imitations of Christmas characters were, it felt almost like self-flagellation over the cast's overall weakness in impressions. The Wizard Of Oz sketch suffered from that a little, too, but mostly it was just a mildly funny one-joke premise belabored; standard mediocre sketch, in other words. She wasn't competing with Padilla or Yang at that pitch, which made it easier for her to slip in and steal the episode. Ariana Grande faces sky-high expectations for the final episode of 2025, coming hot on the heels of a very successful outing last year. I'll try to restrain my bafflement that Cher flogging a couple-years-old Christmas album is considered a treat on the level of Billie Eilish or Lizzo from holiday episodes past. I shrugged off Hozier last year, and wound up quite liking his “Fairytale of New York” cover.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live applied Spotify Wrapped's metrics to Uber Eats—and the public's reaction was far less positive. While the streaming platform's year-end wrap up of listeners' habits included Top Genres, Listening Age and Clubs, the Uber Eats summary of eaters' deliveries features what restaurants they couldn't resist. “Taco Bell, Five Guys, Burger King, Chipotle,” one man (Ben Marshall) says in the digital short, with his disgusted girlfriend (Veronika Slowikowska) commenting: “I guess that's why the plumber's always here.” While one hesitant app user (Andrew Dismuskes) finds out that he's in the top one percent of “nuggets,”  another (James Austin Johnson) learns that his top food was churros—and his Uber Eats age is “dead.” The Uber Eats Wrapped also shows users how they appeared to the delivery driver while grabbing their food from their doorway. “Who would I even share these with?” she wonders.

The couple, who have been romantically linked since 2023, enjoyed some quality time together after welcoming a son together in February.

David Ellison's Netflix Scare Tactic Runs Into European Reality At Fuel Fest in June, he revealed the movie will be released in April 2027, a release time he agreed upon with Universal Studios “under three conditions.” “The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O'Conner,” Diesel said. “That is what you're going to get in the finale.” At the time, he was shooting for Fast & Furious 7, and not all of his scenes were finished. However, Walker's Brian was able to appear in the final scene of the movie using CGI, VFX artists and his two brothers, Cody and Caleb Walker, to create 350 shots. The last scene of Fast & Furious 7 saw Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Walker's Brian have a final moment together in their cars before driving off in separate directions. “There really wasn't room to let anything slip. It was too important to complete the story in respect to Paul's memory — to make sure that when you watched it, you didn't think about any of the work that we did,” he said.
