                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allan Bryant Snr reveals the horrific, taunting messages he receives from amateur detectives and trolls, with one sick letter reading: 'This hunt is going to be fun, your son is in bits' But as his parents search for answers, they today reveal a dark new turn in the tragic case – explaining how callous TikTok sleuths and ‘psychics' have destroyed their lives with gruesome theories, which astonishingly have even been investigated by police without the family's knowledge. His mum, Marie Dugan, and dad, Allan Snr, are convinced he was murdered after allegedly going to a house party after the club – and say the same names have often cropped up over the years, though no one has ever been convicted, and no remains ever found. Mr Bryant – who fears his son may have made contact with a crime gang before his death – has himself passed thousands of tip-offs to Police Scotland during the investigation – and at one stage, cops even searched a house in the town, though nothing came of it. He is therefore angry detectives failed to reveal they had followed up on a bogus tip-off of their own last year that Allan Jr's remains were buried on a farm – with the family only finding out by chance a couple of weeks ago. The family are regularly sent social media DMs, including “sick images”, and letters, and even get tagged in TikTok videos by people claiming they have had psychic visions about what's happened. He told The Sun this week: “Some of them go into gruesome detail they don't have to go into. “Saying what's happened to Allan, that he's been chopped up. But there are others who are far more sinister, including one troll who wrote: “This hunt is going to be fun, your son is in bits.” Creep Stewart McInroy was jailed twice for trolling offences against the Bryant family, in 2014 and 2018. In a Facebook group set up to find Allan, he had posted: “I am the killer of Allan Bryant.” Mr Bryant says the recent flood of baseless tip-offs from sleuths is causing further pain for his tormented family. The bogus farm tip-off saw an anonymous person claiming they believed Allan's remains had been in a pond on a farm in Fife for two years before being moved, and had sent Google Map images of the location to police. Mr Bryant said he had to delete at least five unsolicited Facebook messages last week alone from either people claiming to have psychic gifts or know clairvoyants who he should speak to. “They don't realise how big Fife is. It's different towns – I get comments and messages all the time saying ‘you should try this psychic'… sometimes they send a number and say ‘contact me, I'm a psychic, I'll give you a reading'. “We're not interested, you don't have these gifts. He added: “It's not just letters and messages, they make TikTok videos saying ‘we think this has happened to him, I've got a feeling'. November 3 2013: Allan Bryant Jr disappeared on a night out with friends June 2014: Police Scotland released CCTV of Allan Jr leaving Styx nightclub at 2.02am 2015: Allan's family passed information to police through local contacts that he had gone to a house party the night he vanished 2017: Police searched a house in Glenrothes for 33 days as part of their investigation 2017: Allan's dad Allan Sr voiced fears his son may have had contact with organised gang members weeks before he went missing Mr Bryant added: “I understand why people go and see them, if they've lost family and want a reading, I understand it. “But to troll a family who've been through that just so they can post things for likes and views. “He was going over to the chairs, it was like something out of f***ing Poltergeist,” said Mr Bryant. “He went to the nightclub, it's seven miles away. He felt the door knob and came back and said ‘two guys, two girls were there, they've killed Allan'. “There's not one police force that uses them.” Mr Bryant only found out about the farm tip-off when his local paper also received the same letter in recent weeks. He said: “This is what annoyed me the most – the police were contacted and they received a letter and they should have told us about it. “I'm still angry with them, just let us know and otherwise this wouldn't have happened.” He added: “We basically know what's going on in Allan's investigation. “Police come out and ask me about certain things so I know they're receiving certain information and I'll say ‘it doesn't ring a bell' or whatever. We know something happened to Allan that night, somebody killed him. Just trying to prove it is the hard part.” Detective Inspector Steven McLean told The Sun: “Our aim remains to find answers for Allan's family and officers continue to support and regularly update them with relevant information. “This information was previously passed to police, and extensive enquiries were conducted, with officers attending and assessing the area described. Any information, no matter how small, could prove to be vital. Any new information will be assessed and anyone who can assist should call Police Scotland on 101, or email OperationToner@scotland.police.uk if you can help.” This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

Tuesday marked 60 years since something was spotted in the sky over Westmoreland County

Last Tuesday marked 60 years since the famous Kecksburg UFO incident in which something was spotted in the sky over the Westmoreland County community and, according to some witnesses, it made a controlled landing.

Last week, "4 The Record" host Michelle Wright interviewed Ronnie Struble, a 50-year veteran of the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department, as well as UFO researcher and author Stan Gordon, about the event.

This week, Wright turned her attention to Bob Gatty, a former Greensburg Tribune-Review reporter who was on the scene that night.

Gatty was asked what it was that came out of the sky and he said, “Hard to tell, but I do believe that something happened. I do believe something landed there.”

He also said he never expected that night that this story would continue to follow him for 60 years.

“I'm 82 years old and that thing has followed me my whole life,” he said. “It's the story that won't go away.”

Cephalopod evolution has long had a missing chapter in its story: how did squid-like ancestors give rise to today's octopuses? With its glowing ghostly eyes, eight arms like its octopus cousins and a dark ruby coloring to match, the elusive vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis) has finally revealed its genetic secrets. In a study published Nov. 27 in the journal iScience, researchers sequenced the genome of Vampyrotheuthis and discovered its chromosomes still resemble those of squids and cuttlefish — despite belonging to the octopus order. This discovery hints at what the common ancestor of modern squids and octopuses may have looked like at the genetic level 300 million years ago when octopus and squid evolutionarily diverged. After acquiring a tissue sample from a vampire squid collected as bycatch in the West Pacific Ocean from a research cruise, the researchers used a genetic analysis platform called PacBio to sequence the DNA of the sample. While modern octopuses have DNA that consistently gets reshuffled, resulting in some chromosomal mixing, the researchers found that the vampire squid's genome kept much of its ancestral, squid-like chromosomal arrangement. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The vampire squid has had a long history of being misunderstood. When it was initially discovered in 1903, it was thought to be a cirrate octopus due to its unique webbing between its arms. In the 1950s however, scientists reclassified it as its own group, belonging to neither octopus nor squid but in the order Vampyromorphida, so named because it looks like it's wearing a vampire-like cloak. —Never-before-seen vampire squid species discovered in twilight zone of South China Sea The finding is welcome news for cephalopod scientists as it is "nice to have resolved" why vampire squids retain much of their ancestral, squid-like traits, said Bruce Robison, senior scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) who was not involved in the research. Part of what makes the fully sequenced genome so valuable is how hard it is to study vampire squids, mainly "because they live in a habitat that is difficult to access, they are solitary, rare, and do not survive well in captivity," Robison said. "Some people think that we can just dive into deep water, and find one whenever we like, which is definitely not the case."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>6 Bangladeshi peacekeepers killed, 8 wounded in Sudan UN base attack: ISPR Pran Group's Banga Building signs $25 million deal with German firm Every December, the internet briefly becomes a giant music confessional. Stories light up with lists no one asked for but everyone shares anyway. And among the data visualisations and neon-coloured slides, one joke seems to come back every year: no matter what you think you listened to, Spotify Wrapped will somehow crown Pritam as your #1 artiste. The meme is funny but it also captures something essential about Wrapped: beneath the sleek design and shareable graphics lies a complex, algorithmic machine that processes millions of micro-behaviours to deliver something that looks like a narrative of your year. Most users experience the result as an emotional truth. The science behind Wrapped, however, is built on something far more mechanical, behavioural, and statistical. And to understand why Pritam keeps spontaneously appearing in so many people's Top Artistes lists, you have to unpack how the system collects and weighs data. Wrapped is built on filtered listening hours, engagement scores, and repeat-play intensity, and it considers patterns in a way that can occasionally surprise users. These actions signal preference and raise the weighting of an artiste. So even if you listen to only a few Pritam songs, if they happen during high-focus months, say during exam season, work deadlines, or heartbreak episodes, the repeat clustering makes him important to your algorithmic year, even if the raw quantity is low. Another factor is something engineers call the session effect. If you forget to disconnect your Airpods after playing one Pritam track and the algorithm drifts into similar soundtracks for the next 90 minutes, your Wrapped will politely pretend this was very much part of your personality. Autoplay listening is weighted less but still contributes to overall artiste rankings. Multiply this by dozens of passive listening sessions through the year, and suddenly your assumed #1 artiste loses to someone you barely consciously heard. One heartbreak loop of five consecutive plays in March is worth more algorithmically than listening to twenty new songs once each in June. Spotify interprets looping as a sign of high emotional engagement. This is why one dramatic evening with a Pritam track can outweigh months of casual listening to your favourite international artist. Because, to Spotify, emotional intensity weighs way more than breadth of taste. And then there is also the matter of era detection. Artistes from that era are then weighted higher for Wrapped, especially if the rest of your listening was more eclectic or fragmented. Spotify's engineers have spoken in interviews about the threshold filters. For example, if you listened to an artiste fewer than thirty times in the entire year, they usually would not appear in Top Artistes unless your overall listening was low or extremely diverse. So if you are musically chaotic, even small spikes matter disproportionately. Which is precisely why a person who streams 100 different artists lightly may end up with Pritam topping the list while another person with a highly repetitive playlist distribution ends up with a much more predictable Wrapped. It is also powered by a concept known as affinity modelling. In South Asia, this often benefits artistes like Pritam, Amit Trivedi, or A R Rahman, even for listeners who consider their taste far removed from Hindi film music. Then comes the role of skip rate, an underrated but powerful metric. If you skip an artiste's tracks quickly, their ranking plummets. The viral memes surrounding Wrapped each year are not accidental either. The product team intentionally designs Wrapped to be shareable. The ranking formats mimic video game achievements, which makes users more likely to publicly compare. Spotify wraps raw numbers in narrative language and this emotionally charged phrasing reinforces the feeling that this is not simply metadata but a meaningful reflection of your identity. It uses colour theory, dynamic layouts, tiered animations, and compact categorisation to make your year appear aesthetically pleasing. The interface makes listening patterns look like achievement badges. It gamifies something you did not even realise was a game. Every year, Spotify processes billions of listening events across 574 million users. Data pipelines run for months, cleaning, deduplicating, filtering, and modelling. Engineers have spoken about the annual year-end freeze, a period when Spotify stops pushing new features to ensure that Wrapped's infrastructure remains stable for its December rollout. As AI develops richer understanding of mood, context, and multi-device behaviour, future Wrapped reports could integrate emotional detection, time-of-day patterns, biometric syncs with wearables, or even sentiment analysis from lyrics. In other words, the next wave of Wrapped-style features across digital platforms may become even more immersive, predictive, and strangely intimate.</p>

Where it is: 8 billion light-years away, in the constellation Scutum But what happened on July 2, 2025, was highly unusual: NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which has been orbiting Earth since 2008, recorded an unusually long-lived GRB that continued emitting in bursts for more than seven hours. Researchers used all kinds of telescopes to track its origin in all wavelengths of light, including the twin 8.1-meter Gemini telescopes in Chile and Hawaii, the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Hubble Space Telescope. GRB 250702B came from a massive galaxy 8 billion light-years distant that, critically, is so dusty that it blocked all visible light. The only light detected by telescopes was infrared and high-energy X-ray wavelengths. "This was the longest gamma-ray burst that humans have observed — long enough that it does not fit into any of our existing models for what causes gamma-ray bursts," Jonathan Carney, lead author of the study and doctoral student in physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in a statement. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. —Unprecedented radio view of the Milky Way took over 40,000 hours to construct —Webb reveals a fiery starburst in the Cigar Galaxy Analysis shows that GRB 250702B may have been caused by the death of a massive star, a star being ripped apart by a black hole, or the merger of a helium star and a black hole, where the black hole spirals into the core of the massive star, triggering an explosion from within. "But we can't yet tell which explanation is correct," Carney said. "In the future, this event will serve as a unique benchmark — when astronomers discover similar explosions, they'll ask whether they match GRB 250702B's properties or represent something different entirely."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  December 13, 2025 / 8:01 PM EST / CBS News Erika Kirk has one word for Candace Owens, who has been peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband, Charlie Kirk: "Stop." In a town hall, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss asked Charlie Kirk's widow what she wants to say to Owens and others who are making unfounded claims about his assassination: Owens used to work for Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization founded by Charlie Kirk. The two were generally considered friends, with Owens describing their relationship as akin to that of a "brother and sister." A day after his assassination in September, she posted a nearly 25-minute video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. But in the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs. And in this case, it's hideous that malicious lies and smears obligated [Erika Kirk] to make the request," a senior Treasury official told CBS News. Erika Kirk talked more about her husband, her journey through faith and grief, and the state of the American right in the CBS News town hall. It aired just days after Charlie Kirk's book, "Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life," was posthumously released. ET, and will be available on CBS News' YouTube channel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inspired by real-life events, the show brings to screen the enigmatic journey of India's most well-known paranormal investigator, Gaurav Tiwari, offering viewers a chilling yet grounded storytelling experience. With quiet authority and emotional subtlety, Tacker captures the essence of a man driven by intellectual curiosity while grappling with inner vulnerability. His portrayal avoids melodrama, relying instead on controlled body language, expressive silences, and understated intensity—particularly effective during investigative sequences. The supporting cast—Kalki Koechlin, Saloni Batra, Danish Sood, Shubham Choudhury, and Nimisha Nair—deliver strong performances, effectively conveying fear, skepticism, and emotional conflict without tipping into excess. Director Robbie Grewal deserves special mention for handling a sensitive, real-life inspired subject with care while maintaining commercial appeal. Rather than leaning on loud jump scares, the series builds fear through mood, silence, and psychological tension. Each element works in tandem to sustain a sense of unease throughout. Streaming on Amazon MX Player, Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery stands out as a rare example of intelligent horror in the Indian streaming space—one that prioritizes emotional resonance and realism over shock value. Produced by Almighty Motion Picture and released on December 12, the series earns a strong 4-star rating, making it a must-watch for fans of mystery, psychological thrillers, and supernatural storytelling.
