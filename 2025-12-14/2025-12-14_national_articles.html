(Lily Speredelozzi/The Sun Chronicle via AP) PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A person of interest was in custody Sunday after a shooting during final exams at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, though key questions remained unanswered nearly 24 hours after the attack. The attack Saturday afternoon set off hours of chaos across the Ivy League campus and surrounding Providence neighborhoods as hundreds of officers searched for the shooter and urged students and staff to shelter in place. The lockdown, which stretched into the night, was lifted early Sunday, but authorities had not yet released information about a potential motive. Col. Oscar Perez, the Providence police chief, said Sunday afternoon that the person in custody was in their 20s and that no one has been charged yet. Perez, who earlier had said the person was in their 30s and that no one else was being sought, declined to say whether the detained person had any connection to Brown. The person was taken into custody at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Providence, where police officers and FBI agents remained Sunday, blocking off a hallway with crime scene tape as they searched the area. College President Christina Paxson teared up while describing her conversations with students both on campus and in the hospital. Two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody and authorities also found two loaded 30-round magazines, the official said. Providence leaders said residents would notice a heavier police presence, and many area businesses announced Sunday that they would remain closed. A scheduled 5K run was postponed until next weekend. Mayor Brett Smiley invited residents to gather Sunday evening in a city park where an event had been scheduled to light a Christmas tree and Hanukkah menorah. “For those who know at least bit of the Hanukkah story, it is quite clear that if we can come together as a community to shine a little bit of light tonight, there's nothing better that we can be doing,” he told reporters. One told him that active shooting drills done in high school proved helpful. “The resilience that these survivors showed and shared with me, is frankly pretty overwhelming,” he said. “We're all saddened, scared, tired, but what they've been through is something different entirely.” Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Smiley said. Emma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Surveillance video released by police showed a suspect, dressed in black, walking from the scene. Eva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated. Brown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside. “I'm just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm. Students in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block from where the shooting occurred. Mari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus. “Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said. Crystal McCollaum, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, was staying at the hotel where the person of interest was taken into custody. She was with her daughter to attend a cheerleading competition in Providence, but after hearing about the shooting, she thought they would be safer staying outside the city. “It was just weird and scary,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new House Oversight Committee report takes aim at Washington D.C.‘s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith, accusing Smith of manipulating the district's crime data. “While the Committee continues to investigate documents related to crime statistics reporting, testimony exhibited in this report paints a troubling picture of department leadership placing a higher priority on suppressing public reporting of crime statistics than stopping crime itself,” the report reads. The report describes an alleged “culture of fear, intimidation, threats, and retaliation by Chief Smith” that was often brought out when Smith heard of a rise in crime statistics. “The men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department run towards danger every day to reduce homicides, carjackings, armed robberies, sexual assaults, and more. The Oversight report concluded and warned that crime statistics are still “at risk” of being manipulated following Smith's resignation announcement on Monday. It also recommended that Bowser appoint an MPD chief “who will address the ongoing concerns of crime statistics manipulations and alleviate the retaliatory pressures and threats faced by MPD personnel.” Bowser, who is not running for a fourth term as mayor, thanked Smith for her efforts as chief in her Sunday statement to the Washington Examiner. “I thank Chief Smith for her commitment to the safety of DC residents and for holding the Metropolitan Police Department to an exacting standard, and I expect no less from our next Chief of Police,” Bowser said. But House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said Smith's resignation should have occurred much earlier. “Testimony from experienced and courageous MPD commanders has exposed the truth: Chief Pamela Smith coerced staff to report artificially low crime data and cultivated a culture of fear to achieve her agenda. Chief Smith's decision to mislead the public by manipulating crime statistics is dangerous and undermines trust in both local leadership and law enforcement.” Comer said in a statement.</p>

San Jose State assistant volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose told Fox News Digital about her recent lawsuit after losing her job earlier this year. EXCLUSIVE: Former San Jose State assistant volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has stepped into the recent war of words between former players Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming. Fleming, who is transgender, made disputed claims that Slusser has been anorexic since they first met in 2023 and failed out of her classes at SJSU. Slusser denied Fleming's statements, previously saying that she developed an eating disorder from the stress and anxiety of playing and rooming with Fleming after discovering Fleming was a biological male, and the highly publicized scandal that ensued. SJSU trans player Blaire Fleming and teammate Brooke Slusser went to a magic show and had Thanksgiving together in Las Vegas despite an ongoing lawsuit. "To my knowledge, Brooke's mental health and academic performance were excellent during her first year and a half as a student athlete in the program. But after sharing her experience, the surrounding pressures intensified," Batie-Smoose told Fox News Digital. "She was chastised on campus and on social media, which seemed to cause her well-being and academic performance to decline. From my perspective, that context matters and underscores how much she has been carrying in a short amount of time." "I'm a little surprised and disappointed by Blaire Fleming's comments. Even if you're frustrated or hurt by Brooke's actions, I hoped there might be a little more empathy—especially from someone who has been the subject of personal attacks and understands how tough these things can get. Personal hardship should give us a deeper understanding of and more empathy for what others may be experiencing, not less," Batie-Smoose added. "Struggles with food, mental health or academic pressure are serious matters that deserve compassion, not dismissal. Regardless of personal dynamics, speaking harshly about someone who is clearly going through a difficult period is not something we want to encourage or normalize. Brooke's issues with food and her grades aren't excuses, but rather signs of someone who's been going through a lot." Fox News Digital was unable to reach Fleming for comment, as Fleming's Instagram account has been deactivated in recent days. "From the stress and how anxious I was every single day, I just wasn't eating really at all," Slusser said. "I went from around 160 to 128 [pounds] in that one semester. It definitely isn't healthy for someone of my size to be that weight, and I ended up losing my menstrual cycle for nine months. The 5-foot-11 Slusser added that people at home started to take notice. "When I came home, some of my friends and family were very worried about me," she added. "Some of my friends were just like, ‘You always looked tired all the time. You always look dead…' I was able to come home three days that fall semester my senior year, and I had a friend later on tell me that when I saw her, she went home and cried to her mom, because she was so worried about me, just because she could tell I looked so unhealthily skinny." Her father, Paul Slusser, then insisted that she move back home to Texas from San Jose after the 2024 season and fall semester ended. The family said she then attempted to finish her final semester and degree online, but later dropped the classes to focus on physical and mental rehabilitation. She aspires to start her own business in dietetics. So I really don't care or feel bad for her. Slusser promptly responded, calling Fleming's statement "just not true." I have always lived a very healthy lifestyle. Before these events took place[,] I was very disciplined in fueling myself for athletics and [kept] track to make sure I was where I need to be[,] to be the best athlete. It wasn't until all the craziness started that my healthy lifestyle turned very unhealthy into not eating the amount I should," Slusser said. So no[,] I did not return to San Jose and enroll myself in more courses at an institution that didn't have my best interest." Slusser has alleged in her lawsuits against the NCAA and Mountain West Conference that she was never told Fleming's birth sex, and that the two regularly shared hotel rooms on away trips. Slusser has also said in the lawsuits that Fleming confessed to being transgender during a conversation over ice cream in April 2024. Slusser then joined Riley Gaines' lawsuit against the NCAA in September 2024. What followed was a series of forfeits by opposing teams. Each forfeit compounded growing attention in an election-season media cycle, putting SJSU's volleyball players and their opponents under a massive political spotlight. President Donald Trump even mentioned the scandal on his campaign trail in October of that year, during a Fox News Channel all-woman town hall event. Police protection was assigned to the team on a regular basis. Slusser has alleged in her lawsuit against the Mountain West, which was filed in November, that she was allegedly informed by teammates of an alleged conversation Fleming had with an opposing player, discussing a plan to have Slusser spiked in the face during a match. Batie-Smoose reported those same allegations in a Title IX complaint against the school, and was later suspended and did not have her contract renewed in January. The Mountain West commissioned a third-party investigation into the allegations against Fleming, and determined that sufficient evidence could not be found to assign discipline. Federal Judge Kato Crews, appointed by former President Joe Biden, denied the request, keeping Slusser and Fleming on the court together for practice and games. Slusser and Fleming were ultimately named to the Mountain West all-conference team, as SJSU's only honorees. Slusser left campus shortly after that at the insistence of her parents. Slusser said she came close to returning to play NCAA beach volleyball this past spring, and even had discussions with coaches at other schools about recruitment. But she ultimately decided not to, and moved to North Carolina, where she has served as a youth volleyball coach. The U.S. Department of Education is currently investigating the university for potential Title IX violations related to its handling of Fleming.

People look at seized computers from online scam centers and photos displayed during a news conference on national level efforts to completely eliminate online scams and dismantle their networks at the root, Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025, in Yangon, Myanmar. BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar's military regime appealed to the international community on Sunday to take back hundreds of foreigners who have been detained in a crackdown on scam centers in the country's eastern Kayin state near the Thai border. In recent months, the authorities have raided two major scam centers, KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a trading town on the border with Thailand. “We want the international community to come and call them quickly. On Sunday, Maj-Gen Aung Kyaw Kyaw, deputy minister for Home Affairs, told a press conference in Yangon, the country's biggest city, that 13,272 foreigners from 47 countries had been detained since the start of the crackdown in January. While most have been deported, 1,655 are still in detention, he said. Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations that target people all over the world. They usually involve gaining a person's confidence with romantic ploys and luring them into bogus investment schemes. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has estimated that such activities generate just under $40 billion in annual revenue for criminal gangs. Col. Min Thu Kyaw, the minister for the security and border affairs of Kayin state government, said most of the 1,655 people awaiting deportation are being held at town's sport facilities, as well as in buildings controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force and repurposed scam compounds. They rest comprises groups of between 100 and 300 people each from Indonesia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Kenya and India, he said. The minister said most delayed returns involve foreigners from African countries that do not have embassies in Myanmar or Thailand, and that has slowed the deportation process to as long as five months. State-run MRTV television has recently broadcast footage of security operations at scam centers near Myawaddy, including videos and photos showing buildings being demolished with explosives and bulldozers. The military government has said it began its latest crackdown on online scams and illegal gambling in early September. Ethnic minority militias also exercise strong influence in the Myawaddy area. The Border Guard Force has claimed credit for taking part in the crackdown, though it is widely believed to have provided protection for scam operators in the past. Both groups have denied involvement in the scam operations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Do they realize that nearly 70% of the food available to purchase for their families is ultraprocessed? I've been trying to answer that question for more than two years now, as part of my beat for the CNN Wellness team. Not only does my team report on the latest lifestyle news, we also provide expert-vetted guidance on how to improve your health —  we like to say it's “news you can use.” Yet after reading countless studies, talking to dozens of experts and exploring all sorts of trendy apps, I still can't help you reliably avoid ultraprocessed foods, also known as UPFs. Come with me to the snack aisle, and I'll explain why. As I pass by all the colorfully packaged candies, cookies and chips, my stomach starts to rumble with anticipation. The appeal of junk food hasn't changed — in fact, experts say it's only gotten worse as the food industry refined its algorithms to target our “bliss point” — creating the absolute yummiest combinations of sugar, salt and fat to make it nearly impossible to “eat just one.” Today, many of those same junk foods — as well as the majority of other ultraprocessed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, processed meats, instant and boxed mixes, breakfast cereals, and more — contain newly created synthetic favors, textures, dyes and preservatives. In fact, today's preservatives can keep foods looking fresh and tasty for days and weeks, even years — much longer shelf lives than in your great granny's day. There's no doubt that the safety and convenience of such long-lasting, affordable foods has been life-changing. Today, we can make meals from our cabinets without stopping by the store for fresh ingredients or stirring sauce for hours over the stove. We have more of our precious time to spend on other pursuits. Yet it's those preservatives and other additives, however, that can make a food ultraprocessed, according to the food classification system NOVA, the most widely used definition of UPFs to date. NOVA was created in 2009 by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Augusto Monteiro, who coined the term “ultraprocessed.” Monteiro is an emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil's University of São Paulo. First are  minimally processed foods — whole foods which we may slightly “process” by cutting (slicing up an orange or apple) and cooking (sautéing vegetables). The second group includes processed culinary items used to prepare, season and cook whole foods — think spices, herbs and oils. Group four are ultraprocessed foods — which now make up to 53% of an American adult's diet and 62% of foods eaten by an American child, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Instead, they are manufactured from “chemically manipulated cheap ingredients” and often use synthetic additives to make them “edible, palatable and habit-forming.” “No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro  cowrote in a 2024 editorial in the journal The BMJ. “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.” The stakes are high: Studies have shown that eating just 10% more calories a day from ultraprocessed food — that's about one serving — may be associated with a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death. However, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents major food manufacturers, told me in an email “there is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods.” “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” said Sarah Gallo, CBA's senior vice president of product policy. “Americans deserve facts based on sound science in order to make the best choices for their health.” To manufacture cheap, delicious food that is packaged for convenience, experts say basic food crops such as potatoes, corn, wheat and soybeans may be disassembled into their molecular parts — starchy flours, protein isolates, fats and oils — to create what manufacturers call “slurries.” (How do they do it? The cell walls of the plants are destroyed, dispersing micronutrients that often need to work together to nurture our bodies. What's left is a substance some scientists call “predigested” — not unlike the regurgitated food a mama bird feeds her babies. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health, has seen the process firsthand. “In the early 2000s, I went into some food plants and I saw the stuff — it was supposed to be granola bars, shredded wheat cereal,” Popkin said. Here's why eating “predigested” food can be a problem: When we eat whole foods as our bodies are meant to do, we absorb micronutrients throughout the entire digestive process. If they are exploded into smithereens in an ultraprocessed food, do we still have access to them? But according to some food scientists I've spoken to, it doesn't matter — manufacturers just add back missing vitamins, fiber and protein during manufacturing and voilà! Let's get back to the slurries: Next, with the help of artificial colorings, flavorings, texturizers and glue-like emulsifiers, ingredients are mixed, heated, pounded, shaped or extruded into any food a manufacturer can dream up. “It's an illusion of food,” Dr. Chris van Tulleken told me last year. “It's really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them into molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want,” said van Tulleken, author of the 2023 book “Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn't Food … and Why Can't We Stop?” I'm still wandering around the snack aisle, so let's put our knowledge to the test by looking at one of my kids' old favorites — ranch-flavored veggie straws. As a conscientious mom, I always reached for the organic version. Of the more than 30 ingredients, three are additives: sodium caseinate, used as an emulsifier; calcium chloride, which extends shelf life; and potassium chloride, a flavor enhancer used to treat low blood pressure and low potassium levels. Yet by NOVA's standards, those veggie straws are definitely ultraprocessed. Then come various oils, dehydrated vegetable powders (such as bell peppers, carrots, spinach), turmeric and beetroot powders (for color), and dried milk products (for the ranch taste). None of that sounds dangerous, but all those powders? That's a red flag that these kid-friendly straws may not have been made from my “Mom” vision of sautéed veggies pureed in a blender, poured into a mold and baked until puffy. In fact, none of us can, because how these foods are made is proprietary to each manufacturer, which closely guards recipes and “bliss point” algorithms from competitors and the public. “Food companies today, they've closed off their processing plants,” Popkin said. “So we've never been able to have a clinical study studying what happens if you eat real corn versus deconstructed corn.” But wait — I buy organic versions of the veggie straws, doesn't that help? Buying organic does reduce pesticide levels, but that's not part of ultraprocessing. Turning even an organic vegetable into refined flakes and powders may destroy the plant's food matrix — cell walls that hold nutrients — and like our Humpty Dumpty, that food must be put back together again. Many experts have tried to simplify the chore of avoiding ultraprocessing by advising consumers to choose foods with no more than five ingredients or avoid foods with ingredients you can't pronounce or can't find at home. Those are great suggestions if you have time to read labels. Let's look at my favorite potato chip, which only has three ingredients on the label: potatoes, salt and oil. Does that mean this potato chip is now good for me? Those convenient, kid-friendly frozen chicken nuggets are easy to identify as ultraprocessed. And here's a startling fact: Nuggets typically contain transglutaminase, which the industry calls “meat glue.” It's an enzyme that helps combine parts of an animal or different animals into one product — hot dogs, sausages and deli meats are common examples. (Hint: If the food packaging reads “formed” or “reformed,” it likely contains transglutaminase.) Transglutaminase isn't easy to pronounce, and it's not an ingredient you'll have at home. This next challenge is harder: Are most breads on grocery store shelves ultraprocessed by NOVA standards? Unless it's freshly baked from scratch, the answer is “most likely,” although experts disagree. Common additives in bread include calcium propionate, an artificial preservative linked to behavior problems in children;  potassium sorbate, another synthetic preservative linked to skin and respiratory issues in people who are sensitive to it; and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), two more artificial preservatives that may be linked to hormone and reproductive disruption and cancer. Now, here's a tricky one: plant-based meat substitutes. Ultraprocessed to their core, many experts say these alt meats are still better for us than red and processed meats full of saturated fats or nitrates. “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it's very easy to be better than that,” leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett told me earlier this year. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants,” said Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. According to the Good Food Institute, which promotes alternative proteins and coauthored the report, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98% and land use by up to 97%. I could go on and on, but here's the bottom line: Deciding what is “ultraprocessed and bad for your health” and “ultraprocessed, but OK to eat” is really complicated — especially for a society unwilling or unable to give up inexpensive, convenient food. In mid-May, the World Health Organization put out a global clarion call for scientists to help define and create guidelines for ultraprocessed food consumption. A week later, the Trump Administration released its first “Make America Healthy Again” report, calling for action on ultraprocessed foods they say are a danger to our children's health. An August 15 leaked version of the second report — which was supposed to announce specific policy actions — instead called for the government to “continue efforts to develop a U.S. government-wide definition.” The final report, released in September, provided no additional action. “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” University of Carolina's Popkin told me at the time. “Replacing them with real, whole foods is one of the most effective ways to Make America Healthy Again,” Nixon said. “We remain committed to serving the American people, not special interests or outside critics, by delivering radical transparency and upholding gold-standard science.” High-fat red and processed meats fall within the “least healthy” category in the AHA report — as they should, considering their role in heart disease and colon cancer. However, red meat is also the least processed food in that category. And yet, that's the point: Regulating ultraprocessed foods by additives alone — without also addressing the health concerns of too much sugar, salt and saturated fat (hello, beef tallow!) — won't improve the nation's food supply and our deteriorating health. “Our proposal now is to target any food with an excess of sodium, saturated fat or sugar, along with synthetic colors, flavors and non-nutritive sweeteners,” Monteiro told me when I reported on a recent three-part series in the journal The Lancet. He and Popkin coauthored the articles with 41 other internationally known scientists. However, there is a missing element, according to Harvard's Willett: “The huge blind spot of refined grains, which is the largest source of calories in the US and most countries at this time — this is not considered to be an UPF.” The Lancet series blasted the food industry, claiming global corporations continued to aggressively market and extensively profit from new and existing UPF products despite increasing evidence of harm to public health. “The food industry doesn't want to lose their cash cow, so they're willing to put millions into fighting government restrictions on ultraprocessed food as well as funding nutritionists who'll say there's no evidence of harm,” Popkin said. The International Food & Beverage Alliance, founded in 2008 by leading food and nonalcoholic beverage companies, told me in an email when the Lancet series published that health authorities worldwide have rejected the concept of ultraprocessed food due to its lack of scientific consensus. “The policy and advocacy recommendations of this series go far beyond the available evidence — proposing new regulatory action based on ‘processing' or additive ‘markers' and calling for the exclusion of industry from policymaking,” said IFBA Secretary-General Rocco Renaldi. Not only does the California legislation define ultraprocessed food — not an easy task as you have seen — it requires public health officials and scientists to decide which UPFs are most harmful to human health. California has also led the way in laws banning food dyes, potassium bromate, a possible carcinogen once widely used in breads, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben. “Here in California, we are actually doing the work to protect our kids' health, and we've been doing it since well before anyone had ever heard of the MAHA movement,” said Jesse Gabriel, the Democratic California Assemblymember who introduced several of the bills, in an October 9 press conference. California lawmakers have considered many of the ways in which both junk and ultraprocessed foods may be harmful to human health — ingredients such as nonnutritive sweeteners; additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners; flavor enhancers; a host of food dyes and more. American scientific research on the harms of UPF additives is in its infancy, but the new law has taken that into account. Additives banned, restricted or required to carry a warning by other local, state, federal or international jurisdictions will be in the analysis. Food modified to contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar can also be rejected, according to the law. This will help target industry strategies that may contribute to an addiction to ultraprocessed foods — an increasing concern for American children raised on UPFs. The law won't provide final details on which UPFs are most concerning until June 2028, and it won't have all UPFs out of school lunches until 2035. I'm hopeful there will be useful updates as the process rolls along. Of course, the best way is to buy everything fresh and cook at home. But like you, I'm far too busy to do as much of that as I would like — plus my kids are grown and the pressure to set a good example is gone (although my new grandson may change that). Instead, I stock up on frozen veggies — many are flash frozen and have the same nutrients as when first picked. I also do my best to avoid veggies and salad greens packaged in chemical-laden plastics (that's a whole other problem I write about). I especially stay away from precut veggies (loss of nutrients) and foods sold in black plastic containers (read about those here.) When it comes to ready-to-heat-and-eat meals, I look for whole chicken breasts, sliced beef and pork, chicken or steak kebabs, and stews with real chunks of meat. (Here's a tip: If the package says the meat is cooked “sous vide,” I've found it's more likely to be whole meat.) I don't know all the names of additives — much less which are harmful or beneficial — so that's not very helpful to me. I could just as easily discard a food enriched with pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) or cobalamin (vitamin B12) as I could one with azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent in bread banned in the EU due to cancer concerns. Many people go straight to carbohydrates, but carbs are not necessarily the enemy — in whole foods they come naturally, along with fiber, vitamins and minerals. A tablespoonful of ketchup, for example, can contain 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of added sugar, while spaghetti and pizza sauces are notoriously high in added sugar as well. Let's take honey peanut butter, part of a typical PB&J lunch for my kids while they were growing up. So if I put 3 servings on the sandwich — that's an incredible 39 grams or 7.3 teaspoons of sugar (not counting the jelly) in what many of us consider a healthy meal for a child. But truthfully, how often do you stop and look at serving size? Here's a great example: An extremely popular organic bread in grocery stores has 35 ingredients — the first 21 are whole grains and seeds. The loaf has no synthetic additives, but it does have 4 grams of added sugar per serving in the form of organic molasses. Yet you shouldn't have to decide, experts say. “Curbing corporate power in food systems begins with governance reform.” Otherwise, they added, UPFs may well “replace all other food groups” in the not-so-distant future. But if the majority of our food was regulated to be as whole, fresh, and devoid of added sugar, salt, fat, additives and processing as possible, we would be a much healthier nation — and world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vinyl records are popular again, but it's not just audiophiles or nostalgic boomers fueling the resurgence. Gen Z is playing an outsized role in the revival of vinyl sales, which have grown on average by 18% annually in the past five years. About 60% of Gen Z say they buy records, according to Futuresource Consulting's Audio Tech Lifestyles report. But Gen Z isn't necessarily buying records for their unique sound. Around 40% of record buyers in the United States don't own a turntable, noted James Duvall, principal analyst and head of entertainment at Futuresource Consulting. Fifty-six percent of Gen Z fans like vinyl for its aesthetic, while 37% use it as home decor, according to a Vinyl Alliance survey. The vinyl resurgence can largely be traced back to Taylor Swift, who has promoted her albums as artsy collectibles, sometimes including additional songs, posters or poems for her dedicated fanbase. And her variants are each “a different piece of the story” she curates, which has “raised the bar for everyone,” like singers Lana Del Rey and Olivia Rodrigo, said Jeffrey Smith, vice president of marketing at Discogs.com, a database and marketplace for physical music. Five of Swift's albums were among the top 10 most sold vinyl albums last year in the US, according to entertainment insight group Luminate's 2024 report. Swift currently sells four variants of “Midnights” on her US website. Erin Davila, a 28-year-old from Orlando, Florida, said she may buy one Swift variant but ultimately prefers records with the traditional album cover. “The physical record was almost like a trophy of all of the music that you love, just sitting on your shelf,” she said. Davila has set alarms for Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Kacey Musgraves' vinyl releases, while her husband, Peyton, set an alarm for The Weeknd's vinyl release. Dexter Phuong, a 25-year-old content creator and social media coordinator in North Carolina, similarly uses vinyl as wall decoration, swapping albums based on the season. During the fall, he may put up Swift's “Red” or a Phoebe Bridgers variant that suits the season's orange and green aesthetic. Phuong says he has nearly every Lana Del Rey vinyl, including an estimated 10 variants of her latest album. “I actually don't listen to the variants much unless they have a bonus song on them,” he told CNN. Zoomers enjoy little indulgences — whether that's an expensive latte, clothing or a concert ticket, said NYU's Watson. It's largely because major milestones — like buying a house or getting married — have been delayed, so young adults look for gratification elsewhere, he said. “There's this idea to say, ‘Why can't we treat ourselves today with smaller awards?' That's where we see a rise in the collectibles market,” he said. Some are spending more time comparing prices from various sellers or increasingly shopping at local record stores in search of the best deal. A local record store could save them from the retail price of a vinyl record, which averages $33, but could be as high as $70 for limited edition releases. That includes Tony Baker, a 27-year-old in Orlando, who said he will buy any record for the right price and “figure out the rest later.” He purchased Toni Braxton's self-titled album for $100, which is the most he's willing to pay right now. According to Smith of Discogs, a nearly perfect-condition record sells on the site for around $15 on average, or 45% below the retail price. “Going in and buying a record and digging into the marketplace, finding something that's upwards of 70% off, could be a huge win,” Smith said. Whether they play the record or not, Watson said Gen Z tends to find sentimental value in thrifting records that have an “essence” of being owned previously and the environmental benefit of avoiding overconsumption. Peyton Davila, the Orlando vinyl collector, compared buying records at local stores for as low as $5 to thrifting for clothes. “You're just being more sustainable and not contributing to all the excess that we have of these albums that are over-pressed,” he said.

Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., comments on U.S. soldiers killed in Syria by an ISIS gunman and the potential extension of ACA subsidies on ‘Fox Report.' The U.S. troops who were killed and injured in Saturday's ambush attack in Syria were members of the Iowa National Guard, a senior U.S. official told Fox News. An ISIS gunman opened fire with an automatic weapon in the central Syrian town of Palmyra, killing two Iowa National Guard soldiers and an American civilian translator, the official said. Three additional U.S. soldiers were wounded in the attack. "… This would not be considered a ‘green on blue' incident because the Syrian gunman was not part of the U.S./Syrian partnered delegation." Earlier Saturday, U.S. Central Command confirmed the deaths and injuries were a "result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria." President Donald Trump warned that there will be "very serious retaliation" following the ambush. "We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria, two soldiers, and one Civilian Interpreter. Likewise, we pray for the three injured soldiers who, it has just been confirmed, are doing well," Trump wrote on Truth Social. Trump added, "This was an ISIS attack against the U.S. and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them." Last month, two West Virginia National Guard members were ambushed and shot near the White House in Washington, D.C., in a targeted attack that left one soldier dead.

A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia on Saturday after one of its engine's lost power.

United flight 803, which had 275 passengers and 15 crew members onboard, left Dulles for Tokyo's Haneda Airport at around 12:30 p.m. Shortly after takeoff, one of the Boeing jet's engine's failed and the plane circled in the air for over an hour until it safely returned to the airport.

No injuries were reported from the incident, but a brush fire was sparked near the Dulles runway by the plane's engine cover that blew off and fell to the ground. Smoke could be seen billowing into the air across the tarmac.

The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.

The engine failure on Flight 803 is the latest incident in a long year for air travel, particularly in airspace around Washington, D.C.

Back in January, an American Airlines flight and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided over the Potomac River, killing 67 people. Then, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended in November, resulted in staffing issues and lengthy delays at most major hubs.

The tragic crash in January has been brought back into the spotlight after the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act last weekend, the yearly bill to fund the Pentagon.

BOWSER AND NTSB CHAIRWOMAN RIP ‘SHAMEFUL' DC AIRSPACE PROVISION IN NDAA FOLLOWING POTOMAC CRASH

Included in the over 3,000-page bill is a provision that requires military aircraft operating training missions in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area to provide “warning of the proximity of such aircraft to nearby commercial aircraft in a manner compatible with the traffic alert and collision avoidance system of such commercial aircraft.”

It has recently been hit with backlash from the National Transportation Safety Board and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, as well as a bipartisan group of senators, who say it rolls back safety measures put in place after the Potomac crash.</p>

BALTIMORE (AP) — Blake Horvath to Eli Heidenreich. Horvath threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Heidenreich with 6:32 remaining — on fourth-and-goal — and No. 22 Navy rallied to beat Army 17-16 on Saturday. “Who wouldn't go to him?” Horvath said. “Tried to bring some pressure on them,” Army coach Jeff Monken said. With President Donald Trump in attendance, Navy (10-2) got its second straight victory over Army (6-6), and the Midshipmen won the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy for a second straight season. Army linebacker Eric Ford had a chance to scoop it up, but Navy running back Alex Tecza lunged over to prevent that, and Heidenreich eventually fell on the ball back at the 8. Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll. “That's probably the last thing you want to see on the 1-yard line is you turn around and the ball is just bouncing behind you,” Heidenreich said. I thought he had pushed in, and kind of out of my peripheral I saw it going behind me.” On the next play, Horvath was nearly sacked, but he was able to throw the ball toward Tecza as he went down. The ball fell incomplete instead of being caught around the 15, which was just as well for Navy because it made going for it on fourth down a more viable option. “I kind of felt like we had to,” Navy coach Brian Newberry said. Even after Heidenreich's touchdown and an Army punt, Navy still had to escape one more near-turnover. It came loose again and the Black Knights recovered, but after a review, Horvath was ruled down before the second fumble — a yard short of the line to gain. “They want to talk all their crap during the game and act like they're so tough,” Horvath said. “The excuse last year was that they played a conference championship game before us. This year, we'll see what it is.” The teams traded touchdown drives to start the game, each lasting 13 plays, 75 yards and over seven minutes. Army's first drive didn't end until 5 seconds into the second quarter. Then it was a while before anyone reached the end zone again. With Army up 10-7 late in the second quarter, the ball slipped out of Horvath's hand while he was looking to pass. Army recovered the fumble at its own 45 with 20 seconds to play and moved into range for a 45-yard field goal by Dawson Jones. The Black Knights had to settle for three — Dawson connected on a career-long 48-yard kick. Navy's Wing-T offense has been explosive this season. Army mostly kept them contained, but Horvath slipped free for a 37-yard run that set up a third-quarter field goal that made it 16-10. Army defensive lineman Jack Bousum, who is from Annapolis, had a big game against his hometown team. He finished with 1 1/2 sacks and a fumble recovery. Navy: Horvath made some big plays and some bad ones, and the Navy defense was stout in the second half. This victory matters more to them anyway. Army: Faces UConn in the Fenway Bowl on Dec. 27.
