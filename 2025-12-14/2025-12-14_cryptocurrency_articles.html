                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>YO Protocol is designed to help users earn yield on crypto assets by automatically rebalancing capital across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols while factoring in risk. It currently offers users access to USD, EUR, BTC, and gold-based yield products. Unlike most DeFi yield aggregators that operate within a single blockchain, YO's system works across chains. Its vaults — yoETH, yoUSD, yoBTC, yoEUR, and yoGOLD — dynamically allocate capital to wherever the risk-adjusted yield is most favorable, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. The protocol's core innovation lies in its calculation of "Risk Adjusted Yield," a metric derived from the team's background in building risk ratings for DeFi pools, the protocol's co-founder and CIO, Mehdi Lebbar, told CoinDesk in an interview. Rather than chasing the highest advertised percentages, the system calculates a probability of default based on thousands of risk vectors, which range from a protocol's age to its code audit history. To mitigate the security vulnerabilities often associated with moving assets between blockchains, YO Labs employs a unique architecture that minimizes reliance on bridges, Lebbar said. "If you bridge a pool, you have exposure to the risk of the bridge... We needed to create these 'embassies' across multiple planets, these vaults across multiple chains that hold native assets," Lebbar said. Beyond architecture, the system employs a 'DeFi Graph' to manage active risks during market volatility or protocol failures—what Lebbar calls 'Armageddon scenarios.' With the new capital, the company is positioning YO as core infrastructure for fintechs, wallets, and developers looking to embed sustainable yield into their products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$88,812.41 drifted below $90,000 on Sunday during quiet trading, with investors showing limited appetite for risk ahead of a busy week of economic data and central bank events. Ether ETH$3,086.56 changed hands near $3,104, down on the day but up more than 2% over the past seven days, outperforming bitcoin on a weekly basis. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at nearly $3.15 trillion, about 0.8% lower over 24 hours, with trading volumes around $89 billion, reflecting the thin liquidity typical of Sundays. Bitcoin dominance hovered near 57%, highlighting continued concentration in the largest digital asset as investors remain selective. Some analysts cautioned that bitcoin's consolidation could turn lower if key technical levels fail. Markets appear to be pausing ahead of a dense macroeconomic calendar in the coming days. In the U.S., investors will be watching a series of employment indicators, including the unemployment rate, ADP employment data and weekly jobless claims, alongside November inflation data, December flash PMI readings, and speeches from Federal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher J. Waller, for clues on the path of interest rates. Macro-sensitive traders are also closely monitoring developments in Japan, where the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is widely expected to raise interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. According to a Reuters report published Friday, markets have largely priced in a move that would lift the rate to 0.75% after Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years. While Japanese borrowing costs would remain low by global standards even after such a move, the report noted that the BOJ is likely to emphasize that monetary conditions will remain accommodative and that future rate increases will depend on how the economy responds to each increase. Still, expectations of tighter policy have drawn attention to the potential impact on yen-funded carry trades, a source of liquidity that has supported global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum consensus client Prysm said validators missed out on 382 ETH, equivalent to more than $1 million, after a software bug triggered network disruptions shortly after the recent Fusaka upgrade. The incident, detailed in a post-mortem titled “Fusaka Mainnet Prysm incident,” stemmed from a resource exhaustion event that affected nearly all Prysm nodes and led to missed blocks and attestations. According to Offchain Labs, the developer behind Prysm, the problem emerged on December 4 when a previously introduced bug caused delays in validator requests. Those delays resulted in missed blocks and attestations across the network. The disruption led to 41 missed epochs, with 248 blocks missing out of 1,344 available slots. That represented an 18.5% missed slot rate and pushed overall network participation down to 75% during the incident. While a temporary mitigation reduced the immediate impact, Prysm said it has since implemented permanent changes to its attestation validation logic to prevent a recurrence. Offchain Labs said the outage could have had more severe consequences if Prysm had accounted for a larger share of Ethereum's validator base. A bug client with more than 2/3rd could finalize an invalid chain,” it stated. Despite that mitigation, the incident has intensified calls for greater client diversity. Data from Miga Labs show that Lighthouse remains the dominant Ethereum consensus client, accounting for 51.39% of validators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices have struggled since peaking in early October, with traders fearful the market could be about to take a $1 trillion hit. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has dropped to around $90,000 per bitcoin, falling from its all-time high of $126,000 in October, even as U.S. president Donald Trump primes the market for an “immidiate” game-changer. Now, as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issues a “huge” crypto prediction, Michael Saylor has warned of “chaos, confusion," and "profoundly harmful consequences" if his bitcoin-buying company Strategy is ejected from MSCI indices. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin price and crypto market swings “The bitcoin hoarding will continue until the complaining stops,” Strategy founder Michael Saylor posted to X, sharing a Reuters report on Nasdaq's latest reshuffle. Nasdaq's decision, which could have torpedoed the company's valuation if it had gone the other way, was cheered by bitcoin supporters. “Have you ever actually seen a group of people consistently advocate for the collapse or liquidation of a company the way they do against Strategy,” he asked. However, a bitcoin price slump has followed the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates this week, raising fears of a full-blown bitcoin price crash could be looming. Saylor has written to MSCI, asking it to drop a proposal that would bar companies whose crypto holdings exceed 50% of their total assets from its global equity benchmarks. In the 12-page letter, Saylor and Strategy's chief executive Phong Le warned of "profoundly harmful consequences" if MSCI adopts the proposal, with a decision expected by January 15. "MSCI can either succumb to the reactive short-sightedness that established institutions sometimes display toward innovation, or it can allow its indices to reflect, neutrally and faithfully, the next era of financial technology," the pair wrote. If MSCI does adopt the proposal, it could lead to outflows of as much as $8.8 billion from Strategy's stock if other index providers follow suit, according to a JPMorgan estimate. Saylor's remarks were echoed by Adam Back, the chief executive of bitcoin development company Blockstream who was cited in the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper, telling Yahoo Finance that we are still in the “very early stages” of bitcoin adoption and that all companies will eventually become bitcoin treasury companies. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has slashed its end of 2025 bitcoin price prediction, halving it from $200,000 to $100,000. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “We think buying by bitcoin digital asset treasury companies is likely over,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailed note, adding bitcoin treasury company "buying is unlikely to provide further support." “We now think future bitcoin price increases will effectively be driven by one leg only–ETF buying,” Kendrick said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's overall underwhelming price performance continued in the past 24 hours as the asset is close to breaking below $90,000 decisively. Most larger-cap alts are also slightly in the red daily, as ETH is down to $3,100, while XRP sits at a pivotal support level at $2.00. It slipped following this multi-week peak but challenged it again on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut the rates by 25 bps. However, this was another fakeout as bitcoin quickly lost all of the momentum and dumped below $89,500. However, the bears have been more persistent so far on Sunday as the cryptocurrency sits just under that coveted support. Most larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, so we will focus on their weekly performances. The chart reveals that although ETH has slipped by 1% in the past day, it's actually 2% up weekly at $3,100. XRP has lost around 1% within the same timeframe and now struggles to remain above $2.00. M has outperformed the rest with a 40% weekly surge, while QNT and KAS are down by 11% each. The total crypto market cap has lost another $20 billion daily and is down to $3.150 trillion on CG.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Notably, this announcement has sparked speculation across the financial and crypto communities: Could this new ledger resemble the XRP Ledger (XRPL), renowned for fast, low-cost international transactions? SWIFT is modernizing cross-border payments with a blockchain-based ledger. Traditionally slowed by multiple intermediaries, international transactions can take days to settle. SWIFT's shared, real-time ledger lets authorized institutions view every payment simultaneously, cutting delays, reconciliation errors, and operational friction. Both aim for fast, low-cost, real-time settlements between financial institutions. By enabling “always-on” payments, it offers near-instant access to funds, improved liquidity management, and reduced reliance on intermediaries—potentially lowering transaction costs. For financial institutions, the shared ledger provides real-time transaction visibility, enhancing risk management, efficiency, and settlement speed. Though details on its architecture, blockchain protocol, and interoperability with networks like the XRP Ledger remain unclear, SWIFT's foray into blockchain marks a turning point for global payments. The industry will keenly watch whether Swift's ledger merely mirrors existing networks or pioneers new capabilities that could transform cross-border finance. Well, SWIFT's blockchain initiative highlights a pivotal shift whereby leading financial institutions now see distributed ledger technology not as a fintech experiment, but as the future backbone of global payments. While it's unclear if the ledger will leverage the XRP Ledger, SWIFT's move underscores that distributed ledger technology is moving from theory to a core driver of global finance, potentially making instant, always-on payments the new standard.

JP Morgan, who set up the deal, made an on-chain USCP token for it. The blockchain handles both issuance and redemption flows, a use case for the ease of use of stablecoins and tokenized assets in traditional debt markets. JPM's stock was trading at $314.97, up 1.49% in the last 24 hours. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around JPM continued to be in the ‘extremely bullish' territory amid ‘extremely high' levels of chatter over the past day. Instead, it built its own Ethereum (ETH)-based private ledger called Quorum and started projects such as the Liink to make it easier for banks to share data safely. These efforts indicated that JP Morgan was early on in its "blockchain, not Bitcoin" stance, which favored institutional control and regulatory protections over public, permissionless crypto systems. In 2023, CEO Jamie Dimon publicly called Bitcoin a "hyped-up fraud," but at the same time, the bank was putting millions of dollars into its own blockchain infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The latest slide, including a 1 day share price return of minus 3.7 percent and a year to date share price return of roughly minus 41 percent, suggests momentum is clearly fading even after an exceptional 3 year total shareholder return above 900 percent. If Bitcoin volatility and Strategy's sharp moves have you rethinking concentration risk, it could be worth scanning fast growing stocks with high insider ownership for other high conviction ideas with strong insider alignment. With Strategy trading more than 40 percent below its year-to-date level, yet still closely linked to Bitcoin sentiment, the key question now is whether investors are looking at a rare mispricing or a market that is already discounting future upside. At a last close of $176.45 versus a narrative fair value of $663, the gap is striking and hinges on Strategy's extreme Bitcoin leverage and capital plans. According to BlackGoat, this valuation leans on aggressive earnings expansion powered by explosive Bitcoin price assumptions, growing treasury holdings, and rich profit margins that reshape Strategy's long term earnings base. Want to see what happens when rapid earnings growth, expanding Bitcoin reserves, and a premium profit multiple all collide in one model? However, this upside case still hinges on fraught assumptions, with Bitcoin volatility and potential NAV premium compression both capable of rapidly unwinding that seemingly large discount. Find out about the key risks to this Strategy narrative. If you see the story differently or want to stress test the assumptions yourself, you can build a fresh narrative in just minutes: Do it your way Before you move on, give yourself the edge by scanning fresh stock ideas with strong fundamentals, growth potential, and themes that could reshape your portfolio.
