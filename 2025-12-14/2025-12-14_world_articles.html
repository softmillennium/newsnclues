                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• At least 11 people have been killed in a shooting targeting the Jewish community on Australia's Bondi Beach, police say. The attack took place as hundreds gathered to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah, and has been declared a terrorist incident. • Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the attack as “an act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation” and said that “an attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.” Israeli officials reacted with horror and anger, with several accusing the Australian government of allowing a surge in antisemitism. • Police also confirmed that there are two known suspects — one is dead while the other is in a life-threatening condition in hospital. Officers have secured and removed explosive devices found in a nearby vehicle. It's nearing 5 a.m. in Sydney, where the sun will shortly be rising the day after a fatal shooting attack on Australia's famous Bondi Beach. A 12-year-old girl and a rabbi are among the victims, Alexander Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CNN. US President Donald Trump said Sunday that people celebrating Hanukkah should not be worried about their safety, and should “celebrate proudly,” following a shooting targeting the Jewish community that killed at least 11 people on Australia's Bondi Beach. Peter Doocy of Fox News said on air he “just got off the phone” with Trump and asked whether Americans observing Hanukkah should be worried about their security. “Straight from the president, his message to people celebrating Hanukkah today, he said, ‘they do not need to be worried. A bystander who is being hailed as a hero for tackling one of the gunmen during the Bondi Beach attack has been undergoing surgery after being wounded in the attack, his cousin said. Speaking to 7News from outside a Sydney hospital, his cousin said he had been told by doctors his relative was “OK,” and they would soon be allowed to go inside and visit him. The man was later praised as a “genuine hero” by New South Wales State Premier Chris Minns. The shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday targeted people celebrating the first night of Hanukkah, a Jewish holiday that usually falls between late November and late December and lasts for eight days. It ended up lasting for eight days, until the delivery of new consecrated oil. Candles are lit each night of Hanukkah to commemorate the miracle. The candles are placed in the menorah from right to left but are lit from left to right. Another symbol of Hanukkah is the dreidel, a four-sided spinning top. When soldiers came through while they were reading the sacred text, Jews pretended to play a gambling game involving the tops to avoid detection. In a message sent to the Australian people, the monarch said, “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully, including the police officers who were injured while protecting members of their community.” Charles commended emergency responders as well as members of the public “whose heroic actions no doubt prevented even greater horror and tragedy.” Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales also sent a message, saying their “thoughts are with every Australian today.” A Rabbi based in the US on Sunday described how his nephew was caught up in the fatal shooting at Bondi Beach, hiding with his daughter as bullets flew past them. “He described to me how he was literally hiding as the shooting was going on,” Rabbi Levi Shemtov, Executive Vice President of the American Friends of Lubavitch, told CNN. Adding that Australia is home to the largest community of Holocaust survivors outside of Israel, Shemtov continued, “Many people wanted to get as far away from the horrors of the Holocaust after it ended and went to Australia, and rebuilt their lives very successfully … and were very productive in the development of Australia as a nation.” Australia's National Terrorism Threat level is currently set at “probable,”  according to the Australian government. When a terror threat level is “probable,” it means that there is a more than 50% chance of a terror attack taking place or being planned in Australia in the next twelve months, Australia's New South Wales (NSW) Police Force says on its website. On a page which sets out the National Terrorism Threat Level, Australia's National Security agency says that the country's security landscape “has entered a vulnerable period and is being challenged by new threats with concerning trajectories.” In a section about what a possible terrorist attack might look like in the country, National Security says that “attacks in Australia are likely to be low-cost, using readily available weapons, and simple tactics.” This is also “most likely to be conducted by an individual (known as a lone actor) or a small group,” it adds. “Antisemitism is a cancer that spreads when leaders remain silent, and they must replace weakness with strength in facing it.” “That did not happen in Australia - and today, something terrible occurred there. Some context: Speaking earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the attack as “an act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation” and said that “an attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.” Among those killed in the attack on a Hanukkah event in Sydney's Bondi Beach was one Israeli citizen, according to the Israeli foreign ministry. Another Israeli was wounded and is receiving treatment at a local hospital in Sydney, the foreign ministry said. US' Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said in a post on X that he “strongly condemns” Sunday's fatal attack at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia. The embassy urged Australia-based US citizens to avoid the immediate Bondi Beach area, follow guidance from local authorities and inform loved ones of their status. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Australia “must take significant action” after “a sharp rise in antisemitism,” a statement by the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. Speaking to his Australian counterpart Penny Wong, Saar expressed “sorrow and pain, on behalf of the people of Israel, over the murderous antisemitic attack in Sydney.” Saar said “security” for the Jewish community in Australia “can only be achieved through a true change in public atmosphere.” Australia, which has seen large-scale protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, formally recognized the State of Palestine in September alongside several other Western nations, drawing criticism from the Israeli government. Saar earlier wrote on X that the Australian government “must come to its senses.” A 12-year-old girl and a rabbi are among the victims of the fatal shooting in Sydney, Alexander Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CNN's Victor Blackwell a short while ago. “I know everyone who was there (at the Hanukkah celebration). That's an event where I attend with my family every single year,” Ryvchin said, adding that he was scheduled to speak at the event as he has done for the last decade, but had to drop out last minute due to scheduling conflicts. Another of Ryvchin's friends “lost his 12-year-old daughter, who succumbed to her wounds in hospital,” he said. This is something that will transform our country,” he said. We can now bring you some of the video we mentioned earlier, which shows a bystander tackling and wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen in the Bondi Beach mass shooting on Sunday. The bystander was praised as a “genuine hero” by New South Wales State Premier Chris Minns. In New York, the NYPD said it was deploying additional resources to public Hanukkah celebrations and synagogues “out of an abundance of caution.” “It is an awful reality that Jewish communities across the world continue to face a higher level of threat. At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hannukah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. “Even though there are currently no concrete indications of a threat to Berlin following the suspected attack in Australia, we remain vigilant and alert,” Polizei Berlin said on social media. A fatal shooting incident took place at Australia's popular Bondi Beach on Sunday, in an attack that police said targeted the country's Jewish community. If you're just joining us, here's what we've been reporting so far: Authorities have so far not provided any details about the identities of these suspects. Jewish community targeted: More than 1,000 people were attending a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach when the shooting occurred, police said, adding that the attack was “designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.” Australian PM addresses Jewish community: Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese shared a message with the Jewish community earlier, telling them: “Your fellow Australians stand with you tonight in condemning this act of terror.” The country will never submit to “division, violence or hatred,” he added. Israeli leaders react with horror: A number of Israeli officials reacted angrily to the shooting, with many accusing the Australian government of allowing a surge in antisemitism. Jewish council “horrified and shaken”: Additionally, the Jewish Council of Australia called the attack a “horrific act of antisemitic violence during the Jewish festival of light and hope.” In a statement, it said that “many within our community have just received the worst news of their lives,” adding: “In moments like this, we hold each other close.” CNN's Tal Shalev, Tamar Michaelis, Sophie Tanno, Hilary Whiteman and Mostafa Salem contributed to this reporting. The CEO of the Australian Jewish Association has described the fatal shooting at Bondi Beach as an “entirely foreseeable” tragedy, saying that Australian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese's government had been warned many times about rising antisemitism. “What happened tonight is a tragedy but entirely foreseeable.The Albanese government was warned so many times but failed to take adequate actions to protect the Jewish community,” Robert Gregory said. Earlier, police said they had located a vehicle linked to the deceased gunman which they believed contained “several improvised explosive devices,” at the scene in Bondi Beach. The force's rescue bomb disposal unit had been working at the scene on Campbell Parade, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said at a news conference earlier. It is approaching midnight local time in Sydney, Australia, where at least 11 people were killed in a shooting at the city's Bondi Beach earlier today. Strict gun laws were introduced in 1996 after a shocking attack at Port Arthur, when 35 people were killed by a lone gunman.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With cheap drinks and friendly locals, Jimmy's Corner is a New York institution. But a real-estate developer has ordered its closure – can it survive? Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy's Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years' accumulation of dust in some areas. It's a beloved spot, a piece of New York history that has endured as Times Square transformed from a den of inequity into one of New York's main tourist attractions. But Jimmy's Corner may now have met its match, after the building's landlord ordered its owner to shut down this famous watering hole. “It felt like losing my parents again,” Adam Glenn, Jimmy Glenn's son, who took over the bar in 2015, told the Guardian. It has left people who drink in the bar on tenterhooks. Jimmy, who also worked as a boxing cutman, ran a gym, and was friendly with Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, died in 2020, aged 89, but Glenn has kept the bar has continued unchanged, even down to the prices: a pint of beer is $3, in a neighborhood where some places charge four times that. In an area of Manhattan full of bars, most of which are bigger, brighter, and have more modern toilets than Jimmy's, its close-knit atmosphere is just as important to its appeal. You can't, like, wander off,” said Walter Trice, a Jimmy's regular who was drinking a beer in a small area at the back of the bar on Thursday evening. And there's no wifi here, so your phone basically doesn't work. Karolina Collado, 31, was drinking what she described as “the coldest Corona in all of New York City” – something she attributes to the bar's well-functioning fridges. She drinks in the bar most weeks, including to “pre-game” before playing softball. They make you feel great, we have genuine conversations. And I've met a lot of people here who are awesome. Glenn said his father would be “incredibly hurt” by the potential closure. It's painful for him, too, given Jimmy's is also where Glenn spent key passages of his childhood. I remember being three years old, and it would take me 20 minutes to load a bucket of ice, but I would stand on the chair and load a bucket of ice and push it to the front,” he said. “I have so many of my memories here. We did Thanksgiving here, Christmas, New Year's [Eve]. Most of the major family events were happening at the bar: one, because we loved it there, and two, because we couldn't afford to take a break. When Jimmy Glenn opened the bar in 1971, Times Square was very different from the light-strewn, tourist-stricken place it is today. “For a lot of our neighbors, and people who were young in the 70s and 80s and were in that neighborhood, a lot of them would say, ‘I didn't feel safe coming home late at night if Jimmy wasn't there,'” Glenn said. Glenn said his father was close to the Dursts for decades, but he believes he was “tricked” into agreeing to a lease provision where the Durst could evict Jimmy's Corner when he died. “I think my dad would be incredibly hurt and disappointed, because he would have expected better from them,” Glenn said, adding that his father saw the Dursts as “part of the family”. “But I also think my dad would be very proud of me, because my parents didn't raise me to be the kind of person who lays down just because someone is bigger than you, just because they have more money than you.” A spokeswoman for Durst said: “For decades, we did everything we could to help keep the bar's doors open, including providing extremely favorable rent. After Jimmy's tragic death, we decided to sell the building, and we went above and beyond our lease obligations due to the personal relationship with Jimmy.” The spokeswoman said Durst told Glenn over a year ago he would have to vacate the building, and offered him $250,000 to do so – Glenn disputes this, and says he was initially offered no money to leave. For the Jimmy's Corner patrons, it is unclear what will happen next. Glenn said he always knew the bar couldn't last for ever, given the soaring value of property in Times Square. Even so, the loss of this last vestige of an older New York would be painful for anyone who has eagerly squeezed their way into Jimmy's for a cheap drink and a vivid experience. “One thing I love about this place compared to a lot of other bars is that it's a very friendly environment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the past year, tens of thousands hostile to immigrants marched through London, chanting “send them home!” A British lawmaker complained of seeing too many non-white faces on TV. And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad. In several European countries, political parties that favour mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the AfD, or Alternative for Germany and France's National Rally. U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. “garbage” and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments. Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race. “What were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,” said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen's University Belfast. Opinion: A thriving Syrian family shows why we shouldn't give up on immigration More Canadians, including children, detained in U.S. for immigration violations, new data show Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King's College London. Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Germany's AfD, France's National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties. Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The centre-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes. A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn't see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city. Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse. “There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.” In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain's streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police. Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behaviour. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider. In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function. Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes – though he added that's “quite a forlorn hope.” “The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine has relinquished its aim to join the NATO military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday as peace talks got under way in Berlin. Zelensky aired the concession as he flew to the German capital where he began meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in efforts to end Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War Two. The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join NATO as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia's war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday. “From the very beginning, Ukraine's desire was to join NATO, these are real security guarantees. “And it is already a compromise from our part,” he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from the about 10% of Donbas which Kyiv still controls. Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the U.S.-led NATO alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics. Zelensky had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again. Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow's demands, Zelensky accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine's power and water supplies. U.S. negotiator Jared Kushner arrives at the Chancellery for talks with German Chancellor Merz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin on Sunday.Sean Gallup/Getty Images Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the U.S. proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its NATO ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces. European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine's future, and sought to shore up Kyiv's finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv's military and civilian budget. Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as “constructive,” although no major breakthroughs were reached. Zelensky said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across Ukraine, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that NATO should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia's next target.” “They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr. Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,” Peskov added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Person of interest detained in Brown University shooting that left two dead Earlier on Sunday, Georgia senator Raphael Warnock urged people to find “common humanity” after a deadly shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, Warnock said: “I can tell you that as a pastor who has presided over many funerals, I don't think that there's any pain deeper than when nature is violently reversed and rather than children burying their parents, the parent has to bury the child. And so we pray prayers for these families.” Warnock, who pushed Congress to pass more gun control legislation after two students and two teachers at a high school in his home state of Georgia were shot to death in 2024, went on to call for action after yet another mass shooting at an education facility in America. Any nation that tolerates this kind of violence year after year, decade after decade in random places on our college and school campuses without doing all that we can to stop it is broken and in need of moral repair.” During the press conference, Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say if the person of interest had any connection to Brown University. “I'm not ready to confirm or comment on any of that,” Perez told reporters. “Again, I got to respect the process, and so at this point, we're just going to continue, like the mayor stated. Police refused to comment on a social media post by FBI director Kash Patel that claimed the arrest of a person of interest was based on a lead from Providence police. Writing on X, Patel said the FBI “established a command post to intake, develop and analyze leads, and run them to ground. We activated the FBI's Cellular Analysis Survey Team, to provide critical geolocation capabilities. We set up a digital media intake portal to ingest images and video from the public related to this incident. “And the FBI's victim specialists are fully integrating with our partners to provide resources to victims and survivors of this horrific violence. This FBI will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served. Mayor Brett Smiley says he won't share names of the victims yet as he believes some of their families have not yet been contacted because they might be travelling for the holidays. Police chief Col Oscar Perez addresses reporters and says he is aware of speculation around a suspect's name. He told reporters the “investigation continues to progress extremely fast” He added: We're in the process of collecting evidence and seizing items that we need to seize such location that we need to search.” He thanked the medical staff at Brown Health and Rhode Island Hospital, saying: “These folks, just like our law enforcement professionals, have been up all night working. But the level of care and professionalism that they're exhibiting is extraordinary. It pales in comparison what they've gone through for the rest of us here. “But what they've been through something entirely different. He pointed to a website set up by the city of Providence where the community find resources for mental health care. He said a vigil would be held at 5pm ET at Olympic Park, where there had been plans to light a Christmas tree and to light a menorah for the first night of Hanukkah. He said: “And for those who know at least a little bit of a Hanukkah story, it is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light, if there's nothing better that we could be doing this community.” Providence mayor Brett Smiley begins the press conference. He starts by praising the level of collaboration between law enforcement agencies. He says there is no update to share on the investigation, that the investigation is ongoing and that officials are cooperating with law enforcement agencies.</p>

MOSCOW, December 14. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Alliance needs to revise its strategic framework to prepare for a confrontation with Russia that will go beyond the "Battle for the Atlantic," the NATO Defense College (NDC) said in a report.

NDC Senior Non-Resident Associate Fellow Andrew Monaghan points out that "the development of the holistic sea power of the state is an essential feature" of Moscow' s policy, which allows Russia to position itself as a leader in "a period of geoeconomic competition."

"This shifts the frames of NATO's reference beyond a renewed ‘Battle for the Atlantic' or scenarios of ground operations in northeastern Europe towards a multi-front, multi-domain Russian challenge, one with a global horizon," the document notes.

The report adds that scenarios for a crisis "often focus on an escalation in what is a single strategic direction stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Kara Sea.".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Republican plans to pick off five Democratic-held congressional seats in Texas once seemed like a sure thing. President Donald Trump's flagging approval ratings, particularly among Latinos, and strong Democratic performance in this year's special elections have changed both parties' assumptions. Now, the cushion the Texas GOP drew into its new map – Trump won every Republican-favored district by 10 points or more a year ago – seems like it might be too small. Democrats beat Trump's 2024 results in five US House districts with special elections this year by at least 13 points. Over-performance at that level next year would flip three of the five new Texas seats to the Democratic column, though it's unlikely that performance will be replicated in every district around the country, and recent polling suggests that Democrats currently have a more modest national advantage. “I can feel it on the ground,” said Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, whose South Texas district was one of the five targeted by Republicans. “I really anticipate us taking the majority back next cycle and winning back South Texas and places that had been traditional Democratic districts that have turned on us in the last few cycles, with so many disillusioned people.” Republicans are still likely to make overall gains in the national redistricting battle with the help of Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio, even after Indiana's Republican senators rejected new maps despite Trump's pressure. But shifting national trends could change what both parties expect to gain as they redraw their maps. Greg Abbott, who pushed the GOP-led legislature to redistrict and is running for a fourth term next year, said the “vast majority of Texans” share Abbott's values: “secure borders, safer communities, and an economy that keeps Texas affordable.” “We compete for every vote, because elections aren't won on past results but on a clear vision and proven experience that delivers for all Texans,” Leal said in a statement. “We're confident that message continues to resonate with Latino voters statewide.” Texas' new maps sought to build on Trump's strong performance in the state, which he won by 14 points. Notably, Trump won every county in the heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley, which was long a Democratic stronghold. And in Miami, a Democratic-backed candidate won the mayoral election earlier this month, breaking nearly 30 years of Republican-aligned control of the nonpartisan seat. When asked how they would have voted in the 2024 presidential election if they could vote again, Texan Latinos backed Democrat Kamala Harris by a margin of 11 points, a 19-point swing from the 8-point margin by which the same group said they supported Trump in 2024. Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist and founder of Solidarity Strategies, told CNN that he thought Latinos could swing back to Democrats next year by a five- to 20-point margin. “I think they're all going to snap back,” Rocha said. Gonzalez highlighted that affordability is the top issue in his district, along with a shortage of labor and an increased presence of immigration officers on the ground. “I don't think Democrats, and especially Latinos, who voted for Trump ever expected that this would happen,” Gonzalez later said. A big swing among Texas Latinos could put the GOP-held 15th Congressional District in play too. Currently held by Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, the 15th District voted comfortably for Trump in 2024 (he won by 18 points under 2026 lines), but his margin was considerably more modest in 2020 (2 points). Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke won the district by 11 points in his 2018 US Senate run. De La Cruz's electoral margins barely change under the new map. Patrick Ruffini, pollster and founding partner at Republican firm Echelon Insights, argued before last year's presidential election that Trump could lead a realignment to bring many Latinos into a GOP coalition focused on working-class issues. “Without them … it's kind of very hard for Democrats to have long-term success in presidential elections. South Texas is home to a more conservative population intimately familiar with the border, Ruffini said. But Rocha believes even just a slight change in the voting habits of Latinos in rural areas could flip districts on the edge. Democrats notched strong performances in the five special elections for US House this year, over-performing 2024 presidential margins by at least 13 points in each race and averaging a 17-point improvement overall. Democratic candidates may end up with a larger margin among voters who actually turn out given the growing evidence of Democratic advantage in voter motivation. “Affordability is really the front and center issue right now. This story has been updated to add a statement from Texas Gov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's 429th Separate Drone Regiment "Achilles" claimed on Dec. 13 the destruction of a pipeline used by Russian troops to infiltrate the front-line town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast. The news came shortly after Ukraine's National Guard said its 2nd Khartiia Corps carried out a successful counterattack north of Kupiansk, a development that flatly contradicted Russia's recent claims of capturing the northeastern town. The route was discovered during reconnaissance and destroyed in a joint operation with other Ukrainian units. "It was a safe route that allowed (Russia) to build up strength while bypassing (Ukrainian) fire," the "Achilles" said. In September, reports emerged that Russian troops used a gas pipeline to infiltrate Kupiansk, a tactic they adopted during the Battle of Avdiivka. Kupiansk lies 104 kilometers (65 miles) east of Kharkiv, the regional center. President Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin, as talks continue to finalize a peace plan to end Russia's full-scale war. Russian forces attacked a supermarket in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Dec. 14, injuring at least 14 people, including a six-year-old child, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported. President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed solidarity with Australia following a terrorist attack in eastern Sydney on Dec. 14, which targeted the Jewish community, killing at least 12 people and injuring 29 others. "I don't think we'll be delaying anything. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on renewed calls for Ukraine to hold wartime elections after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Kyiv used Russia's war to avoid a vote, echoing a Kremlin narrative. Zelensky said Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov informed him Belarus preferred this option over releasing the prisoners via "this or that EU country." The U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian potash in exchange for the release of over 100 political prisoners in Belarus, many of whom were transferred to Ukraine. Ukraine's "Achilles" drone regiment described the pipeline as a "critically important logistical channel" for Russian forces. The route was discovered during reconnaissance and destroyed in a joint operation with other Ukrainian units. President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 13 that Ukraine's sanctions against nearly 700 vessels linked to Russia's shadow fleet had entered into force. President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 13 announced he will meet "with envoys" of U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming days as discussions on the U.S.-proposed peace framework aimed at ending Russia's war continue.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States has deployed combat aircraft using lighting bombs after an attack by militants of the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) on a Syrian-American patrol in Palmyra, Syria TV reported. "American planes dropped lighting bombs in the sky over the city," the TV channel said. Earlier, SANA news agency reported that a man opened fire on the Syrian and American military during their joint patrol of the territory. The attacker was killed on the spot. According to the Pentagon, two US military personnel and one American translator were killed and several people injured. Traffic on the Deir ez-Zor-Damascus highway was suspended. American helicopters arrived at the scene to evacuate the injured to the US and Western coalition military base near the city of Al-Tanf (250 km off Damascus). The United States has been actively reducing its military contingent in Syria since the beginning of the year. The main American forces are currently concentrated in the Kurdish-controlled regions of northeastern Syria and in the south, near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The United States continues to coordinate operations with the Syrian security forces against the remaining cells of the IG terrorist group.</p>
