                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  December 14, 2025 / 12:57 PM EST / CBS New York New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says he will appoint a "World Cup czar" to push FIFA to lower ticket prices for the 2026 tournament. Mamdani, a democratic socialist and avid soccer fan, has been openly critical of FIFA's decision to let ticket prices fluctuate based on demand, instead of selling them for a flat rate based on seating, like at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. But as mayor, can he actually do anything about high ticket prices? FIFA's ticket pricing plan for the tournament across the U.S., Mexico and Canada has drawn international outage, as soccer fans worry about getting priced out, especially with eight matches, including the Final, coming next summer to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The group Football Supports Europe contends it would cost fans nearly $7,000 USD to follow their team from its first match to the Final in 2026. FIFA is also involved in ticket resales for the upcoming tournament, charging secondary sellers and buyers 15% each. "I want the price to be something that's affordable. And when it was last in the United States, you could get to the final in California for less than $200. That needs to be what we're looking for," Mamdani said. The first game at MetLife Stadium will be a Group Stage match pitting Brazil, one of the most successful teams in World Cup history, against Morocco on June 13. The stadium holds a whopping 82,500 fans for soccer, but demand appears to be very high to start and it's likely to rise as the stakes get higher later in the tournament. "I am going to appoint a World Cup czar because, I think at the core of it, I'm so excited at the fact that we are going to be hosting eight games across the World Cup next summer," Mamdani said. "I also understand why soccer fans feel the way they do. FIFA also used a dynamic ticket pricing model for the Club World Cup last summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The surprisingly high cost of tickets for the 2026 World Cup is reported to have created a serious risk of empty seats across the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC A European supporters' group branded the prices “extortionate,” while FIFA's defense of its decision to take 15% from both the buyer and seller of any tickets resold through official channels also left fans across the globe furious. According to The Times, there have been no suggestions that FIFA will lower the cost of tickets and, as a result, many national associations traveling to North America now have genuine concerns about not selling their full allocations. On top of the obvious issues with ticket prices, overseas fans also have to consider transport and accommodation costs when exploring how to support their teams next summer. Many who registered their interest in tickets months ago have since walked away following the release of ticket prices. Ticket sales through national associations remain open until Jan. 13, at which point it will be revealed whether any have not sold their full allocations. FIFA clearly have no concerns about a reduced attendance. Having initially predicted World Cup tickets would generate a total of around $1.8 billion, that estimate has now risen to $3 billion. The process is not unique to FIFA and has long attracted significant criticism. FIFA claim to have received “extraordinary levels” of interest when it comes to ticket sales, although most of those supporters were based in the three host nations across North America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has criticised ex-England player Rio Ferdinand for failing to speak out against the high ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The controversy began when Ferdinand tagged Carragher on his X page to comment on Mohamed Salah being applauded by Liverpool fans after their Premier League win over Brighton and Hove Albion. The former Manchester United defender wrote: “Thoughts @Carra23? ‘Mo Salah' being sung by the Kop.” Carragher, a Sky Sports analyst, responded by acknowledging Salah's strong performance when given the opportunity to play. He then went further, questioning Ferdinand on why he has not addressed the exorbitant ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup. Carragher hinted that Ferdinand's payment for serving as Master of Ceremonies at the tournament draw may have influenced his silence. A man of the people would surely call @FIFAcom & Infantino out. Or was your pay packet for the draw (acting) enough to buy your silence?” Carragher tweeted on X. FIFA has faced increasing pressure from football fans and advocacy groups, who have criticized the ticket prices for the 2026 tournament, noting they are significantly higher than those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erling Haaland and Phil Foden raised their game as Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 despite producing an underwhelming performance in south London. Palace posed a threat with their frequent quick and direct breaks, such as when Yeremy Pino clattered the bar after being played in by Adam Wharton or Ismaila Sarr getting into the area and flashing a shot across the face of goal. GOAL rates Man City's players from Selhurst Park... Had to be alert throughout due to Palace's bright play and was ready for everything they threw at him. Mostly solid apart from when he gave the ball straight to Warton, which led to a Palace break. An early blow to the head didn't stop him from making crunching tackles and getting on top of Palace's attacks. Had a testing first half, struggling to handle Sarr. Grew more composed as the game went on and reasserted himself by picking Sarr's pocket to snuff out a good chance. Much better than his rusty display in Madrid as he kept the ball well. Fed Nunes when he crossed for Haaland. Sat very deep and was overwhelmed on several occasions, getting mugged by Pino in the first half and again when Wharton hit the post. Didn't get the rub of the green with his opportunities, shooting straight at Dean Henderson and being dispossessed by Chris Richards when he was about to pull the trigger. Had little joy before then but he is developing a great habit of making key contributions at key moments. Had little involvement in the game but all he needed was one sight of goal to give City the lead. Held the ball up well when Foden scored and faced down taunts from Palace fans for not taking the penalty in the FA Cup final by coolly dispatching his spot-kick.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A long-standing Lionel Messi record at Barcelona has finally fallen after Pedri etched his name into Blaugrana history during a La Liga win over Osasuna. Goals from Raphinha secured all three points for Flick's side, who were seeking to move seven points clear of Real Madrid ahead of their rivals' fixture the following day. Pedri was handed a starting role at the base of Flick's double-pivot system, a position that has increasingly become his natural role this season. The Spain international dictated tempo throughout the contest, offering calmness and structure during periods when Osasuna threatened to disrupt Barcelona's rhythm. Beyond his influence on the match itself, Pedri's appearance carried historic significance. As per Opta, at just 23 years and 18 days old, he reached 150 La Liga appearances for Barcelona, becoming the youngest player ever to do so. In the process, he surpassed a record previously held by Messi. Pedri's record-breaking milestone highlights his remarkable consistency and durability at a club where young players are often burdened with enormous expectations. Reaching 150 league appearances at such an early age places him in rare company and reinforces Barcelona's long-term commitment to building their midfield around him. The midfielder's influence did not go unnoticed by his teammates, with Eric Garcia offering a light-hearted but telling assessment after the match. When things get complicated, give the ball to Pedri, and he solves everything." Head coach Flick was equally emphatic in his praise, singling Pedri out despite Raphinha's two-goal contribution. The German said: "Pedri is a fantastic player, top class. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Pedri's rise at Barcelona has been nothing short of extraordinary since his arrival from Las Palmas in 2020. Thrust into the first team almost immediately, he became a regular starter during the 2020–21 season, amassing 52 appearances and playing a key role in Barcelona's Copa del Rey triumph. Those efforts earned him both the Golden Boy and Kopa Trophy in 2021, confirming his status as the most highly regarded young midfielder in world football. Comparisons with Andres Iniesta soon followed, driven by his composure, close control, and ability to glide through crowded midfields. In recent seasons, injuries have provided the main obstacle to Pedri's sustained momentum. However, under Flick, he has re-emerged as a central figure, once fit, already surpassing 220 appearances in all competitions by the age of 23 and continuing to shape games with maturity well beyond his years. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Barcelona now turn their focus to maintaining their advantage at the top of La Liga as the season enters a decisive phase. With Pedri once again available and influencing matches, Flick's side look better equipped to manage the demands of both domestic and European competitions. For Pedri personally, breaking Messi's record is unlikely to be an endpoint, but rather another marker in a rapidly expanding legacy at Camp Nou. With assists in three consecutive league games and a growing leadership role in midfield, his influence continues to increase with each appearance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Per one report, if Bayern Munich wants Borussia Dortmund and German national team center-back Nico Schlotterbeck, it will have to pony up €50 million for a transfer fee. That number seems….low, especially considering the fact that BVB would likely not want to do anything to help Bayern Munich secure a player like Schlotterbeck. In addition, Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg and Patrick Berger (via @iMiaSanMia) are reporting that Schlotterbeck is biding his time to see what will develop with Bayern Munich, FC Barcelona., and Real Madrid before making anything official. Dortmund would likely take a similarly firm stance to Leverkusen's handling of Jonathan Tah. Even with only one year remaining on his contract, they would absolutely not let him go for something around €25-30m. They would even accept the risk of losing him on a free transfer in 2027. At FC Bayern, Schlotterbeck, just like Marc Guéhi, remains a candidate. According to one report, Bayern Munich is planning a raid for Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez: Vincent Kompany's Bayern Munich are plotting a raid on Chelsea for their midfield mainstay Enzo Fernandez. Bayern Munich are looking to add more quality to their midfield, and they have their eyes set on Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez, who is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world. Bayern Munich are very keen on signing the Argentine international, as they look to further bolster their midfield. They want to freshen things up in the centre of the park, and believe he could become one of their leaders going forward. Kompany wants someone who can partner with Joshua Kimmich and is capable enough to control the tempo and increase the speed of play when needed. The German giants have been carefully monitoring his progress, and they are now ready to make an offer worth around €120 million to prise him away from the London club. However, a €120 million offer won't be that easy to turn down amidst some financial difficulty. Gareth Bale's love of golf while he was at Real Madrid became a punchline and a meme worldwide, but the Welsh legend thinks it that is was just fake news: Eintracht remain fully convinced that he will become their number one in the near future. Bayern Munich wunderkind was named to UEFA”s Champions League Team of the Week: Bayern Munich has been linked to AZ Alkmaar midfielder Kees Smit, but Chelsea could be leading on the 19-year-old: Kees' transfer is valued at around the £25 million mark, although it's unclear if Chelsea would be willing to stump up such a sum in January. Newcastle, by contrast, are definitely pondering a move for the Netherlands international next month. Football fandom is often marked by fierce passion, but at times that emotion can erupt in alarming and destructive ways. What FC Haka endured was chaos of an entirely different magnitude. The nine-time Finnish champions were already grappling with the sting of relegation after a punishing Veikkausliiga season, but things took an even darker turn on Sunday night when a stand at their Factory Field stadium was completely destroyed in a fire. What should have been a symbol of community pride was reduced to a charred wreck, showing just how dangerously fan frustration can spiral out of control. Instead of voicing their frustration through peaceful protest, a group – reportedly teenagers – lashed out at the symbol of their grief: club's home ground. Scandal in Finland: a team was relegated and the fans set their own stadium on fire 😢🇫🇮 Top-flight club FC Haka have suffered a fresh blow after relegation. Police have since arrested three teenagers, and a 15-year-old has reportedly confessed to starting the blaze. I don't know what parenting is like in Finland these days, but those kids might be do for a grounding…until they are like 60.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With El Tri guaranteed three games during the group stage, many expected Javier Aguirre's side to play at least once in all three of the country's host cities. That expectation didn't materialize and García admitted he's not convinced by the reasons that led to the decision. “It seems to be a somewhat economical decision [El Tri not playing in Monterrey],” García told TUDN. “Obviously, my question was, ‘if Monterrey's stadium has a greater capacity why [is Mexico playing in] Jalisco?' Some Mexican outlets suggested FIFA gave Monterrey “breadcrumbs,” but Garcia reportedly said, “they gave us lemons, we'll try to make lemonade.” Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. García eventually said he understands FIFA and the Mexican soccer federation have their own dynamics and their reasons for keeping El Tri away from Monterrey during the World Cup. However, García also revealed he spoke with federation president Mikel Arriola following the apparent World Cup snub of his host city, looking for El Tri's chief official to do right by fans in Nuevo León. “The final draw can't be altered, that's definitive, but I'm looking to at least get a [Mexico] friendly match against a strong national team to happen in Monterrey before the World Cup. “I told him that if he didn't want fans in Monterrey to feel a certain way, you [Mexico national team] have to come before the World Cup to play a friendly and that's what they're working on.” Mexico's men's national team hasn't played a single game at the Estadio BBVA since it opened its doors in 2015. Now, the expectation is that El Tri makes its maiden visit to the "Giant of Steel” during their final preparations before next summer's spectacle. Regardless of how the situation unfolded, García closed the subject touching upon what he along with every El Tri fan deems most relevant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This guide outlines key tips to buy safely and understand the different ticket types. No one likes to lose their hard-earned money at any time—and even less so on luxury items families save to buy or because of fraudulent activity. However, the risks of being scammed are very high as fans scramble to get their hands on 2026 FIFA World Cup tickets to cheer on their favorite teams. With prices already sky high months before the tournament, at a time when the country is facing a persistent “affordability crisis,” any loss will hurt even more. So if you're shopping for Haiti tickets to the Boston, Philadelphia or Atlanta matches next June, here are some general tips to help you stay safe. Whether you buy from FIFA directly or an unofficial reseller, there are three different types of tickets floating around. On unofficial resale sites, tickets posted there — presumably by people who were allowed to buy from FIFA during the first release phases — tickets were significantly lower. “If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is.” Again, buying from resale platforms other than FIFA's own Marketplace may not guarantee entry at the stadium gate. It may be a slog, but take the time to read descriptions of what FIFA or an unofficial reseller is offering before you add to cart. Some platforms list the single ticket prices to entice clicks. Whichever you need, be sure to read the printed information. If it's not clear whether the ticket is for one seat or more, consider that a red flag. If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Fraudulent activity has hit record highs in the number of people scammed and amount of money reported stolen in recent years. Fraudsters have gotten really savvy at reaching people by email, text and social media and at targeting people to earn their trust. That's why scammers now reach out not only in English, but also in Haitian Creole via messages, voice notes, WhatsApp groups and other channels. They can also set up fake websites and products, including counterfeit versions of a legitimate company's communications to persuade people to part with their money. Many times, they use fear to trigger panic so the target can't think straight. So beware, and learn to spot fraudulent activity that may be underway. FIFA is using dynamic pricing, meaning prices may increase for high-demand matches, according to Goal, the soccer magazine. Think surge-pricing with Ubers and Lyfts based on demand. Tickets are selling fast, especially for popular teams like Brazil; they may be gone if you delay payment. As with all tickets, they will be delivered via the FIFA World Cup 2026™ App. As an independent publication, we rely on contributions from readers like you to fund our journalism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump accepts a peace award from FIFA, the international governing body of soccer, during the World Cup drawing on Dec. 5. If you were appalled by the spectacle of Donald Trump clumsily accepting a peace trophy that looks like a prop from “Night of the Living Dead,” then brace yourself. You may recall that Trump named himself chair and master of ceremonies at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which for 50 years had been the nation's premier cultural institution and largely insulated from politics. Now, it's simply another reflection of Trump's MAGA whims, and an oddly political choice for the final draw. I don't follow soccer — sorry, I mean football — but I gather from those who do that the final draw is an important day for fans, because that's when they know which teams will play at various host cities. The games will be held at 16 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada — including Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. FIFA is the global governing body for the sport and it has a history of bad behavior. The 2022 Cup was embroiled in bribery claims and concern about human rights violations in the host country, Qatar. In 2015, following an FBI investigation, top FIFA officials were indicted for racketeering and money laundering. You can think of Infantino giving Trump the prize as akin to the world's most historically corrupt sports body giving a trophy to one of the world's most corrupt leaders. Trump, smarting from not having received the Nobel Peace Prize he so lusted after, accepted the FIFA prize but couldn't resist taking a swipe at the Biden administration. “The United States one year ago was not doing too well,” he said. The prize, according to FIFA, is given “to reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world.” FIFA did not reveal whether there were other nominees for the award or why the prize was announced just a month before. Apparently, the extrajudicial killings of alleged drug traffickers in small boats, the demonization and mass deportation of migrants at home, or threatening to invade Venezuela were not disqualifying factors. It is a dread object, with zombie-like hands clawing upward, as if from the grave, at a globe that resembles a meatball you left in the microwave too long. But at least it was on brand. His mooning over the FIFA prize reminded me of the 2017 photo of Trump with his hands on a glowing orb in Saudi Arabia. No James Bond movie villain could signal his desire for world domination any clearer. Why on this or any other Earth would FIFA indulge Trump? Trump, a dangerous combination of ego and avarice, is about the only person who could seriously disrupt the World Cup games. Of the three host countries, the United States has the most locations, 11, and Trump has demonstrated his willingness to send troops to American cities for any reason. Also, most of the 6.5 million fans expected to attend this summer's games are from places that Trump may have taken a dislike to, including Africa and South America. At least one national team — Haiti — is from a place Trump has described as a “s***hole” country. Travel bans could seriously disrupt the ability of fans to attend games, and without fans there is no fan money. To support that tourism, the state of Missouri is giving $74 million, and Kansas is chipping in $28 million. FIFA's ethics committee has been asked to investigate whether Infantino violated the organization's neutrality rules in giving Trump the peace prize. But why would Trump accept such a prize when it is so obviously absurd? He must know that, coming on the heels of his Nobel disappointment, it appears to be some kind of poor substitute. There has been sport over this at Trump's expense, but the joke is probably on us. When the 1934 World Cup was hosted by Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini seized the opportunity to turn sport into propaganda. Consider the official poster, the work of illustrator Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an early adherent of Italian Fascism and the author of the “Futurist Manifesto.” It presaged a new movement that would glorify war; scorn women; and worship technology, destruction and speed. His World Cup poster is bold and unsettling, a dynamic male figure in an Italian national team shirt poised to kick the living daylights out of a brown ball, a fasces tucked into one corner. But for Mussolini, the World Cup was a way to project fascist strength. Mussolini also created a trophy — the “Coppa del Duce” — as an additional prize to be given to the winner. That trophy depicted the Greek goddess Victory and was used from 1930 to 1970. All that's ever been found is the stone base. Now, I understand that Trump is no Mussolini. But he is Il Duce-like in his awareness of image, and by placing himself center stage at the World Cup, he is reaching a vast global audience where football is played with a white ball and you can't touch it with your hands. Typically, when the word “vast” is used it's mostly hype, but in this case no other description comes close. FIFA is projecting that 6 billion people will watch at least one of the games, up about a billion from the last World Cup. If you know it was María Corina Machado of Venezuela, pat yourself on the back. Machado, who was awarded the prize for her peaceful efforts to overthrow Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship, has dedicated the prize to Trump and now supports the use of force for regime change. I'm not saying Trump is Mussolini or Hitler. If they're not plugged in individually, they'll be gathered in schools or pubs, experiencing perhaps the national thrill of victory or the cold embrace of defeat, but at some point they are bound to have seen an image of Trump clutching that damned trophy, and for some the image will stick. Never mind that just days after receiving the dread object, he seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast as part of a massive military buildup that appears ready to topple the Maduro regime. If it pops up on my feed, I'll swipe past. No ads for World Cup merch will sway me. Well, I did buy Wilson's book, but that taught me how politics have always been deeply embedded in the history of soccer. Meanwhile, I'll watch how plans for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles are shaping up. Politico reports that nearly all of the new board members to the Olympic planning committee have MAGA ties.
