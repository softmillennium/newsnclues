            • At least 11 people have been killed in a shooting targeting the Jewish community on Australia's Bondi Beach, police say. The attack took place as hundreds gathered to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah, and has been declared a terrorist incident. The victims include an Israeli citizen, according to the country's foreign ministry.
    


            • Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the attack as “an act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation” and said that “an attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.” Israeli officials reacted with horror and anger, with several accusing the Australian government of allowing a surge in antisemitism.
    


            • Police also confirmed that there are two known suspects — one is dead while the other is in a life-threatening condition in hospital. Officers have secured and removed explosive devices found in a nearby vehicle.
    


            Israel's Knesset parliament building in Jerusalem was lit up with the colors of the Australian flag on Sunday night, as a gesture of solidarity with the country's Jewish community following the deadly attack at Bondi Beach on the first day of Hanukkah.
    


            “The Knesset bows its head in memory of the victims of the horrific terror attack in Sydney and stands alongside the Jewish community in Australia,” Knesset speaker Amir Ohana said.
    


            It's nearing 5 a.m. in Sydney, where the sun will shortly be rising the day after a fatal shooting attack on Australia's famous Bondi Beach.
    


            At least 11 people were killed in the attack, with another 29 people injured, according to police. A 12-year-old girl and a rabbi are among the victims, Alexander Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CNN.



            Here's what we know about the shooting:
    


            US President Donald Trump said Sunday that people celebrating Hanukkah should not be worried about their safety, and should “celebrate proudly,” following a shooting targeting the Jewish community that killed at least 11 people on Australia's Bondi Beach.
    


            Peter Doocy of Fox News said on air he “just got off the phone” with Trump and asked whether Americans observing Hanukkah should be worried about their security.
    


            “Straight from the president, his message to people celebrating Hanukkah today, he said, ‘they do not need to be worried. They should celebrate proudly, and they should be proud of who you are, celebrate proudly,'” Doocy said.
    


            A bystander who is being hailed as a hero for tackling one of the gunmen during the Bondi Beach attack has been undergoing surgery after being wounded in the attack, his cousin said.
    


            The man was seen in footage widely circulated on social media wrestling a firearm from one of the shooters. He was shot and was taken to hospital for an operation, CNN affiliate 7News reported.
    


            Speaking to 7News from outside a Sydney hospital, his cousin said he had been told by doctors his relative was “OK,” and they would soon be allowed to go inside and visit him.
    


            “He's a hero, 100%, he's a hero,” he said. “He has two shots, one in his arm here, and one in his hand.”
    


            The social media footage showed a bystander tackling and wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen in the Bondi Beach mass shooting on Sunday. The man was later praised as a “genuine hero” by New South Wales State Premier Chris Minns.
    


            In the full version of the video, after being disarmed by the bystander the shooter seems to reposition himself on a bridge, rearm and start firing again.
    


            The shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday targeted people celebrating the first night of Hanukkah, a Jewish holiday that usually falls between late November and late December and lasts for eight days.
    


            During Hanukkah, Jewish people commemorate the victory of the Maccabees  over the Syrians and the re-dedication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem around 165 BC.
    


            Jewish people believe that when the Maccabees, an army led by the priest Mattathias, began preparing the Temple for the re-dedication, they found that they only had enough oil to light the Temple for one night. It ended up lasting for eight days, until the delivery of new consecrated oil. Candles are lit each night of Hanukkah to commemorate the miracle.
    


            Nowadays, Jewish people celebrate this holiday by placing candles on a special candelabra called a menorah or hanukkiyah. Every night, another candle is added until the total reaches eight on the last night. The candles are placed in the menorah from right to left but are lit from left to right.
    


            Another symbol of Hanukkah is the dreidel, a four-sided spinning top. Before the Maccabean Revolt, it was illegal for people to read the Torah. When soldiers came through while they were reading the sacred text, Jews pretended to play a gambling game involving the tops to avoid detection.
    


            King Charles said he and Queen Camilla are “appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack” which targeted the Jewish community at Bondi Beach on the first day of Hanukkah.
    


            In a message sent to the Australian people, the monarch said, “Our hearts go out to everyone who has been affected so dreadfully, including the police officers who were injured while protecting members of their community.”
    


            Charles commended emergency responders as well as members of the public “whose heroic actions no doubt prevented even greater horror and tragedy.”
    


                    “In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve. I know that the spirit of community and love that shines so brightly in Australia - and the light at the heart of the Chanukah festival - will always triumph over the darkness of such evil,” he added.
                





            Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales also sent a message, saying their “thoughts are with every Australian today.”
    


            The couple offered their “deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives” before adding that they “stand with the Jewish community in grief.”
    


            A Rabbi based in the US on Sunday described how his nephew was caught up in the fatal shooting at Bondi Beach, hiding with his daughter as bullets flew past them.
    


            “He described to me how he was literally hiding as the shooting was going on,” Rabbi Levi Shemtov, Executive Vice President of the American Friends of Lubavitch, told CNN.
    


                    “He says he was holding his daughter, praying. The bullets were whizzing right by him. He said it was a horrific experience.”
                





            He said that Sydney, a city which has always prided itself on multiculturalism, has now “taken a turn for the worse, in a very major way.”
    


            Adding that Australia is home to the largest community of Holocaust survivors outside of Israel, Shemtov continued, “Many people wanted to get as far away from the horrors of the Holocaust after it ended and went to Australia, and rebuilt their lives very successfully … and were very productive in the development of Australia as a nation.”
    


            Australia's National Terrorism Threat level is currently set at “probable,”  according to the Australian government. This level is in the middle of five tiers on a scale which informs the public about the likelihood of a terror attack taking place in Australia.
    


            The five levels are ranked from the highest chance of an act of terrorism happening to the smallest likelihood. They are — Certain, Expected, Probable, Possible and Not Expected.
    


            When a terror threat level is “probable,” it means that there is a more than 50% chance of a terror attack taking place or being planned in Australia in the next twelve months, Australia's New South Wales (NSW) Police Force says on its website.



            On a page which sets out the National Terrorism Threat Level, Australia's National Security agency says that the country's security landscape “has entered a vulnerable period and is being challenged by new threats with concerning trajectories.”
    


            In a section about what a possible terrorist attack might look like in the country, National Security says that “attacks in Australia are likely to be low-cost, using readily available weapons, and simple tactics.”
    


            The “most likely” location for such a terrorist attack is a “crowded place, in a major city,” it continues. This is also “most likely to be conducted by an individual (known as a lone actor) or a small group,” it adds.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he believes the Australian government poured oil on the flames of antisemitism through its silence on anti-Jewish sentiment in the country.
    


            “A few months ago, I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister of Australia. I said that their policy was pouring oil on the flames of antisemitism and encouraging the hatred of Jews that is raging in the streets of Australia,” Netanyahu said ahead of his weekly cabinet meeting.
    


            “Antisemitism is a cancer that spreads when leaders remain silent, and they must replace weakness with strength in facing it.”
    


            “That did not happen in Australia - and today, something terrible occurred there. A cold-blooded murder,” Netanyahu added.
    


Some context: Speaking earlier, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the attack as “an act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation” and said that “an attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”
    


            Among those killed in the attack on a Hanukkah event in Sydney's Bondi Beach was one Israeli citizen, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.
    


            Another Israeli was wounded and is receiving treatment at a local hospital in Sydney, the foreign ministry said.
    


            US' Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said in a post on X that he “strongly condemns” Sunday's fatal attack at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia.
    


                    “Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia,” Rubio said.
                





            The US Embassy in Australia, based in Canberra, also posted to X about the terror attack, writing that it was “heartbroken” by the news and offering its “sincerest condolences to the families of the victims of this senseless act that targeted the Jewish community on the first night of Hanukkah.”
    


            The embassy urged Australia-based US citizens to avoid the immediate Bondi Beach area, follow guidance from local authorities and inform loved ones of their status.
    


            Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Australia “must take significant action” after “a sharp rise in antisemitism,” a statement by the Israeli Foreign Ministry said.
    


            Speaking to his Australian counterpart Penny Wong, Saar expressed “sorrow and pain, on behalf of the people of Israel, over the murderous antisemitic attack in Sydney.”
    


            He told the Australian foreign minister that there had been an increase in antisemitism in the country since October 7, citing examples of chants against the Israeli military, the burning of Israeli flags during marches marked by “overt expressions of hatred.”
    


            Saar said “security” for the Jewish community in Australia “can only be achieved through a true change in public atmosphere.”
    


            Australia, which has seen large-scale protests against Israel's actions in Gaza, formally recognized the State of Palestine in September alongside several other Western nations, drawing criticism from the Israeli government.
    


            Saar described slogans like “Globalize the Intifada,” “From the River to the Sea,” and calls for violence against the Israel Defense Forces as “illegitimate” and “not part of free speech,” and warned that they “ultimately lead to the kind of violence witnessed today,” linking them directly to the Bondi Beach attack.
    


            Saar earlier wrote on X that the Australian government “must come to its senses.”
    


            A 12-year-old girl and a rabbi are among the victims of the fatal shooting in Sydney, Alexander Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told CNN's Victor Blackwell a short while ago.
    


            “I know everyone who was there (at the Hanukkah celebration). That's an event where I attend with my family every single year,” Ryvchin said, adding that he was scheduled to speak at the event as he has done for the last decade, but had to drop out last minute due to scheduling conflicts.
    


            A rabbi who was at the event, who Ryvchin described as “one of the kindest and most beautiful human beings I've ever known,” is among the dead, he said.
    


            Another of Ryvchin's friends “lost his 12-year-old daughter, who succumbed to her wounds in hospital,” he said.
    


            “We're a very close knit community, and this event is kind of the gem of our year. It's something we look forward to every year,” he told CNN, adding that it is usually a “joyous day.”
    


                    “The fact that it's turned into a blood bath, the fact that people plotted, acquired weapons, came there knowing that there would be children there, that there would be elderly people, families, defenseless people, just gathered there in peace, and they slaughtered them in cold blood. This is something that will transform our country,” he said.
                





Warning: Graphic content



            We can now bring you some of the video we mentioned earlier, which shows a bystander tackling and wrestling a firearm from one of the gunmen in the Bondi Beach mass shooting on Sunday.
    


            The bystander was praised as a “genuine hero” by New South Wales State Premier Chris Minns. In the full version of the video (which we are not showing here), after being disarmed by the bystander, the shooter seems to reposition himself on a bridge, rearm and start firing again.
    


            Police around the world are stepping up their presence at public Hanukkah events in the wake of Sunday's deadly terror attack in Sydney, which police said targeted the Jewish community.
    


            In New York, the NYPD said it was deploying additional resources to public Hanukkah celebrations and synagogues “out of an abundance of caution.”
    


            London's Metropolitan Police said that while there was no information suggesting a link between the attack in Sydney and the threat level in London, the force would step up its police presence, carry out additional patrols and engage with the Jewish community in the wake of the tragedy.
    


                    “It is an awful reality that Jewish communities across the world continue to face a higher level of threat. At a time when London's Jewish communities are coming together to begin the celebration of Hannukah, we know this attack will be the cause of not just terrible upset but also significant heightened concern about safety,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
                





            Police in Berlin said they would deploy increased forces and intensify their security measures ahead of a Hanukkah event in the German capital this evening, in light of the attack.
    


                    “Even though there are currently no concrete indications of a threat to Berlin following the suspected attack in Australia, we remain vigilant and alert,” Polizei Berlin said on social media.
                





            A fatal shooting incident took place at Australia's popular Bondi Beach on Sunday, in an attack that police said targeted the country's Jewish community.
    


If you're just joining us, here's what we've been reporting so far:



At least 11 dead: At least 11 people were killed in the attack, with another 29 injured, police said at a press conference earlier. No details have yet been given about the victims of the shooting.
    


One person in custody: Of the two suspected attackers, one is in custody in critical condition and the other was shot dead at the scene, according to police. Authorities have so far not provided any details about the identities of these suspects.
    


Jewish community targeted: More than 1,000 people were attending a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach when the shooting occurred, police said, adding that the attack was “designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.”
    


Police declare terror incident: The fact the shooting took place on the first day of Hanukkah, as well other circumstances including the types of weapons at the scene and the offenders, led a terrorist incident to be declared a few hours after the attack, police said.
    


Australian PM addresses Jewish community: Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese shared a message with the Jewish community earlier, telling them: “Your fellow Australians stand with you tonight in condemning this act of terror.” The country will never submit to “division, violence or hatred,” he added.
    


Israeli leaders react with horror: A number of Israeli officials reacted angrily to the shooting, with many accusing the Australian government of allowing a surge in antisemitism.
    


Jewish council “horrified and shaken”: Additionally, the Jewish Council of Australia called the attack a “horrific act of antisemitic violence during the Jewish festival of light and hope.” In a statement, it said that “many within our community have just received the worst news of their lives,” adding: “In moments like this, we hold each other close.”
    


CNN's Tal Shalev, Tamar Michaelis, Sophie Tanno, Hilary Whiteman and Mostafa Salem contributed to this reporting.



            The CEO of the Australian Jewish Association has described the fatal shooting at Bondi Beach as an “entirely foreseeable” tragedy, saying that Australian Prime Minster Anthony Albanese's government had been warned many times about rising antisemitism.
    


            “What happened tonight is a tragedy but entirely foreseeable.The Albanese government was warned so many times but failed to take adequate actions to protect the Jewish community,” Robert Gregory said.
    


            He added that many members of the Jewish community are now pondering whether they have a future in Australia, in the wake of the deadly attack.
    


            Earlier, police said they had located a vehicle linked to the deceased gunman which they believed contained “several improvised explosive devices,” at the scene in Bondi Beach.
    


            The IED's have now been removed from the vehicle, a police official said.
    


            The crime scene is no longer an exclusion area, the official added.
    


            The force's rescue bomb disposal unit had been working at the scene on Campbell Parade, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said at a news conference earlier.
    


            It is approaching midnight local time in Sydney, Australia, where at least 11 people were killed in a shooting at the city's Bondi Beach earlier today.
    


            The scene of the attack has been cordoned off by authorities. Police vehicles are parked near the cordons, with members of the public being ushered away from the area.
    


            Here are some images from the scene:
    


             Australia is unaccustomed to mass shootings. Strict gun laws were introduced in 1996 after a shocking attack at Port Arthur, when 35 people were killed by a lone gunman.
    


            Buying a gun requires extensive checks, and though gun crimes occur, they are usually targeted and limited in scope.
    


            According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, 31 homicides by firearm were recorded in Australia from 2023–24, the most recent figures.
    


            Mass attacks are also uncommon. One of the most recent also took place in Sydney's eastern suburbs, when a man armed with a knife killed six people in Westfield shopping center at Bondi Junction in April 2024. The perpetrator, who was shot at the scene, had a history of mental health issues.

            The Republican plans to pick off five Democratic-held congressional seats in Texas once seemed like a sure thing. Not anymore.
    


            President Donald Trump's flagging approval ratings, particularly among Latinos, and strong Democratic performance in this year's special elections have changed both parties' assumptions. Now, the cushion the Texas GOP drew into its new map – Trump won every Republican-favored district by 10 points or more a year ago – seems like it might be too small.
    


            Democrats beat Trump's 2024 results in five US House districts with special elections this year by at least 13 points. Over-performance at that level next year would flip three of the five new Texas seats to the Democratic column, though it's unlikely that performance will be replicated in every district around the country, and recent polling suggests that Democrats currently have a more modest national advantage.
    


            “I can feel it on the ground,” said Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, whose South Texas district was one of the five targeted by Republicans. “I really anticipate us taking the majority back next cycle and winning back South Texas and places that had been traditional Democratic districts that have turned on us in the last few cycles, with so many disillusioned people.”
    


            Republicans are still likely to make overall gains in the national redistricting battle with the help of Texas, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio, even after Indiana's Republican senators rejected new maps despite Trump's pressure. But shifting national trends could change what both parties expect to gain as they redraw their maps.
    


            Eduardo Leal, press secretary for Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who pushed the GOP-led legislature to redistrict and is running for a fourth term next year, said the “vast majority of Texans” share Abbott's values: “secure borders, safer communities, and an economy that keeps Texas affordable.”
    


            “We compete for every vote, because elections aren't won on past results but on a clear vision and proven experience that delivers for all Texans,” Leal said in a statement. “We're confident that message continues to resonate with Latino voters statewide.”
    


            Trump improved Republicans' standing with Latino voters in 2024, winning about 46%, according to 2024 exit polls, up from 32% in 2020. Texas' new maps sought to build on Trump's strong performance in the state, which he won by 14 points. Notably, Trump won every county in the heavily Latino Rio Grande Valley, which was long a Democratic stronghold.
    


            Four of the five Democratic-held seats targeted by the state GOP are majority Latino under the new maps, with the 28th Congressional District, represented by longtime Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, topping out at over 90% Latino.
    


            But Trump's standing among Latinos has fallen dramatically nationwide since the start of his second term, outpacing his drop in approval overall. In three statewide races this November – a Democratic-backed ballot measure in California and gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia – Democrats gained the most in counties with higher shares of Latinos, even outpacing Joe Biden's 2020 margins there.
    


            And in Miami, a Democratic-backed candidate won the mayoral election earlier this month, breaking nearly 30 years of Republican-aligned control of the nonpartisan seat.
    


            In Texas, Trump's approval rating among Latinos dropped from 44% in February to 32% in October, according to the University of Texas/Texas Politics Project poll. The 2025 UH-TSU Texas Trends Survey found Latinos in Texas expressing regret for their 2024 vote at higher rates than Texan voters overall. When asked how they would have voted in the 2024 presidential election if they could vote again, Texan Latinos backed Democrat Kamala Harris by a margin of 11 points, a 19-point swing from the 8-point margin by which the same group said they supported Trump in 2024.
    


            Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist and founder of Solidarity Strategies, told CNN that he thought Latinos could swing back to Democrats next year by a five- to 20-point margin.
    


            “I think they're all going to snap back,” Rocha said. “It's just, do they get back to the norms of where it was before Trump?”
    


            Gonzalez told CNN that he's been seeing that discontent among his own constituents in the past year. His new district is more than three-quarters Latino.
    


            Gonzalez highlighted that affordability is the top issue in his district, along with a shortage of labor and an increased presence of immigration officers on the ground.
    


            “I don't think Democrats, and especially Latinos, who voted for Trump ever expected that this would happen,” Gonzalez later said. “And now it has, and it's compounded - that is compounded with a lot of the other problems that we're talking about, economic problems and inflation and people, the American people, are continuing to struggle.”
    


            A big swing among Texas Latinos could put the GOP-held 15th Congressional District in play too. Currently held by Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, the 15th District voted comfortably for Trump in 2024 (he won by 18 points under 2026 lines), but his margin was considerably more modest in 2020 (2 points). Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke won the district by 11 points in his 2018 US Senate run. De La Cruz's electoral margins barely change under the new map.
    


            Patrick Ruffini, pollster and founding partner at Republican firm Echelon Insights, argued before last year's presidential election that Trump could lead a realignment to bring many Latinos into a GOP coalition focused on working-class issues.
    


            “These are the most important voters to cultivate because they  are the swingiest,” Ruffini told CNN about the Latino vote. “Without them … it's kind of very hard for Democrats to have long-term success in presidential elections. I think that should absolutely be more of a focus for the administration and for the Republicans heading into the midterms.”
    


            South Texas is home to a more conservative population intimately familiar with the border, Ruffini said. But Rocha believes even just a slight change in the voting habits of Latinos in rural areas could flip districts on the edge.
    


            Democrats notched strong performances in the five special elections for US House this year, over-performing 2024 presidential margins by at least 13 points in each race and averaging a 17-point improvement overall.
    


            Special elections tend to be lower-turnout events, and typically, only the most partisan and highly engaged voters participate. But an early December special election in Tennessee's 7th congressional district featured turnout roughly on par with that of the 2022 midterm election. Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn lost that race by 9 points, trimming Trump's 22-point margin in the district by 13 points.
    


            In CNN's latest poll, registered voters preferred Democratic over Republican candidates in their House district by 5 points (that's roughly a 7-point improvement compared with 2024). Democratic candidates may end up with a larger margin among voters who actually turn out given the growing evidence of Democratic advantage in voter motivation.
    


            “Affordability is really the front and center issue right now. I think that's really the primary concern and the primary component of this,” Ruffini told CNN. “I think that Donald Trump doesn't need to convince people that he feels their pain, but I think he does need to make the case that Democrats are too weak to fix it.”

NEW YORK, December 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has threatened Thailand and Cambodia with more duties if they do not stop hostilities, he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

""I just used tariffs 10 minutes ago, just before you came, to settle the new inflammation that took place with Thailand and Cambodia,"" Trump said. ""And I told them, ‘If you have the war, not only am I going to break the trade deal we have, but I'm going to put tariffs on your country.'"" He added, ""Nobody can do that but me.""

The Wall Street Journal said the interview was recorded on Friday. Trump was apparently referring to telephone conversations earlier in the day with the Prime Ministers of Thailand and Cambodia, Anutin Charnvirakul and Hun Manet.

Trump said he was sure that the duties is an important tool in the foreign policy for his administration. As Trump said, it would be ""terrible"" for the US if the US Supreme Court declared some of the duties imposed by him illegal. However, the American leader assured that in this case he would find legal grounds for further duties. The U.S. Supreme Court continues to consider this issue.

Trump said on Friday that he had spoken by phone with the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia and that the two leaders agreed to cease hostilities within 24 hours and return to the implementation of peace agreements. However, after that fighting continued.

In October, the Prime Ministers of Cambodia and Thailand signed a joint declaration in Trump's presence on the sidelines of the 47th ASEAN Summit, which formulated further steps for a peaceful settlement of the border conflict. The parties said they commit to contribute to de-escalating tensions, restoring trust and mutually beneficial relations.

Armed clashes with the use of small arms took place along the Cambodian-Thai border on December 7. The Royal Thai Army said that Cambodian forces began shelling Thai positions in the border area in the early morning. The Thai Air Force responded by attacking Cambodia's military infrastructure. There was information about casualties among the military. The Russian embassies in both countries advised Russian tourists to refrain from visiting the border areas.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

TUNIS, December 14. /TASS/. The United States has deployed combat aircraft using lighting bombs after an attack by militants of the Islamic State terrorist group (IS, banned in Russia) on a Syrian-American patrol in Palmyra, Syria TV reported.

""American planes dropped lighting bombs in the sky over the city,"" the TV channel said.

Earlier, SANA news agency reported that a man opened fire on the Syrian and American military during their joint patrol of the territory. The attacker was killed on the spot. According to the Pentagon, two US military personnel and one American translator were killed and several people injured.

Traffic on the Deir ez-Zor-Damascus highway was suspended. American helicopters arrived at the scene to evacuate the injured to the US and Western coalition military base near the city of Al-Tanf (250 km off Damascus).

The United States has been actively reducing its military contingent in Syria since the beginning of the year. The main American forces are currently concentrated in the Kurdish-controlled regions of northeastern Syria and in the south, near the border with Iraq and Jordan. The United States continues to coordinate operations with the Syrian security forces against the remaining cells of the IG terrorist group.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 14. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Alliance needs to revise its strategic framework to prepare for a confrontation with Russia that will go beyond the ""Battle for the Atlantic,"" the NATO Defense College (NDC) said in a report.

NDC Senior Non-Resident Associate Fellow Andrew Monaghan points out that ""the development of the holistic sea power of the state is an essential feature"" of Moscow' s policy, which allows Russia to position itself as a leader in ""a period of geoeconomic competition.""

""This shifts the frames of NATO's reference beyond a renewed ‘Battle for the Atlantic' or scenarios of ground operations in northeastern Europe towards a multi-front, multi-domain Russian challenge, one with a global horizon,"" the document notes.

Officials refuse to share name of person or details of arrest; names of victims not released as authorities have not yet been able to contact all relatives

Person of interest detained in Brown University shooting that left two dead

What we know so far

Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez has said the person of interest in custody is in his 20s, not in his 30s as officials stated earlier on Sunday.

Earlier on Sunday, Georgia senator Raphael Warnock urged people to find “common humanity” after a deadly shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, Warnock said: “I can tell you that as a pastor who has presided over many funerals, I don't think that there's any pain deeper than when nature is violently reversed and rather than children burying their parents, the parent has to bury the child. And so we pray prayers for these families.”

Warnock, who pushed Congress to pass more gun control legislation after two students and two teachers at a high school in his home state of Georgia were shot to death in 2024, went on to call for action after yet another mass shooting at an education facility in America.

He told NBC: “We have to pray not only with our lips, but with our action. Any nation that tolerates this kind of violence year after year, decade after decade in random places on our college and school campuses without doing all that we can to stop it is broken and in need of moral repair.”

During the press conference, Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say if the person of interest had any connection to Brown University.

“I'm not ready to confirm or comment on any of that,” Perez told reporters. “Again, I got to respect the process, and so at this point, we're just going to continue, like the mayor stated. It's complex, but we want to make sure that we have a successful prosecution.”

Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez said at this moment an eventual case against a shooting suspect is being treated as a state prosecution, rather than a federal one.

Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez has said the person of interest in custody is in his 20s, not in his 30s as officials stated earlier on Sunday.

Police refused to comment on a social media post by FBI director Kash Patel that claimed the arrest of a person of interest was based on a lead from Providence police.

Writing on X, Patel said the FBI “established a command post to intake, develop and analyze leads, and run them to ground. We activated the FBI's Cellular Analysis Survey Team, to provide critical geolocation capabilities.

“As a result, early this morning, FBI Boston's Safe Streets Task Force, with assistance from the @USMarshalsHQ & the @Coventry_RI_PD, detained a person of interest in a hotel room in Coventry, RI, based off a lead by the @ProvidenceRIPD.

“We have deployed local and national resources to process and reconstruct the shooting scene - providing HQ and Lab elements on scene. We set up a digital media intake portal to ingest images and video from the public related to this incident.

“And the FBI's victim specialists are fully integrating with our partners to provide resources to victims and survivors of this horrific violence. This FBI will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served. Thanks to the men and women of the FBI and our partners for their continued teamwork. Please continue praying for the victims and their families - as well as all those at Brown University.

Mayor Brett Smiley says he won't share names of the victims yet as he believes some of their families have not yet been contacted because they might be travelling for the holidays.

He adds that bringing the person responsible for the shooting to justice is the top priority for officials. He reiterates the reason he's not sharing unconfirmed information so as to not compromise any future prosecution.

Col Oscar Perez refused to say whether the person in custody is the same person as the one seen in surveillance footage released on Saturday night.

Perez declined to comment on whether officials had found the gun used in the attack.

Col Oscar Perez was asked whether officials had been able to establish any connection between the suspects and the university or find out why the suspect targeted the university.

Perez said: “So that's all part of the investigation that we're conducting. And again, it's, it's complex.”

Police chief Col Oscar Perez addresses reporters and says he is aware of speculation around a suspect's name. He says he is not ready to provide a name or names.

He told reporters the “investigation continues to progress extremely fast” He added: We're in the process of collecting evidence and seizing items that we need to seize such location that we need to search.”

Mayor Smiley went on to say he visited victims of the attack and their families in hospital on Sunday.

He thanked the medical staff at Brown Health and Rhode Island Hospital, saying: “These folks, just like our law enforcement professionals, have been up all night working. But the level of care and professionalism that they're exhibiting is extraordinary.

“These survivors received an excellent care. And the resilience that these survivors showed and shared with me is, frankly, pretty overwhelming. It pales in comparison what they've gone through for the rest of us here. We're all saddened and scared and tired.

“But what they've been through something entirely different. And yet they showed courage and hope and gratitude for how this community has stood up for them, and how the health care providers care for them.”

Mayor Brett Smiley says the community would now turn “our attention to caring for our neighbors”.

He pointed to a website set up by the city of Providence where the community find resources for mental health care.

He said a vigil would be held at 5pm ET at Olympic Park, where there had been plans to light a Christmas tree and to light a menorah for the first night of Hanukkah.

He said: “And for those who know at least a little bit of a Hanukkah story, it is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light, if there's nothing better that we could be doing this community.”

Providence mayor Brett Smiley begins the press conference. He starts by praising the level of collaboration between law enforcement agencies.

He says there is no update to share on the investigation, that the investigation is ongoing and that officials are cooperating with law enforcement agencies.

He said he would not share any information that could jeopardize the investigation or compromise any future charges.

The person in custody after the Brown University shooting had two firearms with them when they were detained, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN.

The exact type of firearms remains unclear.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Analysts say benefits could be felt in under-resourced rural hospitals but warn against AI as a cost-cutting measure

For states to receive certain funding stipulated in the Trump administration's “big, beautiful” bill, they must meet three of 10 criteria – including integrating more artificial intelligence (AI) technology in healthcare settings – which experts say could have major benefits and liabilities for under-resourced hospitals, depending on how it's implemented.

The Rural Health Transformation Fund is a carveout that will provide $50bn over a period of five years to states who meet certain application criteria, including “consumer-facing, technology-driven solutions for the prevention and management of chronic diseases,” and “providing training and technical assistance for the development and adoption of technology-enabled solutions that improve care delivery in rural hospitals, including remote monitoring, robotics, artificial intelligence, and other advanced technologies”.

Analysts have noted that this $50bn will not be nearly enough to make up for the Congressional Budget Office's projected $911bn reduction in Medicaid spending over the next decade under the bill (Obba). These cuts will affect both patients who lose free health coverage under Medicaid, and hospitals who benefit from those patients' Medicaid reimbursements.

Chenhao Tan, associate professor of data science at the University of Chicago, and Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an assistant professor at the University of South Florida's college of AI and cybersecurity, said AI technology could provide major benefits to rural hospitals that are frequently under-resourced and under-staffed. They also agreed that AI has the potential to alleviate the administrative burden that physicians at these hospitals often face.

Physicians are responsible for taking detailed notes on patient visits and compiling them for electronic health records systems – a task that can take eight hours or more each week, according to the American Medical Association.

A recent study found that AI generated patient notes are similar in quality to those of general physicians, but worse than those of expert physicians. Tan said that it's important to take context – like frequent physician burnout in rural hospitals – into account when evaluating risks and benefits.

“If the baseline is tired human doctors, then I think it is even easier to make an argument that AI may do better than them,” Tan said.

Chagal-Feferkorn hopes that AI can help alleviate rural hospital staffing issues, not only by reducing the workload but by attracting more doctors.

“If the equipment is state-of-the-art, and they feel that much of the burdensome work is done by AI, I think this could be one incentive for physicians to go work in rural areas, this might have a great impact,” she said.

The FDA currently regulates AI technologies that are intended to evaluate and diagnose health conditions because they are considered medical devices. However, technologies that simply transcribe and compile patient notes are not regulated, though they may market themselves as Hipaa compliant.

While Tan said it would be too high a bar to expect these technologies to be “bulletproof” before they can enter the market, he acknowledged that “there should be something higher than nothing,” in terms of regulatory requirements.

Chagal-Feferkorn also said that the proliferation of AI also creates additional cybersecurity concerns.

“AI makes it easier for ordinary people to hack systems,” she said, adding that AI has the potential to improve patient safety by merging patient records from different providers so that, for example, every provider is aware of every medication that a patient is taking and can thus easily avoid dangerous medication interactions.

But this kind of technology will also require more privacy precautions.

“The more data sharing there is, obviously the risk for data security breach is larger,” Chagal-Feferkorn continued.

To mitigate these risks, Tan said “worker upscaling needs to go hand in hand” with the adoption of AI technology. But Tan and Chagal-Feferkorn both expressed concern that under-resourced hospitals will attempt to adopt AI technology as a cost-cutting measure without the necessary staff and safety infrastructure.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Venezuelan politicians battling to end Maduro's rule reject claims his downfall would thrust their country into maelstrom of bloodshed and retribution

Nicolás Maduro is chased out of office by a massive popular revolt but the Venezuelan military takes to the streets, turning its guns on the civilians who have brought him down.

A palace coup sends Venezuela's authoritarian leader into exile, sparking a bloody power struggle between members of his disintegrating regime.

Maduro or a key ally is assassinated by a US “decapitation” strike but – as foreign soldiers commandeer Caracas and key airports and ports – leftwing insurgents tighten their grip on the country's mineral-rich hinterlands and regime loyalists launch guerrilla-style attacks on oil refineries and pipelines.

These three scenarios were all contemplated six years ago during US government “war games” designed to predict what a post-Maduro Venezuela might look like if the South American dictator was overthrown by an uprising, a palace revolution or a foreign attack. None of them ended well.

“You'd have prolonged chaos … with no clear way out,” said Douglas Farah, a Latin America expert whose national security consulting firm was part of those 2019 strategising efforts.

In all three of the discussion-based simulations, the upheaval triggered a fresh exodus of refugees across Venezuela's borders with Colombia and Brazil, as citizens fled skirmishes between rival rebel groups or foreign occupiers and loyalist troops.

“Everyone wrestling with this issue [is] sort of hoping that you could wave a magic wand and have a new government [in Venezuela],” said Farah. “I think the reason it hasn't happened is because people sat down and thought: ‘Wait a minute. What the hell are we getting ourselves into?'”

The Venezuelan politicians battling to end Maduro's 12-year rule reject claims that his downfall would inevitably thrust their country into a maelstrom of bloodshed and retribution.

María Corina Machado – the Nobel laureate and leader of the political movement widely believed to have beaten Maduro in last year's presidential election – called claims Maduro's exit could plunge Venezuela into violence similar to Syria's civil war “utterly unfounded”.

“Venezuela is a country with a long democratic culture and a society that is set on recovering that democracy,” she told the Guardian in Oslo on Friday after slipping out of her country to receive the peace prize.

Miguel Pizarro, another opposition leader, dismissed the suggestion Venezuela was doomed to become a South American version of Iraq, Libya or Haiti if Maduro was toppled. “The truth is that Venezuelans took their decision [in last year's election] … it was Venezuela's greatest ever social consensus.”

Allies of Donald Trump – who has spent recent months ratcheting up the pressure on Maduro with a massive military deployment, deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the seizure of an oil tanker – also play down the dangers of a possible US intervention.

But many experts and South American diplomats are sceptical things will go so smoothly – irrespective of how Maduro's deposition comes about.

“If there's a popular uprising, the military is probably gonna be very defensive, very violent and reactionary to the protests on the street. [You'll have] a lot of people dead,” warned Farah, who thought, in that scenario, it was possible Colombian guerrillas, including the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) might enter the fray on the side of Venezuela's nominally leftwing regime.

A coup had the potential to produce “a huge vacuum of power” with rival armed actors battling to fill Maduro's shoes. “You might have four different folks saying: ‘OK, now I'm in charge,'” Farah said.

If foreign troops were deployed, they would probably be able to take control of big cities and infrastructure such as ports and airports. But they faced the possibility of asymmetric attacks from government loyalists or Colombian rebels and a protracted battle to regain control of gold mining regions already under the influence of the ELN. “[Defeating them is] a long-term proposition that would require a lot of money, a lot troops and probably some casualties,” Farah said.

Whatever happened, Farah feared post-Maduro Venezuela was likely to suffer “a huge mess that would last a while”. “None of this [is] going to be resolved in three weeks. You're talking years.”

Farah is not the only observer who frets that sudden political change could have dire consequences for the oil-rich South American country.

Last week the chief foreign policy adviser to Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, warned upheaval in Venezuela could transform the region into a Vietnam-style “war zone”.

Juan González, the White House's top Latin America official under Joe Biden, also said he feared the potential for violent retaliation.

“I have this recurring dream about Venezuela … of Maduro getting dragged through the streets like Benito Mussolini,” González said of the Italian dictator who was captured while trying to flee to Switzerland in 1945 and shot by a firing squad.

“You just never know what the trigger is … [Muammar] Gaddafi was very much in power until he wasn't,” González added of Libya's former leader, who also met a grisly end after being captured by his enemies.

González hoped a negotiated solution could still be found despite the escalating tensions.

“Negotiations are long and hard fought and require compromise. But history shows us that they're the most effective way to actually promote a transition,” he said, warning that toppling Maduro didn't necessarily mean the situation would improve. “It could actually get worse,” he said, pondering what might happen if a regime hardliner such as interior minister Diosdado Cabello, who runs Venezuela's repressive security forces, succeeded Maduro.

Farah thought a temporary power-sharing deal might be one way to avoid the “massive fracturing” of Venezuela between rival factions. But for that to happen, difficult choices would have to be made, possibly including letting “massive human rights violators” off the hook and giving Maduro safe passage out of the country and some form of immunity for alleged crimes against humanity.

An indication that the opposition might accept some such compromises came last week when the Washington Post reported that Machado's opposition believed only a “‘limited' purge of top Maduro officials would be necessary” once he was gone.

But many of the alternatives were even uglier. If the security situation spiralled out of control post-Maduro, Farah feared Washington's temptation might be to engage mercenary groups and private military contractors, rather than put US boots on the ground.

“[That] gets you closer to an Iraqi-type scenario, where you have multiple non-state groups doing multiple things on the ground that no one has control over,” Farah warned.

“If things go south, that's one of the options they will look at,” he predicted, “and that would be very damaging”.

Singaporean stalwart Paul Lim became the oldest player to win a match at the World Darts Championship when the 71-year-old beat Jeffrey de Graaf 3-1 at Alexandra Palace in London on Saturday.

Lim, who famously threw the first world championship nine-darter way back in 1990, eclipsed the mark set by Northern Irishman John MaGowan, who beat Chris Mason in December 2008, aged 67.

“A moment like this has kept me going for all these years,” Lim said.

“The standard of play nowadays is not like how it was before. This tournament is the Super Bowl of darts so I would say this is a good moment,” he said.

Lim would face last year's world champion, Luke Humphries, 41 years his junior, in the second round.

Lim beat Humphries when the pair last met in the championships five years ago.

“I hope on a given day it can happen again,” said Lim, who will turn 72 next month.

“I never give up. He is good but he can be beaten,” he added.

Arsenal remain perfect in this season's competition and three points clear at the top of the standings after a 3-0 win against Club Brugge, while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain were held 0-0 at Athletic Bilbao.
The clash between Madrid and City was the standout game of the round amid reports this week that Alonso had lost control of the locker room. Speculation over his position is likely to intensify after the latest

Most of the world knows how to respond to the US' new National Security Strategy. As my colleague Marc Champion has written, Russia loves it. Liberal Europeans are dismayed and the Gulf monarchies are overjoyed.

In the rest of Asia — and what, until now, Washington has called the Indo-Pacific — the dominant emotion is uneasiness. There are words, phrases and entire sections in the document that are exactly what we want to hear, but the underlying worldview is at odds with its rhetoric.

The strategy promises that the US would build a military capable of deterrence in the First Island Chain and the Taiwan Strait, and an insistence that the South China Sea cannot be controlled by any one actor. There is a promise to defend “global and regional balances of power,” and to fight “predatory” economic practices.

Illustration: Yusha

The Indo-Pacific shares all these priorities, and many are relieved that the administration of US President Donald Trump has taken the trouble to restate them. And yet there is disquiet, because some of these commitments look like they have been grafted on to a strategy that could push US policy in a fundamentally different direction.

This is a startlingly ideological document even by the standards of today's Washington. It extends “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) domestic obsessions — the border, diversity and equality initiatives, climate denialism — beyond America's shores. US soft power is listed as one of its greatest assets, without the recognition that illiberalism and xenophobia erode its value daily.

But MAGA's most dangerous export, as far as the security of the Indo-Pacific is concerned, is its distaste for the liberal order.

The US might not always have lived up to its ideals, but since the Second World War, it has defined its role in the world as promoting them — defending the practice of liberal democracy and evangelizing the benefits of global norms. They include shared prosperity, for Americans and the citizens of partner nations.

It is here that the 2025 National Security Strategy makes its most impactful break with the past. The security and stability of the Indo-Pacific might remain a stated priority, but not because freedom and openness would enrich the region and keep it loyal to the rules-based order that benefits Americans more than anyone else. Instead, a much narrower and more fragile link is being drawn, between deterring China and Trump-era economic priorities: Big Tech profits, the securing of global resources and a “rebalanced” global economy that forces production back onshore.

This link could snap at any time — particularly if Trump is deceived into thinking that cooperation with Xi Jinping (習近平) would not cost the US in the short run, while confronting Beijing's designs in Asia might. He is certainly being tempted down that path: Nvidia Corp being granted permission to sell high-end chips to China is not a good sign. Trump has said it is “good business,” as long as the federal government gets a 25 percent cut. A short-term revenue boost is sufficient to risk US tech leadership, apparently. How can we take the solemn pronouncements in the NSS seriously? 

The president's mercantilist instincts are well-known. This piece of paper reminds us that he believes in another throwback theory, that of spheres of influence. The strategy states that “the outsized influence of larger, richer and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.”

A revanchist Russia is not the only beneficiary of this belief. China is larger, richer and stronger than anyone else in its region; why not permit it a sphere of influence in Asia, if it gives Trump an economic deal “better” than his predecessors could extract? Beijing might break that promise later, but by then it would be some other administration's problem.

Over the past few decades, a bipartisan consensus had developed in Washington that China was a systemic rival, and not just another economic challenger. But those running policy in the second Trump term are arguing from different premises. It is centered on domestic economic considerations and not to preserve the world order. They do not fear the loss of global leadership; they might even welcome the dissolution of economic arrangements. All they want is to contain the economic shocks accompanying China's rise.

Written into the silences in this document is an unpalatable truth: An establishment in Washington that intimidates large companies, that conscripts tech into politics, that guards its domestic markets and weaponizes its trade would hardly see the Chinese system as an ideological threat.

This is what unnerves Asian capitals. One day soon, MAGA's ideologues and populists might decide that granting Beijing overlordship of Asia would not affect jobs or profits in the US. From that day on, they will not lift a finger in defense of the Indo-Pacific.

A Ukrainian drone attack in southwestern Russia killed two people on Saturday as parts of Ukraine went without power following Russian assaults on energy infrastructure hours before peace talks were to restart in Germany. 

Foreign policy advisers from the US, Ukraine and Germany, among others, were expected to meet in Berlin yesterday, German news agency dpa said. 

Germany is also set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy today, part of efforts by European leaders to steer the negotiations.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law who has been working as an outside adviser, were traveling to Berlin for the talk, said a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

US officials have tried for months to navigate the demands of each side as Trump presses for a swift end to Russia's war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into major obstacles, including the possession of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, mostly occupied by Russia, but parts of which remain under Ukrainian control. 

The drone attack in Russia's Saratov region damaged a residential building and several windows were also blown out at a kindergarten and clinic, Saratov Governor Roman Busargin said. 

The Russian Ministry of Defense said it had shot down 41 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight. 

In Ukraine, Russia launched overnight drone and missile strikes on five Ukrainian regions, targeting energy and port infrastructure. Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Ihor Klymenko said that more than 1 million people were without electricity. 

Russia had sent more than 450 drones and 30 missiles into Ukraine overnight, Zelenskiy said. 

An attack on the Black Sea city of Odesa caused grain silos to catch fire at the port, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure Oleksiy Kuleba said. 

Two people were wounded in attacks on the wider Odesa region, regional military administration head Oleh Kiper said. 

Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia is trying to cripple the Ukrainian power grid, and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water for a fourth consecutive winter, in what Ukrainian officials call “weaponizing” the cold. 

On the front lines, Ukrainian forces on Saturday said that the northern part of the critical city of Pokrovsk was under Ukrainian control, despite Russia's claims earlier this month that it had taken full control of the city. 

The Associated Press was not able to independently verify the claims.

Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

A tsunami as high as three metres (10 feet) could hit Japan's northeastern coast after an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.6 occurred offshore at 11:15 p.m. (1415 GMT), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and a tsunami of 40cm had been observed at Aomori's Mutsu Ogawara and Hokkaido's Urakawa ports before midnight, JMA said.

Ukraine's 429th Separate Drone Regiment ""Achilles"" claimed on Dec. 13 the destruction of a pipeline used by Russian troops to infiltrate the front-line town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast.

The news came shortly after Ukraine's National Guard said its 2nd Khartiia Corps carried out a successful counterattack north of Kupiansk, a development that flatly contradicted Russia's recent claims of capturing the northeastern town.

The ""Achilles"" regiment entered the Kupiansk sector in April and, since then, has killed 998 Russian soldiers and injured another 879, the unit's statement read. 

The regiment described the pipeline as a ""critically important logistical channel"" for Russian forces. The route was discovered during reconnaissance and destroyed in a joint operation with other Ukrainian units.

""It was a safe route that allowed (Russia) to build up strength while bypassing (Ukrainian) fire,"" the ""Achilles"" said.

In September, reports emerged that Russian troops used a gas pipeline to infiltrate Kupiansk, a tactic they adopted during the Battle of Avdiivka.

Kupiansk lies 104 kilometers (65 miles) east of Kharkiv, the regional center. Fighting has been fierce around the town, which was occupied at the start of the full-scale invasion before being liberated in September 2022.

Battles in the Kupiansk sector are ongoing, the ""Achilles"" said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky is meeting U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin, as talks continue to finalize a peace plan to end Russia's full-scale war.

Russian forces attacked a supermarket in the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia on Dec. 14, injuring at least 14 people, including a six-year-old child, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported.

President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed solidarity with Australia following a terrorist attack in eastern Sydney on Dec. 14, which targeted the Jewish community, killing at least 12 people and injuring 29 others.

""I don't think we'll be delaying anything. It is very important for us to maintain the relationship between us and Poland,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on renewed calls for Ukraine to hold wartime elections after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Kyiv used Russia's war to avoid a vote, echoing a Kremlin narrative. 

Zelensky said Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov informed him Belarus preferred this option over releasing the prisoners via ""this or that EU country.""

The U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian potash in exchange for the release of over 100 political prisoners in Belarus, many of whom were transferred to Ukraine. 

Ukraine's ""Achilles"" drone regiment described the pipeline as a ""critically important logistical channel"" for Russian forces. The route was discovered during reconnaissance and destroyed in a joint operation with other Ukrainian units.

The Afipsky Oil Refinery in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, the Uryupinsk oil depot in Vologograd Oblast, and two fuel depots in Crimea were struck, the Ukrainian military reported.

Ukrainian forces downed 110 out of the 138 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Russia also launched an Iskander-M ballistic missile.

The number includes 710 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Russia's oil and gas revenue in December is expected to be nearly half compared to the previous year, down to about 410 billion rubles ($5.17 billion), Reuters reported on Dec. 12.

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Dec. 13 that Ukraine's sanctions against nearly 700 vessels linked to Russia's shadow fleet had entered into force.

President Volodymyr Zelensky on Dec. 13 announced he will meet ""with envoys"" of U.S. President Donald Trump in the coming days as discussions on the U.S.-proposed peace framework aimed at ending Russia's war continue.

Ukraine has relinquished its aim to join the NATO military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday as peace talks got under way in Berlin.

Zelensky aired the concession as he flew to the German capital where he began meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in efforts to end Europe's bloodiest conflict since World War Two.

The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join NATO as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia's war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.

Zelensky met the U.S. envoys at talks hosted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.

Security guarantees from the United States, Europe and other partners instead of NATO membership represented a compromise on Ukraine's side, Zelensky said ahead of Sunday's discussions.

“From the very beginning, Ukraine's desire was to join NATO, these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.

“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries – Canada, Japan – are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” Zelensky said.

“And it is already a compromise from our part,” he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from the about 10% of Donbas which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no NATO troops can be stationed in Ukraine.

Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the U.S.-led NATO alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.

Zelensky had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.

Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow's demands, Zelensky accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine's power and water supplies.

Sending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a U.S. peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia's 2022 invasion.

Zelensky said Ukraine, the Europeans and U.S. are looking at a 20-point plan and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia.

A ceasefire along the current front lines would be a fair option, he added.

Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the U.S. proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its NATO ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.

European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine's future, and sought to shore up Kyiv's finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv's military and civilian budget.

Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as “constructive,” although no major breakthroughs were reached.

Zelensky said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across Ukraine,

“Russia is dragging out the war and seeks to inflict as much harm as possible on our people,” he said.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from NATO and European leaders that Putin would not stop there.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that NATO should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia's next target.”

The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed such claims.

“This seems like a statement by a representative of a generation that has managed to forget what World War Two was actually like,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday.

“They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr. Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,” Peskov added.

In the past year, tens of thousands hostile to immigrants marched through London, chanting “send them home!” A British lawmaker complained of seeing too many non-white faces on TV. And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.

The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. – and across Europe – as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.

In several European countries, political parties that favour mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the AfD, or Alternative for Germany and France's National Rally.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. “garbage” and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.

Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.

“What were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,” said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen's University Belfast.

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King's College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Germany's AfD, France's National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration's concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The centre-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn't see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city. Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain's streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum centre is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behaviour. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain's centre-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain's national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there's going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O'Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Politicians of the political centre also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany's centre-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don't look German don't truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes – though he added that's “quite a forlorn hope.”

“The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

Read more about the obstacles people who are not white Germans face in finding housing.

German authorities have arrested five men suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market, the German DPA news agency and other outlets cited the Munich public prosecutor's office as saying Saturday. 

Read DW's full story on the arrests here.

Affordable housing is rare in Germany. 40% of households spend over a third of their income on rent. But in Augsburg, some have paid almost no rent for over 500 years!

A man suspected of stabbing a young mother and her four small children has been apprehended in Germany's industrial Ruhr valley, police announced on Saturday.

The woman and her four children have been hospitalized in critical but stable condition.

State prosecutors in the city of Bergkamen say the 20-year-old suspect was arrested while hiding in his basement. Police had previously published photos of the suspect online and on social media.

Authorities say the suspect attacked a 26-year-old mother and her four children — ages three, five, seven and eight — with a knife at their home earlier in the day before fleeing the scene.

Police say the suspect likely knew the woman and her children, though they say his motive remains unclear at the moment.

Germany's health minister has called for stronger action to address unequal treatment of women in medical care and research.

Nina Warken of the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) told the Rheinische Post newspaper it was alarming that women's needs had only recently been taken into account in clinical studies.

She noted that women often show different symptoms than men, including in cardiovascular disease, and that medicines can work differently in female bodies.

She said these differences were still insufficiently covered in medical studies and training and called for the knowledge gap to be closed as quickly as possible.

Warken said her ministry has set aside €11.5 million ($13.5 million) in funding through 2029 to support research aimed at improving care for women, adding that additional funds are available through the research ministry led by Dorothee Baer.

Beyond research, Warken said she wants greater political attention on conditions that primarily affect women, including severe menstrual pain, the effects of endometriosis, and menopause.

This is not the first time that Chancellor Merz warned of the tectonic changes that are already affecting Germany and Europe.

As Ukraine negotiations zoom in on Berlin, where Trump's chief negotiator Steve Witkoff is expected to meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday, Merz's words resonate all the more. Even here, among delegates of his traditionally inward-looking conservative CSU sister party in Bavaria.

Merz's warnings were in part strikingly similar to Angela Merkel's sober assessment of Trump's intentions. When she returned from her first visit to see the new US President in 2017, she warned of Trump's America turning its back on Europe. But Merz goes much further.

He underlines his assessment that Europe ""is no longer in peace"" with Russia by comparing the situation in Ukraine to 1938, when Germany first annexed Austria, then parts of Czechoslovakia, and Britain and France tolerated Germany's aggression, hoping Hitler would stop there. He didn't.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin will continue his advance if Ukraine is defeated.

Speaking on Saturday at the party conference of the Bavarian conservative Christian Social Union in Munich, Merz said Putin would not stop and argued that the war was about redrawing Europe's borders and restoring the former Soviet sphere of influence.

Merz said this course posed a serious military threat to countries that were once part of that empire, including Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which are now members of NATO and the EU, as well as other former Warsaw Pact states.

He has also warned Europe to prepare for a lasting shift in relations with the United States.

""The decades of Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe, and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists as we knew it. And nostalgia won't change that,"" he told a party congress in the southern city of Munich.

Merz warned strongly against making major concessions to Moscow in its war against Ukraine.

Diplomatic efforts to end the war have been intensifying. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Berlin over the weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders.

Fewer tourists have visited Berlin this year, leaving the city set to miss a key milestone in 2025, the head of its tourism agency has said.

Burkhard Kieker, chief executive of Visit Berlin, told the Tagesspiegel that overnight stays would end up just below 30 million.

Berlin recorded 30.6 million overnight stays in 2024.

By the end of October, the Berlin-Brandenburg Statistics Office had counted 24.8 million stays, down 4.1% from the same period last year.

Kieker said the slower recovery was mainly due to weak consumer sentiment in Germany and Europe and a lack of broader economic momentum.

He added that traffic at Berlin-Brandenburg Airport remained about 30% below pre-coronavirus levels, while tourism overall was still around 9% below 2019 levels.

Germany has announced plans for its armed forces, the Bundeswehr, to help secure Poland's eastern border with Belarus and Russia.

The Defense Ministry said on Saturday that several dozen German soldiers were set to join Poland's Operation Eastern Shield from April 2026, with the mission initially running until the end of 2027.

A ministry spokesperson said the core task of the German troops in northern and eastern Poland would be engineering work.

This was described as building positions, digging trenches, laying barbed wire and constructing anti-tank obstacles. No further duties are planned.

The operation has been underway since May 2024 in border areas with Moscow ally Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad exclave.

The measures are aimed at strengthening defenses against a possible attack on NATO member Poland.

The deployment does not require parliamentary approval, the ministry said, because it is not considered an armed foreign mission under German law and is not expected to expose troops to direct military confrontation.

Australian police have taken two people into custody after reports of multiple gunshots at Sydney's Bondi Beach. A Jewish event to mark the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday appeared to have been the target of the attack.

New South Wales police said Sunday two people were in custody after multiple gunshots were heard at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach. 

Police said officers were responding to a ""developing incident"" and urged the public to avoid the area and take shelter if already nearby.

For the latest, follow our live updates.

Police warned that the operation was ongoing and instructed people to obey police directions and avoid crossing police lines.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that one suspected shooter had been shot by police, while another was detained. Police have not confirmed those details.

""We are aware of an active security situation in Bondi. We urge people in the vicinity to follow information from NSW Police,"" said a spokesperson for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Videos circulating on X appeared to show people scattering across Bondi Beach as multiple gunshots and police sirens were heard.

Another video showed two men pinned to the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge, with officers appearing to try to resuscitate one of them.

The attack appeared to target a Jewish event, to mark the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday.

Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News the attack occurred during what he described as a joyful community gathering and said his media adviser was wounded.

""This is the Jewish community at its best coming together to mark a happy occasion. If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it's something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It's a horrific thing,"" he said.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said, ""The heart of the entire nation of Israel misses a beat at this very moment, as we pray for the recovery of the wounded, we pray for them and we pray for those who lost their lives.""

            As I push my cart into my favorite grocery store, I stop and look at the shoppers — my neighbors — around me. Do they realize that nearly 70% of the food available to purchase for their families is ultraprocessed? And if they did, would they know how to avoid those foods?
    


            I've been trying to answer that question for more than two years now, as part of my beat for the CNN Wellness team. Not only does my team report on the latest lifestyle news, we also provide expert-vetted guidance on how to improve your health —  we like to say it's “news you can use.”
    


            Yet after reading countless studies, talking to dozens of experts and exploring all sorts of trendy apps, I still can't help you reliably avoid ultraprocessed foods, also known as UPFs.
    


            Come with me to the snack aisle, and I'll explain why.
    


            As I pass by all the colorfully packaged candies, cookies and chips, my stomach starts to rumble with anticipation. Typically made of refined grains and overflowing with sugar, salt and fat, these products — which we used to call “junk foods” — are calorie-laden, nutritionally bad for us, and deliciously addictive.
    


            The appeal of junk food hasn't changed — in fact, experts say it's only gotten worse as the food industry refined its algorithms to target our “bliss point” — creating the absolute yummiest combinations of sugar, salt and fat to make it nearly impossible to “eat just one.”
    


            Today, many of those same junk foods — as well as the majority of other ultraprocessed foods such as ready-to-eat meals, processed meats, instant and boxed mixes, breakfast cereals, and more — contain newly created synthetic favors, textures, dyes and preservatives.
    


            In fact, today's preservatives can keep foods looking fresh and tasty for days and weeks, even years — much longer shelf lives than in your great granny's day.
    


            There's no doubt that the safety and convenience of such long-lasting, affordable foods has been life-changing. Today, we can make meals from our cabinets without stopping by the store for fresh ingredients or stirring sauce for hours over the stove. We have more of our precious time to spend on other pursuits.
    


            Yet it's those preservatives and other additives, however, that can make a food ultraprocessed, according to the food classification system NOVA, the most widely used definition of UPFs to date.
    


            NOVA was created in 2009 by Brazilian nutritionist Carlos Augusto Monteiro, who coined the term “ultraprocessed.” Monteiro is an emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil's University of São Paulo.
    


            NOVA splits food into four categories. First are  minimally processed foods — whole foods which we may slightly “process” by cutting (slicing up an orange or apple) and cooking (sautéing vegetables). The second group includes processed culinary items used to prepare, season and cook whole foods — think spices, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned or bottled veggies and fruits, salted nuts, and unpackaged, freshly baked breads are examples.
    


            Group four are ultraprocessed foods — which now make up to 53% of an American adult's diet and 62% of foods eaten by an American child, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            According to Monteiro, the products in group four contain little to no whole food. Instead, they are manufactured from “chemically manipulated cheap ingredients” and often use synthetic additives to make them “edible, palatable and habit-forming.”
    


            Additives often used in ultraprocessed foods include preservatives to resist mold and bacteria; emulsifiers to keep incompatible ingredients from separating; artificial colorings; fragrance and flavor enhancers; and anti-foaming, bulking, bleaching, gelling and glazing agents.
    


            “No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro  cowrote in a 2024 editorial in the journal The BMJ. “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.”
    


            The stakes are high: Studies have shown that eating just 10% more calories a day from ultraprocessed food — that's about one serving — may be associated with a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death. There is also a 55% greater chance of obesity and a 40% higher probability of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk of cognitive decline and stroke also rises, as does the chance of developing cancers of the upper digestive tract.
    


            However, the Consumer Brands Association, which represents major food manufacturers, told me in an email “there is currently no agreed upon scientific definition of ultra-processed foods.”
    


            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” said Sarah Gallo, CBA's senior vice president of product policy. “Americans deserve facts based on sound science in order to make the best choices for their health.”
    


            In addition, she said, food and beverage manufacturers have long invested in product labeling, “so that consumers can review product ingredients and nutrition information and make decisions best for them.”
    


            To manufacture cheap, delicious food that is packaged for convenience, experts say basic food crops such as potatoes, corn, wheat and soybeans may be disassembled into their molecular parts — starchy flours, protein isolates, fats and oils — to create what manufacturers call “slurries.” (How do they do it?  Watch this video.)
    


            The cell walls of the plants are destroyed, dispersing micronutrients that often need to work together to nurture our bodies. Insoluble plant fiber we need to be healthy may also be lost. What's left is a substance some scientists call “predigested” — not unlike the regurgitated food a mama bird feeds her babies.
    


            Barry Popkin, the W.R. Kenan Jr. Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health, has seen the process firsthand.
    


            “In the early 2000s, I went into some food plants and I saw the stuff — it was supposed to be granola bars, shredded wheat cereal,” Popkin said. “It was colorless, odorless. I scooped some up in a spoon and tried to taste it — it was like sawdust or something.”
    


            Here's why eating “predigested” food can be a problem: When we eat whole foods as our bodies are meant to do, we absorb micronutrients throughout the entire digestive process. If they are exploded into smithereens in an ultraprocessed food, do we still have access to them? If we do, are they absorbed by the body in the ways nature meant them to be?
    


            I'm not aware of any studies that answer that question, although research is underway. But according to some food scientists I've spoken to, it doesn't matter — manufacturers just add back missing vitamins, fiber and protein during manufacturing and voilà! It's as good as new.
    


            Or is it? Is a patched-up Humpty Dumpty really the same Dumpty that fell off the wall?
    


            Let's get back to the slurries: Next, with the help of artificial colorings, flavorings, texturizers and glue-like emulsifiers, ingredients are mixed, heated, pounded, shaped or extruded into any food a manufacturer can dream up.
    


            “It's an illusion of food,” Dr. Chris van Tulleken told me last year.  He is a BBC contributor and professor of infection and global health at University College London.
    


            “It's really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them into molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want,” said van Tulleken, author of the 2023 book “Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn't Food … and Why Can't We Stop?”
    


            I'm still wandering around the snack aisle, so let's put our knowledge to the test by looking at one of my kids' old favorites — ranch-flavored veggie straws. As a conscientious mom, I always reached for the organic version.
    


            Of the more than 30 ingredients, three are additives: sodium caseinate, used as an emulsifier; calcium chloride, which extends shelf life; and potassium chloride, a flavor enhancer used to treat low blood pressure and low potassium levels.
    


            All are designated GRAS (generally regarded as safe) for use in food by the US Food and Drug Administration. Yet by NOVA's standards, those veggie straws are definitely ultraprocessed.
    


            Let's look at the nutrition label. The top ingredient is potato starch, followed by potato powder. Then come various oils, dehydrated vegetable powders (such as bell peppers, carrots, spinach), turmeric and beetroot powders (for color), and dried milk products (for the ranch taste). There are some vitamins and minerals. Oh, and salt and sugar, of course.
    


            None of that sounds dangerous, but all those powders? That's a red flag that these kid-friendly straws may not have been made from my “Mom” vision of sautéed veggies pureed in a blender, poured into a mold and baked until puffy. Instead, it's possible they were created from a potato-based sludge, colored and flavored with vegetable powders, and enriched with vitamins before being squeezed through a tube and baked.



            That's something scientists can't determine. In fact, none of us can, because how these foods are made is proprietary to each manufacturer, which closely guards recipes and “bliss point” algorithms from competitors and the public.
    


            I tried to obtain access to a major food company's production site on several occasions to understand how potato chips and other foods are made. Six months later, I gave up.
    


            “Food companies today, they've closed off their processing plants,” Popkin said. “So we've never been able to have a clinical study studying what happens if you eat real corn versus deconstructed corn.”
    


            But wait — I buy organic versions of the veggie straws, doesn't that help? Unfortunately, no. Buying organic does reduce pesticide levels, but that's not part of ultraprocessing. Turning even an organic vegetable into refined flakes and powders may destroy the plant's food matrix — cell walls that hold nutrients — and like our Humpty Dumpty, that food must be put back together again.
    


            Many experts have tried to simplify the chore of avoiding ultraprocessing by advising consumers to choose foods with no more than five ingredients or avoid foods with ingredients you can't pronounce or can't find at home.
    


            Those are great suggestions if you have time to read labels. It's also not a complete solution. Let's look at my favorite potato chip, which only has three ingredients on the label: potatoes, salt and oil. Does that mean this potato chip is now good for me? Or is it still a junk food even though it isn't ultraprocessed by the NOVA definition?
    


            Those convenient, kid-friendly frozen chicken nuggets are easy to identify as ultraprocessed. And here's a startling fact: Nuggets typically contain transglutaminase, which the industry calls “meat glue.” It's an enzyme that helps combine parts of an animal or different animals into one product — hot dogs, sausages and deli meats are common examples. (Hint: If the food packaging reads “formed” or “reformed,” it likely contains transglutaminase.)
    


            Transglutaminase isn't easy to pronounce, and it's not an ingredient you'll have at home. Yet the FDA and US Department of Agriculture have no problem with it because it dissipates when cooked.
    


            This next challenge is harder: Are most breads on grocery store shelves ultraprocessed by NOVA standards? Unless it's freshly baked from scratch, the answer is “most likely,” although experts disagree.
    


            From the NOVA perspective, if a bread lasts longer than a week or so without mold, it may have a synthetic preservative in it. Common additives in bread include calcium propionate, an artificial preservative linked to behavior problems in children;  potassium sorbate, another synthetic preservative linked to skin and respiratory issues in people who are sensitive to it; and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), two more artificial preservatives that may be linked to hormone and reproductive disruption and cancer.
    


            But what if the bread is made with whole wheat or whole grains you can actually see and taste? It may still be ultraprocessed, but isn't it better for you? That is still a fiercely debated question.
    


            Now, here's a tricky one: plant-based meat substitutes. Ultraprocessed to their core, many experts say these alt meats are still better for us than red and processed meats full of saturated fats or nitrates.
    


            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it's very easy to be better than that,” leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett told me earlier this year.



            “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants,” said Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    


            Many of the alt-meat products have dramatically improved their nutritional profiles since they first hit the market. Recent studies analyzed by the Physicians Association for Nutrition, or PAN International, found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, dramatically higher in fiber (beef has no fiber), and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.
    


            There's also the role of plant-based meat in saving the planet. According to the Good Food Institute, which promotes alternative proteins and coauthored the report, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98% and land use by up to 97%.
    


            I could go on and on, but here's the bottom line: Deciding what is “ultraprocessed and bad for your health” and “ultraprocessed, but OK to eat” is really complicated — especially for a society unwilling or unable to give up inexpensive, convenient food.
    


            Fortunately, the world is taking action. In mid-May, the World Health Organization put out a global clarion call for scientists to help define and create guidelines for ultraprocessed food consumption. Once the panel is chosen, the work is expected to take two years.
    


            A week later, the Trump Administration released its first “Make America Healthy Again” report, calling for action on ultraprocessed foods they say are a danger to our children's health. An August 15 leaked version of the second report — which was supposed to announce specific policy actions — instead called for the government to “continue efforts to develop a U.S. government-wide definition.” The final report, released in September, provided no additional action.
    


            “Unfortunately, the final MAHA report is all promises and has no teeth,” University of Carolina's Popkin told me at the time. “In my opinion, it shows the food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical industries got to the White House and won the day.”
    


            Andrew Nixon, deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the US Department of Health and Human Services, told me in an email the administration is confronting the UPF challenge, which is a “major driver of the nation's chronic disease epidemic.”
    


            “Replacing them with real, whole foods is one of the most effective ways to Make America Healthy Again,” Nixon said. “We remain committed to serving the American people, not special interests or outside critics, by delivering radical transparency and upholding gold-standard science.”
    


            Other groups have stepped into the void. The American Heart Association, for example, divided ultraprocessed food into three categories — least healthy, moderately healthy and healthy.
    


            Understandably, the AHA is most concerned with how foods impact the heart. High-fat red and processed meats fall within the “least healthy” category in the AHA report — as they should, considering their role in heart disease and colon cancer. However, red meat is also the least processed food in that category.
    


            And yet, that's the point: Regulating ultraprocessed foods by additives alone — without also addressing the health concerns of too much sugar, salt and saturated fat (hello, beef tallow!) — won't improve the nation's food supply and our deteriorating health.
    


            In an effort to fix that, Monteiro is campaigning for researchers and government officials to add more ingredients to the NOVA definition often used in creating food policy.
    


            “Our proposal now is to target any food with an excess of sodium, saturated fat or sugar, along with synthetic colors, flavors and non-nutritive sweeteners,” Monteiro told me when I reported on a recent three-part series in the journal The Lancet. He and Popkin coauthored the articles with 41 other internationally known scientists.
    


            However, there is a missing element, according to Harvard's Willett: “The huge blind spot of refined grains, which is the largest source of calories in the US and most countries at this time — this is not considered to be an UPF.”
    


            The Lancet series blasted the food industry, claiming global corporations continued to aggressively market and extensively profit from new and existing UPF products despite increasing evidence of harm to public health.
    


            “The food industry doesn't want to lose their cash cow, so they're willing to put millions into fighting government restrictions on ultraprocessed food as well as funding nutritionists who'll say there's no evidence of harm,” Popkin said.
    


            The International Food & Beverage Alliance, founded in 2008 by leading food and nonalcoholic beverage companies, told me in an email when the Lancet series published that health authorities worldwide have rejected the concept of ultraprocessed food due to its lack of scientific consensus.
    


            “The policy and advocacy recommendations of this series go far beyond the available evidence — proposing new regulatory action based on ‘processing' or additive ‘markers' and calling for the exclusion of industry from policymaking,” said IFBA Secretary-General Rocco Renaldi.
    


            California made history in early October by enacting the first law in the United States to define and ultimately ban problematic ultraprocessed foods in public schools.
    


            Not only does the California legislation define ultraprocessed food — not an easy task as you have seen — it requires public health officials and scientists to decide which UPFs are most harmful to human health. An “ultraprocessed food of concern” would then be phased out of the school food supply. That's impressive, considering California is projected to serve over 1 billion meals to schoolchildren in the 2025–26 school year.
    


California has also led the way in laws banning food dyes, potassium bromate, a possible carcinogen once widely used in breads, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben.
    


            “Here in California, we are actually doing the work to protect our kids' health, and we've been doing it since well before anyone had ever heard of the MAHA movement,” said Jesse Gabriel, the Democratic California Assemblymember who introduced several of the bills, in an October 9 press conference.
    


            What's so promising about the legislation is the scope of the effort. California lawmakers have considered many of the ways in which both junk and ultraprocessed foods may be harmful to human health — ingredients such as nonnutritive sweeteners; additives such as emulsifiers, stabilizers and thickeners; flavor enhancers; a host of food dyes and more.
    


            American scientific research on the harms of UPF additives is in its infancy, but the new law has taken that into account. Additives banned, restricted or required to carry a warning by other local, state, federal or international jurisdictions will be in the analysis. That's key, as the European Union and other countries have already regulated many additives still allowed in the US.
    


            Food modified to contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar can also be rejected, according to the law. This will help target industry strategies that may contribute to an addiction to ultraprocessed foods — an increasing concern for American children raised on UPFs.
    


            The downside? The law won't provide final details on which UPFs are most concerning until June 2028, and it won't have all UPFs out of school lunches until 2035. I'm hopeful there will be useful updates as the process rolls along.
    


            While we wait for definitive action (don't hold your breath), we still have to navigate the grocery store. Of course, the best way is to buy everything fresh and cook at home. But like you, I'm far too busy to do as much of that as I would like — plus my kids are grown and the pressure to set a good example is gone (although my new grandson may change that).
    


            Instead, I stock up on frozen veggies — many are flash frozen and have the same nutrients as when first picked. Low-sodium canned beans and other legumes keep me from having to cook dry beans from scratch.
    


            When I buy fresh produce, I try to buy organic if my budget allows. That's especially true for crops in the 2025 “Dirty Dozen,” an annual list of foods with the most (and least) pesticides created by the Environmental Working Group, a health advocacy group.
    


            I also do my best to avoid veggies and salad greens packaged in chemical-laden plastics (that's a whole other problem I write about). I especially stay away from precut veggies (loss of nutrients) and foods sold in black plastic containers (read about those here.) That's really hard because they are everywhere!



            When it comes to ready-to-heat-and-eat meals, I look for whole chicken breasts, sliced beef and pork, chicken or steak kebabs, and stews with real chunks of meat. (Here's a tip: If the package says the meat is cooked “sous vide,” I've found it's more likely to be whole meat.)
    


            As for the rest of the grocery store — the nearly 70% which is ultraprocessed — I do my best. I don't know all the names of additives — much less which are harmful or beneficial — so that's not very helpful to me. I could just as easily discard a food enriched with pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyridoxine (vitamin B6) or cobalamin (vitamin B12) as I could one with azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent in bread banned in the EU due to cancer concerns.
    


            Instead, I put on my detective hat, turn the product over, and read — starting with the nutrition label. Many people go straight to carbohydrates, but carbs are not necessarily the enemy — in whole foods they come naturally, along with fiber, vitamins and minerals. Foods which are overly processed, however, may need to increase levels of added sugars, salt and fat to make the food “hyperpalatable” and hard to resist.
    


            A tablespoonful of ketchup, for example, can contain 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of added sugar, while spaghetti and pizza sauces are notoriously high in added sugar as well. If you search the shelves, however, there are low-salt, no sugar and no artificial sweetener options.
    


            And this is important — the percentages on the nutrition label are only for one serving. Let's take honey peanut butter, part of a typical PB&J lunch for my kids while they were growing up.
    


            The label says one serving — two tablespoons of peanut butter — has 13 grams of sugar (2.5 teaspoons). So if I put 3 servings on the sandwich — that's an incredible 39 grams or 7.3 teaspoons of sugar (not counting the jelly) in what many of us consider a healthy meal for a child.
    


            (OK, you may know this, yes. But truthfully, how often do you stop and look at serving size? Yeah, me neither.)
    


            I then move to the ingredients listed in the order of prevalence. I look for signs of overprocessing (powdered veggies, of course). Additives are always at the bottom, but other culprits rise to the occasion. If sugar is first, second or third on the list, I tend to consider the food a dessert. If ingredients at the top are healthy and sugar is toward the bottom of the list, I'm not overly concerned.
    


            Here's a great example: An extremely popular organic bread in grocery stores has 35 ingredients — the first 21 are whole grains and seeds. The loaf has no synthetic additives, but it does have 4 grams of added sugar per serving in the form of organic molasses. Would you consider that a junk food? An ultraprocessed food overly laden with sugar? Or is it healthy? You decide.
    


            Yet you shouldn't have to decide, experts say. You should be able to go to your grocery store and buy foods that are good for you without having to play detective.
    


            “The rise of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in human diets is being driven by the growing economic and political power of the UPF industry,” wrote the authors of the third Lancet paper. “Curbing corporate power in food systems begins with governance reform.”
    


            Otherwise, they added, UPFs may well “replace all other food groups” in the not-so-distant future.
    


            Yes, there will always be junk food, and yes, we will all succumb at times. But if the majority of our food was regulated to be as whole, fresh, and devoid of added sugar, salt, fat, additives and processing as possible, we would be a much healthier nation — and world.
    


            I'm not holding my breath.

Fernando Mendoza's remarkable season at the helm of the nation's top-ranked team was rewarded with college football's most coveted individual award on Saturday.
    


            The Indiana Hoosiers quarterback won the 2025 Heisman Trophy, beating out Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, and Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, to become the school's first winner of the acclaimed prize.
    


            As his name was called, an emotional Mendoza embraced his fellow finalists and his family. Holding back tears, he also hugged his IU head coach, Curt Cignetti.
    


            “I'm at a loss of words. Thank you to everybody. First, I want to thank God for giving me the opportunity to chase a dream that once felt a world away,” Mendoza said while next to the trophy. “Standing here tonight and holding this bad boy, representing Indiana University, still doesn't feel real.”
    


            Mendoza's football resume was stacked with notable accomplishments. He led the Hoosiers to a perfect 13-0 record, to the university's first Big Ten football title since 1967 and helped book the No. 1 seed in the upcoming College Football Playoff. He was also named the Associated Press player of the year and won the Davey O'Brien Award as the nation's top quarterback.
    


            “If you told me, as a kid in Miami, that I would be here on stage, holding this prestigious trophy, I probably would have laughed, cried like I'm doing now, or both,” Mendoza said. “Because this moment, it's an honor, it's bigger than me. It's a product of a family, a team, community and a whole lot of people who believed in me long before anybody knew my name.”
    


            It was almost exactly a year ago to the day when Mendoza traded his Northern California digs for the Midwest sprawl of Indiana.
    


            And on Saturday, the move paid off with the 22-year-old winning the 91st edition of the Heisman Trophy at New York City's Lincoln Center.
    


            The junior quarterback threw for 2,980 yards and 33 touchdowns while adding six more scores on the ground this season.
    

Quarterback Fernando Mendoza is making history at Indiana University with a perfect season. He also has a real shot at the Heisman Trophy. CNN's Brynn Gingras travels to his old high school in Miami to learn what makes this player so special. Stream the full story on the CNN app.


            Mendoza gave credit to the school and his teammates for the honor.
    


            “Congrats to all my teammates. My brothers. This is our trophy. I love you guys more than you know,” Mendoza said.
    


            “This trophy might have my name on it but it belongs to all of you. It belongs … first time in Bloomington. Playing in front of Hoosier nation is one of the greatest privileges of my life. And I'll carry that forever.”
    


            With his family looking upon, Mendoza thanked his parents, especially his mother.
    


            “I was only a two-star prospect, only had one scholarship offer. But my family's unconditional love and belief kept me going and pushing me forward. These are the people who built me long before football did,” Mendoza said.
    


            “Mommy, this is your trophy as much as it is mine,” he said as the ESPN broadcast showed Elsa Mendoza proudly listening to her son on stage, holding back her tears.
    


            “You've always been my biggest fan. You're my light. You're my why. You're my biggest supporter. Your sacrifices encouraged love. Those have been my playbook and the playbook I'm going to carry through my side for my entire life.”
    


            A Cuban American whose grandparents immigrated from Cuba, Mendoza gave a special shout-out in Spanish to Alberto and Alicia Espinoza, who were also in attendance.
    


            After spending his first two seasons as the University of California, Berkeley Golden Bears QB, Mendoza entered the transfer portal and eventually committed to play for Cignetti and Indiana University in late December 2024.
    


            What came next was a historic season in which the city of Bloomington, an illustrious college basketball town, caught “HeisMendoza” fever.
    


After an epic victory, one of Heisman hopeful's first texts was to his high school coach



            In an October interview with CNN, Mendoza said he's been watching the Heisman ceremony since he was a kid and divulged what the opportunity to win the trophy meant to him.
    


            “It's definitely a great honor to be in that (Heisman) conversation, especially with so many great former players and so many great players that are in that conversation right now.
    


            “I honestly always believed in myself and believed in my team. And so I really just try to keep it one game at a time, one practice at a time, in order to then have a small scope in order to get my large goals.”
    


            Mendoza finished with 643 first-place votes.
    


            Pavia finished in second, with Love and Sayin coming in third and fourth in the voting, respectively.
    


            The ultimate team prize, a national championship, is also within the quarterback's grasp. The journey will start at the beginning of the new year, as Indiana awaits the winner of No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Alabama in the CFP quarterfinals on January 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.
    


            The Fighting Irish have been the talk of college football in the last week for the wrong reasons. Despite his team missing out on the CFP, Love proved himself to be the premier halfback in college this season.
    


            The 20-year-old junior finished fourth in the FBS with 1,372 rushing yards and third with 18 rushing touchdowns.
    


            Sayin, the sophomore quarterback, had big shoes to fill after his Buckeyes won the 2024-2025 national championship behind signal-caller Will Howard.
    


            The 20-year-old did just that this season, leading No. 2 Ohio State to a 12-1 record with 3,232 yards and 31 touchdowns.
    


            The Buckeyes will face the winner of No. 7 Texas A&M and No. 10 Miami in the Cotton Bowl on January 1.
    


            Before Pavia got onto campus in Nashville, Vanderbilt was not viewed as a serious Southeastern Conference powerhouse.
    


            But the 23-year-old transferred in from New Mexico State University ahead of the 2024 season and the Commodores became a SEC contender ever since.
    


            The senior led No. 14 Vandy to the program's first 10-win season, throwing for 3,192 yards, 27 passing touchdowns, 826 rushing yards, and nine touchdowns on the ground.
    


            The Commodores just missed out on their first CFP berth but will face No. 23 Iowa in the ReliaQuest Bowl on December 31 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Blake Horvath to Eli Heidenreich.

That's the connection that led Navy to such a memorable season — and the two of them came through again on the biggest play of the biggest game.

Horvath threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Heidenreich with 6:32 remaining — on fourth-and-goal — and No. 22 Navy rallied to beat Army 17-16 on Saturday. Heidenreich, the career and single-season leader in yards receiving for the Midshipmen, caught six of Horvath's seven completions on the day.

“Who wouldn't go to him?” Horvath said. “Talk about an all-time Navy legend. You're going to be talking about Eli Heidenreich for years and years and years.”

Although it was clearly a passing situation, and Heidenreich was Navy's top target, he was single covered over the middle.

“Tried to bring some pressure on them,” Army coach Jeff Monken said. “Good throw and good catch.”

With President Donald Trump in attendance, Navy (10-2) got its second straight victory over Army (6-6), and the Midshipmen won the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy for a second straight season. The Black Knights have not beaten a Navy team that was ranked by the AP since 1955.

Horvath was fortunate to have the chance to throw that decisive touchdown pass. On second-and-goal from the 1, he lost the ball while attempting a tush push. Army linebacker Eric Ford had a chance to scoop it up, but Navy running back Alex Tecza lunged over to prevent that, and Heidenreich eventually fell on the ball back at the 8.

Think you know who belongs in the Top 25? Now it's your turn to vote with the AP Top 25 fan poll.

“That's probably the last thing you want to see on the 1-yard line is you turn around and the ball is just bouncing behind you,” Heidenreich said. “I was blocking down. I thought he had pushed in, and kind of out of my peripheral I saw it going behind me.”




On the next play, Horvath was nearly sacked, but he was able to throw the ball toward Tecza as he went down. The ball fell incomplete instead of being caught around the 15, which was just as well for Navy because it made going for it on fourth down a more viable option.

“I kind of felt like we had to,” Navy coach Brian Newberry said. “The nature of what they do offensively, despite how well we played in the second half, you may not get the ball back.”

Even after Heidenreich's touchdown and an Army punt, Navy still had to escape one more near-turnover. On third-and-3 from the Army 43, the ball popped loose on a run by Horvath, but he was able to catch it out of the air. It came loose again and the Black Knights recovered, but after a review, Horvath was ruled down before the second fumble — a yard short of the line to gain.

Tecza then ran for the first down that enabled Navy to kneel out the clock, and Horvath appeared to wave goodbye at the Army sideline. There was a bit of a ruckus near midfield after the final kneel-down before things eventually calmed down for the traditional singing of the alma maters.

“They want to talk all their crap during the game and act like they're so tough,” Horvath said. “The excuse last year was that they played a conference championship game before us. This year, we'll see what it is.”

The Black Knights were trying to turn the tables on Navy after a ranked Army team — which had just won the American Conference title — lost to the Midshipmen last year.

The teams traded touchdown drives to start the game, each lasting 13 plays, 75 yards and over seven minutes. Horvath had a 5-yard scoring run, and Army quarterback Cale Hellums answered with a 2-yarder. Army's first drive didn't end until 5 seconds into the second quarter.

Then it was a while before anyone reached the end zone again. With Army up 10-7 late in the second quarter, the ball slipped out of Horvath's hand while he was looking to pass. Army recovered the fumble at its own 45 with 20 seconds to play and moved into range for a 45-yard field goal by Dawson Jones.

Navy's defense stiffened in the second half, but the Midshipmen still flirted with disaster. Horvath threw an interception in the third quarter that was initially returned to the end zone — before a replay showed Army's Justin Weaver had a knee down when he picked off the pass at the Navy 32. The Black Knights had to settle for three — Dawson connected on a career-long 48-yard kick.

Navy's Wing-T offense has been explosive this season. The Midshipmen entered the day with an FBS-high 10 plays of at least 60 yards. Army mostly kept them contained, but Horvath slipped free for a 37-yard run that set up a third-quarter field goal that made it 16-10.

After Hellums' underthrown pass was intercepted by Phillip Hamilton, giving Navy the ball at the 50 with 11:19 to play, Tecza's 24-yard run made it first-and-goal from the 5.

Trump tossed the coin before the game at midfield, then returned at halftime to walk from the Navy sideline to the Army one.

Army defensive lineman Jack Bousum, who is from Annapolis, had a big game against his hometown team. He finished with 1 1/2 sacks and a fumble recovery.

Army: The Black Knights were the better team in the first half Saturday but didn't do much offensively after that.

“They beat blocks,” Monken said. “We didn't sustain the blocks we needed to.”

Navy: Horvath made some big plays and some bad ones, and the Navy defense was stout in the second half. The Midshipmen finished tied for first in the AAC this year but missed out on the league title game because of tiebreakers. This victory matters more to them anyway.

Army: Faces UConn in the Fenway Bowl on Dec. 27.

Navy: Faces Cincinnati in the Liberty Bowl on Jan. 2.

BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar's military regime appealed to the international community on Sunday to take back hundreds of foreigners who have been detained in a crackdown on scam centers in the country's eastern Kayin state near the Thai border.

In recent months, the authorities have raided two major scam centers, KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the outskirts of Myawaddy, a trading town on the border with Thailand. The operations resulted in the detention of thousands of foreign nationals.

Col. Min Thu Kyaw, who led the crackdown operations, said authorities were struggling to manage the detainees.

“They are different nationals, who have different religions, morals and personalities,” he said. “We want the international community to come and call them quickly. It would be more convenient if they call them back as soon as possible.”

On Sunday, Maj-Gen Aung Kyaw Kyaw, deputy minister for Home Affairs, told a press conference in Yangon, the country's biggest city, that 13,272 foreigners from 47 countries had been detained since the start of the crackdown in January. While most have been deported, 1,655 are still in detention, he said.

Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations that target people all over the world. They usually involve gaining a person's confidence with romantic ploys and luring them into bogus investment schemes. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime has estimated that such activities generate just under $40 billion in annual revenue for criminal gangs.

Col. Min Thu Kyaw, the minister for the security and border affairs of Kayin state government, said most of the 1,655 people awaiting deportation are being held at town's sport facilities, as well as in buildings controlled by the Kayin Border Guard Force and repurposed scam compounds.

The largest number of the remaining detainees awaiting deportation are Chinese nationals, with more than 500 people. They rest comprises groups of between 100 and 300 people each from Indonesia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Kenya and India, he said.




The minister said most delayed returns involve foreigners from African countries that do not have embassies in Myanmar or Thailand, and that has slowed the deportation process to as long as five months.

State-run MRTV television has recently broadcast footage of security operations at scam centers near Myawaddy, including videos and photos showing buildings being demolished with explosives and bulldozers. 

The military government has said it began its latest crackdown on online scams and illegal gambling in early September. However, critics charge that the masterminds of the scam operations continue to operate in other locations.

Ethnic minority militias also exercise strong influence in the Myawaddy area. Several ethnic Karen militias are active, including the military-backed Border Guard Force, which has signed a ceasefire with the army, and the Karen National Union, which is part of the nationwide resistance fight against military rule.

The Border Guard Force has claimed credit for taking part in the crackdown, though it is widely believed to have provided protection for scam operators in the past. The military government has claimed the KNU is linked to the scam centers on the basis of reported real estate deals.

Both groups have denied involvement in the scam operations.

San Jose State assistant volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose told Fox News Digital about her recent lawsuit after losing her job earlier this year.

EXCLUSIVE: Former San Jose State assistant volleyball coach Melissa Batie-Smoose has stepped into the recent war of words between former players Brooke Slusser and Blaire Fleming. 

Fleming, who is transgender, made disputed claims that Slusser has been anorexic since they first met in 2023 and failed out of her classes at SJSU. Slusser denied Fleming's statements, previously saying that she developed an eating disorder from the stress and anxiety of playing and rooming with Fleming after discovering Fleming was a biological male, and the highly publicized scandal that ensued. 

The conflict between the two players and subsequent lawsuits by Slusser against the NCAA and Mountain West conference over the situation put the players and entire program under immense national scrutiny in their final season together in 2024.

Now, Batie-Smoose has provided her perspective on the disputed claims between the two athletes.

""To my knowledge, Brooke's mental health and academic performance were excellent during her first year and a half as a student athlete in the program. She was engaged, consistent and doing well both personally and academically. But after sharing her experience, the surrounding pressures intensified,"" Batie-Smoose told Fox News Digital. 

""She was chastised on campus and on social media, which seemed to cause her well-being and academic performance to decline. From my perspective, that context matters and underscores how much she has been carrying in a short amount of time."" 

Batie-Smoose also expressed ""disappointment"" about Fleming's disputed comments about Slusser.

""I'm a little surprised and disappointed by Blaire Fleming's comments. Even if you're frustrated or hurt by Brooke's actions, I hoped there might be a little more empathy—especially from someone who has been the subject of personal attacks and understands how tough these things can get. Personal hardship should give us a deeper understanding of and more empathy for what others may be experiencing, not less,"" Batie-Smoose added. 

""Struggles with food, mental health or academic pressure are serious matters that deserve compassion, not dismissal. Regardless of personal dynamics, speaking harshly about someone who is clearly going through a difficult period is not something we want to encourage or normalize. Brooke's issues with food and her grades aren't excuses, but rather signs of someone who's been going through a lot.""

Fox News Digital was unable to reach Fleming for comment, as Fleming's Instagram account has been deactivated in recent days. 

LAW FIRM THAT WORKED TO KEEP SJSU TRANS PLAYER ELIGIBLE ALSO CLEARED ATHLETE OF CONSPIRING TO HARM TEAMMATE

Slusser originally told Fox News Digital on Nov. 30 – the one-year anniversary of her final game with Fleming – about the impact the situation had on her body and academics.

""From the stress and how anxious I was every single day, I just wasn't eating really at all,"" Slusser said. ""I went from around 160 to 128 [pounds] in that one semester. It definitely isn't healthy for someone of my size to be that weight, and I ended up losing my menstrual cycle for nine months. So it was definitely severe."" 

The 5-foot-11 Slusser added that people at home started to take notice. 

""When I came home, some of my friends and family were very worried about me,"" she added. ""Some of my friends were just like, ‘You always looked tired all the time. You always look dead…' I was able to come home three days that fall semester my senior year, and I had a friend later on tell me that when I saw her, she went home and cried to her mom, because she was so worried about me, just because she could tell I looked so unhealthily skinny.""

Her father, Paul Slusser, then insisted that she move back home to Texas from San Jose after the 2024 season and fall semester ended. The family said she then attempted to finish her final semester and degree online, but later dropped the classes to focus on physical and mental rehabilitation. Slusser and her family say she has recovered from her anorexia, and is working on finishing her degree. She aspires to start her own business in dietetics. 

The family is still navigating the completion of her degree. 

Fleming responded to Slusser's situation, making the disputed claims to Fox News Digital on Dec. 7.

""She's been anorexic and struggled with food since I've known her[,] aka since 2023. She literally would weigh herself 2-3x a day and keep track of it on her whiteboard in her room…. So I really don't care or feel bad for her. And she didn't drop her classes[,] she failed out[,] hope that helps!"" Fleming said.

Slusser promptly responded, calling Fleming's statement ""just not true."" 

""These statements are just not true. I have always lived a very healthy lifestyle. Before these events took place[,] I was very disciplined in fueling myself for athletics and [kept] track to make sure I was where I need to be[,] to be the best athlete. It wasn't until all the craziness started that my healthy lifestyle turned very unhealthy into not eating the amount I should,"" Slusser said.

""As for school[,] I decided to stay home after fall 2024 to better myself and heal. So no[,] I did not return to San Jose and enroll myself in more courses at an institution that didn't have my best interest.""

Slusser has alleged in her lawsuits against the NCAA and Mountain West Conference that she was never told Fleming's birth sex, and that the two regularly shared hotel rooms on away trips. Slusser has also said in the lawsuits that Fleming confessed to being transgender during a conversation over ice cream in April 2024. 

Slusser then joined Riley Gaines' lawsuit against the NCAA in September 2024. What followed was a series of forfeits by opposing teams. Each forfeit compounded growing attention in an election-season media cycle, putting SJSU's volleyball players and their opponents under a massive political spotlight.

President Donald Trump even mentioned the scandal on his campaign trail in October of that year, during a Fox News Channel all-woman town hall event. 

Police protection was assigned to the team on a regular basis. 

Slusser has alleged in her lawsuit against the Mountain West, which was filed in November, that she was allegedly informed by teammates of an alleged conversation Fleming had with an opposing player, discussing a plan to have Slusser spiked in the face during a match.

Batie-Smoose reported those same allegations in a Title IX complaint against the school, and was later suspended and did not have her contract renewed in January. Batie-Smoose has since filed her own lawsuit against SJSU over her termination. 

The Mountain West commissioned a third-party investigation into the allegations against Fleming, and determined that sufficient evidence could not be found to assign discipline. 

Fox News Digital has reported extensively on the conditions of that investigation and its handling, prompting critical responses by the White House, U.S. Department of Justice and members of Congress.

EX-SJSU STAR BROOKE SLUSSER MAKES NEW ALLEGATIONS ABOUT PROBE INTO TRANS TEAMMATE'S ALLEGED PLOT TO HARM HER

In the waning weeks of the 2024 regular season, Slusser and 10 other plaintiffs in her lawsuit against the Mountain West filed a request for preliminary injunction to have Fleming be ruled ineligible to continue playing, and to have the forfeits to SJSU reversed. Federal Judge Kato Crews, appointed by former President Joe Biden, denied the request, keeping Slusser and Fleming on the court together for practice and games. 

Slusser and Fleming were ultimately named to the Mountain West all-conference team, as SJSU's only honorees. 

They finished the season with a 14-7 record, aided by six conference forfeits, then advanced to the Mountain West championship game after Boise State forfeited in the divisional round.

But they lost in the title game to Colorado State, three sets to one. The loss ensured that the Spartans wouldn't take their scandal into the NCAA tournament.

Slusser left campus shortly after that at the insistence of her parents. According to The New York Times, Fleming also resumed classes remotely the following semester from Virginia.

Slusser said she came close to returning to play NCAA beach volleyball this past spring, and even had discussions with coaches at other schools about recruitment. But she ultimately decided not to, and moved to North Carolina, where she has served as a youth volleyball coach. 

The U.S. Department of Education is currently investigating the university for potential Title IX violations related to its handling of Fleming.

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., comments on U.S. soldiers killed in Syria by an ISIS gunman and the potential extension of ACA subsidies on ‘Fox Report.'

The U.S. troops who were killed and injured in Saturday's ambush attack in Syria were members of the Iowa National Guard, a senior U.S. official told Fox News.

An ISIS gunman opened fire with an automatic weapon in the central Syrian town of Palmyra, killing two Iowa National Guard soldiers and an American civilian translator, the official said. 

Three additional U.S. soldiers were wounded in the attack.

Preliminary information suggests the attacker was once affiliated with the Syrian government forces and had been a low-level member of the Syrian Security Forces, before later becoming connected to ISIS, the official said. 

""He was not a part of the official delegation that was being escorted by the U.S. and Syrian troops,"" the official said. ""… This would not be considered a ‘green on blue' incident because the Syrian gunman was not part of the U.S./Syrian partnered delegation.""

Earlier Saturday, U.S. Central Command confirmed the deaths and injuries were a ""result of an ambush by a lone ISIS gunman in Syria.""

President Donald Trump warned that there will be ""very serious retaliation"" following the ambush.

""We mourn the loss of three Great American Patriots in Syria, two soldiers, and one Civilian Interpreter. Likewise, we pray for the three injured soldiers who, it has just been confirmed, are doing well,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia on Saturday after one of its engine's lost power.

United flight 803, which had 275 passengers and 15 crew members onboard, left Dulles for Tokyo's Haneda Airport at around 12:30 p.m. Shortly after takeoff, one of the Boeing jet's engine's failed and the plane circled in the air for over an hour until it safely returned to the airport.

No injuries were reported from the incident, but a brush fire was sparked near the Dulles runway by the plane's engine cover that blew off and fell to the ground. Smoke could be seen billowing into the air across the tarmac.

The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.

The engine failure on Flight 803 is the latest incident in a long year for air travel, particularly in airspace around Washington, D.C.

Back in January, an American Airlines flight and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter collided over the Potomac River, killing 67 people. Then, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended in November, resulted in staffing issues and lengthy delays at most major hubs.

The tragic crash in January has been brought back into the spotlight after the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act last weekend, the yearly bill to fund the Pentagon.

BOWSER AND NTSB CHAIRWOMAN RIP ‘SHAMEFUL' DC AIRSPACE PROVISION IN NDAA FOLLOWING POTOMAC CRASH

Included in the over 3,000-page bill is a provision that requires military aircraft operating training missions in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area to provide “warning of the proximity of such aircraft to nearby commercial aircraft in a manner compatible with the traffic alert and collision avoidance system of such commercial aircraft.”

It has recently been hit with backlash from the National Transportation Safety Board and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, as well as a bipartisan group of senators, who say it rolls back safety measures put in place after the Potomac crash.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

For humanities departments to continue to matter, they must challenge the modern world rather than accommodate it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Humanities departments seem to be in perpetual crisis. Fewer students are enrolling in them. The Trump administration is cutting their funding. Smartphones and social media are hastening the collapse of reading and attention spans, even among students at elite schools. Americans are becoming more skeptical about the economic value of any four-year degree, let alone one in comparative literature.

In answer to these and other challenges, many colleges are trying to make the humanities “relevant.” Some are accommodating reduced attention spans by assigning excerpts rather than books. Others are responding to financial anxieties by restructuring departments to emphasize their practicality (if they aren't eliminating programs altogether). But such adaptations and compromises only exacerbate perhaps the most insidious threat the humanities face, and one that's not often discussed.

Tyler Austin Harper: The humanities have sown the seeds of their own destruction

As a humanities professor myself, the biggest danger I see to the discipline is the growing perception, fueled by the ubiquity of large language models, that knowledge is cheap—a resource whose procurement ought to be easy and frictionless. The humanities, which value rigorous inquiry for its own sake, will always be at odds with a world that thinks this way; that's why relevance is a futile goal. For humanities departments to continue to matter, they must challenge the modern world rather than accommodate it. Indeed, the most useful lesson the humanities have to offer today is a profoundly countercultural one: Difficulty is good, an end in its own right.

For the past several years, I've had the pleasantly vague title “visiting professor of humanities” at Bard College, a small liberal-arts school in New York's Hudson Valley. Bard has given me a remit as simple as it is generous: to teach books and ideas I think are important. Every November, I submit course descriptions for two spring seminars—this year, one on Albert Camus and his influences, the other exploring the idea of the American dream through Black writers such as Frederick Douglass and James Baldwin. Within a few days of the courses being posted, prospective students start writing me to say how eager they are to immerse themselves in the texts. I've learned to relish their zeal, because I know it won't last.

When they start my class, many of my bright, self-selecting students appear to be unacquainted with the difficulty of close reading. By the end of the semester, only a fraction seem to have gotten through the texts and writing assignments without outsourcing at least some of their work to AI. In my course on Camus, most students will be able to remember the philosopher's famous injunction to imagine Sisyphus happy, but few will demonstrate mastery of the abstruse train of thought that led him to it. Not many are fully willing to try.

I began teaching in early 2023, two months after OpenAI released ChatGPT. It could generate some amusing parlor tricks—a personal favorite was interweaving Shakespearean sonnets with mid-'90s rap—but it wasn't good at much else. During my first semester, one or two students turned in writing that featured AI's distinct blend of fluency and superficiality, which was easy to detect.

Chatbots look very different today. As the technology has become more sophisticated, more of my students have tried to pass off AI-generated writing as their own. The craftier ones will use chatbots to come up with phrases or insights that they shape into their own prose. The work this yields is usually competent, making AI's influence difficult to spot, but not exceptional. If I have suspicions about a student's take-home essay—maybe it looks nothing like their in-class writing assignments—I run it through AI detectors. These are far from perfect, of course. But when they indicate the use of AI, I confront the student, and he or she almost always confesses. Still, in just three years, ChatGPT and its competitors have rendered take-home essays—what I consider the central exercise of humanistic learning—nearly useless to assign and almost impossible to assess.

More recently I've come to suspect that, in addition to using LLMs to ghostwrite papers, some of my students are relying on them to prepare for in-class discussion. At any rate, their contributions are getting blander and more interchangeable, less daring; eccentric or original observations are becoming rarer. If I'm right that AI is furnishing my students with talking points, then it has almost entirely eliminated the possibility that they arrive at some transformative insight on their own, which is what makes wrestling with words and ideas so joyful and fruitful in the first place.

Kwame Anthony Appiah: The age of de-skilling

Probing a text can be enjoyable but also tiring, even borderline painful. That's good. Exhausting our mental faculties, such as through deep reading or effortful writing, is what makes them more potent. Physical exercise works the same way. AI, by contrast, promises knowledge without effort, just as many people see in GLP-1 drugs the possibility of weight loss without willpower. Although both have legitimate uses, their widespread adoption has diminished our capacity to appreciate, let alone endure, the sustained and challenging work required to flourish beyond the level of simple appearance. Only through difficulty do we improve our powers of thought and perception, which we carry with us in every endeavor. This is the true source of the humanities' relevance.

Camus's great realization was that, in a meaningless world, we create our own meaning and quality through willed struggle—a lesson that AI threatens to obscure but the humanities are uniquely poised to teach. Sisyphus is assigned to roll his rock for eternity, Camus writes. Yet he can still be happy so long as, each time he comes to the bottom of the hill, he's the one who chooses to turn around and rise back up.

I'm used to responding to sudden tragedies, but not ones this personal.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

As a homeland-security expert, I often get unexpected calls telling me of some horrible mayhem. Typically these come from television producers or magazine editors who want to know how long I'll need to get ready and respond. But last night was different. The first call I received didn't come from a producer or editor but from my daughter, an alum of Brown University, where yesterday a shooter walked into a final-exam-review session, killed two students, and injured nine more. My daughter had heard from friends sheltering in place. A TV booker called two minutes later. Instead of saying hello, I responded, “I can be ready in 20.” An editor at this magazine emailed me soon after. I am used to this drill, but not one so personal.

People in my field cover what we sometimes call the “dead people” beat. That kind of humor may seem heartless, but sarcasm is how we deal with the horror of mass shootings, violence, and terrorism. My role is to provide, to the extent I can, some objective way to process the familiar but often inexplicable. If I seem unemotional on television, that is simply a skill honed from experience, not a reflection of what I'm feeling. I am angry—about America's inadequate gun laws, about the senseless ubiquity of “thoughts and prayers,” about the fact that each of my children had to graduate high school with more than a decade of experience with active-shooter drills.

I know Brown well. As an empty nester, I've begun to spend more time at my family's house in Rhode Island, not far from the university—though nothing is very far in America's smallest state, only 37 miles wide. No suspect has yet been identified, but authorities took a “person of interest” into custody this morning. When a reporter asked whether that person was the suspect, a law-enforcement official responded, “It's a small state. Put the dots together.”

I know the faculty member whose class was holding the review session that the shooter walked into. Some of my neighbors work for Brown, others for local media. Elected officials hang out at the bar down the street. I'm friends with the publisher of a local newspaper chain that is following the shooting. I started getting texts from these connections almost immediately after the shooting. People asked what I knew and where I was. Some, believing my eldest was still a student, asked whether she was okay.

The university remained under lockdown through the evening as the shooter remained at large. I was on air for much of the night, hearing unverified rumors from friends, neighbors, and a friend of a friend who works at a local hospital. Most of these people were well meaning. But journalists are the best purveyors of fact, particularly local ones, so on TV I stuck to what had been reported and verified. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, wisely warned people not to relate anything that authorities hadn't confirmed.

I've learned some tricks of the trade on the “dead people” beat. I keep sticky notes around my screen while I'm on air to ensure I pronounce the name of the affected city or town correctly and have a sense of its size and demographics. I do not repost statements or information from social media unless I know the news agency or reporter. I familiarize myself with key political players and law-enforcement leaders.

This time, however, I didn't need any of those tricks. I knew this one all too well.

As a woman in the security space, I tend to be the friend whom other mothers turn to when they're nervous. I'm used to it; I call my doctor friends when I have a medical question, after all. One mother I have known for decades very often worries about her children's safety, sometimes to excess, I have thought. I respond to her angst calmly, with statistics. Her son is at Brown now, though, and I was proved wrong. Is he accounted for? I texted her. He was, but I thought later what a strange and clinical phrase—accounted for—that was to use with a friend, as if her child were a number, as if I hadn't known her son from the day he was born.

Many observers will say that there is nothing new about what happened in Rhode Island this weekend, or that the fear faced by these students is felt every day by children in certain neighborhoods and countries. Sadly, they're not wrong. The reality is that we're all on the “dead people” beat now.

Secret parties, lavish buffets, and talks of annihilation at one of the largest AI-research conferences

In a small room in San Diego last week, a man in a black leather jacket explained to me how to save the world from destruction by AI. Max Tegmark, a notable figure in the AI-safety movement, believes that “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, could precipitate the end of human life. I was in town for NeurIPS, one of the largest AI-research conferences, and Tegmark had invited me, along with five other journalists, to a briefing on an AI-safety index that he would release the next day. No company scored better than a C+.

The threat of technological superintelligence is the stuff of science fiction, yet it has become a topic of serious discussion in the past few years. Despite the lack of clear definition—even OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has called AGI a “weakly defined term”—the idea that powerful AI contains an inherent threat to humanity has gained acceptance among respected cultural critics.

Granted, generative AI is a powerful technology that has already had a massive impact on our work and culture. But superintelligence has become one of several questionable narratives promoted by the AI industry, along with the ideas that AI learns like a human, that it has “emergent” capabilities, that “reasoning models” are actually reasoning, and that the technology will eventually improve itself.

I traveled to NeurIPS, held at the waterfront fortress that is the San Diego Convention Center, partly to understand how seriously these narratives are taken within the AI industry. Do AGI aspirations guide research and product development? When I asked Tegmark about this, he told me that the major AI companies were sincerely trying to build AGI, but his reasoning was unconvincing. “I know their founders,” he said. “And they've said so publicly.”

Parallel to the growth of fear and excitement about AI in the past decade, NeurIPS attendance has exploded, increasing from approximately 3,850 conference-goers in 2015 to 24,500 this year, according to organizers. The conference center's three main rooms each have the square footage of multiple blimp hangars. Speakers addressed audiences of thousands. “I do feel we're on a quest, and a quest should be for the holy grail,” Rich Sutton, the legendary computer scientist, proclaimed in a talk about superintelligence.

The conference's corporate sponsors had booths to promote their accomplishments and impress attendees with their R&D visions. There were companies you've heard of, such as Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, ByteDance, and Tesla, and ones you probably haven't, such as Runpod, Poolside, and Ollama. One company, Lambda, was advertising itself as the “Superintelligence Cloud.” A few of the big dogs were conspicuously absent from the exhibitor hall, namely OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. Consensus among the researchers I spoke with is that the cachet of these companies is already so great that setting up a booth would be pointless.

The conference is a primary battleground in AI's talent war. Much of the recruiting effort happens outside the conference center itself, at semisecret, invitation-only events in downtown San Diego. These events captured the ever-growing opulence of the industry. In a lounge hosted by the Laude Institute, an AI-development support group, a grad student told me about starting salaries at various AI companies of “a million, a million five,” of which a large portion was equity. The lounge was designed in the style of a VIP lounge at a music festival. It was, in fact, located at the top of the Hard Rock Hotel.

The place to be, if you could get in, was the party hosted by Cohere, a Canadian company that builds large language models. (Cohere is being sued for copyright and trademark infringement by a group of news publishers, including The Atlantic.) The party was held on the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier used in Operation Desert Storm, which is now docked in the San Diego harbor. The purpose, according to the event's sign-up page, was “to celebrate AI's potential to connect our world.”

With the help of a researcher friend, I secured an invite to a mixer hosted by the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, the world's first AI-focused university, named for the current UAE president. Earlier this year, MBZUAI established the Institute for Foundation Models, a research group in Silicon Valley. The event, held at a steak house, had an open buffet with oysters, king prawns, ceviche, and other treats. Upstairs, Meta was hosting its own mixer. According to rumor, some of the researchers downstairs were Meta employees hoping to be poached by the Institute for Foundation Models, which supposedly offered more enticing compensation packages.

Of 5,630 papers presented in the poster sessions at NeurIPS, only two mention AGI in their title. An informal survey of 115 researchers at the conference suggested that more than a quarter didn't even know what AGI stands for. At the same time, the idea of AGI, and its accompanying prestige, seemed at least partly responsible for the buffet. The amenities I encountered certainly weren't paid for by chatbot profits. OpenAI, for instance, reportedly expects its massive losses to continue until 2030. How much longer can the industry keep the ceviche coming? And what will happen to the economy, which many believe is propped up by the AI industry, when it stops?

In one of the keynote speeches, the sociologist and writer Zeynep Tufekci warned researchers that the idea of superintelligence was preventing them from understanding the technology they were building. The talk, titled “Are We Having the Wrong Nightmares About AI?,” mentioned several dangers posed by AI chatbots, including widespread addiction to chatbots and the undermining of methods for establishing truth. After Tufekci gave her talk, the first audience member to ask a question appeared annoyed. “Have you been following recent research?” the man asked. “Because that's the exact problems we're trying to fix. So we know of these concerns.” Tufekci responded, “I don't really see these discussions. I keep seeing people discuss mass unemployment versus human extinction.”

It struck me that both might be correct: that many AI developers are thinking about the technology's most tangible problems while public conversations about AI—including those among the most prominent developers themselves—are dominated by imagined ones. Even the conference's name contained a contradiction: The name “NeurIPS” is short for “Neural Information Processing Systems,” but artificial neural networks were conceived in the 1940s by a logician-and-neurophysiologist duo who wildly underestimated the complexity of biological neurons and overstated their similarity to a digital computer. Regardless, a central feature of AI's culture is an obsession with the idea that a computer is a mind. Anthropic and OpenAI have published reports with language about chatbots being, respectively, “unfaithful” and “dishonest.” In the AI discourse, science fiction often defeats science.

On the roof of the Hard Rock Hotel, I attended an interview with Yoshua Bengio, one of the three “godfathers” of AI. Bengio, a co-inventor of an algorithm that makes ChatGPT possible, recently started a nonprofit called LawZero to encourage the development of AI that is “safe by design.” He took the nonprofit's name from a law featured in several Isaac Asimov stories that states that a robot should not allow humans to be harmed. Bengio was concerned that, in a possible dystopian future, AIs might deceive their creators and that “those who will have very powerful AIs could misuse it for political advantage, in terms of influencing public opinion.”

I looked around to see if anyone else was troubled by the disconnect. Bengio did not mention how fake videos are already affecting public discourse. Neither did he meaningfully address the burgeoning chatbot mental-health crisis, or the pillaging of the arts and humanities. The catastrophic harms, in his view, are “three to 10 or 20 years” away. We still have time “to figure it out, technically.”

Bengio has written elsewhere about the more immediate dangers of AI. But the technical and speculative focus of his remarks captures the sentiment among technologists who now dominate the public conversation about our future. Ostensibly, they are trying to save us, but who actually benefits from their predictions? As I spoke with 25-year-olds entertaining seven-figure job offers and watched the industry's millionaire luminaries debate the dangers of superintelligence, the answer seemed clear.

A Hanukkah massacre of Australian Jews

It's long past time to stop saying “Anti-Semitic violence has no place in our society.” Outrage upon outrage confirms that anti-Semitic violence has a large and expanding place in Western societies—that it is supported by many, that it is tolerated by many more, and that it is often appeased or even enabled by governments fearful of confronting large and militant factions within their populations.

For months before today's mass killing on Sydney's Bondi Beach, Australia has been afflicted by repeated incidents of anti-Jewish harassment and intimidation. The outrages began just two days after the October 7 Hamas terror attacks in Israel, with a demonstration at the Sydney Opera House that included a chant of “Fuck the Jews.” Dozens more such demonstrations followed across the country.

Curses soon escalated into crimes. There was an arson attack on a synagogue and another at a day-care center. Protestors stormed into an Israeli restaurant, and police foiled a plot for mass bombings of Jewish targets.

In September, a social-media influencer carrying a Palestinian flag on horseback across Bondi Beach got off with a warning. “I cannot believe we can fine a cocker spaniel for being off leash, we can fine a restaurant owner for having a chair on a footpath, we can move people on for drinking in our public parks, but there is no power whatsoever for us to fine someone for riding a horse in an intimidating manner on a beach,” Waverley Councillor Steven Lewis said at the time.

The beach, which is proximate to a large Jewish community, has been repeatedly targeted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators, leading to counter-protests and clashes.

When people chant “intifada revolution,” they are revealing something important about their goals and methods. Yet in many Western countries, public authorities have been reluctant—or unwilling—to hear the message.

In August 2025, a pro-Palestinian activist assassinated two people in downtown Washington, D.C. “I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,” he told police according to his federal indictment. The same message appeared on a prescheduled post on his social-media accounts.

In October, two men were killed and three injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack directed against Yom Kippur worshippers in Manchester, England.

Yet there has remained, until now, terrible reluctance by Western governments to accept the appearance on their soil of deadly threats to their Jewish citizens from people motivated by anti-Israel ideology. Those movements have progressively tested what used to be red lines: blocking access to synagogues, for example, as happened in recent weeks in Los Angeles and New York City. (In New York, the incident drew a statement from Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani that apportioned blame to both the protesters and the synagogue itself.)

After the mass killing in Sydney, facing reality is not merely urgent—it's inescapable. Symbolic violence is a rehearsal for actual violence. Many in the Western world have interpreted post–October 7 anti-Israel actions within the framework of free speech. Ten days after the terror attacks, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education posted a statement: “Let every participant in the debate over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict show their cards, even those with the most extreme views. And let others marshal arguments and evidence to refute or discredit those views.”

But what if the “extreme view” in question is that Jews should be made to fear death, and the best way to spread that fear is by killing them? How do you marshal arguments and evidence against that proposition? In a 2021 essay, the prominent anti-Israel academic Steve Salaita rejected those who “speak of rights and democracy and civil liberties and then superimpose those categories onto Palestine. It doesn't occur to them that Palestine has its own vocabularies of freedom worth forcing into the American conversation.”

It is helpful to possess a lexicon of what is typically intended by these vocabularies. Armed struggle means shooting people or blowing them up with bombs. By any means necessary means targeting the most defenseless: children, the elderly, other civilians. Globalize the intifada means shooting or bombing people in Sydney, London, Paris, Toronto, Los Angeles, and New York City, as well as in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. From the river to the sea means the annihilation of a sovereign democratic state and the mass murder, expulsion, and enslavement of much of its population.

Of course, there is the irony that the one place on Earth where Jews most resolutely meet such threats is precisely the same State of Israel marked for annihilation by its enemies. The more dangerous the anti-Israel movement makes the diaspora for Jews, the more Jews will leave the diaspora for the state that exists to protect them.

People who dress up like Hamas terrorists and brandish their insignia and chant their slogans are not merely opining. They are propagating, recruiting, and inciting the actions they believe in.

Among Western liberals is a strong impulse to show respect to people from other cultures—or who hold other beliefs—by interpreting their words and actions in the most benign way. But sometimes the way to show the deepest respect is by taking people seriously, believing their words as they are spoken, heeding their own accounts of their intentions.

The massacre on Bondi Beach is an ultimate consequence of this well-meaning condescension, but there were a lot of stops along the way—and more ahead.

The genius of Problemista, folktronica music, and more culture and entertainment recommendations

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Álex Maroño Porto, an associate editor who has written about becoming a different person after learning English.

Álex recommends watching Problemista, a surrealist film featuring an aspiring toy designer and an art critic with a cryogenically frozen husband. He also enjoys listening to folktronica music, reading Joan Didion, and spending time with Sandra Blow's photography.

— Stephanie Bai, associate editor

Something I recently rewatched: A few months ago, a friend of mine got sucked into the endless vortex of looking at streaming options. After he'd spent a while fumbling with the remote, I tried to rescue him—and the evening—by proposing Problemista. Julio Torres's 2024 directorial feature-film debut is an absurdist take on the seemingly infinite steps needed for Alejandro, a young Salvadorian man in Brooklyn, to fulfil his American dream: getting a job at Hasbro. Early in the film, Tilda Swinton enters as Elizabeth, an unhinged art critic who could possibly solve all of Alejandro's problems by sponsoring his visa. Craigslist makes a cameo embodied as a glitchy siren of sorts, and Isabella Rossellini's soothing voice threads together the narrative, which stretches like the Penrose stairs as Alejandro navigates the fractured immigration system.



Best novel I've recently read, and the best work of nonfiction: Bad Habit, a coming-of-age debut by Alana S. Portero, is the type of book you wish you'd discovered as a teenager. Beginning in 1980s Spain, it chronicles the story of a young girl who navigates her trans identity while living in a working-class neighborhood in Madrid. The novel is an ode to the mundane actions that trigger change in the outskirts of society: bringing a plate of garlic mushrooms to a person in need, talking to an old neighbor who is derided because of her appearance. “Women who live the way they want, who age on their own terms and wear their lives etched into their faces, are treated with pathos and mockery because they are feared,” Portero writes.



I first read Slouching Towards Bethlehem in 2020 while confined in my grandmother's house in Irixoa, a village in rural Galicia. Didion's essays about a country in apparent collapse may not have been the ideal respite during the pandemic, but she proved to be an invaluable companion on my writing journey. Her style hovers between detachment and self-involvement; in Slouching, every word falls in the right place as she observes the forces shaping the culture of the '60s. It's not an easy task to maintain such balance—for some writers, that center doesn't seem to be holding. [Related: Joan Didion's magic trick]



A musical artist who means a lot to me: Alejandro Guillén's musical project, Baiuca, feels as if a group of cantareiras—Galician female folk singers—stormed a rave with tassel-covered bagpipes and tambourines, ready to fill the air with their high-pitched clamor. Guillén experiments with “folktronica,” a genre that blends traditional folk sounds with electronica beats; I recommend “Morriña,” a song that conveys the longing for one's home, and “Veleno”—featuring the folktronica artist Rodrigo Cuevas—which has an infectious dose of magical realism. (Other folktronica singers include Omar Souleyman and Chancha Vía Circuito.) When I first heard Baiuca play during Madrid's San Isidro festivities in 2019, I connected with a part of my culture that I hadn't known existed: Baiuca's songs taught me about the traditional Galician folk music passed down by generations of women who sang by the hearth.



A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: “White Ferrari,” by Frank Ocean, a song for an overcast morning when time appears to stand still. By the time I hear the glitch before he sings, “I'm sure we're taller in another dimension,” I want to replay it right away—or queue “Lost” next.



When I need immediate energy, I play “escucha,” by friedplatano. It never fails to drag me out of bed.



The last culture thing that made me cry: If I held back tears watching I'm Still Here, it's because I didn't deserve to cry as much as Eunice did. Played by Fernanda Torres, Eunice is a mother trying to shield her family from the ugly realities of fighting against an authoritarian state that kidnapped her husband. Torres commands the film, showing the gradual breakdown of normalcy, and how the arrival of a car in broad daylight can suddenly shatter everything. [Related: A horrifying true story, told through mundane details]



The last museum show that I loved: Two weeks ago, I discovered the transgressive beauty of Sandra Blow's vision in “Lines of Belonging,” the latest exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art's New Photography series. Her art chronicles the underground queer communities of Mexico City while redefining Catholic symbolism, imbuing her subjects with a delicate light that elevates them to the status of religious idols. The sheer intimacy of her pictures and the warm colors reminded me of Clifford Prince King, another queer photographer with a distinctive gaze.



A favorite story I've read in The Atlantic: In 2020, trapped at home and jobless, I started a document with articles that I wanted to revisit. Something I've always admired about The Atlantic is how its writers can identify a particular social phenomenon and explain the forces behind its rise, as well as its cultural effects. Spencer Kornhaber's “The Lady Gaga Anthem That Previewed a Decade of Culture Wars” was one of those stories: He places Gaga's art within the political debates of the 2010s, exposing the flaws in her attempt at broad intersectionality and analyzing the limits of celebrity's political aims. At least she fared better than Katy Perry.

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

The Week Ahead

Essay

The New Allowance

By Michael Waters

Around the 1920s, a certain class of parents—those with enough money to indulge their kids from time to time—started to panic. Toy companies and trinket manufacturers were buffeting kids with ads, and children were pestering their parents for gifts. Many parents wanted their kids to have these new luxuries, but they also wanted them to understand that money had limits.

Parenting magazines suggested an intervention: small weekly payments, called allowances, that kids could squirrel away and use to buy toys or other treats on their own. The hope was that these payments would teach children to save rather than spend. But not everyone was a fan of the idea.

You were told you'd change the world. But there's a better way to think about your potential.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism — the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity:

I've worked in communications for the past decade helping get important ideas out to the public. I'm good at what I do and I think it's useful, but I don't really feel like I'm having a grand impact on the world.

Meanwhile, some of my friends have built their entire careers around the goal of having the biggest positive impact possible. They're busy pulling big levers — doing global health work that saves lives, shaping federal policy that protects the environment, etc. I feel like my contribution is tiny in comparison.

I know life's not a competition, but I grew up being told I was smart and had so much potential to change the world, and I worry I'm not living up to that. On the other hand, I also value work-life balance and relationships and experiences outside of work. Should I consider switching careers to something more impactful? Do I need to have an extraordinary career, or is it okay to just do an average amount of good and live a small(ish) life?

Dear Impact-Minded,

How do you feel about the fact that you're going to die one day?

That might sound like a weird place to start, but I ask because I think fear of our mortality is what drives a lot of our modern quest for extraordinary careers.

In fact, the American anthropologist Ernest Becker argued in his 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, The Denial of Death, that one of the main functions of culture is to offer effective ways to manage the terror of knowing that we're going to die and eventually be forgotten.

The prospect of absolute annihilation is so terror-inducing, Becker argues, that we come up with all sorts of ways to convince ourselves we can achieve immortality. In the pre-modern era, most people looked to religion for this. It promised us literal immortality, in the form of an eternal soul that could enjoy a happy afterlife in heaven, or maybe a nice reincarnation here on Earth.

In the modern era, as religion's dominance waned, we've had to come up with new types of “symbolic immortality.” That can come in the form of publishing an autobiography, being part of a great nation, or — especially popular starting in the 18th century — achieving social progress “at scale.” As the Industrial Revolution propelled globalization and it became possible to think about affecting people halfway around the world, utilitarian philosophers argued that our actions are good to the extent that they create “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.”

The idea that we could use our working lives to maximize the good gave people a new way to be extraordinary and thus achieve a lasting legacy — that is, a sense of immortality. By belonging to the grand project of social progress, we could live on well past our physical death.

On the one hand, the tacit promise is comforting: If we all chase these superlative lives, we can participate in the great forever! But on the other hand, it creates a crushing amount of pressure: There's a sense that you need to be engaged in a maximally heroic quest — otherwise your life is basically meaningless.

Not everyone, however, sees things this way.

For an alternative, consider Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Born in France in 1873, she only lived to the age of 24, and the last nine years of her life were spent cloistered in a convent. She was an extremely pious young woman who prioritized kindness. But she was acutely aware of her own imperfections and limitations. She didn't believe she was a great soul capable of great, heroic deeds. She definitely didn't think her vocation was to have a positive impact “at scale.”

Instead, she developed a very different approach to goodness, which she called her “Little Way.” It wasn't about trying to reach a wide swath of people. It was about trying to go deep on little, daily actions, infusing every glance and word with the purest love.

When the other nuns in the convent annoyingly interrupted her with chit-chat while she was trying to write, she made sure “to appear happy and especially to be so.” When one made exasperating clicking noises during prayers, she worked so hard to conquer her irritability that she broke into a sweat. She made lots of sacrifices lovingly, and trusted that through that, she could achieve holiness — and, yes, eternal life.

Saint Thérèse compared people to flowers. Although most people want to be a big, showy flower like a rose or lily, she wrote, she was content to be a little flower at the feet of Jesus:

If all the lowly flowers wished to be roses, nature would lose its springtide beauty, and the fields would no longer be enamelled with lovely hues. And so it is in the world of souls, Our Lord's living garden. He has been pleased to create great Saints who may be compared to the lily and the rose, but He has also created lesser ones, who must be content to be daisies or simple violets flowering at His Feet.

Saint Thérèse became known as the Little Flower. After she died of tuberculosis, her spiritual memoir grew famous. People fell in love with her theology of the Little Way, and she ended up being one of the most popular saints in Catholic history.

I suspect she struck a chord with people because she offered them a strong counterpoint to the idea, which was gaining traction at the time, that it's not enough to do good — we have to do the most good possible.

But, personally, I'm satisfied neither by the utilitarian perspective nor by Saint Thérèse's perspective. Both are extremes: one says “you absolutely must do the most good,” and the other says “don't even bother trying to help more people — just give the few people in your cloister the deepest love possible.”

Yet it's a feature of our modern life that the fortunate among us have the capacity to go both wide and deep — to consider both scale and other dimensions of value. People who go all-in on just one of these tend to feel regret, whether it's the effective altruist who's so focused on helping at scale that he ignores everything else or the monk who spends decades in deep contemplation but doesn't do a thing to help others.

So, when you consider your own potential, I'd encourage you to consider the full picture. I don't think you should obsess over finding a career that'll allow you to do “the most good.” But doing “more good”? Sure! If you can find a job like that, why not?

But as you look around to see whether there's a job where you could have a bigger positive impact, you have to be mindful of a few things. For one, there are many different kinds of “good,” and you can't always run an apples-to-apples comparison between them. (Is your current job doing more or less good than, say, being a journalist or an educator? Hard to say.) Also, there's more to life than just “doing good” — a life well lived includes reveling in other precious things, like art or relationships, so you don't want a job that'll bar you from that. Plus, you don't want a job that'll be unsustainable for your physical or mental wellbeing or that'll wreck your integrity by contravening other values you believe in.

Ultimately, what'll probably work best is settling on a career that lets you achieve a decent balance among multiple criteria: doing substantial good, allowing for a pluralistic enjoyment of all life's riches, feeling sustainable, and fitting with your values. (And after scanning the landscape, you just might find that the best career for you overall is the one you've already got!)

You'll notice that this doesn't sound as “grand” as either the utilitarian recommendation or the Saint Thérèse recommendation. But that's the point: Those are extreme visions of life, and if you ask me, they're not even really about life at all. They're about death and achieving a legacy that you think will earn you a kind of eternal life after death. The assumption is that you need to do something “grand” in order to make your time on Earth not worthless.

There's a radically different starting assumption available to you: What if life is just a gift, and the time you have on this mysterious, weird, wondrous Earth is inherently precious, even if it's temporary? When you get a gift — like, say, a box of candy — the point is not to try to make it last forever. The point is to appreciate the candy! To savor it yourself, and also savor the pleasure of sharing it with others.

If we embrace this view, then we don't feel like we need to do something grand or extraordinary. Life is extraordinary, and living it well means relishing all the goods it offers us — and extending those goods to other beings so they can relish them too. Not out of fear that we'll be worthless and forgettable otherwise, but simply because we realize we've been given talents and resources and, feeling grateful for them, we naturally want to share those gifts with others.

If Elon Musk and Sam Altman like each other, they hide it well.

While they cofounded OpenAI together back in 2015, the partnership has frayed spectacularly since. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and later founded rival startup, xAI. He or his company, xAI, has filed multiple lawsuits against OpenAI, and the two have traded public barbs.

In the latest turn in the rivalry, they are battling over the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable private companies.

OpenAI held a secondary share sale in October that valued it at $500 billion, taking the lead from Musk's SpaceX by a cool $100 billion.

Not one to cede ground to a rival, Musk is now planning his own secondary share sale at SpaceX, according to an internal letter to employees seen by multiple outlets. It would value the company at a whopping $800 billion. If that happens soon, it means Musk would have only let Altman hold the mantle for a couple of months.

Musk also confirmed on X this week that the company is exploring a blockbuster initial public offering, which might be the only way OpenAI can regain its lead as the top private company. OpenAI this year restructured its business, which would allow it to also pursue its own eye-watering IPO in the future.

While this valuation battle between the two billionaires is maybe cringeworthy theater for the average earner, it underscores a significant shift: investors are pouring unprecedented money into technologies once viewed as speculative science projects.

SpaceX, which aims to make life multi-planetary and colonize Mars, and OpenAI, which seeks to develop a theoretical AI that can reason like humans, are two of the most visible examples, but they are part of a broader surge in frontier-tech valuations. AI, robotics, and defense tech startups have all notched multibillion-dollar valuations in the past year — bubble be damned.

If all you want for Christmas is a job, don't let the holiday fanfare slow down your search.

Recruiters and hiring managers say a common misconception is that employers pause interviewing at the end of the year because decision-makers are all on vacation. In reality, they say hiring activity tends to hold steady, and in some cases, managers are pressed to fill openings before their talent-acquisition budgets reset in January.

They need to ""use it or lose it,"" said Nicole Fernandez-Valle, lead talent acquisition partner at Miami-based Royal Caribbean Group. ""This is still a pretty hardworking time for our recruitment teams.""

Brian Fink, an independent recruiter in Georgia, said he's helping an AI startup in Atlanta find two managers and six software engineers to bring on board before 2025 comes to a close.

""Employers want to start 2026 ready,"" said Fink. ""They don't want to start recruiting in January. They want to start running a race.""

While other job seekers put their searches on hold, take advantage of the lighter competition to submit applications, said Aaron Roberts, a hiring manager at commercial real-estate company JLL. He has more than 50 openings he's looking to fill in California, including ones for administrative assistants, facilities managers, and producers. He anticipates filling at least a third by New Year's.

""You might miss an opportunity if you put your job hunt on hold,"" he said. ""Keep going.""

Roberts knows from personal experience. He applied for his current position as vice president of operations at JLL just before Thanksgiving in 2019 and did several rounds of interviews in December that year. The last one took place five days before Christmas.

Since people tend to be jollier around the holidays, it's a good time to reach out to folks who could potentially help with your job search, said Julia Levy, an independent talent-acquisition executive in Memphis and author of ""From Hi to Hired: Your Insider Guide to Internships."" They'll be more likely to take your call, she said.

By contrast, if you hold off networking until January, your odds of getting a meaningful response — or any at all — will be slimmer since this is when people tend to be busy starting new projects, Levy said.

Competition for jobs will also likely intensify in January, she added. People who put off their searches for the holidays return, and those resolving to find a new job in the new year enter the market, Levy said.

Job hunting during the winter holidays can be more mentally challenging than at any other time of year. Your family and friends may be shopping for gifts, decorating the house, and baking sweet treats, while you're still at a computer searching for newly posted job listings.

And if you're a parent, your kids are likely off from school and may be eager for your attention.

""It's so hard,"" said Helene Vo, a career strategist in Los Angeles. ""You're almost going against the grain of what the holidays are about.""

But this is also why competition for jobs dies down — and why it can pay off to stick with your search routine. When you're used to applying to five or six jobs a day, ""it's much easier to override"" all of the holiday hoopla around you, Vo said.

The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join NATO as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia's war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.

Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the U.S., European, and other partners' security guarantees, instead of NATO membership, were a compromise on Ukraine's side.

""From the very beginning, Ukraine's desire was to join NATO, these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,"" he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.

""Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US, and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries — Canada, Japan — are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,"" Zelenskyy said.

""And it is already a compromise from our part,"" he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its NATO ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10% of Donbas, which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no NATO troops can be stationed in Ukraine.

Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a ""written"" pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the U.S.-led NATO alliance eastwards — shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.

Zelenskyy had earlier called for a ""dignified"" peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again as he prepared to meet U.S. envoys and European allies in Berlin to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.

Under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow's demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine's power and water supplies.

Although the exact make-up of the meetings on Sunday and Monday has not been made public, a U.S. official said Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were travelling to Germany for talks involving Ukrainians and Europeans.

The choice to send Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a U.S. peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia's 2022 invasion.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine, the Europeans, and the U.S. are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this, there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia.

Zelenskyy said a ceasefire along the current front lines would be a fair option.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is hosting Zelenskyy and European leaders for a summit in the German capital on Monday, the latest in a series of public shows of support for the Ukrainian leader from allies across Europe.

Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the U.S. proposals, which, in a draft disclosed last month, called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its ambition to join NATO and accept limits on its armed forces.

European allies have described this as a ""critical moment"" that could shape Ukraine's future, and sought to shore up Kyiv's finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv's military and civilian budget.

Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as ""constructive,"" although no major breakthroughs were reached.

Zelenskyy said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across swathes of Ukraine, posting pictures of burning and destroyed buildings.

""Russia is dragging out the war and seeks to inflict as much harm as possible on our people,"" he said.

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from NATO and European leaders that Putin would not stop there.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that NATO should be ""prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured"" and asserted that ""we are Russia's next target.""

The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed such claims.

""This seems like a statement by a representative of a generation that has managed to forget what World War Two was actually like,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday.

""They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr. Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,"" Peskov added.

Between long office days, late dinners and endless to-dos, many working couples slip into a routine of coexisting instead of really connecting. The excuses feel valid: ""We're exhausted,"" or, ""We'll catch up this weekend."" The problem is that they both end up missing the everyday moments that keep a relationship alive.

As a psychologist who studies couples and as a husband, I've found that people in the happiest, most resilient relationships treat their weeknights as opportunities that don't go wasted.

Here are the seven things these couples consistently do before bedtime.

You can't always expect your partner to walk through the door ready to cook, talk, or be cheerful. Healthy couples build in 15 to 30 minutes of guilt-free alone time for each partner — one decompresses while the other handles a light task, then they switch.

It's not glamorous, but it's a huge kindness. By protecting each other's battery early in the evening, they preserve the bandwidth they'll need to connect later on.

Some nights, even after a decompression session, you may still feel drained. Happy couples don't force it. They start their evening together, but quietly: sitting on the balcony, lying side by side, taking a slow walk.

In psychological research, this is a form of co-regulation: the process of two people syncing up emotionally, allowing the emotions of the day to rise and fall until they feel like themselves again. A few minutes of shared quiet can reset your rhythm better than a forced conversation.

Not every weeknight has room for deep emotional check-ins. So the happiest couples keep it simple: each person shares one thing about their day, good or bad. 

It could be venting some frustration, sharing a little win they had at the office or even just something funny that happened. No advice. No solutions. Just listening. This light, consistent sharing keeps them emotionally updated without draining what's left of their workweek energy.

Even on nights when both partners want to zone out, they stick to one small shared ritual they never skip. 

For most, it's something ridiculously simple: eating dinner together without their phones, making a nightly cup of tea, or doing a word game together. The ritual becomes a daily anchor — something predictable, comforting, and theirs alone.

If I had to choose just one nightly habit to keep, this would be it. Research shows that partners who cuddle regularly report higher relationship satisfaction and commitment, even compared with couples who emphasize ""quality time"" together.

Cuddling triggers oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and lowers cortisol (the stress hormone). It's the easiest, fastest biological boost your relationship can get.

Even the happiest couples feel the low-level resentment of uneven household work. That's why they end the evening with 5 to 10 minutes of shared tidying, wiping counters, packing tomorrow's lunches, loading the dishwasher.

The point isn't actually about cleaning, but rather to prove that they're committed to keeping things fair.

Instead of rehashing the day, heathy and happy couples look ahead. They share one small thing they're looking forward to tomorrow, or even one small thing they're dreading.

This is a brief, gentle way for working couples to stay in sync without needing to fully rehash the emotional weight of their day. You get a sense of what your partner might need tomorrow, whether it's encouragement, space, or just a little extra support. And they get the same from you.

At least 12 people were killed and almost 30 wounded when gunmen fired on a Jewish holiday event at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday in what Australian police and officials described as a terrorist attack.

One suspected gunman was killed and another was in a critical condition, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference. At least 29 people injured, including two police officers, were taken to the hospital, he said.

Police were investigating whether a third gunman was involved in the shooting, and a bomb-disposal unit was working on several suspected improvised explosive devices, Lanyon said.

Mike Burgess, a top Australian intelligence official, said one of the suspected attackers was known to authorities but had not been deemed an immediate threat.

Sunday's shootings were the most serious of a string of antisemitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023.

Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world's safest countries. Sunday's attack was the worst such incident in the country since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at a tourist site in the southern state of Tasmania.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese convened a meeting of the country's national security council and condemned the attack, saying the evil that was unleashed was ""beyond comprehension.""

""This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,"" he said. ""At this dark moment for our nation, our police and security agencies are working to determine anyone associated with this outrage.""

Witnesses said the shooting at the famed beach on a hot summer's evening lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets and parks. Police said around 1,000 people had attended the Hanukkah event alone.

""I was just getting ready to go home, and, like, I was packing my bag, got my flip-flops, was ready to catch my bus, and then I started hearing the shots,"" said Bondi Junction resident Marcos Carvalho, 38.

""We all panicked and started running as well. So we left everything behind, like flip-flops, everything. We just ran through the hill,"" he said. ""I must have heard, I don't know, maybe, like, 40, 50 shots.""

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by ""vile terrorists"".

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting and that Australia's government must ""come to its senses"" after countless warnings.

""These are the results of the antisemitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the antisemitic and inciting calls of 'Globalise the Intifada' that were realised today.""

One of the world's most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists.

""If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it's something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It's a horrific thing,"" Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.

Bondi resident Grace Mathew said she saw people running past her and heard gunshots.

""Initially you just think, it's a beautiful day down by the beach,"" she said. ""You sort of think that people are just having a good time. Then more people ran past and said there's a shooter, there's a mass shooting and they're killing people.""

Muslim groups condemned the shooting.

""These acts of violence and crimes have no place in our society. Those responsible must be held fully accountable and face the full force of the law,"" the Australian National Imams Council, the Council of Imams NSW and the Australian Muslim community said in a statement.

""Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all those who witnessed or were affected by this deeply traumatic attack.""

Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard. One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled the weapon off him. Another man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge.

Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters confirmed the videos from verified corroborating footage showing the same men.

The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff.

""Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,"" said Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia's opposition Liberal Party.

President Donald Trump's verdict on Europe: a ""decaying"" group of nations led by ""weak"" people. 

His criticism in a recent Politico interview adds to a tough period for the bloc, with challenges on multiple fronts testing European leaders in the final weeks of the year. 

Next week looks set to be critical, with a high-stakes summit in Brussels and the European Central Bank's final policy meeting of the year. Let's take a look at some of the key topics for next week: 

At the summit in Brussels on Thursday (and possibly extending into Friday), European leaders are expected to address the most pressing challenge — how to sharpen military capabilities and support the funding of the war in Ukraine. 

Key to this is an agreement on how to use billions of frozen Russian assets to underpin a 210-billion-euro loan ($246 billion) to Kyiv. Defending Ukraine's borders as part of any peace agreement will also remain critical, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposing a vote or referendum within Ukraine on whether to allow parts of the Donbas region to be ceded to Russia as part of the U.S. peace plan. 

Tensions between the White House and Europe following Trump's comments will only challenge this process, with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte issuing a stark warning this week that ""we [Europe] are Russia's next target, and we are already in harm's way.""

Another fractious front for Europe is the Big Tech space. The bloc has been heavily criticized by the Trump administration for its targeting of American tech giants. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said he was ""disappointed"" by the EU's use of the Digital Services Act, despite agreeing to ""fair treatment"" of U.S. digital giants as part of the July trade agreement. 

The bloc has issued fines to X for violating content-moderation laws, and put Google under an antitrust investigation for its use of content to inform its AI models. Meanwhile, Meta has offered to make changes to its Facebook and Instagram services to avoid further investigation and fines from the EU. 

There is a bright spot for Europe this week. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday for its final policy-setting meeting of the year. Speaking to the Financial Times, ECB President Christine Lagarde said the central bank was likely to lift its growth forecasts again in December, after raising its prediction for annual GDP growth to 1.2% back in September. 

Broad consensus is that this improved outlook will also support the central bank's decision to keep rates on hold at 2% for another month. Throughout December, ECB board members themselves have reinforced this messaging:

Isabel Schnabel: rates unlikely to change soon

Francois Villeroy de Galhau: no reason to raise rates soon

Gediminas Simkus: no need for change to rates

Joachim Nagel: rates are currently in a good place

Monday: EU foreign affairs council meeting

Tuesday: EU general affairs council meeting

Wednesday: EU inflation data, UK inflation data, German IFO index

Thursday: EU leaders summit, ECB meeting, BOE meeting, Riksbank meeting, Norges bank meeting

Friday: EU leaders summit may continue

In this article

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut key interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering borrowing costs for the third time in 2025. Given the lower interest rate backdrop (which reduces the appeal of fixed-income investments) and a volatile stock market, some investors might want to consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income and enhance overall returns.

The stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend-paying companies.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. 

This week's first dividend pick is Devon Energy (DVN), an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company. In the third quarter of 2025, Devon returned $401 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's fixed quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share (annualized dividend of $0.96 per share) indicates a yield of 2.5%.

Recently, JP Morgan analyst Arun Jayaram upgraded Devon Energy stock to buy from hold, though he lowered the price target to $44 from $49. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on DVN stock with a price target of $43.

Jayaram explained that his rating upgrade was based on DVN's compelling valuation compared to its peers, supported by free cash flow gains from the company's $1 billion business optimization plan. The 5 star analyst noted that Devon achieved about 60% of its $1 billion goal in a little over half a year following the plan's formal rollout.

The analyst noted that Devon's Delaware Basin well productivity was adversely impacted by the company's focus on completing a higher proportion of Wolfcamp B wells. That said, Jayaram expects well productivity to be stable in 2026 and 2027 due to a ""steadier mix of secondary zones"" compared to 2025.

Overall, Jayaram is bullish on Devon, given that it has a top-quality acreage position in the most important parts of the Delaware Basin, Bakken, and Eagle Ford shale regions. Moreover, the company has the option to expand in the STACK and Powder River Basins.

""We believe DVN's core franchise assets have the potential to provide a large inventory of lower-risk, high rate-of-return development drilling opportunities that are critical given the depleting nature of an E&P's asset base,"" said Jayaram.

Jayaram ranks No. 655 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%. See Devon Energy Statistics on TipRanks. 

The next dividend-paying stock is EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company with reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. In the third quarter of 2025, EOG paid $545 million in regular dividends and repurchased shares worth $440 million. Last month, EOG announced a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share, payable on January 30, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $4.08, EOG's yield stands at 3.7%.

Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The stock also scores an ""outperform"" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst, with a price target of $127.

Sorbara views EOG as a ""premier"" large-cap company with the ability to navigate through commodity cycles, supported by its solid balance sheet and strong inventory. The analyst also noted the company's massive free cash flow-generating capabilities.

Notably, Sorbara highlighted EOG's commitment to return at least 70% of its free cash flow to shareholders annually through dividends and share buybacks. In fact, the energy company has the flexibility to return 100% of free cash flow based on its balance sheet strength.

The 5-star analyst also noted EOG's efforts to leverage advanced technology to capture further opportunities in the Delaware Basin, with the company now identifying more than nine different development targets. Among other positives, Sorbara also mentioned that EOG is tracking ahead of its target for the first year with regard to the $150 million synergies from its Encino acquisition. More savings are expected from factors like improved infrastructure, production efficiency, and marketing deals through EOG's midstream network.

Sorbara ranks No. 225 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.4%. See EOG Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks. 

Finally, let's look at pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS). The company's turnaround efforts are helping it drive improved performance in a challenging business backdrop. At its Investor Day event on December 9, CVS Health provided positive updates and stated that it expects to achieve a mid-teens adjusted earnings per share (EPS) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2028. At a quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share (annualized dividend of $2.66 per share), CVS stock offers a yield of 3.4%.

Following Investor Day, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes reiterated a Buy rating on CVS stock and raised her price target to $95 from $88. ""CVS is our top pick in our coverage universe,"" said the 5-star analyst, and cited structural improvement in retail earnings forecast as the reason for her revised price target. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on CVS with a price target of $81.

Hynes noted that CVS' mid-teens adjusted EPS CAGR target does not take into account any additional share buybacks, which she expects to take place once the company achieves its leverage targets, possibly by the end of next year.

The analyst also highlighted the company's efforts to improve margins of the Healthcare Benefits (HCB) segment, which has been under pressure due to a continued rise in the medical loss ratio (MLR). This ratio is expected to decline by about 50 basis points in 2026 due to better pricing, reduced benefits under Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, and the company's decision to exit the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX) business.

Hynes also noted the improvement in CVS' Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness (PCW) segment outlook, with the company now expecting flat adjusted operating income growth compared to the previous guidance of a mid-single-digit decline. This improvement is driven by market share gains, a better reimbursement backdrop, and cost savings.

Hynes ranks No. 733 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See CVS Health Options Activity on TipRanks.

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy (MSTR) has had a rough stretch, with the stock down around 21% over the past month and nearly 47% in the past 3 months, prompting fresh questions about valuation and Bitcoin exposure.

See our latest analysis for Strategy.

The latest slide, including a 1 day share price return of minus 3.7 percent and a year to date share price return of roughly minus 41 percent, suggests momentum is clearly fading even after an exceptional 3 year total shareholder return above 900 percent.

If Bitcoin volatility and Strategy's sharp moves have you rethinking concentration risk, it could be worth scanning fast growing stocks with high insider ownership for other high conviction ideas with strong insider alignment.

With Strategy trading more than 40 percent below its year-to-date level, yet still closely linked to Bitcoin sentiment, the key question now is whether investors are looking at a rare mispricing or a market that is already discounting future upside.

At a last close of $176.45 versus a narrative fair value of $663, the gap is striking and hinges on Strategy's extreme Bitcoin leverage and capital plans.

Assuming Bitcoin appreciates to $300,000 within the next few years, and MSTR partially executes the 21/21 plan, MicroStrategy's fair value could reach $663 per share, with the potential for higher prices during speculative peaks.

Read the complete narrative.

According to BlackGoat, this valuation leans on aggressive earnings expansion powered by explosive Bitcoin price assumptions, growing treasury holdings, and rich profit margins that reshape Strategy's long term earnings base.

Want to see what happens when rapid earnings growth, expanding Bitcoin reserves, and a premium profit multiple all collide in one model? The full narrative unpacks the bold assumptions step by step and shows how they build to that eye catching fair value.

Result: Fair Value of $663 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, this upside case still hinges on fraught assumptions, with Bitcoin volatility and potential NAV premium compression both capable of rapidly unwinding that seemingly large discount.

Written by Oluwapelumi Adejumo

Edited by Mohammad Shahid

Ethereum consensus client Prysm said validators missed out on 382 ETH, equivalent to more than $1 million, after a software bug triggered network disruptions shortly after the recent Fusaka upgrade.

The incident, detailed in a post-mortem titled “Fusaka Mainnet Prysm incident,” stemmed from a resource exhaustion event that affected nearly all Prysm nodes and led to missed blocks and attestations.

According to Offchain Labs, the developer behind Prysm, the problem emerged on December 4 when a previously introduced bug caused delays in validator requests.

Those delays resulted in missed blocks and attestations across the network.

“Prysm beacon nodes received attestations from nodes that were possibly out of sync with the network. These attestations referenced a block root from the previous epoch,” the project explained.

The disruption led to 41 missed epochs, with 248 blocks missing out of 1,344 available slots. That represented an 18.5% missed slot rate and pushed overall network participation down to 75% during the incident.

Offchain Labs said the bug responsible for the behavior was introduced and deployed to testnets about a month earlier, before being triggered on mainnet following the Fusaka upgrade. 

While a temporary mitigation reduced the immediate impact, Prysm said it has since implemented permanent changes to its attestation validation logic to prevent a recurrence.

Meanwhile, the outage has renewed scrutiny around Ethereum's client concentration and the risks posed by software monocultures.

Offchain Labs said the outage could have had more severe consequences if Prysm had accounted for a larger share of Ethereum's validator base. The firm pointed to Ethereum's client diversity as a key factor in preventing a wider network failure.

“A client with more than 1/3rd of the network would have caused a temporary loss in finality and more missed blocks. A bug client with more than 2/3rd could finalize an invalid chain,” it stated.

Despite that mitigation, the incident has intensified calls for greater client diversity. 

Data from Miga Labs show that Lighthouse remains the dominant Ethereum consensus client, accounting for 51.39% of validators. Prysm represents 19.06%, followed by Teku at 13.71% and Nimbus at 9.25%.

Lighthouse's share places it roughly 15% points away from a threshold that some researchers view as a systemic risk. 

As a result, developers and ecosystem participants have again urged validators to consider switching to alternative clients to reduce the likelihood that a single software flaw could disrupt the blockchain's core operations.

In a landscape of relentless flux, Ethereum stands at a pivotal crossroads, beckoning investors to scrutinize the shifting sands beneath their feet. The Federal Reserve's recent decisions on interest rates have injected a jolt of unpredictability into the cryptocurrency realm, igniting traders' concerns about what lies ahead in 2026. As whispers of a possible leadership shake-up at the Fed swirl—particularly should another Trump administration occur—analysts find themselves pondering an unavoidable question: is Ethereum poised for a transformative leap?

Presently, Ethereum finds itself locked in a trading corridor between $3,051 and $3,272, a testament to the heightened turbulence characterizing today's market. Although the Fed's modest quarter-point rate cut initially sparked a flicker of optimism, the tepid language surrounding future policies swiftly dampened that mood. This ongoing uncertainty leads to a pressing inquiry: what trajectory might Ethereum's value chart in the impending months?

Crucial Support Levels and Market Signals

Ethereum's most vital support level hovers around $3,000—a barrier that, if breached, could usher in a plunge towards $2,800. On the flip side, maintaining stability above this critical line could pave the way for an audacious challenge at the $3,200 level, potentially rekindling bullish momentum that aims for $3,400. 

Traders would be wise to keep an eye on the Bollinger Bands, currently depicting a contraction in volatility; this could herald an imminent breakout. The transformation at the Federal Reserve's helm might play a crucial role in driving these pivotal movements.

The looming transition in Federal Reserve leadership is pivotal for resources like Ethereum. As Jerome Powell's term gradually winds down, speculation burgeons regarding possible successors and their strategies for managing interest rates. The incoming Fed chair could endorse vastly different philosophies for economic policy. A dovish approach that favors aggressive rate cuts could pump vitality into liquidity, a prime catalyst for speculative assets including Ethereum. 

On the contrary, a hawkish stance or indecision from the next administration might stifle bullish engagement from institutional traders, who significantly influence Ethereum's trading volume. The standout question remains—how will these changes impact the flow of liquidity throughout the crypto markets?

Risk Versus Reward: Embracing the Dovish Approach

Should the new Fed leadership advocate for deeper rate reductions, the influx of liquidity might rejuvenate Ethereum, reminiscent of the highs observed during the booming DeFi and NFT epochs. Yet the fog surrounding leadership decisions and the shadow of a possible government shutdown—which could stall essential economic data—might foster hesitance among large-scale traders. This creates a climate of tug-of-war between investor confidence and apprehension, ultimately shaping Ethereum's short-term price dynamics.

At the moment, market sentiment occupies a precarious balance teetering between bullish exuberance and bearish caution. Ethereum bulls seem to be gaining ground above the $3,000 mark, yet the pall of economic uncertainty continues to loom, potentially stalling substantial upward movement. Traders are on high alert as the market reacts to economic triggers, knowing full well that ETH price projections hinge significantly on external forces operating beyond the blockchain.

Institutional Trading Insights: A Potential Silver Lining

The uptick in institutional trading presents an encouraging narrative for Ethereum's prospects. As Fed policies align with institutional support, the environment could dramatically shift if these traders recognize favorable conditions. The anticipated approval of ETFs, such as BlackRock's iShares Staked Ethereum Trust, could channel new investments, bolstering long-term forecasts for ETH.

As we cast our eyes towards early 2026, confusion and volatility seem set to reign as traders dissect every subtle shift from the Federal Reserve. Expectations for Ethereum's price movements to remain reactive grow more pronounced, tethered to market responses to impending announcements and economic forecasts. If the new Fed tapestry leans towards aggressive rate cuts, Ethereum might find itself on an exhilarating rebound journey, potentially eyeing the coveted $4,000 milestone by mid-2026.

Conversely, we may also experience extended uncertainty, with prices oscillating beneath critical support levels, leading to a more constrained trading environment for ETH. Navigating this current landscape will require astute awareness—investors must stay vigilant to balance the myriad opportunities and risks this intricate environment presents.

The intricate interplay between Federal Reserve dynamics and institutional maneuvers creates a distinctive backdrop for Ethereum as it propels into 2026. Stakeholders must remain agile, honing in on how regulatory and macroeconomic shifts will mold price trajectories. Those equipped with insight and responsiveness will likely emerge in a stronger position to seize opportunities while deftly managing risks amid ongoing uncertainties. 

As the cryptocurrency terrain brims with potential transformations, Ethereum's destiny remains seamlessly intertwined with broader economic currents, crafting a compelling narrative rich in both promise and unpredictability.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Bitcoin Below $90K, Markets Turn Cautious Ahead of U.S. Data and BOJ Decision","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/14/bitcoin-dips-below-usd90k-amid-fading-risk-appetite-ahead-of-key-macro-events","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:53:53 GMT","

Bitcoin BTC$88,812.41 drifted below $90,000 on Sunday during quiet trading, with investors showing limited appetite for risk ahead of a busy week of economic data and central bank events.

The largest cryptocurrency was trading around $89,600 as of early afternoon UTC, down about 0.9% in 24 hours, marginally higher on the week and still down roughly 7.6% over the past month. Ether ETH$3,086.56 changed hands near $3,104, down on the day but up more than 2% over the past seven days, outperforming bitcoin on a weekly basis.

Across the broader market, price action remained subdued. Solana, XRP, dogecoin and Cardano's ADA all fell, and continued to show double-digit losses over the past month, underscoring persistent weakness across major altcoins. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) dropped almost 1%.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at nearly $3.15 trillion, about 0.8% lower over 24 hours, with trading volumes around $89 billion, reflecting the thin liquidity typical of Sundays. Bitcoin dominance hovered near 57%, highlighting continued concentration in the largest digital asset as investors remain selective.

Some analysts cautioned that bitcoin's consolidation could turn lower if key technical levels fail. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez said earlier Sunday on X that $86,000 remains an important level for bitcoin to hold, noting that a deeper pullback could come into play if that support gives way.

Markets appear to be pausing ahead of a dense macroeconomic calendar in the coming days. In the U.S., investors will be watching a series of employment indicators, including the unemployment rate, ADP employment data and weekly jobless claims, alongside November inflation data, December flash PMI readings, and speeches from Federal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher J. Waller, for clues on the path of interest rates.

Macro-sensitive traders are also closely monitoring developments in Japan, where the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is widely expected to raise interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. According to a Reuters report published Friday, markets have largely priced in a move that would lift the rate to 0.75% after Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years.

While Japanese borrowing costs would remain low by global standards even after such a move, the report noted that the BOJ is likely to emphasize that monetary conditions will remain accommodative and that future rate increases will depend on how the economy responds to each increase. Still, expectations of tighter policy have drawn attention to the potential impact on yen-funded carry trades, a source of liquidity that has supported global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

For now, crypto markets remain range-bound, with subdued volumes and limited conviction as traders await clearer signals from upcoming U.S. data and central bank decisions.

Bitcoin's overall underwhelming price performance continued in the past 24 hours as the asset is close to breaking below $90,000 decisively.

Most larger-cap alts are also slightly in the red daily, as ETH is down to $3,100, while XRP sits at a pivotal support level at $2.00.

The primary cryptocurrency began the business week with high hopes of substantial price resurgance due to the FOMC meeting on Wednesday. A day before the US Fed met for the last time in 2025, the asset indeed went on the run and exploded by several grand to just over $94,500.

It slipped following this multi-week peak but challenged it again on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut the rates by 25 bps. However, this was another fakeout as bitcoin quickly lost all of the momentum and dumped below $89,500. It bounced to $93,600 on Thursday afternoon, only to be rejected again on Friday and dip below $90,000.

The bull managed to defend that level on Saturday, helping BTC climb to $90,500. However, the bears have been more persistent so far on Sunday as the cryptocurrency sits just under that coveted support.

Its market cap has dropped below $1.8 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins is close to 57%.

Most larger-cap alts are quite sluggish on a daily scale, so we will focus on their weekly performances. The chart reveals that although ETH has slipped by 1% in the past day, it's actually 2% up weekly at $3,100. XRP has lost around 1% within the same timeframe and now struggles to remain above $2.00. TRX is down by 3%, while HBAR has plunged by 8%.

In contrast, ZEC has exploded by 25% even though it has lost 5% of value since Saturday. MNT is up by 18% to $1.27, CC has gained 14%, while XMR has jumped by 9%. M has outperformed the rest with a 40% weekly surge, while QNT and KAS are down by 11% each.

The total crypto market cap has lost another $20 billion daily and is down to $3.150 trillion on CG.

SWIFT launches a blockchain-ledger project with the big question being is it the XRP Ledger or its own network?

In a move poised to reshape cross-border payments, SWIFT , the global interbank messaging network, has confirmed it is building a blockchain-based ledger. 





Notably, this announcement has sparked speculation across the financial and crypto communities: Could this new ledger resemble the XRP Ledger (XRPL), renowned for fast, low-cost international transactions?

SWIFT is modernizing cross-border payments with a blockchain-based ledger. Traditionally slowed by multiple intermediaries, international transactions can take days to settle. SWIFT's shared, real-time ledger lets authorized institutions view every payment simultaneously, cutting delays, reconciliation errors, and operational friction.

SWIFT hasn't confirmed whether it will use the XRP Ledger or Ripple technology, but the parallels are clear. Both aim for fast, low-cost, real-time settlements between financial institutions. 

Therefore, SWIFT's blockchain ledger could transform international banking. By enabling “always-on” payments, it offers near-instant access to funds, improved liquidity management, and reduced reliance on intermediaries—potentially lowering transaction costs.

For financial institutions, the shared ledger provides real-time transaction visibility, enhancing risk management, efficiency, and settlement speed. For corporates and consumers, it promises faster cross-border payments, a smoother experience, and greater predictability.

Though details on its architecture, blockchain protocol, and interoperability with networks like the XRP Ledger remain unclear, SWIFT's foray into blockchain marks a turning point for global payments. 

The industry will keenly watch whether Swift's ledger merely mirrors existing networks or pioneers new capabilities that could transform cross-border finance.

Well, SWIFT's blockchain initiative highlights a pivotal shift whereby leading financial institutions now see distributed ledger technology not as a fintech experiment, but as the future backbone of global payments.

SWIFT's launch of a blockchain-based ledger signals a major shift in cross-border payments. By enabling real-time, secure, and transparent transaction tracking, it promises faster settlements, lower costs, and greater operational efficiency for banks worldwide. 

While it's unclear if the ledger will leverage the XRP Ledger, SWIFT's move underscores that distributed ledger technology is moving from theory to a core driver of global finance, potentially making instant, always-on payments the new standard.

JP Morgan (JPM) on Thursday reportedly used a public blockchain for the first time to issue a $50 million U.S commercial paper for Galaxy Digital Holdings (GLXY).

According to Reuters, the global fintech giant said that it had used the Solana (SOL) blockchain for the issuance of the short-term debt instrument. Coinbase Global (COIN) and Franklin Templeton (BEN) reportedly bought the debt instrument and paid for it with USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin issued by Circle (CRCL). 

JP Morgan, who set up the deal, made an on-chain USCP token for it. The blockchain handles both issuance and redemption flows, a use case for the ease of use of stablecoins and tokenized assets in traditional debt markets.

JPM's stock was trading at $314.97, up 1.49% in the last 24 hours. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around JPM continued to be in the ‘extremely bullish' territory amid ‘extremely high' levels of chatter over the past day.

Prior this this, JP Morgan used blockchain-based issuances on its private network, such as a municipal bond for the City of Quincy and a similar commercial paper for a Singapore-based bank. 

In the past, the bank was careful about decentralized infrastructure. Instead, it built its own Ethereum (ETH)-based private ledger called Quorum and started projects such as the Liink to make it easier for banks to share data safely. 

These efforts indicated that JP Morgan was early on in its ""blockchain, not Bitcoin"" stance, which favored institutional control and regulatory protections over public, permissionless crypto systems. 

In 2023, CEO Jamie Dimon publicly called Bitcoin a ""hyped-up fraud,"" but at the same time, the bank was putting millions of dollars into its own blockchain infrastructure. As of late 2025, Dimon said that the bank will let institutional clients use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as collateral for loans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Venezuela's Bold Blockchain Leap Redefines Financial Resilience","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/venezuela-blockchain-crypto-adoption","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 02:57:29 GMT","

In a nation grappling with relentless turbulence and economic volatility, one might ask: where do the citizens of Venezuela turn for a lifeline? As the flames of hyperinflation rage and regulatory frameworks remain murky at best, many Venezuelans are finding refuge in a revolutionary technology—blockchain. This shift toward cryptocurrencies, particularly USDT, isn't just a fleeting moment of innovation; it represents a radical evolution in how financial transactions are conceived and executed in an environment steeped in turmoil.

Recent figures present a startling narrative: Venezuela occupies the 18th position globally in crypto adoption, but when considering population proportions, it leaps to an impressive 9th place. This remarkable shift illustrates a transformative moment in Venezuelan society, where digital assets have become indispensable financial tools. With traditional banking systems collapsing under their own weight, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions have risen as crucial means for effective exchanges and conversions, enabling communities to forge new paths despite institutional failures.

The country's acute economic crisis has resulted in an unprecedented embrace of stablecoins, primarily USDT, emerging as cornerstones of survival in everyday transactions. With the Bolívar losing its value at an alarming pace, Venezuelans are increasingly utilizing USDT for various purposes—from receiving remittances to paying vendors and even processing salaries. A report from TRM Labs highlights that a staggering 38% of significant crypto-platform traffic emanates from Venezuela, emphasizing the depth of dependency on these digital currencies. It's clear that the normalization of crypto-to-fiat exchanges is accelerating, creating an ecosystem that sustains ordinary lives amid chaos.

For the everyday Venezuelan, stablecoins have metamorphosed from speculative assets into essential instruments for economic activity. In a climate where traditional banks falter, stablecoins empower citizens to conduct transactions without falling prey to the limitations imposed by local financial institutions. As ever-tightening economic sanctions and crumbling financial infrastructures continue to loom, the shift towards digital currencies emerges not merely as a choice but as an absolute necessity.

Stablecoins, especially USDT, afford some level of economic continuity, aiding individuals in weathering the storm of hyperinflation. Despite looming compliance concerns and regulatory confusion, these digital currencies have woven themselves seamlessly into the fabric of daily commerce, enabling a semblance of normalcy.

The challenges faced by Venezuela could serve as a roadmap for other nations wrestling with economic crises. The innovative use of decentralized finance in this context showcases how countries can leverage blockchain technology to construct resilient financial landscapes devoid of the failures of traditional banks. This possibility of adaptability could inspire similar transitions in other insecure economies, providing a fresh outlook on financial stability.

Nonetheless, while a horizon of possibilities beckons, the journey is fraught with hurdles. The lack of an organized regulatory framework in Venezuela has given rise to a thriving grassroots adoption of cryptocurrency. However, concerns linger regarding the influence of regulatory bodies like SUNACRIP, which threaten the prospect of sustainable growth. Without substantial improvements in macroeconomic conditions or robust regulatory updates, the populace's reliance on digital assets is likely to deepen and expand.

In this rapidly changing landscape, enterprising firms possess the opportunity to explore the viability of P2P USDT models, pushing their operations beyond the confining limits of conventional banking systems. Embracing these strategies could fortify financial infrastructure and pave the way for compliance in unpredictable economic spheres.

Venezuela's steep reliance on blockchain technology underscores how cryptocurrencies have the potential to redefine financial systems during times of upheaval. The pivotal role played by stablecoins in facilitating daily transactions has positioned Venezuela as a compelling case study of resilience amid hardship. As global challenges mount, the insights gleaned from Venezuelan crypto market trends can offer critical guidance to other nations wrestling with their own economic instability. In navigating uncharted waters, the evolution of blockchain in Venezuela stands testament to the future of digital finance in the face of adversity.

Key Takeaways

Aggressive long-term HODLing and exchange withdrawals are creating an extreme, historic Bitcoin supply shock.

Disappointing ETF outflows have evaporated, replaced by a sharp and sustained return of institutional capital.

Fading selling pressure and Bitcoin's stable $90K-$93K range suggest a strong market base is forming.

The Federal Reserve's anticipated 25 basis point Fed rate cut failed to dramatically sway the Bitcoin price. The rate cut initially caused a momentary spike in volatility, driving BTC toward $89,000. However, Bitcoin rapidly recovered, cementing its position in the $90K – $93K consolidation range.

Although the market's sideways movement tested the patience of short-term traders, analytics confirm a significant shift toward market stabilization. Downward pressure on Bitcoin is fading; the second wave of post-FOMC selling proved markedly weaker, indicating a strong base is now forming.

The most bullish factor is the extreme conviction visible in on-chain activity, signaling an impending Bitcoin Supply Shock. Long-term investors are aggressively removing coins from exchanges: Binance withdrawals hit their highest transaction level since May 2018, confirming a strong HODLing strategy and a massive shift to self-custody. At the same time, BTC deposits, which generally indicate the necessary fuel for selling, plummeted to an 8-year low.

In other words, these historic on-chain trends, where participants actively remove supply and new selling pressure vanishes, are classic supply shock behavior. This move has pushed the total exchange balance of Bitcoin to a critical low of approximately 2.76 million BTC, continuing a year-long trend where 403,000 BTC left exchanges.

BTC depositing transactions have also dropped for months. – Source: CryptoQuant

Global macro conditions provided a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin. One of the typical inverse indicators for Bitcoin, namely the Dollar Index (DXY), sold off post-Fed, has reached its weakest point since mid-October. This DXY bearish trend generally benefits risk assets. Technical signals are confirming the potential for a move higher; the Bitcoin MACD histogram, set for a medium-to-long-term view, remains on the verge of a positive cross above zero, which would signal renewed bullish momentum.

In stark contrast, altcoins lagged severely. Assets like Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) declined 12% – 14%, which highlights selective investor focus on Bitcoin stability during transitional macro periods.

In addition, the primary risk factor cited in earlier analyses, disappointing ETF flows, has evaporated. Institutional demand has witnessed a material and continuous recovery in the crypto market as of early December, culminating in the sector logging its most significant net-positive week since October. Within only one single week, the influx nearly matches the entire cumulative inflows reported for the final four weeks of November, indicating a sharp revival of institutional appetite. For instance, the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs attracted $223.5 million in a single session.

With this major headwind removed, the technical BTC breakout becomes highly probable. A sustained move above the bearish trendline confirms the end of the downtrend. Bitcoin's next major $108K resistance zone, defined by key moving averages, is the immediate target.

Strongly bullish sentiment now characterizes the revised market outlook, primarily fueled by the combination of historic supply removal and resurgent institutional buying. Analysts are confidently setting the major resistance zone near the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $108,000 as the primary target, expecting the initial $97,000 target to clear quickly.

Analytics firm Swissblock noted the downward pressure on Bitcoin is losing steam, with the market stabilizing. The firm added, “The second selling wave is weaker than the first, and selling pressure is not intensifying,” suggesting that while signs of stabilization exist, confirmation is still pending. According to Swissblock, the market still needs the Risk Index to drop below 25 and a reclaim of structural levels before definitively calling a bottom.

The Bitcoin Risk Index is showing a crucial step:

The second selling wave is weaker than the first, and selling pressure is not intensifying.

Signs of stabilization… but not confirmation.

We still need Risk < 25 and structural reclaim levels before calling a bottom.… pic.twitter.com/UvoMqxVGco

— Swissblock (@swissblock__) December 11, 2025



Market focus is shifting away from simple Fed decisions. The new market drivers shift toward U.S. crypto regulation and emerging scarcity dynamics, making supply constraints the dominant long-term narrative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Venezuela's Bold Blockchain Leap Redefines Financial Resilience","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/venezuela-blockchain-crypto-adoption","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 02:57:29 GMT","

In a nation grappling with relentless turbulence and economic volatility, one might ask: where do the citizens of Venezuela turn for a lifeline? As the flames of hyperinflation rage and regulatory frameworks remain murky at best, many Venezuelans are finding refuge in a revolutionary technology—blockchain. This shift toward cryptocurrencies, particularly USDT, isn't just a fleeting moment of innovation; it represents a radical evolution in how financial transactions are conceived and executed in an environment steeped in turmoil.

Recent figures present a startling narrative: Venezuela occupies the 18th position globally in crypto adoption, but when considering population proportions, it leaps to an impressive 9th place. This remarkable shift illustrates a transformative moment in Venezuelan society, where digital assets have become indispensable financial tools. With traditional banking systems collapsing under their own weight, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions have risen as crucial means for effective exchanges and conversions, enabling communities to forge new paths despite institutional failures.

The country's acute economic crisis has resulted in an unprecedented embrace of stablecoins, primarily USDT, emerging as cornerstones of survival in everyday transactions. With the Bolívar losing its value at an alarming pace, Venezuelans are increasingly utilizing USDT for various purposes—from receiving remittances to paying vendors and even processing salaries. A report from TRM Labs highlights that a staggering 38% of significant crypto-platform traffic emanates from Venezuela, emphasizing the depth of dependency on these digital currencies. It's clear that the normalization of crypto-to-fiat exchanges is accelerating, creating an ecosystem that sustains ordinary lives amid chaos.

For the everyday Venezuelan, stablecoins have metamorphosed from speculative assets into essential instruments for economic activity. In a climate where traditional banks falter, stablecoins empower citizens to conduct transactions without falling prey to the limitations imposed by local financial institutions. As ever-tightening economic sanctions and crumbling financial infrastructures continue to loom, the shift towards digital currencies emerges not merely as a choice but as an absolute necessity.

Stablecoins, especially USDT, afford some level of economic continuity, aiding individuals in weathering the storm of hyperinflation. Despite looming compliance concerns and regulatory confusion, these digital currencies have woven themselves seamlessly into the fabric of daily commerce, enabling a semblance of normalcy.

The challenges faced by Venezuela could serve as a roadmap for other nations wrestling with economic crises. The innovative use of decentralized finance in this context showcases how countries can leverage blockchain technology to construct resilient financial landscapes devoid of the failures of traditional banks. This possibility of adaptability could inspire similar transitions in other insecure economies, providing a fresh outlook on financial stability.

Nonetheless, while a horizon of possibilities beckons, the journey is fraught with hurdles. The lack of an organized regulatory framework in Venezuela has given rise to a thriving grassroots adoption of cryptocurrency. However, concerns linger regarding the influence of regulatory bodies like SUNACRIP, which threaten the prospect of sustainable growth. Without substantial improvements in macroeconomic conditions or robust regulatory updates, the populace's reliance on digital assets is likely to deepen and expand.

In this rapidly changing landscape, enterprising firms possess the opportunity to explore the viability of P2P USDT models, pushing their operations beyond the confining limits of conventional banking systems. Embracing these strategies could fortify financial infrastructure and pave the way for compliance in unpredictable economic spheres.

Venezuela's steep reliance on blockchain technology underscores how cryptocurrencies have the potential to redefine financial systems during times of upheaval. The pivotal role played by stablecoins in facilitating daily transactions has positioned Venezuela as a compelling case study of resilience amid hardship. As global challenges mount, the insights gleaned from Venezuelan crypto market trends can offer critical guidance to other nations wrestling with their own economic instability. In navigating uncharted waters, the evolution of blockchain in Venezuela stands testament to the future of digital finance in the face of adversity.

On December 14, Ripple announced a major milestone: receiving conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish the Ripple National Trust Bank. This regulatory breakthrough marks a pivotal moment for Ripple, enhancing its credibility and operational scope within the US financial market. As Ripple strengthens its positioning, the news triggers optimism in the cryptocurrency sphere, particularly regarding XRP, Ripple's native digital asset.

The approval from the OCC allows Ripple to set up the Ripple National Trust Bank. This reflects Ripple's efforts to align with regulatory standards, particularly important as digital currencies strive for broader acceptance. Obtaining this license indicates Ripple's commitment to expanding its foothold in the financial industry. 

Since traditional banks have been cautious about digital currencies, Ripple's move stands out as it bridges blockchain solutions with established financial systems. This building of trust can pave the way for future innovations and partnerships within the banking sector.

Following the announcement, XRP saw a notable price increase, reflecting market optimism. On December 14, XRP-USD traded up 5%, reaching $0.71. This surge illustrates investor confidence in Ripple's strategic direction. Ripple's regulatory approval aids in clearing uncertainties, potentially driving more institutional interest and adoption. 

For investors, this development is vital as it suggests a more secure and credible future for Ripple and XRP. Seeing regulatory challenges being addressed positions Ripple favorably for future growth.

Ripple's bank license aligns with its goal to enhance cross-border payment solutions. By establishing the Ripple National Trust Bank, Ripple can offer a range of financial services traditionally covered by banks. This allows Ripple to penetrate deeper into the financial systems of the US, potentially increasing its user base and transaction volumes.

This strategic maneuver can enhance Ripple's role in streamlining global financial transactions, providing faster, cheaper, and more reliable services. The regulatory approval also bolsters Ripple's image, potentially influencing industry standards for digital assets.

Ripple's conditional approval to launch the Ripple National Trust Bank signifies a substantial leap in its journey towards integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. This move not only enhances Ripple's regulatory standing but also boosts investor confidence, as seen in the XRP price bump. By aligning with regulatory frameworks, Ripple sets a precedent in the digital currency space, fostering a more trusted environment for cryptocurrencies.

For investors and industry watchers, this development highlights the potential for Ripple to expand its influence and capabilities. As Meyka suggests, keeping an eye on Ripple's progress could offer insights into how digital currencies can collaborate with traditional finance, offering new opportunities for growth and innovation.

As Ripple's credibility grows, its role in shaping the financial future becomes increasingly significant. The bank license approval is just a stepping stone towards broader adoption and acceptance of digital assets in the global financial ecosystem.

Ripple's conditional approval to establish the Ripple National Trust Bank marks a significant regulatory achievement, demonstrating its alignment with financial compliance standards and potentially boosting its market credibility.

Following the announcement, XRP experienced a 5% increase, reaching $0.71, as investor confidence grew due to Ripple's enhanced market positioning and regulatory progress.

By obtaining the bank license, Ripple aims to offer financial services traditionally handled by banks, boosting its influence in the US market and increasing transaction volumes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","The double-edged future: Bringing fintech onchain","https://crypto.news/double-edged-future-bringing-fintech-onchain-opinion/","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:04:18 GMT","


        Share    


            Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news' editorial.        

For years, crypto promised to democratize finance, to bank the unbanked, to make finance more inclusive. But if we're honest, that promise has largely remained rhetorical. Blockchain technology revolutionized settlement and ownership, yet most of the world still banks, invests, and trades in the same systems it always has. The divide between the crypto economy and capital markets persists, and it is not because of a lack of interest but because of a missing bridge.

That bridge is beginning to take shape. We're entering an era where fintech meets blockchain — where finance goes onchain. The question is not whether this convergence will happen, but how. And whether it will truly make capital markets more accessible or simply reproduce their inequalities under a new digital flag.

The fundamental logic of blockchain aligns with what fintech has been chasing for decades: efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. Moving capital markets onchain could, in theory, deliver all three at once.

Tokenization of real-world assets allows anything from bonds to real estate to be fractionalized and traded with the same ease as digital tokens. Settlement could become instantaneous. Custody could be simplified. Compliance, if built correctly, could become programmable.

For retail users, this could mean genuine participation in markets previously closed to them: access to credit, yield, and diversified assets without intermediaries taking most of the margin. For institutions, it could mean cost reduction, global liquidity, and composable financial products that settle in seconds instead of days.

That's the dream: an open, transparent, programmable capital market that runs on blockchain rails but speaks the language of finance.

But accessibility isn't just about technology — it's about experience. For most retail users, finance is already digitized through fintech apps like Revolut, Robinhood, or Cash App. The next leap is not making these platforms “more digital,” but making them natively interoperable with blockchain infrastructure, allowing users to move seamlessly between fiat and onchain assets without needing to understand gas fees, seed phrases, or chain IDs.

This is where fintech has a head start. It has mastered UX as trust. Users don't care about what database holds their money; they care about seeing their balance, clicking once, and knowing it works. Data shows that 73% of users switch banks for a better user experience, while crypto UX is in a deep crisis.

Bringing fintech onchain must preserve that psychological contract. The onboarding needs to be invisible. The regulatory clarity needs to be visible. When the average user can buy tokenized Treasury bills from their regular fintech app, see yield accrue transparently, and trust that the same investor protections apply as in traditional markets — that's when onchain adoption will no longer be speculative. It will be habitual.

Institutional players, meanwhile, have moved from skepticism to cautious experimentation. BlackRock's tokenized funds, JPMorgan's Onyx network, and Franklin Templeton's blockchain funds are early signs of a broader shift: the world's biggest financial engines quietly testing how much of their operations can be brought onchain without regulatory blowback or operational risk.

For them, the appeal isn't ideology. It's efficiency. Blockchain infrastructure can reduce reconciliation costs, improve settlement speed, and unlock new liquidity models. But institutions don't move for ideals; they move for compliance and yield.

To bring fintech fully onchain, institutions need assurance that the benefits of TradFi — clear legal frameworks, robust custody, and recourse mechanisms — don't vanish in translation. That's the real double-edged sword of accessibility.

The same tools that make finance more open can make it more fragile if deployed without guardrails.

Making capital markets more accessible requires walking a tightrope between two imperatives: regulation and technology.

On one side lies regulation: the slow, necessary machinery that guarantees trust. Without it, no institution will transition onchain, and no retail user will risk their savings there. Tokenized assets need legal status. Smart contracts need enforceability. Stablecoins need backing clarity.

On the other side lies technology: the innovation that makes the transition worthwhile. If onchain infrastructure simply replicates TradFi bureaucracy with more jargon, the promise of accessibility dies in compliance paperwork.

The goal is balance: regulation that protects without suffocating, and technology that liberates without destabilizing.

This is why hybrid architectures — combining onchain transparency with off-chain controls — are gaining traction. The future isn't decentralized anarchy; it's programmable regulation. Compliance baked into code. Identity systems that preserve privacy while satisfying KYC. Liquidity that can flow freely but within defined perimeters.

The hardest transition won't be technical. It will be cultural. Finance has always run on trust, and trust is built on habit. For regulators, blockchain still feels foreign, risky, and uncontrollable. For crypto-native builders, regulation still feels like a threat to innovation. Both sides are wrong.

True accessibility will come not when we abolish TradFi, but when we integrate it, when fintech, blockchain, and regulation stop competing narratives and start forming a shared one. 

It will take new kinds of partnerships: between banks and protocols, auditors and oracles, regulators and developers. It will take language that both retail users and policymakers can understand. And it will take humility from all sides, because no one has the full map of this transition yet.

The next evolution of fintech will not be “crypto-fied.” It will be onchain — transparent, interoperable, and composable — but built to serve human and institutional needs, not memes or hype cycles.

This future won't look like DeFi summer. It will look like your bank, your broker, and your wallet quietly merging into one seamless interface where value moves frictionlessly across asset classes and jurisdictions.

When that happens, the distinction between fintech and crypto will dissolve. We'll simply call it finance again — rebuilt, restructured, and running onchain.

In the end, bringing fintech onchain isn't just a technical upgrade. It's a philosophical one. It's about expanding access without losing trust, innovating without abandoning regulation, and modernizing capital markets without erasing the human need for security.

That balance — between openness and order — will decide whether this next era of finance fulfills its promise or repeats the same exclusions on a shinier blockchain.

Bitcoin BTC$88,812.41 drifted below $90,000 on Sunday during quiet trading, with investors showing limited appetite for risk ahead of a busy week of economic data and central bank events.

The largest cryptocurrency was trading around $89,600 as of early afternoon UTC, down about 0.9% in 24 hours, marginally higher on the week and still down roughly 7.6% over the past month. Ether ETH$3,086.56 changed hands near $3,104, down on the day but up more than 2% over the past seven days, outperforming bitcoin on a weekly basis.

Across the broader market, price action remained subdued. Solana, XRP, dogecoin and Cardano's ADA all fell, and continued to show double-digit losses over the past month, underscoring persistent weakness across major altcoins. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) dropped almost 1%.

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization stood at nearly $3.15 trillion, about 0.8% lower over 24 hours, with trading volumes around $89 billion, reflecting the thin liquidity typical of Sundays. Bitcoin dominance hovered near 57%, highlighting continued concentration in the largest digital asset as investors remain selective.

Some analysts cautioned that bitcoin's consolidation could turn lower if key technical levels fail. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez said earlier Sunday on X that $86,000 remains an important level for bitcoin to hold, noting that a deeper pullback could come into play if that support gives way.

Markets appear to be pausing ahead of a dense macroeconomic calendar in the coming days. In the U.S., investors will be watching a series of employment indicators, including the unemployment rate, ADP employment data and weekly jobless claims, alongside November inflation data, December flash PMI readings, and speeches from Federal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher J. Waller, for clues on the path of interest rates.

Macro-sensitive traders are also closely monitoring developments in Japan, where the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is widely expected to raise interest rates at its upcoming policy meeting on Thursday. According to a Reuters report published Friday, markets have largely priced in a move that would lift the rate to 0.75% after Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled that inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target for more than three years.

While Japanese borrowing costs would remain low by global standards even after such a move, the report noted that the BOJ is likely to emphasize that monetary conditions will remain accommodative and that future rate increases will depend on how the economy responds to each increase. Still, expectations of tighter policy have drawn attention to the potential impact on yen-funded carry trades, a source of liquidity that has supported global risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

For now, crypto markets remain range-bound, with subdued volumes and limited conviction as traders await clearer signals from upcoming U.S. data and central bank decisions.

Spanish police arrested five people and charged four others in Denmark on Thursday for the kidnapping and murder of a man targeted for his cryptocurrency.

The police operation dismantled what authorities described as a criminal group operating across borders to steal cryptocurrency.

The investigation began in April when a woman arrived at a Málaga police station to report that she and her partner had been abducted in the nearby town of Mijas. According to the police, the couple was ambushed by three or four masked men dressed in black and armed with handguns.

The man was shot in the leg while trying to escape, and both were then forced into a vehicle and taken to a house where they were held for several hours.

The attackers tried to gain access to the couple's crypto wallets during the ordeal. The woman was released around midnight, but her partner's deceased body was later found in a wooded area. He showed signs of violence in addition to the gunshot wound, according to police.

Authorities carried out six raids in homes across Madrid and Málaga, seizing two handguns — one real, one fake — a baton, blood-stained clothing, mobile devices, and documents.

Biological evidence linked to the scene was also recovered. Danish police, working with their Spanish counterparts, charged four people in connection with the case. Two are already in prison for similar crimes.

The case points to a growing trend: physical attacks aimed at extracting access to crypto wallets. These attacks have been influential in the crypto space this year and have led to campaigns against what has become known as wrench attacks.

YO Labs, the development team behind YO Protocol, has raised $10 million in a Series A round to expand its crypto yield optimization platform.

Venture capital firm Foundation Capital led the round, joined by Coinbase Ventures, Scribble Ventures, and Launchpad Capital.

The San Francisco-based company plans to use the funding to bring its yield optimization protocol to more blockchains and improve its infrastructure.

YO Protocol is designed to help users earn yield on crypto assets by automatically rebalancing capital across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols while factoring in risk. It currently offers users access to USD, EUR, BTC, and gold-based yield products.

Unlike most DeFi yield aggregators that operate within a single blockchain, YO's system works across chains. Its vaults — yoETH, yoUSD, yoBTC, yoEUR, and yoGOLD — dynamically allocate capital to wherever the risk-adjusted yield is most favorable, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

This is powered by Exponential.fi, a platform built by the same team to assign transparent risk scores to DeFi protocols. The protocol's core innovation lies in its calculation of ""Risk Adjusted Yield,"" a metric derived from the team's background in building risk ratings for DeFi pools, the protocol's co-founder and CIO, Mehdi Lebbar, told CoinDesk in an interview.

Rather than chasing the highest advertised percentages, the system calculates a probability of default based on thousands of risk vectors, which range from a protocol's age to its code audit history.

To mitigate the security vulnerabilities often associated with moving assets between blockchains, YO Labs employs a unique architecture that minimizes reliance on bridges, Lebbar said. Instead of constantly moving funds across chains, the protocol establishes what the team describes as ""embassies"" —independent vaults holding native assets on each blockchain.

""If you bridge a pool, you have exposure to the risk of the bridge... We needed to create these 'embassies' across multiple planets, these vaults across multiple chains that hold native assets,"" Lebbar said. ""If you have USDC on Arbitrum, that is the same USDC as on Ethereum, and you no longer have the bridge in the middle... that's much safer.""

Beyond architecture, the system employs a 'DeFi Graph' to manage active risks during market volatility or protocol failures—what Lebbar calls 'Armageddon scenarios.' This system monitors dependencies up to five levels deep, allowing the protocol to trigger automated withdrawals if a pool is indirectly exposed to a failing asset, Lebbar said.

The funding round brings YO Labs' total raised to $24 million, including a previous seed round led by Paradigm. With the new capital, the company is positioning YO as core infrastructure for fintechs, wallets, and developers looking to embed sustainable yield into their products.

AI-powered trading hasn't yet reached an “iPhone moment,” when everyone is carrying around an algorithmic, reinforcement learning portfolio manager in their pocket, but something like that is coming, experts say.

In fact, the power of AI meets its match when faced with the dynamic, adversarial arena of trading markets. Unlike an AI agent informed by endless circuits of self-driving cars learning to accurately recognize traffic signals, no amount of data and modeling will ever be able to tell the future.

This makes refining AI trading models a complex, demanding process. The measure of success has typically been gauging profit and loss (P&L). But advancements in how to customize algorithms are engendering agents that continually learn to balance risk and reward when faced with a multitude of market conditions.

Allowing risk-adjusted metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio to inform the learning process multiplies the sophistication of a test, said Michael Sena, chief marketing officer at Recall Labs, a firm that has run 20 or so AI trading arenas, where a community submits AI trading agents, and those agents compete over a four or five day period.

“When it comes to scanning the market for alpha, the next generation of builders are exploring algo customization and specialization, taking user preferences into account,” Sena said in an interview. “Being optimized for a particular ratio and not just raw P&L is more like the way leading financial institutions work in traditional markets. So, looking at things like, what is your max drawdown, how much was your value at risk to make this P&L?”

Taking a step back, a recent trading competition on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, involving several large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-5, DeepSeek and Gemini Pro, kind of set the baseline for where AI is in the trading world. These LLMs were all given the same prompt and executed autonomously, making decisions. But they weren't that good, according to Sena, barely outperforming the market.

“We took the AI models used in the Hyperliquid contest and we let people submit their trading agents that they had built to compete against those models. We wanted to see if trading agents are better than the foundational models, with that added specialization,” Sena said.

The top three spots in Recall's competition were taken by customized models. “Some models were unprofitable and underperformed, but it became obvious that specialized trading agents that take these models and apply additional logic and inference and data sources and things on top, are outperforming the base AI,” he said.

The democratization of AI-based trading raises interesting questions about whether there will be any alpha left to cover if everyone is using the same level of sophisticated machine-learning tech.

“If everyone's using the same agent and that agent is executing the same strategy for everyone, does that sort of collapse into itself?” Sena said. “Does the alpha it's detecting go away because it's trying to execute it at scale for everyone else?”

That's why those best positioned to benefit from the advantage AI trading will eventually bring are those with the resources to invest in the development of custom tools, Sena said. As in traditional finance, the highest quality tools that generate the most alpha are typically not public, he added.

“People want to keep these tools as private as possible, because they want to protect that alpha,” Sena said. “They paid a lot for it. You saw that with hedge funds buying data sets. You can see that with proprietary algos developed by family offices.

“I think the magical sweet spot will be where there's a product that is a portfolio manager but the user still has some say in their strategy. They can say, ‘This is how I like to trade and here are my parameters, let's implement something similar, but make it better.'”

Trump Officials Keep Comparing the U.S.'s Vaccine Schedule to Denmark's. They're Missing the Point

The U.S.'s and Denmark's health systems are starkly different, so it makes sense that their vaccination schedules would differ, too

At a controversial meeting of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel recently, members voted to remove a long-standing recommendation that all babies get a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Public health experts derided the move, which goes against evidence that the shot is safe and effective. Members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and agency officials cited a curious rationale for the change: a need to align the U.S.'s vaccine schedule with Denmark's.

Shortly after the meeting, President Donald Trump ordered the CDC to fast-track a review of the U.S. vaccination schedule to align with that of other “peer, developed countries,"" including Denmark. But there's something rotten in this comparison.

The U.S. and Denmark have starkly different populations, disease rates and health care systems. It makes sense that they have different vaccination policies.

“The United States is not Denmark,” says Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who writes a popular health newsletter and who previously advised the CDC on its COVID policy. “The health care and safety net system of the United States is drastically different than other high-income countries around the world. We should expect country-level policy decisions to vary.”

The U.S. has more than 340 million people; Denmark's population is a little more than six million. Denmark is also much more demographically and economically homogenous than the U.S. And the countries have different burdens of disease.

Take hepatitis B—there were 99 new cases of chronic hepatitis B in Denmark in 2023, compared with more than 17,000 new cases in the U.S. Denmark also screens practically every single pregnant person for the disease, and most of those who test positive receive treatment. In the U.S., about 85 percent of pregnant people are screened, and many never get treatment. Hepatitis B is a liver infection, and if it is left untreated and becomes chronic, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and death.

The U.S. and Danish health care systems are incomparable. With the exception of Medicare and Medicaid, the U.S. system operates largely on privately funded insurance. Denmark has a universal health system that is paid for by the government, and all residents have access to free care. The CDC's advisory panel made no mention of this difference during its recent meeting, and the Trump administration has no appetite for a universal health care system in the U.S.

“Managing and following a small population with universal health care is much different than an enormous population with multiple delivery systems and multiple payers,” says Kathryn Edwards, a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. It's “like comparing apples and oranges.”

Jetelina concurs. In Denmark, people are less likely to fall through the cracks of their health system, she says, whereas the U.S. has a “very different health care capacity, and we don't have a safety net.”

A consequence of universal health care systems is that countries like Denmark are also more likely than the U.S. to take cost-effectiveness into consideration when deciding which vaccines to recommend and to whom. Even though providing vaccines is generally far cheaper than treating a disease, it still costs money. For example, in the U.K., which also has state-funded universal health care, flu vaccines aren't routinely recommended for children because the shots are more cost-effective in older adults. Similar logic may explain why the hepatitis B vaccine isn't universally given at birth in Denmark.

A lot of the discussion at the December 5 ACIP meeting focused on hypothetical risks from the hepatitis B vaccine in babies born to people who test negative for the disease; there was very little emphasis on the societal benefits of widespread vaccination.

When it comes to targeting vaccination only to individuals born to parents who are known to have hepatitis B, Jetelina says, “we've tested this before.” Prior to 1991, the U.S. attempted to vaccinate only people at high risk for hepatitis B. “Even when mothers screened negative for hep B and the birth dose was withheld, thousands of children did end up infected via another member of the household,” she says. In contrast, after ACIP recommended a universal birth dose in 1991, cases declined dramatically: in children, teens and young adults up to age 19, cases of acute hepatitis dropped by 99 percent from 1990 to 2019.

The push to alter the U.S. hepatitis B vaccine recommendation fits into a broader effort by the Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers to prioritize individual freedoms over collective action. Yet strong public health systems—and vaccination in particular—rely on collective action to protect those who cannot protect themselves, such as immune-suppressed people, older adults and young babies.

“I'm concerned about that,” Jetelina says. “If we land too much on individualism, diseases are going to come back.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A grad student's wild idea triggers a major aging breakthrough","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032625.htm","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 15:35:18 GMT","

One potential strategy for treating a wide range of illnesses involves targeting senescent cells. These cells -- also known as ""zombie cells"" -- stop multiplying but fail to clear themselves from the body as healthy cells normally do. They appear in many conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and throughout the aging process. Although scientists are working on ways to eliminate or repair these cells, a major challenge has been detecting them within living tissue without disturbing nearby healthy cells.

Researchers at Mayo Clinic, writing in the journal Aging Cell, describe a new method for labeling senescent cells. Their approach uses ""aptamers"" -- short pieces of synthetic DNA that fold into three-dimensional structures. These structures can attach to proteins found on the outer surfaces of cells. In experiments with mouse cells, the team identified several rare aptamers, selected from more than 100 trillion random DNA sequences, that were able to recognize specific surface proteins and mark senescent cells.

""This approach established the principle that aptamers are a technology that can be used to distinguish senescent cells from healthy ones,"" says biochemist and molecular biologist Jim Maher, III, Ph.D., a principal investigator of the study. ""Though this study is a first step, the results suggest the approach could eventually apply to human cells.""

How a Chance Conversation Sparked a Collaboration

The idea that led to this project began when a Mayo Clinic graduate student shared an offbeat thought during a casual discussion with a classmate.

Keenan Pearson, Ph.D. -- who recently received his degree from Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences -- had been working with Dr. Maher on how aptamers might be used for neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancer.

Meanwhile, several floors above, fellow graduate student Sarah Jachim, Ph.D., was studying senescent cells and aging in the lab of researcher Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.

Their paths crossed at a scientific gathering, where they exchanged ideas about their thesis projects. Dr. Pearson wondered if aptamers could be adapted to detect senescent cells. ""I thought the idea was a good one, but I didn't know about the process of preparing senescent cells to test them, and that was Sarah's expertise,"" says Dr. Pearson, who became lead author of the publication.

Mentors Back a Bold Student Idea

The students brought their concept to their advisors and to researcher Darren Baker, Ph.D., whose work centers on senescent cell therapies. Dr. Maher recalls that the idea initially struck him as ""crazy"" but worth exploring. All three mentors supported the proposal. ""We frankly loved that it was the students' idea and a real synergy of two research areas,"" says Dr. Maher.

As early experiments produced promising results, the pair enlisted more students from their labs. Then-graduate students Brandon Wilbanks, Ph.D., Luis Prieto, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. student Caroline Doherty added new techniques, including advanced microscopy and additional tissue types. ""It became encouraging to expend more effort,"" Dr. Jachim says, ""because we could tell it was a project that was going to succeed.""

Revealing New Clues About Senescent Cells

Beyond providing a tagging method, the research offered insight into the biology of senescent cells. ""To date, there aren't universal markers that characterize senescent cells,"" says Dr. Maher. ""Our study was set up to be open-ended about the target surface molecules on senescent cells. The beauty of this approach is that we let the aptamers choose the molecules to bind to.""

The team found that several aptamers attached to a variant of a protein called fibronectin on the surface of mouse cells. Scientists do not yet know how this fibronectin variant relates to senescence. However, its discovery suggests that aptamers may help identify features unique to senescent cells.

Potential Applications for Human Health

More work will be needed to find aptamers that can reliably detect senescent cells in human tissue. If aptamers can be adapted for this purpose, they could eventually be used to deliver treatments directly to these cells. Dr. Pearson notes that aptamers are less costly and more flexible than traditional antibodies, which are commonly used to distinguish one cell type from another.

""This project demonstrated a novel concept,"" says Dr. Maher. ""Future studies may extend the approach to applications related to senescent cells in human disease.""

Researchers have used a deep learning artificial intelligence model to identify what they describe as the first biomarker of chronic stress that can be directly seen on standard medical images. The findings are being presented next week at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Chronic stress does not just affect mood. It can influence both physical and mental health, contributing to problems such as anxiety, trouble sleeping, muscle pain, high blood pressure and a less effective immune system, according to the American Psychological Association. Studies have also linked ongoing stress to major conditions including heart disease, depression and obesity.

The study's lead author, Elena Ghotbi, M.D., a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, created and trained a deep learning tool designed to calculate the size of the adrenal glands using CT scans that had already been performed.

Each year, tens of millions of chest CT scans are performed in the United States alone.

""Our approach leverages widely available imaging data and opens the door to large-scale evaluations of the biological impact of chronic stress across a range of conditions using existing chest CT scans,"" Dr. Ghotbi said. ""This AI-driven biomarker has the potential to enhance cardiovascular risk stratification and guide preventive care without additional testing or radiation.""

Senior author Shadpour Demehri, M.D., professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins, noted that chronic stress is extremely common and is something many adults experience every day.

""For the first time, we can 'see' the long-term burden of stress inside the body, using a scan that patients already get every day in hospitals across the country. Until now, we haven't had a way to measure and quantify the cumulative effects of chronic stress, other than questionnaires, surrogate serum markers like chronic inflammation, and cortisol measurement, which is very cumbersome to obtain."" Dr. Demehri said.

Unlike a single cortisol test, which reflects stress at just one point in time, the size of the adrenal glands functions more like a long-term gauge of chronic stress.

In this research, the team analyzed information from 2,842 participants (mean age 69.3; 51% women) enrolled in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large study that combines chest CT imaging, validated stress questionnaires, cortisol measurements and indicators of allostatic load -- the cumulative physiological and psychological effects of chronic stress on the body. Because it integrates imaging, biochemical data and psychosocial assessments in the same individuals, this cohort was uniquely suited, and likely the only one available, for creating an imaging-based marker of chronic stress.

The investigators applied their deep learning model to the CT scans to automatically outline and measure adrenal gland volume. They defined Adrenal Volume Index (AVI) as adrenal volume (cm3) divided by height2 (m2). To capture hormonal patterns, participants provided salivary cortisol eight times per day over the course of two days. Allostatic load was calculated using body mass index, creatinine, hemoglobin, albumin, glucose, white blood count, heart rate and blood pressure.

The team then examined how AVI related to cortisol, allostatic load and a range of psychosocial stress indicators, such as depression scores and perceived stress questionnaires. They discovered that AVI generated by the AI model aligned with established stress questionnaires, with circulating cortisol levels and with future adverse cardiovascular events.

Higher AVI values were linked with greater overall cortisol exposure, higher peak cortisol levels and increased allostatic load. People who reported high levels of perceived stress had higher AVI compared with those who reported low stress. AVI was also connected to a higher left ventricular mass index, a measure related to heart structure. For every 1 cm3/m2 increase in AVI, the risk of heart failure and death increased.

""With up to 10-year follow-up data on our participants, we were able to correlate AI-derived AVI with clinically meaningful and relevant outcomes,"" Dr. Ghotbi said. ""This is the very first imaging marker of chronic stress that has been validated and shown to have an independent impact on a cardiovascular outcome, namely, heart failure.""

""For over three decades, we've known that chronic stress can wear down the body across multiple systems,"" said Teresa E. Seeman, Ph.D., study co-author and professor of epidemiology at UCLA and a pioneering researcher in stress and health. ""What makes this work so exciting is that it links a routinely obtained imaging feature, adrenal volume, with validated biological and psychological measures of stress and shows that it independently predicts a major clinical outcome. It's a true step forward in operationalizing the cumulative impact of stress on health.""

Dr. Demehri explained that connecting a simple imaging measure with several well-established markers of stress and disease outcomes creates a new, practical approach to measuring chronic stress in everyday clinical practice.

""The key significance of this work is that this biomarker is obtainable from CTs that are performed widely in United States for various reasons,"" Dr. Demehri said. ""Secondly, it is a physiologically sound measure of adrenal volume, which is part of the chronic stress physiologic cascade.""

The researchers noted that this imaging biomarker could potentially be applied to many stress-related diseases that commonly affect middle-aged and older adults.

Male bonobos are able to interpret female fertility signals that do not reliably reflect ovulation. This ability lets them direct their mating attempts toward the moments when conception is most likely, according to research led by Heungjin Ryu at Kyoto University, Japan. The work was published December 9th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology.

In many mammals, females are receptive to mating only when ovulating, which gives males a clear window to maximize reproductive success. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) differ from this pattern because females remain sexually receptive for long periods and develop a bright pink genital swelling that persists well beyond the actual fertile stage.

Tracking Wild Bonobos to Understand Fertility Signals

To examine how males respond to this unreliable signal, researchers observed a wild bonobo community at Wamba in the Luo Scientific Reserve in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The team documented sexual interactions each day and visually assessed the degree of genital swelling in every female. They also collected urine samples on filter paper to measure estrogen and progesterone, allowing them to identify when ovulation occurred.

The data showed that the likelihood of ovulation was highest between 8 and 27 days after a female reached maximum swelling, a range that makes prediction challenging. Even so, male behavior closely followed the true timing of ovulation. Males focused their mating activity on females who had reached maximum swelling earlier and who had older infants, two indicators linked to a greater chance of ovulation.

Flexible Mating Strategies Maintain an Imperfect System

These findings reveal that males improve their reproductive success by combining information about swelling patterns with knowledge of a female's reproductive history. Because males are able to estimate fertility reasonably well despite the lack of a precise signal, the researchers suggest there has been little evolutionary pressure to make the signal more accurate. This may help explain why the system has persisted over long evolutionary timescales.

The authors add, ""In this study, we found that bonobo males, instead of trying to predict precise ovulation timing, use a flexible strategy -- paying attention to the end-signal cue of the sexual swelling along with infant age -- to fine-tune their mating efforts. This finding reveals that even imprecise signals can remain evolutionarily functional when animals use them flexibly rather than expecting perfect accuracy. Our results help explain how conspicuous but noisy ovulatory signals, like those of bonobos, can persist and shape mating strategies in complex social environments.""

Researchers Reflect on Months of Field Observation

""The male bonobos weren't the only ones paying close attention to sexual swelling -- we spent countless days in the rainforest at Wamba, DRC doing exactly the same thing! All that watching, sweating, and scribbling in our notebooks eventually paid off. By tracking these daily changes, we uncovered just how impressively bonobos can read meaning in a signal that seems noisy and confusing to us.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New quantum antenna reveals a hidden terahertz world","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032617.htm","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 04:13:18 GMT","

A research team from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw has introduced a new way to measure hard-to-detect terahertz signals using a ""quantum antenna."" In their work, the scientists applied an innovative radio wave detection setup based on Rydberg atoms that not only senses terahertz radiation, but also accurately calibrates a so-called frequency comb in this part of the spectrum. Until recently, the terahertz range was considered a blank area in the electromagnetic spectrum, and the method reported in the journal Optica opens the door to extremely sensitive spectroscopy and a new class of room-temperature quantum sensors.

Terahertz (THz) radiation, being part of the electromagnetic spectrum, lies at the boundary of electronics and optics, positioned between microwaves (used, for example, in Wi-Fi) and infrared. Although it holds immense potential for applications that include inspecting packages without harmful X-rays, superspeed 6G communication, and spectroscopy and imaging of organic compounds, turning this potential into precise and sensitive measurements has been technically very difficult. In the past few years, scientists have made major strides in both generating and detecting terahertz radiation, yet until now they had not been able to measure a frequency comb in this region with the required precision.

Frequency combs as ultra-precise electromagnetic rulers

Why is this so important? Frequency combs, which earned a Nobel Prize in 2005, can be imagined as an incredibly accurate ruler made not from a solid material, but from light or radio waves. Instead of millimeter markings, there is a sequence of evenly spaced lines (""teeth"") at strictly defined frequencies. This ""electromagnetic ruler"" lets physicists determine the frequency of an unknown signal with extraordinary accuracy simply by seeing which ""tooth"" it matches. Because of this, frequency combs act as reference standards that can be used to calibrate and stabilize many types of instruments over a wide range of frequencies. Depending on where in the electromagnetic spectrum this ruler sits, scientists talk about optical, radio, or terahertz frequency combs.

Terahertz frequency combs are particularly attractive because they can support calibration and highly accurate measurements in a band where the oscillation frequencies are higher than typical radio waves but lower than optical waves (light). However, such combs are notoriously difficult to measure with high precision, since their oscillations are too rapid for conventional electronics and cannot be directly captured with standard optical methods. Researchers have been able to determine the spacing between the comb ""teeth"" and to measure the total power spread across the spectrum, but determining how much power belongs to a single tooth has remained a major challenge.

Rydberg atoms turned into quantum antennas

The scientists from the Faculty of Physics and the Centre for Quantum Optical Technologies at the Centre of New Technologies, University of Warsaw have now overcome this obstacle and, for the first time, measured the signal emitted by a single terahertz comb tooth. To achieve this, they employed a gas of rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state. A Rydberg atom is defined as having a single electron excited to a very high orbit by being illuminated with precisely tuned lasers. This ""swollen"" atom acts as a quantum antenna that is extremely sensitive to external electric fields. In addition, by using tunable lasers, the detector can be adjusted to respond to one specific frequency within such a field, across a range that extends up to terahertz waves.

Traditionally, in Rydberg electrometry, the phenomenon of Autler-Townes splitting is used to measure the electric field. Its huge advantage is that the measurement result depends only on fundamental atomic constants, providing an absolutely calibrated readout. Unlike classical antennas, which require laborious calibration in specialized radio laboratories, the atomic-based system is, in a sense, a standard unto itself. Moreover, thanks to the richness of energy states in the atom, such a sensor can be tuned almost continuously over an enormous range, from a direct current (DC) signal up to the aforementioned terahertz.

Hybrid terahertz to light conversion for extreme sensitivity

However, this method has a limitation: on its own, it is not sensitive enough to record very weak terahertz signals. To remedy this, the research team additionally applied a radio wave-to-light conversion technique invented at the University of Warsaw and adapted it to the needs of terahertz radiation. In this process, the weak terahertz signal is converted into optical photons, which can then be detected with immense sensitivity using single-photon counters. This hybrid approach is the key to success: it combines the extreme sensitivity of photon detection with the ability to ""recover"" the calibration capabilities of the Autler-Townes method even for the weakest signals.

The sensor based on Rydberg atoms possesses all the features needed to perform precise frequency comb calibration: it can be tuned to a single tooth of the comb, and then retuned to the next, and the next. The scientists managed to observe several dozen teeth in a very wide frequency range this way. Additionally, thanks to the knowledge of the fundamental properties of atoms, the comb was directly calibrated, precisely determining its intensity.

New path for terahertz metrology and future technologies

The results obtained by the physicists from the University of Warsaw Wiktor Krokosz, Jan Nowosielski, Bartosz Kasza, Sebastian Borówka, Mateusz Mazelanik, Wojciech Wasilewski, and Michał Parniak represent much more than the development of another sensitive detector. Their work lays the groundwork for a new area of metrology. With the help of Rydberg atoms, the transformative uses of optical frequency combs can now be extended into the previously difficult terahertz region. Importantly, unlike many quantum technologies that require extremely low temperatures, this system functions at room temperature, which greatly lowers costs and makes future commercialization more realistic. This creates an opportunity to build reference measurement standards for the coming generation of terahertz technologies.

The project ""Quantum Optical Technologies"" (FENG.02.01-IP.05-0017/23) is implemented as part of Measure 2.1 International Research Agendas of the Foundation for Polish Science, co-financed by the European Union from Priority 2 of the European Funds for Modern Economy Programme 2021-2027 (FENG). The research is also one of the results of the SONATA17 and PRELUDIUM23 projects funded by the National Science Centre.)

When gas falls onto a compact object, such as a neutron star or black hole, due to its strong gravity (a process called accretion), it emits electromagnetic waves. High-sensitivity observations have discovered objects with extremely high X-ray luminosities. One possible explanation for the ultraluminosity is that an extraordinary amount of gas falls onto a compact object through a process called supercritical accretion. However, the mechanism of supercritical accretion remains unclear.

The research team focused on NGC 7793 P13 (hereafter, P13), which is a neutron star in supercritical accretion, located in the galaxy NGC 7793 (about 10 million light-years from the Earth). As gas falls onto a neutron star, it forms a column structure (called an accretion column) on magnetic poles, from which intense X-ray is thought to be emitted. Then, coherent X-ray pulsation accompanied by the rotation of a neutron star can be detected. According to previous studies, P13 rotates with a period of 0.4 s with a constant acceleration rate. Moreover, the luminosity changed by more than two orders of magnitude in about 10 years. Both rotation velocity and luminosity are effective parameters to estimate the amount of gas accreted. However, the relation between them was not found for P13.

The research team investigated the long-term evolution of the X-ray luminosity and rotation period of P13 from 2011 to 2024, using the archival data of XMM-Newton, Chandra, NuSTAR, and NICER. It was found that P13 was in a faint phase in 2021 and started to be bright again in 2022. By 2024, it reached a high luminosity, more than two orders of magnitude higher than in 2021. Moreover, in the rebrightening phase in 2022, the acceleration rate of the rotation velocity was increased by a factor of 2, and it was maintained until 2024. This result suggests a relationship between X-ray luminosity and rotation velocity, and that the accretion system changed during the faint phase. The research team then focused on the pulsation and performed detailed analyses. It was suggested that the height of the accretion column was changed with the 10-year flux modulation. Those results are expected to be clues to reveal the mechanism of supercritical accretion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Webb finds a hidden atmosphere on a molten super-Earth","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032607.htm","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:03:29 GMT","

Researchers using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope have found the clearest sign so far that a rocky planet beyond our solar system is wrapped in an atmosphere.

Their observations of the ultra-hot super-Earth TOI-561 b indicate that this exoplanet is likely enveloped in a thick layer of gases sitting above a global ocean of molten rock.

The team reported the results on December 11 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. They explain that the new data help account for the planet's surprisingly low density and challenge the long-standing idea that relatively small planets orbiting very close to their stars cannot hold on to atmospheres.

Extreme orbit and ultra-short period super-Earth

TOI-561 b has a radius about 1.4 times that of Earth and completes one orbit in less than 11 hours, placing it in a rare group known as ultra-short period exoplanets.

Its host star is only slightly smaller and cooler than the Sun, but TOI-561 b circles it at an extremely close distance -- less than one million miles or one-fortieth the distance between Mercury and the Sun -- which almost certainly locks one side permanently facing the star. On this unending dayside, temperatures are expected to soar far beyond the melting point of typical rock.

Co-author Dr. Anjali Piette, from the University of Birmingham, said: ""We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations. Strong winds would cool the dayside by transporting heat over to the nightside.

""Gases like water vapor would absorb some wavelengths of near-infrared light emitted by the surface before they make it all the way up through the atmosphere. The planet would look colder because the telescope detects less light, but it's also possible that there are bright silicate clouds that cool the atmosphere by reflecting starlight.""

Probing the planet's unusual low density

One possible explanation the researchers explored for the planet's low density is that TOI-561 b might contain a relatively small iron core along with a mantle made of rock that is less dense than Earth's interior.

Lead author Johanna Teske, staff scientist at Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory, said: ""What really sets this planet apart is its anomalously low density. It is less dense than you would expect if it had an Earth-like composition.

""TOI-561 b is distinct among ultra-short period planets in that it orbits a very old, iron-poor star -- twice as old as our sun -- in a region of the Milky Way known as the thick disk. It must have formed in a very different chemical environment from planets in our own solar system.""

Because of this, the planet's make-up may resemble worlds that formed when the universe itself was still relatively young.

A thick atmosphere above a global magma ocean

The team also proposed that TOI-561 b could be wrapped in a substantial atmosphere that makes the planet appear larger than its solid body alone. Although theory suggests that small planets left for billions of years in intense stellar radiation should lose any gases they once had, a few such worlds still show signs that they are not just bare rock or exposed lava.

Using Webb's NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) to measure the planet's dayside temperature based on its near-infrared brightness, researchers tested the idea that TOI-561 b has an atmosphere. The method involves tracking the drop in brightness of the combined star and planet system when the planet moves behind the star. It is similar to techniques used to search for atmospheres in the TRAPPIST-1 system and on other small rocky exoplanets.

If TOI-561 b were simply a bare rocky surface with no atmosphere to move heat to the nightside, its illuminated hemisphere should reach about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 degrees Celsius). Instead, the NIRSpec data indicate that the dayside temperature is closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1,800 degrees Celsius) -- still extremely hot, but significantly cooler than expected.

Testing heat transport and atmospheric scenarios

To account for this lower-than-expected temperature, the researchers evaluated several scenarios. A global magma ocean might move some heat from the dayside toward the nightside, but without an atmosphere the permanently dark side would solidify, limiting how much energy could be redistributed. A thin layer of rock vapor over the molten surface could exist, yet by itself this would not provide enough cooling to match the observations.

While the Webb measurements strongly support the presence of an atmosphere, an important puzzle remains: how can a relatively small planet that is bombarded by such intense radiation keep any atmosphere at all, especially one that appears so substantial?

Co-author Tim Lichtenberg from the University of Groningen, Netherlands, said: ""We think there is an equilibrium between the magma ocean and the atmosphere. While gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior. This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.""

Webb's long look at TOI-561 b and its broader mission

These findings come from the first results of Webb's General Observers Program 3860, which monitored the system continuously for more than 37 hours while TOI-561 b completed nearly four full orbits of its star. The team is now studying the complete data set in detail to chart how temperature varies around the entire planet and to better pin down the makeup of its atmosphere.

The James Webb Space Telescope is the world's premier space science observatory. Webb is solving mysteries in our solar system, looking beyond to distant worlds around other stars, and probing the mysterious structures and origins of our universe and our place in it. Webb is an international program led by NASA with its partners, ESA (European Space Agency) and CSA (Canadian Space Agency).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A clear new material could make windows super efficient","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251213032611.htm","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 03:56:49 GMT","

Physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder have developed a new window insulation material that could significantly improve how buildings manage heat around the world. Their creation functions somewhat like a high-tech form of Bubble Wrap, but it is designed for energy performance rather than packaging.

The material is called Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI. It can be manufactured as thick blocks or thin flexible sheets that attach to the interior surface of standard windows. At present, MOCHI is only produced in the laboratory and is not yet available to consumers, but the researchers report that it is durable and nearly completely see-through.

Because of its clarity, MOCHI maintains an unobstructed view, which sets it apart from many other window insulation products.

""To block heat exchange, you can put a lot of insulation in your walls, but windows need to be transparent,"" said Ivan Smalyukh, senior author of the study and a professor of physics at CU Boulder. ""Finding insulators that are transparent is really challenging.""

The research team published its findings on Dec. 11 in the journal Science.

Why Window Heat Loss Matters

Buildings of all kinds, from houses to large office towers, account for about 40% of global energy consumption. Much of that energy is wasted as heat escapes to the outdoors during winter or enters buildings during hot weather.

Smalyukh and his collaborators hope MOCHI will slow that unwanted heat flow.

The new material is a silicone-based gel with a complex internal structure. It contains air trapped within extremely fine pores that are far thinner than a human hair. These microscopic pockets make MOCHI an excellent thermal barrier. In fact, a sheet only 5 millimeters thick is enough to let a person safely hold a flame against it.

""No matter what the temperatures are outside, we want people to be able to have comfortable temperatures inside without having to waste energy,"" said Smalyukh, a fellow at the Renewable And Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) at CU Boulder.

How MOCHI Controls Light and Heat

Smalyukh described the key to MOCHI's performance as its precisely arranged air pockets.

The new material shares similarities with aerogels, which are well-known insulators used in many industries. (NASA uses aerogels inside its Mars rovers to keep electronics warm). Aerogels also rely on air-filled pores, but those pores are typically arranged in a random pattern that scatters light. This is why aerogels often appear cloudy and are sometimes referred to as ""frozen smoke.""

The CU Boulder team wanted an insulating material that would maintain clarity while providing strong thermal resistance.

To build MOCHI, researchers combined surfactant molecules with a liquid mixture. These molecules naturally cluster into thread-like shapes, somewhat like the separation that occurs when oil and vinegar form layers in salad dressing. Silicone molecules in the same mixture attach themselves to the surface of those tiny threads.

Through several controlled steps, the researchers then remove the detergent clusters and replace them with air. This leaves behind a silicone framework surrounding a network of ultra-small, air-filled channels. Smalyukh likens the intricate pattern to a ""plumber's nightmare.""

Air accounts for more than 90% of MOCHI's volume.

Stopping Heat at the Molecular Scale

Heat travels through a gas in a way similar to a billiards-style chain reaction. Energy causes gas molecules and atoms to move faster and collide with one another, passing heat along as they strike.

The pores inside MOCHI are so tiny that the gas molecules cannot freely collide. Instead, they repeatedly hit the silicone walls, which prevents heat from easily spreading through the material.

""The molecules don't have a chance to collide freely with each other and exchange energy,"" Smalyukh said. ""Instead, they bump into the walls of the pores.""

Despite this strong heat blocking ability, MOCHI reflects only about .2% of incoming light, allowing nearly all visible light to pass through.

Potential Uses and Future Development

The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat. One possibility is a device that captures warmth from sunlight and converts it into low-cost, sustainable energy.

""Even when it's a somewhat cloudy day, you could still harness a lot of energy and then use it to heat your water and your building interior,"" Smalyukh said.

For now, MOCHI is not ready for commercial release. Its laboratory production requires considerable time, although Smalyukh believes that more efficient manufacturing methods can be developed. The components used to make MOCHI are relatively low-cost, which supports the long-term potential for scaling the technology.

For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.

Co-authors of the study include Amit Bhardwaj, Blaise Fleury, Eldo Abraham and Taewoo Lee, all postdoctoral research associates in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder. Bohdan Senyuk, Jan Bart ten Hove and Vladyslav Cherpak, former postdoctoral researchers at CU Boulder, also contributed as co-authors.

You download a new app, eager to get past the sign-in page and all the pop-ups asking you if you're super sure you don't want to pay for the premium version. When you're almost there, the app asks you to agree to a lengthy privacy policy. If you're like me and you lack caution, you hastily check yes and move on.

This scenario is becoming an increasingly common problem as more gadgets require companion apps to control them. And sex toys are no exception.

With research showing that the global sex toy market continues to grow steadily—it's expected to top $80 billion by 2030—it only makes sense that this wildly popular electronics sector also turned to app-pairing technology. Of course, if you're worried about a paired app collecting data about how you're using the device, it might be alarming to consider what types of data a sex toy's app is tracking.

""App-connected sex toys could be collecting highly sensitive data,"" says Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at the consumer research site Comparitech. Walsh says the types of data collected potentially include sexual behavior data, usage frequency, intensity settings, partner connections, location data, and IP addresses. ""Sexual behavior data,"" explains Walsh, refers to information such as which toy you're using, how you're using it, and which functions you're using. If the toy has an app that enables you to connect with another partner for long-distance play, then the app could also collect data from whoever you're using it with.

Most companies that collect data will claim they're doing so to improve their products–if, for instance, they're collecting data on which modes or intensities are being used and notice most users are keeping it on the highest setting, they might use this information to make future toys that offer stronger vibrations. Companies can also use the data to market new features or products to you. A spokesperson for the sex toy brand Lelo tells me data collection is used to help the company better tailor any marketing or advertisements it might target you with.

But collected data can also end up being scooped up by data brokers if a company decides to sell its customer data to make a buck, says Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy. “Brokers can sell the data to anyone who wants it and can afford to pay for it. This can include the government, private investigators, advertisers, and any other nosy party,"" he says.

Paul Bischoff, a consumer privacy advocate at Comparitech also adds that the reason some sex toy companies will sell information to data brokers is simply to create a second stream of revenue. “Brokers can then match and package it with data they've collected from other sources, then sell it to advertisers who use it to target their audience. Each app user's data is associated with an email address, device ID, IP address, tracking cookie, or some other identifier used to target them with ads,” Bischoff says. That means any collected data that ends up being sold is passing through quite a few parties.

Whether or not you can opt out of your data being sold—or even be notified in the first place—depends on where you live, Bischoff says, as the laws requiring companies to notify you differ between US states and other regions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act requires that businesses disclose to Californians if they sell their personal information and provide those consumers a right to opt out.

If you're already feeling a little skeezed out, know that there are steps you can take to protect your privacy. Since you don't need to own a sex toy to download its app, I was able to do some exploring. I downloaded various sex toy apps to look at what kinds of information they were asking for and whether they were requesting my permission before accessing my personal information or the various components of my phone.

Let's start with Siri. Apple says that although there are laws in place preventing apps from automatically enabling permissions, many apps will still switch on Siri access when you download it, most commonly through the “Learn from this app” feature. Since Siri is part of Apple's operating system, Bischoff explains that although Siri won't see inside the app, Apple could still be privy to highly personal patterns such as when and how often you're using your toy. So for an extra layer of privacy, you may want to decline when the “Learn from this app” pop up appears on iPhones.

You can also take a look at the app's privacy information prior to download in your phone's app store. Look for language that states the app may collect data linked to your identity, including your contact information.

Wi-Fi-enabled toys may pose additional concerns. Sex toy manufacturer Svakom, for instance, drew attention back in 2015 when it started selling a vibrator, called the Siime Eye, with a unique design featuring a camera built into the tip. The toy's operation didn't just involve an app, but Wi-Fi as well. The toy's default Wi-Fi password to access the camera's stream was “88888888,” which anyone could find by reading the manual online. Customers who didn't bother to change the default were left with an easily hackable feed anyone in Wi-Fi range could watch. Yikes. (The brand has since discontinued the model.)

Despite that past vulnerability, Svakom's current app for its other connected products feels much safer. It lets you create an account, or skip registering and just use it as a guest. Furthermore, the company's privacy policy explicitly states that no data from unregistered users will be collected, and those users will still be able to access all of the app's functions. Other brands also offer this; We-Vibe's app offers a similar option for guest users.

The Satisfyer Connect app was also very forward about its privacy policy, allowing users to opt out of any data collection before continuing into the app. Additionally, Satisfyer's privacy policy was easy to read, divided into sections and using layman's terms as much as possible.

Anyone who uses app-connected sex toys might be sweating right now and questioning their purchase. Thankfully, there are steps you can take as safeguards.

Treat each sex toy's app like a physical product. If you're reading reviews before deciding on a sex toy, then do the same research for their app. You can find app reviews on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Some YouTube reviews or Reddit forums can be very thorough, as can the reviews on the company's product page. Users will often discuss how honest the brand was about the app's data usage intentions.

After you buy a toy or download the app, toggle off any permissions you're not comfortable granting. If you want to check which permissions are already enabled, head to your phone's settings and scroll down to “Apps”, tap on the app and look at what it has permission to access. Can it access your camera? Siri? Contacts? Toggling those off might make the app less useful, but the app will know far less about you as a result.

However, remember that just disabling access to your personal information doesn't fully protect you. These measures would still potentially leave the door open for companies to learn about certain behaviors, such as how often you log in, what buttons you press, and how you interact with the sex toy.

""Even with permissions toggled off to prevent an app-connected sex toy from accessing device-level features like your camera, microphone, GPS, and contacts, it doesn't definitively prevent the app from collecting behavioral data,” Walsh says.

Some apps will require you to enable specific permissions just to use it. This can vary based on your mobile operating system, but just because an app asks you to enable a specific permission doesn't mean the app will definitely use the information that permission exposes.

The privacy policies you encounter when launching an app can be long and filled with obscure jargon. But Katrina Rosseini, a cybersecurity expert at Ascendant Group, recommends scanning the policy for certain key phrases and words before clicking “OK” to dismiss it. She says to be wary of vague phrases like “we may share your data with trusted partners.”

Walsh also advises looking for specific keywords and phrases such as ""no third-party sharing,"" ""end-to-end encryption,"" and ""data anonymization."" The latter two are indicators that the company has processes in place to protect its users' privacy by either encrypting your data so it cannot be read by anyone other than the person you're sending it to, or by erasing identifying information that connects you to the data.

Rosseini also says the length of time the company stores your data is important. When I downloaded the app from the sex toy company, Lelo, I clicked on several of the sex advice articles offered inside the app. Everything I clicked on was subsequently stored in the app's history, and I was not given the option to clear that history. Everything I ever clicked on has been listed there since I downloaded the app in August of 2024.

When pressed on its data storage policies, Lelo replied vaguely, saying “We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. The specific retention period depends on the type of data and the context in which it was collected.” The company also noted that deleting the app does not delete your data from its servers, and that if you want your data deleted from its servers, you'll need to contact Lelo using the phone number listed in its privacy policy.

Some apps will outline this in their privacy policy, though. Before letting you into the app, the Satisfyer Connect app tell you it deletes its logs every 60 days.

If you're looking to delete your data and make sure it's completely gone, don't just delete the app. Also delete your user account, as well as any data stored on the company's servers.

At the end of the day, clear policies outlining intentions are critical as they enable users to make educated decisions about their app usage. Doing your homework on the app and the company's data policies are just as important as doing your homework on the toy itself. It's the only way to know if your vibrator is indeed spying on you.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Among the myriad abilities that humans possess, which ones are uniquely human? Language has been a top candidate at least since Aristotle, who wrote that humanity was “the animal that has language.” Even as large language models such as ChatGPT superficially replicate ordinary speech, researchers want to know if there are specific aspects of human language that simply have no parallels in the communication systems of other animals or artificially intelligent devices.

In particular, researchers have been exploring the extent to which language models can reason about language itself. For some in the linguistic community, language models not only don't have reasoning abilities, they can't. This view was summed up by Noam Chomsky, a prominent linguist, and two coauthors in 2023, when they wrote in The New York Times that “the correct explanations of language are complicated and cannot be learned just by marinating in big data.” AI models may be adept at using language, these researchers argued, but they're not capable of analyzing language in a sophisticated way.

Gašper Beguš, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley.

That view was challenged in a recent paper by Gašper Beguš, a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley; Maksymilian Dąbkowski, who recently received his doctorate in linguistics at Berkeley; and Ryan Rhodes of Rutgers University. The researchers put a number of large language models, or LLMs, through a gamut of linguistic tests—including, in one case, having the LLM generalize the rules of a made-up language. While most of the LLMs failed to parse linguistic rules in the way that humans are able to, one had impressive abilities that greatly exceeded expectations. It was able to analyze language in much the same way a graduate student in linguistics would—diagramming sentences, resolving multiple ambiguous meanings, and making use of complicated linguistic features such as recursion. This finding, Beguš said, “challenges our understanding of what AI can do.”

This new work is both timely and “very important,” said Tom McCoy, a computational linguist at Yale University who was not involved with the research. “As society becomes more dependent on this technology, it's increasingly important to understand where it can succeed and where it can fail.” Linguistic analysis, he added, is the ideal test bed for evaluating the degree to which these language models can reason like humans.

One challenge of giving language models a rigorous linguistic test is making sure they don't already know the answers. These systems are typically trained on huge amounts of written information—not just the bulk of the internet, in dozens if not hundreds of languages, but also things like linguistics textbooks. The models could, in theory, simply memorize and regurgitate the information that they've been fed during training.

To avoid this, Beguš and his colleagues created a linguistic test in four parts. Three of the four parts involved asking the model to analyze specially crafted sentences using tree diagrams, which were first introduced in Chomsky's landmark 1957 book, Syntactic Structures. These diagrams break sentences down into noun phrases and verb phrases and then further subdivide them into nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and so forth.

One part of the test focused on recursion—the ability to embed phrases within phrases. “The sky is blue” is a simple English sentence. “Jane said that the sky is blue” embeds the original sentence in a slightly more complex one. Importantly, this process of recursion can go on forever: “Maria wondered if Sam knew that Omar heard that Jane said that the sky is blue” is also a grammatically correct, if awkward, recursive sentence.

Recursion has been called one of the defining characteristics of human language by Chomsky and others—and indeed, perhaps a defining characteristic of the human mind. Linguists have argued that its limitless potential is what gives human languages their ability to generate an infinite number of possible sentences out of a finite vocabulary and a finite set of rules. So far, there's no convincing evidence that other animals can use recursion in a sophisticated way.

Recursion can occur at the beginning or end of a sentence, but the form that is most challenging to master, called center embedding, takes place in the middle—for instance, going from “the cat died” to “the cat the dog bit died.”

Beguš' test fed the language models 30 original sentences that featured tricky examples of recursion. For example: “The astronomy the ancients we revere studied was not separate from astrology.” Using a syntactic tree, one of the language models—OpenAI's o1—was able to determine that the sentence was structured like so:

The astronomy [the ancients [we revere] studied] was not separate from astrology.

The model then went further and added another layer of recursion to the sentence:

The astronomy [the ancients [we revere [who lived in lands we cherish]] studied] was not separate from astrology.

Beguš, among others, didn't anticipate that this study would come across an AI model with a higher-level “metalinguistic” capacity–“the ability not just to use a language but to think about language,” as he put it.

That is one of the “attention-getting” aspects of their paper, said David Mortensen, a computational linguist at Carnegie Mellon University who was not involved with the work. There has been debate about whether language models are just predicting the next word (or linguistic token) in a sentence, which is qualitatively different from the deep understanding of language that humans have. “Some people in linguistics have said that LLMs are not really doing language,” he said. “This looks like an invalidation of those claims.”

McCoy was surprised by o1's performance in general, particularly by its ability to recognize ambiguity, which is “famously a difficult thing for computational models of language to capture,” he said. Humans “have a lot of commonsense knowledge that enables us to rule out the ambiguity. But it's difficult for computers to have that level of commonsense knowledge.”

A sentence such as “Rowan fed his pet chicken” could be describing the chicken that Rowan keeps as a pet, or it could be describing the meal of chicken meat that he gave to his (presumably more traditional) animal companion. The o1 model correctly produced two different syntactic trees, one that corresponds to the first interpretation of the sentence and one that corresponds to the latter.

The researchers also carried out experiments related to phonology—the study of the pattern of sounds and of the way the smallest units of sound, called phonemes, are organized. To speak fluently, like a native speaker, people follow phonological rules that they might have picked up through practice without ever having been explicitly taught. In English, for example, adding an “s” to a word that ends in a “g” creates a “z” sound, as in “dogs.” But an “s” added to a word ending in “t” sounds more like a standard “s,” as in “cats.”

In the phonology task, the group made up 30 new mini-languages, as Beguš called them, to find out whether the LLMs could correctly infer the phonological rules without any prior knowledge. Each language consisted of 40 made-up words. Here are some example words from one of the languages:

θalpʃebreði̤zṳga̤rbo̤nda̤ʒi̤zṳðe̤jo

They then asked the language models to analyze the phonological processes of each language. For this language, o1 correctly wrote that “a vowel becomes a breathy vowel when it is immediately preceded by a consonant that is both voiced and an obstruent”—a sound formed by restricting airflow, like the “t” in “top.”

The languages were newly invented, so there's no way that o1 could have been exposed to them during its training. “I was not expecting the results to be as strong or as impressive as they were,” Mortensen said.

How far can these language models go? Will they get better, without limit, simply by getting bigger—layering on more computing power, more complexity and more training data? Or are some of the characteristics of human language the result of an evolutionary process that is limited to our species?

The recent results show that these models can, in principle, do sophisticated linguistic analysis. But no model has yet come up with anything original, nor has it taught us something about language we didn't know before.

If improvement is just a matter of increasing both computational power and the training data, then Beguš thinks that language models will eventually surpass us in language skills. Mortensen said that current models are somewhat limited. “They're trained to do something very specific: given a history of tokens [or words], to predict the next token,” he said. “They have some trouble generalizing by virtue of the way they're trained.”

But in view of recent progress, Mortensen said he doesn't see why language models won't eventually demonstrate an understanding of our language that's better than our own. “It's only a matter of time before we are able to build models that generalize better from less data in a way that is more creative.”

The new results show a steady “chipping away” at properties that had been regarded as the exclusive domain of human language, Beguš said. “It appears that we're less unique than we previously thought we were.”

7/10

Oft-compared to Lotus, the Alpine brand has drifted in and out of focus over the years despite seven decades of idiosyncratic road cars and regular motorsport success. It's currently in Formula One and the World Endurance Championship, and its A110 sports car is a masterpiece of lightweight analogue driving entertainment. No slouches, then.

On top of all this, a global expansion of Alpine is planned, too, seeing the brand enter new markets, including the US, where it's expected to launch a three-car electric lineup in 2027.

For now, as the future is electric, the requirement for greater global awareness rests with the A390. It's an unusual proposition, on the face of it—a genuine five-door sports coupe that builds out on the design attributes that made the A110 so much more than a retro pastiche. You can see the connection in the side profile and shoulders, although the front end's air curtains and bonnet blades have a model-specific aero functionality.

We're less sure about the triangles etched into the nose (Alpine names them, quite unforgivably, “cosmic dust” for some reason), or the snowflake-aping alloy wheel design. Overall, though, it's individual (Alpine is calling it a “race car in a suit”), and that's a win given the soul-crushingly generic nature of so many new EVs.

The A390's electric motors are manufactured in a dedicated facility in Cléon, the NMC batteries sourced from a company called Verkor, but with modules produced in Dunkirk and assembled in the Renault Group facility in Douai. The chassis, meanwhile, was designed and built at the company's Le Mans plant.

As with the smaller A290 and indeed with various Renaults (the 4, 5 and incoming Twingo), this is an EV for the committed Francophile. Alpine isn't just leveraging its quirky past, it's an avatar for the wider Group's technical prowess.

The platform is an evolution of the AmpR Medium architecture that's already in service beneath the Megane E-Tech and Scenic, and Nissan's Arya and Leaf, a necessary synergy given the vast cost of developing these things. But some notable lengths have been gone to here in order to differentiate the A390 and justify the investment and Porsche-baiting aspirations.

“The driving force behind the A390's dynamics was to make it as fast and agile as the A110,” Vehicle Projects VP Robert Bonetto says. “To achieve this, we had to eliminate the impact of the battery's weight with a technical solution to enhance the perceived lightness.”

“Perceived” being the key word here. The A110 is beloved of diehard car fans because it only weighs 1,140 kg, a stellar achievement in this day and age. The A390 is approximately twice that, unavoidable given its mode of propulsion, but sticks as close as possible to Alpine's primary recipe. The 89 kWh battery uses a new chemistry and cooling system for more sustained power and performance, and more efficient charging and discharging.

The A390 is also unique in this segment by having three motors, a coil one on the front axle and two permanent synchronous ones on each of the rear wheels, for a total power output of 396 bhp in GT guise, rising to 463 bhp in GTS form.

That's enabled the engineers to deliver independent wheel control at the rear, and to sharpen the dynamics and obviate the car's weight via active torque vectoring. That varies the amount of slip at each wheel and adjusts the amount of torque right to left to optimize handling responses. There's an additional torque split with the front motor, too.

This is clever stuff, backed up by Alpine's decision to use passive damping in its suspension rather than an adaptive, multi-mode system that adds weight, cost and complexity. Nor is there four-wheel steering or active anti-roll, hi-tech tricks generally used to atone for dynamic failings. This is the sort of confident thinking you'd hope for from a company steeped in motorsport, and run by a former Ferrari R&D boss (Philippe Krief, although he's French not Italian) with some of the Prancing Horse's greatest modern hits on his CV.

Despite the undeniable element of cost-saving here, the result is an EV whose handling and ride are satisfyingly pure whilst feeling grown-up and expensively engineered. Although Alpine insists it's a fastback rather than a quasi-SUV, you sit high enough to seed doubts about a compromised center of gravity, despite the batteries' skateboard configuration. Yet the A390 moves with a grace and fluidity that confirms that the same people who worked wonders on the lissom mid-engined A110 coupe have delivered the goods here, too.

Only the GT was available to test, but it's easily fast enough for most drivers, 0 to 62 mph taking 4.8 seconds, the punchy mid-range a more useful everyday metric. Five drive modes are available, including a Sport and Track set-up that allows the driver to reconfigure steering effort, throttle response, and the aggressiveness of the torque vectoring. A Live Data graphic on the central display allows you to see exactly what each wheel is contending with in specific moments, up to and including a little oversteer, if that's your bag. Although, if you are going sideways, it won't be the data display you'll be looking at.

Mostly, the A390's torque vectoring wants to sharpen the front end and neutralize the rear, and the upshot is a car of less extrovert behaviour but more polished overall dynamics than the highly amusing Hyundai Ioniq 5 N. The brakes are good, too, a blue rotary dial on the steering wheel offering levels of regen up to one-pedal operation. There's also a red “boost” button for an extra slug of power or when using launch control. It's that or your right foot.

Inside, the kinship with the Megane E-Tech is apparent, though the A390 does its best to hide it with a variety of tactile materials including Alcantara and Nappa leather. The instrument display is configurable and dense with info, as is the central touchscreen whose menus are nonetheless easy to navigate. A page of telematics and coaching software underscores the Alpine's racy mien, and there's also a terrific audio system from French specialist, Devialet.

Some of the parts bin switchgear, however, feels a little clunky and old-fashioned. But at least it's still physically there, and Alpine hasn't migrated everything to the touchscreen. As with the drive modes, the ADAS settings can be personalized and saved. It's a neat solution. Less so the rear accommodation, hurt by the high seating position and low roofline.

The A390 features bi-directional charging, which is becoming more commonplace but still retains an air of novelty. So it delivers vehicle-to-load (V2L) charging as standard, enabling you to charge the e-bike which is the likeliest accompaniment to the A390, given Alpine's high-ish level lifestyle aspirations.

Assuming you have the appropriate home charger, it also offers vehicle-to-grid compatibility, so you can buy cheaper rate power at night, store it and sell it back to the grid. Renault's Mobilize division has been working on this for a while for UK customers; it should happen in 2026, but it's available in other markets already.

Alpine A390

Rating: 7/10

Peak rapid charging is 190 kW for the GTS (150 kW for the GT, due to differing battery chemistry), which is good if not outstanding. Alpine insists that maintaining a high charging power for longer periods is just as significant. The A390 will charge from 10 to 80 percent in less than 25 minutes, and you can manually set the battery to pre-heat.

Google Maps navigation includes an EV route planner, which helps reduce the stress of a longer journey by considering all the major variables: route, charge level, battery temperature, and real-time consumption. Alpine claims 325 miles range on the WLTP standard for the GTS, 340 for the GT. WIRED saw around 2.9 miles per kWh, but that was during enthusiastic driving. Expect around 290 miles real world in the GT.

Prices are yet to be fixed, but the A390 GT is likely to start at around £60,000 in the UK, £70,000 for the GTS. That drops it directly into territory patrolled very effectively by the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N, Polestar 4 and Porsche Macan, among others. But in addition to useful tech and its undoubted handling smarts, the A390 also locates something that's rarer than it should be in the fast-evolving EV world: real character.

6/10

I have had the new M5-powered Apple Vision Pro and Samsung Galaxy XR headsets sitting on my desk for several weeks. These are expensive, cutting-edge pieces of hardware. Apple's version is $3,499! Samsung's headset is roughly half that—still a pretty penny at $1,800. Mustering the energy to don them has been a task.

You can watch movies, play immersive games, and get some work done with multiple virtual screens. None of these experiences has been so compelling that I want to wear a headset on my face for more than an hour. Still, I gave it the ol' college try, and my takeaway is that Google and Samsung have more work ahead of them to improve the Android XR experience; I've also had a strange and newfound appreciation for the quality of Apple's mixed reality headset.

I purchased the Galaxy XR from Samsung's website, and the company offers a handy link to EyeBuyDirect, where you can buy prescription Kodak magnetic inserts for $100 so you can use the headset without glasses. The process was seamless, though long shipping times meant my inserts arrived weeks before the XR.

While I appreciate how much more lightweight the Galaxy XR is compared to the Vision Pro, I constantly struggled to find a comfortable fit. You put the headset on and turn a knob at the back to tighten the band around your head, but there's often a good amount of pressure resting on your forehead, which also gets warm when the audible fans kick in; it's near impossible not to have a sweaty brow after a bout in XR. Two magnetic light shields in the box do a decent job of blocking ambient light from filtering into your virtual reality, but they're not perfect, as I still encountered some slight light bleed.

The Galaxy XR routinely told me to shift the headset up or down whenever I popped it on my head, and while I occasionally could find a fit that worked for a spell, I wouldn't call it comfortable. The included forehead cushion helps a bit, but I wouldn't have minded softer padding. Surprisingly, I found Apple's Vision Pro with the new Dual Knit Band immensely more supportive. Because there are two points where you can customize the fit, it rests much better on the head.

The visual quality of Samsung's 4K micro-OLED display is excellent and one of the highlights of the Galaxy XR. Everything generally looks sharp. I enjoyed watching a few episodes of Stranger Things season 5 on the headset, and I spent a fair amount of time playing Grimvalor with a paired PlayStation 5 DualSense controller.

Overall, the gesture-based navigation and eye tracking are fine, though not quite as precise as Apple's system in the Vision Pro. Sometimes the iris unlock wouldn't work, forcing me to input my PIN to unlock the headset. I'd often have trouble getting the eye tracking to land on exactly the right virtual button, so I'd have to resort to the pointer-style finger gesture to make selections. (And yes, I did try recalibrating the eye tracking.)

Where the Vision Pro can pick up on minute changes I make with my fingers, I found myself needing to be more pronounced with my gestures on the Galaxy XR. Sometimes I'd have to make sure my fingers were facing the headset for selections to work, but I never had to do that with the Vision Pro. On the Galaxy XR, there were far more occasions where my virtual screens just moved around because it thought I was making a pinch gesture. Even looking at my hand and pinching—how you evoke the home button—sometimes took multiple pinches to activate. The whole thing is rough around the edges.

That's without mentioning the other bugs. When I tried to work in Chrome and opened more than six tabs, Chrome stopped working and required a restart. My Telegram app did the same here and there, and so did Google Play Services when I tried to run Grimvalor once. I also had a problem with a paired mouse when I tried to get some virtual work done—the cursor kept disappearing, only appearing after a few seconds of shaking my mouse violently. It made it really difficult to work in the headset.

Initially, I couldn't pair the Galaxy XR to my PC because this feature requires a Samsung Galaxy Book laptop, but Google recently issued an update that introduced a beta app called PC Connect for Android XR. Download it on your Windows PC (Mac support is coming later), and it instantly brings your Windows desktop screen into the XR's space, and you can keep using your keyboard and mouse that are paired with your desktop. This was excellent and a much nicer way to work, rather than trying to recreate my workspace with Android apps, but I still had the issue with the mouse cursor periodically disappearing, so I was never able to really get much work done. It's not as seamless a system as Apple's Mac Virtual Display.

I did try Game Link, which requires you to download Samsung's Game Link app on the Microsoft Store on your PC, along with Steam and SteamVR. The idea is you'll be able to stream your Steam games, VR or otherwise, to the headset. Unfortunately, while I could briefly connect the Galaxy XR to the Game Link app, SteamVR consistently failed, and the entire prompt on the headset to connect controllers and continue the pairing process would disappear. There could be various things causing the issue, so it's hard to say if this is a Galaxy XR problem or something else. (It's worth noting that there are other ways to connect the Galaxy XR to your PC via third-party apps, but I didn't try them.)

What's nice about Android XR is that Samsung and Google aren't starting from scratch in terms of the app ecosystem. You can pretty much access any Android app and bring it into your virtual space, though some apps are better designed for this experience than others. (The Slack app still sucks on anything larger than a phone screen.)

A key feature of Android XR is the ability to chat with Google's Gemini chatbot willy-nilly. I did this a few times when I wanted to figure out how to connect the PS5 controller to the headset, and it pulled up YouTube video recommendations so I could watch a how-to. But bizarrely, Gemini repeatedly said things I don't think I'm meant to hear. When I looked at the chat transcript, it became clear that Gemini sometimes responded to my queries with its instructions on how to parse a command. “<\ctrl94> The user wants to open the Telegram app. I need to check if Telegram is installed on the device first. <\ctrl95>."" This happened multiple times when I invoked Gemini to ask a question. Remember, this isn't some prototype hardware device Samsung sent me; this is the consumer version I purchased myself.

I still don't know how often I would realistically chat with Gemini, even if the experience was more polished. In the same vein, I spent about two minutes looking at spatialized versions of my photos in the Google Photos app, said “neat,” and never cared to use the feature again. It's just not that interesting.

Don't get me started on my avatar. I customized a cartoonish Galaxy avatar to replicate my likeness; they look like Bitmoji (aka not great), and the avatar does a poor job of re-creating facial expressions. Minutes into my Zoom meeting with a coworker, he complained that it was hard to figure out what my face was trying to do and that he also couldn't hear me very well because the headset's mic kept cutting off.

Thankfully, Google came to the rescue with a recent update that added “Likeness,” designed to be a more realistic representation of yourself, like Apple's Personas. You have to download Google's Likeness app on your phone first and scan your face, then it'll send it to your Galaxy XR. It immediately looked more like me, but my eyes were weirdly wide, and anytime I made a mouth movement, it would show my full set of teeth. I video-called my wife via Google Meet, and she just said no, screenshotted my face, and posted it on her Instagram Story for all our friends to laugh at. I looked like I was on drugs.

The Galaxy XR is a niche product. I really like playing around with the latest and greatest tech, and I enjoy working spatially with the right hardware. I've had loads of fun in devices like the Meta Quest headset, playing games like SuperHot and Beat Saber. But headsets like the Galaxy XR and Vision Pro are simply too bulky, heavy, and annoying to wear for more than an hour. Putting them on feels like a chore, and I don't think they offer that much greater an experience than I can have in my non-virtual world. Heck, I don't even mind the tethered battery. If these can get drastically lighter, comfier, and smaller, I could see a world where I'd pop 'em on for a few hours and enjoy a virtual reality to get away from life. Unfortunately, we're still not there.

It was almost 100 years ago that Clyde W. Tombaugh discovered Pluto. That was the last planet found until 1992, when humans found another one. But this new planet wasn't in our solar system—it was orbiting another star. We call this an extrasolar planet, or “exoplanet” for short.

Since then, astronomers have cataloged more than 6,000 exoplanets. If you thought it was hard to remember the names of our own planets, try all the planets, with names like HD 189733b. (A jolly place where it rains molten glass and the wind blows 9,000 kilometers per hour.)

Even the closest exoplanets are more than 4 light years away (36 trillion miles), which makes it doubtful that we'll ever visit one—so why bother? The reason is, it helps us answer an age-old question: Are we alone in the universe? As far as we understand, you need a planet to have life, and the race is on to locate one with Earth-like qualities.

The problem is, you can't just take your best telescope and start looking around the sky. Telescopes have a limited resolving power—the smallest angular size they can “see.” For the Hubble Space Telescope that's 0.05 arc second, which is incredibly tiny—about 1/72,000th of a degree. The HST could make out a giant, Jupiter-size planet at a distance of 590 billion kilometers. That's amazing, but it's just 0.06 light year, and the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light years away.

Another problem is the dimness of planets. Sure, Jupiter is easy to see in our own night sky, because of the sunlight reflecting off its surface. But you can't see Jupiter at all during the day, because that reflected light is much dimmer than direct sunlight. It's the same for exoplanets. When we're looking at the light from a star, the planets around it just aren't bright enough to be discernable.

Luckily, there are other methods, and I'm going to explain the two that were used to find most of the exoplanets we know today. There's a bunch of cool physics here, so let's go!

What happens when a planet moves around a star? First, there's a gravitational interaction that pulls the planet in the direction of the star. The magnitude of this force (FG) depends on the mass of the star (M) and the planet (m), as well as the distance (r) between them:

(G is a gravitational constant, which we can ignore.) It's possible to use this force to make an object move in a circular path. Remember from Newton's second law, when a force acts on an object, the object accelerates, and we define acceleration as the change in the object's velocity.

However, velocity is speed in a certain direction, so changing direction is itself a type of acceleration. In orbital motion, we call this centripetal (center-pointing) acceleration, and it depends on both the radius (r) of the circular path and the speed of the object (v). Putting this together with the gravitational force from above, we get the following equation:

Yes, some stuff (like the planet's mass and the radius) cancel, but let's not worry about that now. You can see that there's a relation between the orbital radius and speed of the planet. Let's go ahead and model the motion of a planet as it moves around a star.

Oh! Do you see that? The star isn't stationary! I didn't tell you the whole story. If the star pulls on the planet, the planet also pulls back on the star. This is because forces are always an interaction between two objects (Newton again, third law). Since there's a gravitational pull on the star, it also moves in a circular orbit.

Obviously nothing in the simulation above is drawn to scale. A real star has vastly more mass than the planet, so the effect is tiny. Basically, the star just “jiggles.” We can't see the movement, but we can still detect it. How? From the Doppler effect.

This is something you already know about, even if you don't know you know it. When a speeding train goes by, its sound changes in pitch, from high to low. It's like NEEEEEEERrrrraawww … Right? Here's an animation to help you understand what's going on. Imagine a ball that emits sound waves at regular intervals. These waves then expand from their starting location. Now, if the ball is moving toward you, this is what happens:

See how the wave fronts get squished together? This means more waves hit your ear per second—i.e., they have a higher frequency, and we hear that as a higher pitch. Also, on the back side the waves get unsquished. If the ball moved away from you, the pitch would drop.

That's the Doppler effect, and it works with all wave phenomena—including, notably, light. When a light source is moving toward you, the frequency increases. For visible light, this means the color changes—it's shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum. We call that a blue shift. When it moves away, the color moves toward the red end—that's a red shift.

Voilà! Even though astronomers can't see a star wobbling, they can tell if it's moving by using a spectroscope to see how the light changes. But wait! There's more. If you know the original frequency, you can tell how fast the star is moving based on the frequency shift.

The only problem with this technique is that the amount of color shift depends on the speed of light and the speed of the source. Light moves really fast (3 x 108 meters per second), so that in most cases the Doppler shift is really hard to detect. Hard doesn't mean impossible, though.

So here's how you find an exoplanet: Observe a star for several years and look for small shifts in its color spectrum. Then use this to determine the speed at which the star moves toward and away from Earth. If we can estimate the mass of the star (we can), then using its velocity and period of oscillation (how long one oscillation takes), we can calculate the mass and orbital distance of the planet. Hurrah!

That's kind of a big deal. If you're hoping to find extraterrestrial life, you probably want to find an Earth-like planet in an Earth-like orbit—not too close to the sun and not too far, so that water can exist in a liquid state. It's a small window.

OK, here's the second way of detecting an exoplanet. Let's start by thinking about something familiar: a solar eclipse. This is when the moon passes in front of the sun, causing the moon's shadow to fall on Earth. In a total eclipse, the amount of light reaching Earth can be about 1,000 times less than normal. It looks like those “day-for-night” scenes in old movies.

Venus and Mercury also sometimes pass between the sun and Earth. We call these solar transits. They don't cast a shadow on Earth, but they do slightly decrease the overall solar brightness. (Fun fact: In the 1700s, the transit of Venus was used to calculate the distance from Earth to the sun.)

We can also get an exoplanet transit, when an extrasolar planet comes between its local star and our observation point on Earth. When that happens, the brightness of the star will decrease by just a tiny bit. Sensitive instruments can detect this change and figure out that there is an exoplanet around that star. This is how Kepler-10 b, the planet in the illustration up top was first discovered. (It was later confirmed by the stellar wobble and Doppler shift.)

If you could see this transit (which you totally can not see), it would look like this:

Now suppose you plotted the star's brightness, or intensity, as a function of time. During a transit, it might look something like this:

This is called a light curve, and there's a bunch of stuff we can figure out from it. The flat bottom of the depression is the part where the planet is fully in front of the star. The depth of the dip tells us the size of the planet. Bigger planets block more light.

Second, the length of the depression tells us how long the planet is in front of the star. We can use that to determine the orbital period (how long it takes to complete a full circle). If we know the mass of the star and the orbital velocity, then we can calculate the orbital distance.

Finally, we keep watching to see if this dip happens on a regular schedule—that's how we know we've got a legit exoplanet. It's even possible to get transits from multiple planets, and we can identify them from their signature light curves.

Of course, both methods have limits. Doppler effects get harder to suss out the farther away you're looking. And both require a specific favorable alignment. For example, if a distant planet system is perpendicular to our view from Earth, the star's wobble won't move it nearer and farther from us, so there'd be no Doppler shift.

For the transit method, the exoplanet has to orbit its star in a plane that includes Earth. If everything doesn't line up, we won't get a transit at all. Only a tiny percentage of solar systems will satisfy that condition.

Also, both detection methods are strongly biased toward finding large planets orbiting close to their stars—so-called “hot Jupiters”—because they cause bigger, more frequent signals. For Earth-like planets, you'd have to spend three years to get a minimally acceptable three-transit observation. And no one's going to detect an extrasolar version of Pluto, with its 250-year orbit.

Now think of the 6,000 exoplanets found so far. All but one are in the Milky Way, which leaves aside the “billions and billions” (more like trillions) of other galaxies. And almost all known exoplanets are larger than Earth, even though Earth-size planets are believed to be common. And each of the 6,000 were cases where the planets were aligned just right for us to detect them.

Then … how many planets are really out there? Current guesses put it in the vicinity of 100 sextillion (1 followed by 23 zeroes). So what do you think? Are we alone in the universe?

Another year, another update to Sony's PlayStation Portal. The latest tweak to the hardware considerably expands the roster of games playable on the device—but the end result only highlights how urgently PlayStation needs to re-enter the gaming handheld market for real.

The evolution of PlayStation Portal has been fascinating to watch, mainly to see Sony practically scrambling to keep up with the gadget's unexpected popularity. Launched November 2023, Portal was intended as a mere accessory for PlayStation 5. It had no native processing abilities, simply using Sony's Remote Play technology to stream whatever happened on players' personal PS5 to the portable's screen.

Although it could technically be used anywhere with a strong Wi-Fi signal, difficulties connecting to public networks and high speed requirements to even launch a stream meant the Portal was effectively only suitable for in-home use, to free up the main TV or play in another room.

Somehow, it still took off, with Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino saying in 2024 that the Portal had been a “huge success.” The same year, Sony made it easier to connect to public Wi-Fi and added actual cloud gaming support to Portal, with a selection of games on offer to players subscribing to PlayStation Plus Premium. The initial offering included “over 120 PS5 games from the PS Plus Game Catalog,” though the curated library was subject to change. It could have been a big shift in how players approached hardware and software alike, but, in practice, didn't really deliver.

Even so, another year on and the Portal's success seems unstoppable. Sony's Takuro Fushimi recently told TechRadar that ""the community's response has been overwhelming"" and that Portal is now the “most widely used device for PS5 Remote Play.” It's little surprise, then, that Sony keeps trying to hammer it into something that looks, if you squint, like the standalone gaming handheld it was never intended to be, but that players so desperately want.

Enter the newest update to PlayStation Portal. It takes Cloud Streaming out of its beta phase, expanding the streamable library from only those titles included in the PS Plus selection to many games digitally owned by players. Until now, if you didn't have a game installed locally on your PS5 or it wasn't included in that cloud catalog, too bad, no Portal play for you. Going forwards, you'll be able to cloud stream many titles if they're tied to your PlayStation account through purchase on the PlayStation Store—although you will still need to be subscribed at the PS Plus Premium tier to use the feature, which will set you back $160 for a full year.

The assortment available is already vast—more than 3,000 games at time of writing. On the face of it, this should be a transformative development for not just the Portal, but PlayStation as a gaming ecosystem. It potentially extends availability of titles you own to wherever you want to play them, and could even help alleviate data storage woes. Although the PS5's internal drives can be expanded, SSDs can be pricey at higher capacities, and players with large digital collections often can't install everything they own. Being able to stream games tied to your account without eating up drive space could be a great workaround.

The update also aims to improve the broader player experience on Portal. It finally adds the ability to make in-game purchases when cloud streaming (potentially useful if you want to buy some DLC or virtual currency), and allows players to receive game invites to multiplayer sessions when playing a game via the cloud. Previously, these features were only enabled for Remote Play gaming on Portal, since they were effectively being done through the PS5 and mirrored on the Portal's screen. Accessibility features have also been improved, adding a screen reader tool and adjustable text sizes.

The Portal has been a surprise hit for Sony—but it was never intended to be a standalone gaming handheld.

I was cautiously excited at the overhaul's potential, thinking it might help me tackle my ever-growing backlog of unfinished games. Lately, I've recently been trying to make my way through Koei Tecmo's Atelier Ryza trilogy, cozy but absolutely massive Japanese RPGs. I say ""trying"" because these are time sinks by any measure—around 80 hours each, with the recently released trilogy pack featuring the ""DX"" versions that add even more content, and there are only so many hours in the day that I can spend rotting in front of my PS5.

However, given all three are included in the new cloud streaming roster, being able to play them in shorter chunks on the go might be a great way to get through these gargantuan adventures. Plus, with Cloud Streaming out of beta, surely it's overcome its previous shoddy performance, right?

Unfortunately, wrong. For all the features Sony has added to Portal and the overall catalog it has access to, it is still fatally stymied by being a streaming-only piece of hardware. Sony officially states that “PlayStation Portal Remote Player requires broadband internet Wi-Fi with at least 5 Mbps for use. For a better play experience, a high-speed connection of at least 15 Mbps is recommended.” In reality, those numbers are woefully optimistic. Trying to connect to Sony's servers and stream a game on anything but a lightning-fast connection remains an exercise in frustration, and makes out-of-home play nigh-impossible.

Testing the Portal in a coffee shop, getting a network speed test result of 14.97 Mbps—just shy of that ""better experience"" number but 3x the supposed minimum requirement—an attempt to launch the first Atelier Ryza was met with an error message of “can't start the streaming game because of poor connection quality.” I tried to tether to my phone instead, getting a speed of 17.29 Mbps and with the Portal as the only connected device. I got the same failure to launch, but with a different error message: “Can't start the streaming game, try again.”

Thinking that perhaps my signal was slightly blocked by sitting towards the rear of the building, I moved to a table closer to the street, and reset the connection. Another speed test told me I might have been onto something, as I was now getting 37.14 Mbps—surely more than doubling the speed will help me play a game? Nope: “Can't start because your internet connection quality might not be sufficient to play streaming games.” Points for the variety of ways to say nothing works, I guess.

There are numerous reasons why connection speeds in any given network environment can fluctuate, but I was surprised that the experience now proved worse than the last time I tested the Portal in a coffee shop, where an even slower 11 Mbps connection sufficed to at least launch Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Gris, albeit not in great quality. This go around, I could log in and browse both the PS Plus catalog and my own library of digitally owned games, but absolutely nothing would play.

It's particularly annoying given that Sony's pitch for the new Cloud Streaming offering is that it “makes it easier to enjoy PS5 games on the go—at a hotel, café, friend's place, or anywhere else with a high-speed internet Wi-Fi connection.” In fact, at a friend's house was the only place I could get it working, thanks to an 802 Mbps connection speed—but it shouldn't take nearly 54x the recommended 15 Mbps for the Portal to perform its sole function.

Despite what Sony says about minimum speed requirements, in reality streaming games on the Portal needs a thumping great Wi-Fi connection.

So, if multiple attempts to morph the Portal into being a vaguely portable console have, charitably, underdelivered, there's only one path left for Sony: fully commit to a true, dedicated gaming handheld again.

It's easy to understand why Sony might be cautious on this, since its last effort—the brilliant but under-appreciated PlayStation Vita—failed to match the success of its predecessor, the PlayStation Portable (an estimated 14 to 16 million units sold, versus the PSP's 82.5 million). However, the market is vastly different now, and so are player expectations. The Nintendo Switch changed everything: rather than handhelds being bespoke systems with their own games, often cut-down versions of the titles enjoyed at home, there was now a system that offered the exact same experience wherever you went.

Players loved this, and seemingly everyone was copying the Switch's approach. By the time Portal launched in 2023, the Steam Deck was already riding high and had inspired a slate of rivals, all of which allowed PC gamers to take their libraries with them wherever they went. When the Switch 2 launched earlier in 2025, it went on to become the fastest-selling console ever. Even Xbox is trying to get in on the action, with its ROG Xbox Ally handhelds in partnership with Asus, and its ""Play Anywhere"" initiative.

The good news is Sony may be working on something of a course correction. Rumors have abounded since at least 2024 that a true successor to the Vita is in development, one that can supposedly natively play PS5 games. Others suggest that Sony will take a page from Nintendo's book and offer a hybrid device, with a handheld that slots into a power-boosting dock for at-home play, possibly as a companion device to the inevitable PlayStation 6. There's potentially very good incentive for that last approach, since a combo of the upcoming Steam Machine and Steam Deck could steal everyone's lunch.

While there are no official announcements from Sony on its future hardware plans—bar some very technical nuggets shared by PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny back in October 2025—there have been some purported leaks claiming that Sony is pushing developers to adopt the PS5's new ""Power Saver"" setting, which reduces performance of demanding games to cut their energy usage. Beyond environmental benefits, slashing power drain for big games would also help optimize battery life, a necessity for a handheld processing games locally.

With its latest Cloud Streaming update for Portal, Sony recognizes that people want to play the same games on the go that they do at home, continuing their progress and having a continuity of experience between platforms. The problem is how it goes about delivering that. Relying on cloud gaming as a delivery mechanism is a fool's errand—the network infrastructure just isn't there to make it viable, especially in public. I doubt it ever will be, either.

For many players, the dream is unfettered access to the PlayStation games they own, wherever they want to play them, without having to hope the connection-quality gods are on your side. No matter what features are added, PlayStation Portal is incapable of making that dream a reality—and until it has a handheld that can, Sony's portable play plans are in the clouds.

Spinny, an Indian online marketplace for used cars, is raising around $160 million as it moves to acquire car services startup GoMechanic, TechCrunch has learned.

The Series G round, which includes a mix of primary and secondary transactions, would value the 10-year-old startup at about $1.8 billion post-money, three people familiar with the matter said, broadly in line with its previous valuation. 

Nearly $90 million of the round is primary, people said; Existing investor Accel has already wired about $44 million of that amount, with some details of the investment appearing in regulatory filings in India this week, which Indian outlet Entrackr first reported. A new investor is participating in the remaining portion of the primary, but TechCrunch could not confirm its specifics.

WestBridge Capital is doubling down in the new round with a check of a similar size to its previous investment, the people said. The firm invested about $35 million to $40 million in Spinny's Series F round earlier this year.

Much of the secondary portion of the transaction is being sold by Indian VC firm Fundamentum, according to the people, while Blume Ventures is also expected to pare part of its stake.

Accel, Fundamentum, and Blume Ventures did not respond to requests for comments. WestBridge Capital declined to comment.

In March, Spinny raised $131 million in the first part of its Series F round led by Accel, with participation from Fundamentum, before expanding the raise to about $170 million in June to include WestBridge Capital. Those funds were earmarked to scale Spinny's core used-car business. 

However, the new round is being raised specifically to finance the acquisition of GoMechanic and invest in its platform, without drawing on the startup's existing cash reserves, the people said. Earlier reports suggested Spinny could buy GoMechanic for around ₹4.5 billion (approximately $49.70 million) in a cash-and-stock deal.

A consortium led by Lifelong Group acquired GoMechanic in 2023 after the startup admitted to “grave errors” in its financial reporting. The startup had previously been backed by high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, and SoftBank.

For Spinny, acquiring GoMechanic would deepen its control across the used-car value chain. The Gurugram-based startup has built a large consumer-facing business, selling about 13,000 used cars a month, primarily directly to buyers and, to a lesser extent, to dealers through its auction platform. Spinny operates its own large reconditioning centers to refurbish vehicles before sale and relies on third-party service shops for after-sales servicing of customer cars — a gap GoMechanic could bring in-house.

GoMechanic would also act as a “two-way” funnel for Spinny, a person familiar with the matter said. The platform would service vehicles bought or sold through Spinny, and help attract car owners who may not yet be customers. That could help expand Spinny's vehicle supply without significantly increasing customer acquisition costs.

The acquisition comes as India's used-car market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% to roughly 9.5 million units by 2030, from nearly 6 million units today, per a recent report by Mahindra First Choice and Volkswagen Pre-owned Certified. 

The GoMechanic deal would mark Spinny's latest move to broaden its footprint in India's automotive market. In recent months, the startup has expanded beyond used-car sales by acquiring auto publications Autocar India, Autocar Professional and What Car? India from London-based media group Haymarket, and by launching a non-banking finance company, Spinny Capital, to offer vehicle loans to customers.

Spinny co-founder and CEO Niraj Singh declined to comment.

Ain't nobody dedicating their money to anything.That's exactly why these enormous tech giants are privacy nightmares. How many people complaining about Google have used their services extensively for decades now, and never have once given a cent to Google? Probably over 90%.People were offended when Google launched YouTube Premium because it encroached on their right to ""free"" everything from Google. Even today people still chain themselves to the hill of ""I will never give youtube a penny"", despite them probably using a couple percentage points of their entire waking life on google products.Europe is in a tough, if not impossible spot, of having (relatively) heavy privacy protections, while also having a population that is largely offended by the idea of having to pay for something that ""has always been free!"".Maybe they can launch a taxpayer funded EuroTube and EuroGram.

The current modus operandi for tech companies is to offer something for free or below market price, gain a userbase, lock them in and destroy competitors who don't have cash to burn, then alter the deal.If I start using a company's offerings, I have certain expectations, such as the terms and conditions suddenly not changing from under me. Now, you can argue that they are required by law to inform me of any changes to the literal Terms and Conditions. Well, yes, except:1) They are often worded so carefully from the beginning that they can start doing something exploitative at a later date, only after gaining goodwill and users by not doing it.2) I can't very well stop using a service if doing so incurs a loss to me. Phone operators are required by law in some countries to allow customers to transfer their phone number to a competitor. I am not aware of a similar law for email addresses. And email is at least 1:1, what any other operator offers it technologically compatible due to open protocols, so a transfer is possible. There are services with no 1:1 alternative.( Hopefully Open Social will change that but we're not there yet: https://overreacted.io/open-social/ )---There's also informed consent. Most countries don't allow people below a certain age to have sex because they might not understand all the implications and consequences. How many people do truly understand how tracking and profiling works, the risks of data breaches, doxxing, stalking, surveillance, etc? I argue informed consent cannot be formed unless people are aware of _exactly_ where each bit of data about them is stored and accessed; and also are made aware of the probabilities of all the possible adverse events over their lifetime.

I'm pissing in the wind, but I'd prefer it if the use of personal data - sold for adverts - was banned outright. Particularly for large companies.This would forced Google et al to charge for their services, creating the market that would stimulate competitors (Open Source or otherwise).People will argue against this, but online advertising that got us to where we are is the absolute scourge of modern society ... it's poisoned every decent well of humanity.Even for things like Youtube Premium, I'm certain Google are double dipping ... likely quadruple dipping.

Nope. At least I was offended, because YT Premium wanted $15 from me for hosting other people's videos. That's more than streaming services that pay for production of TV shows and movies.Don't think they really need THAT much to cover hosting costs. Not when they operate on that scale and in addition can hover up and profit on all the usage data.If YT Premium costed $3 or $5, I'd pay and I'd bully any friends and family that watch YT and don't pay into supporting the service. As it is now, my appraisal skill says ""SCAM"" and I pirate YT with clean conscience.

Also blocking-ads/pirating on youtube provides the creators with nothing. I'm not sure how people justify this besides the established internal conditioning that anything on the internet must be free. Also conversion rates for ""watches all their content"" to ""pays for their patreon"" are <1%. meanwhile ad-blocking/pirating rates are around 40-60% depending on your audience.At some point the internet has got to have a reckoning with reality if they want things to improve.

No system is perfectly secure, Apple has done more to address those issues than any other tech company.

> IMHO it requires conscious choices by European citizens to choose more carefully which online services they dedicate their time and money to. Or expect unintended consequences.You mean, European citizens ""need to"" expect to, and pay for, basic internet services like search, mail, ... and, let's be honest, pay for worse services than are available free.Imho proton is about the best available, it's just mail and office, and it's 5 euros per month for just mail and basic office, essentially Google's free tier.Obviously, this will never happen. So either the government makes such services, and makes them well enough to seriously compete or implements a ""great firewall of Europe"" Chinese/Russian style and forces the change.Instead, governments are introducing dependency after dependency on FANG companies. Is there any place left in the EU where you can even do your taxes without identifying through Google/Android or Apple/IOS on Chinese made hardware? Any at all? How about all of Europe? There was a row in the Netherlands about efforts to force homeless people to pay for cell phones ... and the government is refusing to back down. It's just incredible.Even if the EU kicked out the FANGs with a ""great firewall of EU"", to force people to pay, it would decimate the gig economy and show that EU unemployment, especially among young people, is really double or perhaps even more the figure it appears to be. Plus I don't think it would work. Too many people would choose to simply stop interacting with the government under such a situation. And while the government can deal with 1 or 1000 people not doing their taxes, they cannot hope to deal with 10% not doing their taxes.The only solution is that all European governments force themselves to ONLY work through ""sovereign"" channels not dependent on American companies. Right now they are all doing the opposite, and in fact not just encouraging EU citizens to give their information to FANGs, but actively forcing them to do so.And you're right. This can only end in disaster. But it's slightly cheaper now.

How does that make the EU regulation something bad?

Internally, you have the Hospital Information System where you can look up all the informations you need.I can just say I know the inside of one of Germany's biggest Hospitals, since I'm a Doctor.

Perfect cover story /slowclapSecret services use companies as cover all the time. Nothing new there.The conspiracy is that it is a dragnet for the data, and given the data is first send plaintext to Zivver (see the Dutch FTM article I already linked), it isn't far-fetched.Looking at the current geopolitical situation, it also isn't far-fetched. It even fits in the Israeli secret services' M.O.Actually, anyone who uses Zivver can find these vulnerabilities. I was worried about this, and reported it to my former employer (while still employed), but alas I did not have a PoC and they had a lot of other security related incidents so this was low priority. Also, this was at a time when the company was still privately owned by the Dutch founders. My hypothesis is that someone working for such an organization passed it to the Israeli secret service, who then got motivated to buy this honeypot.Chinese do something similar: release some piece of technology, never provide any meaningful updates to the product, and voila it is insecure as hell (yet 'we didn't know' provides plausible deniability). I saw this first-hand with KRACK vulnerability.Also... Kiteworks [1] is the name of the company. Not sure why you keep calling it Kitenet.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiteworks

Oracle gets its name from a codename of a 1977 project for the Central Intelligence Agency, Oracle's first customer.In 2004, then-United States Attorney General John Ashcroft sued Oracle Corporation to prevent it from acquiring a multibillion-dollar intelligence contract. After Ashcroft's resignation from government, he founded a lobbying firm, The Ashcroft Group, which Oracle hired in 2005. With the group's help, Oracle went on to acquire the contract.Following the beginning of the Gaza war in 2023, Oracle's top executives, including Safra Catz and Larry Ellison, publicly aligned the company with Israel's military operations. They issued statements of solidarity, paid double salaries to Israeli employees, and donated to organizations connected to Israel's wartime response.

Privacy is privacy. I ideally don't want any of my data sold to anyone, but health data is even more vulnerable.In my country it was even a big deal when they allowed different doctors to access your health data via a common system, as there were e.g. concerns that the information recorded by one doctor might bias another doctor, so some felt that it should be your choice what data to share between different parts of the public health system (except for explicit referrals).Moreover, most European countries do have private doctors, private hospitals, and private health insurance – it's just way less used than the public system. Those would have the same concerns as in the US.

You can be discriminated against a job based on health records. Scary diseases like AIDS and TB make it hard for unskilled labor to land a job since it's so easy to discriminate. Pregnancy history may hurt women who are in countries with more generous maternity leave.Mental health history will hurt just about everyone - who wants a worker who can claim ADHD, depression, anxiety, etc as reasons to be unproductive?Then people will simply deny getting diagnosed for fear that they may uncover something that puts their jobs at risk. That hurts the medical system as a whole.Combine with weird stuff like eugenics. What if we identify a possible rapist gene and neuter them in advance? Or bar people with a klepto gene from working in finance? You may live in happy, sane, democratic societies today, but it may not be the case 30 years from now.

Or bar people with a klepto gene from working in finance? You may live in happy, sane, democratic societies today, but it may not be the case 30 years from now.

Just to make this clear, probably EU-wide, you can't legally be discriminated against. However, it's gonna be hard to prove leaked data won't be illegally integrated in e.g. ATS models, or was attributed as skill issue when it popped up during manual background checks.Although, infectious disease like HIV or dystopian scenarios like eugenics are probably the classical discrimination examples for these privacy implications, I don't think they are very likely to be discriminated against (outside of jobs where discrimination is legal and require disclosure anyway, e.g. health workers, food industry etc.). It's easy to dismiss those worries, since most people aren't affected. But common issues with mental health (e.g. depression), hidden disabilities and chronic disease (e.g. PMS), or potentially severe recurring  disease (e.g. cancer) realistically are going to be much more impactful. Everything which statistically increases chances to fall out the work force due to health reasons - especially in combination with strong labor protections.

I think this has been something people have had an instinct about forever, and the only reason I had to threaten to quit was because of a misunderstanding of the level of data safety involved; put simply it was not common knowledge that socket connections could be snooped and that targeting a popular service would be easy for a malicious person to do. (This was before SSL was efficient or easy to manage, and in the days when only payment screens were encrypted).Once the message was across, everyone's objectives were aligned again.Health information is deeply private because disease is entangled with shame/weakness/vulnerability/taboo/intimacy.

You still wouldn't necessarily want a life insurance company to know stuff they haven't formally asked to know, you still have health information that could be used to blackmail you or whose reveal would be humiliating or upsetting.

At this phase, conventional wisdom will tell you that the Trump Administration is probably not going to use the force of the government to shoot down Netflix's effort to acquire the core studio and streaming assets of Warner Bros. Discovery. However, with South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott now signaling antitrust concerns in a letter to Trump's regulators, according to Semafor, it's now plausible to say there is real pushback. Semafor quotes the letter as saying there are “significant antitrust problems” with the deal, and that it harms “moviegoers, on-camera talent, writers, producers, and everyone who loves the entertainment industry.”Scott also reportedly expressed concerns about Netflix's ease around price hikes and the deal's potential negative impact on TV showrunners and movie theaters.

And for what it's worth, Scott's opposition sounds pretty full-throated: “The transaction warrants rigorous antitrust review under all applicable antitrust merger and monopolization laws and, to the extent appropriate, a lawsuit to block it,” Semafor quotes the letter as saying.Shortly after the terms of the deal were announced, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee, the head of the antitrust committee, said it “should send alarm to antitrust enforcers around the world.”Trump himself has said the deal “could be a problem.”Interestingly, Polymarket gives Paramount's hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery a slightly better chance of succeeding by the end of 2027 than Netflix's slightly smaller deal, which has been approved by the boards of both companies. So the fatal blow may not come from anything that happens in the Capitol. Then again, antitrust enforcement can mean a lot of things. There could be a lawsuit from the Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission, or some kind of foot-dragging effort by regulators asking for divestitures or making other demands. Scrutiny from legislators like Scott is just one of many potential arrows in the quiver of this deal's opponents.

A case of astronomical fratricide is doomed to end in a fiery supernova bright enough to be spotted from Earth during the day.

A study published this August in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society investigated a binary star system about 10,000 light-years from Earth called V Sagittae. Researchers finally solved the century-long mystery behind what makes it so freaking bright. They found that the system is strangely luminous because one of the pair, a super-dense white dwarf, is absolutely scarfing down on its larger sibling at unprecedented speed.

Eventually, the two stars will collide, producing a supernova explosion of unusual brightness. The event is set to occur “in the coming years,” the researchers said in a university statement.

“V Sagittae is no ordinary star system—it's the brightest of its kind and has baffled experts since it was first discovered in 1902. Our study shows that this extreme brightness is down to the white dwarf sucking the life out of its companion star, using the accreted matter to turn it into a blazing inferno,” Phil Charles, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the University of Southampton, said in the statement. “It's a process so intense that it's going thermonuclear on the white dwarf's surface, shining like a beacon in the night sky.”

The team observed the extraterrestrial siblings, which orbit each other once every 12.3 hours, using the powerful European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. By doing so they also found a giant ring of gas around the binary stars, consisting of the debris from carnage and resulting from the gargantuan levels of energy the white dwarf is generating.

This unexpected finding provides insight that could reshape our knowledge about the birth and death of stars, explained Pasi Hakala, a researcher at the University of Turku and co-lead author of the study. “The white dwarf cannot consume all the mass being transferred from its hot star twin, so it creates this bright cosmic ring,” he continued. “The speed at which this doomed stellar system is lurching wildly, likely due to the extreme brightness, is a frantic sign of its imminent, violent end.”

Pablo Rodríguez-Gil, the other co-lead author and a researcher at the Spanish Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias and University of La Laguna, says that in the near future, the amassing matter on the white dwarf will probably create a nova outburst. A nova is an explosion in a binary star system, and this one would make V Sagittae visible to people on Earth without the help of any instruments.

“But when the two stars finally smash into each other and explode, this would be a supernova explosion so bright it'll be visible from Earth even in the daytime,” he concluded.

2025 marks the 10th anniversary of MSI's “Godlike” motherboards first hitting store shelves. The first motherboard to bear the name is the X99A Godlike Gaming, a black-and-red HEDT board which, love ‘em or hate ‘em, is the first RGB motherboard (according to MSI). From there, MSI added unique technologies, including a dynamic display, a wireless extender, magnetic RGB modules, and EZ Link, to improve the user experience. Today's Godlike and other flagship-class motherboards are the pinnacle of consumer board technology, offering users the best of what's available, cost be damned.

The Godlike X we have in on the test bench celebrates the 10-year milestone with a special collector's edition for AMD (sorry, no Intel), dubbed Godlike X. The refreshed motherboard gets a few aesthetic updates, though the specifications remain unchanged. It's collectable, as the board is a limited run of 1,000 units, each identified by a numbered golden nameplate on the M.2 Shield Frozr heatsink. MSI also includes a premium collectors' stand to show off the RGB heatsink (USB-C-powered) and a cute Lucky plush with branded keychain ‘charms' celebrating the anniversary.

To give you a quick refresher on the impressive specifications, the Godlike X bestows upon owners a premium audio codec and DAC/HPA, fast networking including Wi-Fi 7, 10GbE, and 5GbE ports, five native (seven total) M.2 sockets, robust power delivery with 27 total phases, an incredible seven USB Type-C ports on the rear IO, an informative (and customizable) LED screen, and more. On top of that, it looks great with three tastefully implemented RGB zones, and it has the EZ Link design and EZ Bridge features for easier building and upgrades.

The Godlike X's performance was just like its paternal twin and among the best across most of our test suite. It's a competent gamer and held up well across the remainder of the benchmarks, sometimes leading the pack. All this was done with the default settings and PBO disabled. Granted, the differences are generally insignificant, but the takeaway is that the board performs well, regardless of the task.Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our list of the Best Motherboards. But before we share test results and discuss details, here are the specifications from MSI's website.

Inside the premium box are a slew of accessories. The box the “X” is in opens a bit differently to show off the included goodies. It even comes with the cool powered collector's stand to show off the numbered Shield Frozr M.2 heatsink. In addition to the basics, MSI includes the M.2 XPander-Z Slider Gen M.2 expansion card with the EZ Slide design and an EZ Control hub for the fan and RGB headers. There are also several extension cables, thermistors, stickers, and more. The long list is below, and we've included an image of Lucky and the collector's stand all lit up.

The Godlike X certainly looks the part of a $1,000+ motherboard. It's covered in shrouds, heatsinks, an LCD screen, and RGB lighting areas that grace the front of the board, while a backplate covers the rear and doubles as an additional heatsink for multiple components. MSI also updated the RGB feature above the VRMs. The dragon is still there, but the background is now an “X” instead of the triangle.

The primary M.2 heatsink is where you'll see the Godlike name and the engraved gold number (0001-1000), while to the right is a static RGB display. The EZ Bridge houses the Dynamic Dashboard III TFT LCD panel that displays system status, temperatures, voltages, BIOS Flash status, and error messages. You can even customize it using your own image file (.gif, .bmp, .png, .jpg). The M.2 plate heatsinks now sport a ribbed pattern with gold highlights on the X. There's no doubt it's a good-looking motherboard, and will be cooler for some because it's a limited edition.

In the upper-left corner, we get a better look at the first RGB feature, with the MSI dragon and an “X” in the background (previously, it was a triangle). Typically, we'd also see the EPS power connections here, but they're on the other side of the wavy fin, direct-touch heatpipe-connected VRM heatsinks, sticking out between the shroud and the Dynamic Dashboard III.

Below the two 8-pin EPS connectors are four DRAM slots with the locking mechanism at the top (where there's room). MSI lists support up to DDR-9000(OC), which is plenty fast for the platform. We could run our DDR5-7200 kit, but our Klevv DDR5-8000 kit booted to Windows and did not complete the stress test. I didn't see our kit on the QVL list, so we weren't disappointed. Perhaps with some additional tweaking, it could get there. As always, stick to the QVL list for your best opportunity at plug-and-play, especially with high-speed kits.

 




To the right of the DRAM slots is the EZ Bridge. This unique item contains the Dynamic Dashboard III (3.99-inch 800x480 TFT full-color LCD) and several connections (think front panel, USB, some fans, and more) that magnetically attach to the motherboard. The design cleans up the board's appearance, hiding all those unsightly ports and headers. The Dynamic Dashboard displays system status, temperatures, voltages, BIOS Flash status, error messages, accepts custom images, and is truly the showpiece of the board. I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for these screens on motherboards for some reason.

From top to bottom, you have a 4-pin ARGB header, CPU and PUMP fan headers, 24-pin ATX power, supplemental 8-pin PCIe power (required for 60W charging via USB-C), Front panel USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps) and Gen 2 (10 Gbps) Type-C ports, and another 4-pin fan header. The Godlike includes the EZ Control Hub that attaches to the JBRG_HUB1 port on the EZ Bridge. The hub offers seven more fan headers (for a total of 10), two ARGB headers, one 3-pin RGB header, and a water-flow connection. Power for the hub comes from a SATA power connector, while control over most devices is handled through the MSI Center and its applications, or, for some devices (like fans), through the BIOS as well.

 




Power delivery on the Godlike consists of 27 phases, 24 of which are dedicated to Vcore. Power is supplied via the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to a Renesas RAA229628 controller. From there, it moves to the Renesas R2209004 110A SPS MOSFETs. The 2,640A available is plenty for even the flagship Ryzen 9 7950X or 9950X. The VRMs are among the most robust on the platform and will not hold you back, even if you decide to overclock with sub-ambient cooling.

 




On the bottom left side, hidden under the heatsink, is a flagship-class audio solution based on the 7.1-channel Realtek ALC4082 codec/chip and supported by an ESS 9219Q Combo DAC/HPA, with its own audio capacitors and the audio separation line to minimize EMI. You won't find much better audio hardware on a modern motherboard.

Three PCIe slots and five M.2 sockets are in the middle of the board. The top PCIe slot connects to the CPU, supports PCIe 5.0 x16, and uses a convenient button on the EZ Bridge to lock and unlock the video card in its slot. The second slot also connects through the processor and runs up to PCIe 5.0 x8 speeds. When both slots are populated, they both run at x8 speeds. The bottom PCIe x4 slot connects through the chipset and runs at PCIe 4.0 x4. Note that the bottom slot will run at x2 speeds when the M.2_4 socket is populated. You can switch it to x4, but this disables the M2_4 slot.Onboard, two M.2 sockets (M.2_1/2) are PCIe 5.0 x4-capable and handle up to 80mm modules. M.2_3/5 connects through the chipset and runs PCIe 4.0 x,4 while the M.2_4 is limited to PCIe 4.0 x2 (fine for PCIe 3.0 x4 modules). If you need additional PCIe 5.0 M.2 storage, MSI includes the M.2 Xpander-Z Slider Gen 5 add-in card with two PCIe 5.0 x4 slots with an EZ Slide design for quick installation/removal. You don't have to remove the card from your PC to access it, as the drives install through the IO plate. The Godlike can hold a wild seven M.2 drives — the most I recall seeing on any consumer motherboard.

Past the second RGB feature (above the chipset), to the right edge is the standard fare of connectors for the space, including two 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) headers, supplemental PCIe power, two SATA ports, a USB 2.0 header, and front-panel audio.

There isn't much across the bottom of the board, as many headers are contained in the EZ Bridge. Under a magnetic strip, you'll find the other two SATA Ports, three switches (Dashboard, LED, BIOS Select), LN2, battery (CMOS), and OC jumpers.Before getting to the rear IO, we snapped a few pictures of the onboard ICs that control some of the board's features.

The rear IO on the X870E Godlike X has a lot going on, as you'd expect. The black background with white writing allows for easy reading and properly labels each port so you know exactly what it is. Starting with USB ports, there are a total of 15, with seven of them being USB Type-C! You get two 40 Gbps (with DisplayPort capability) and five 10 Gbps Type-C ports, plus eight more 10 Gbps Type-A ports. In the middle are three buttons: one to Flash the BIOS, a second to clear the CMOS, and the third is a flexible Smart Button (Reset, Mystic Light on/off, Safe Boot, or Turbo Fan). Above those are the two Ethernet ports (10 Gbps and 5 Gbps), standard Wi-Fi 7 antenna connections, and the two-plug (mic-in and line-out) plus SPDIF audio stack.

People who regularly ate cheese were at a modestly lower risk of developing dementia in a new observational study from Japan.

The reduction in risk was not large but was statistically significant, according to the researchers, thus underscoring the potential effect of diet on long-term cognitive health.

Among the 7,914 people involved in the study, just 134 people who self-reported eating cheese developed symptoms of dementia after 3 years, compared to 176 people who said they were not regular cheese-eaters.

People who ate cheese were thus less likely to develop dementia by 1.06 percentage points. The authors of the study note that this reduction in risk is consistent with other research suggesting dairy products may have neuroprotective value.

The study is published in the journal Nutrients, and it was funded by the Meiji group, a Japanese company that sells, among other items, dairy products, including fermented and processed cheeses.

It is beyond the scope of an observational study to identify a direct causal relationship between, in this case, consumption of cheese and a reduced risk of developing dementia. The study simply reports an association between the two.

The effect of cheese consumption on dementia risk may actually have something to do with how little cheese Japanese people eat, compared to people in the United States and other Western cultures, said first author Seungwon Jeong, PhD, from the Department of Community Welfare, Faculty of Health Sciences, at the Niimi University in Okayama, Japan.

According to current estimates, the average amount of cheese consumed per person per year in the U.S. is of 17.4 kilograms (kg). It is the nation that eats the most cheese by far. Japan ranks 15th, with a per capita consumption of just 2.6 kg.

“Japan has a very low baseline level of cheese consumption, so a small difference in frequency may appear more pronounced statistically in this context,” said Jeong. “We did not assess dose–response relationships, and cheese consumption in Japan is substantially lower than in Western countries.”

“Therefore, even relatively small increases in consumption might be associated with meaningful differences,” she said.

“Previous studies,” Jeong noted, “have also suggested that effect sizes may vary depending on the regional context and baseline intake levels. In countries where cheese consumption is already high, similar increments may not lead to statistically significant differences.”

Given the far higher rate of cheese consumption in the West, “this study is intriguing but should be taken with a big grain of salt,” cautioned Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN, a registered dietician specializing in heart disease, who was not involved in the research.

“Eating a small amount of cheese once a week [in the study] was linked to a slightly lower risk of dementia but this is observational over just 3 years, and can't prove cheese is doing the work. The ‘benefit' could easily come from other factors, like a generally healthier diet, lifestyle, or socioeconomic advantages.”

– Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, CDN

“Still, if you enjoy a little cheese, this suggests it can fit into a brain healthy diet, but it shouldn't make headlines that cheese alone will protect your brain,” she told us.

Consuming large quantities of cheese — more likely to occur in the U.S. than Japan — has been the source of some concern, even for dementia risk.

And Jeong pointed out that, “according to general nutritional guidance, excessive intake of any food is not advisable.”

“Cheese has historically raised concerns because of its typical high sodium and high saturated fat content that can worsen blood pressure or lipid levels, both well-established dementia risk factors,” said Routhenstein.

Nonetheless, “large cohort studies generally show that small amounts of cheese are not linked to cardiovascular harm or dementia risk, and some suggest potentially favorable outcomes for fermented dairy,” she admitted.

“Although our study was epidemiological rather than mechanistic,” said Jeong, “previous literature suggests that cheese contains vitamin K2, antioxidant components — such as selenium and vitamin E — protein, and amino acids.”

These, Routhenstein explained, “help keep blood vessels healthy, support calcium balance, and reduce inflammation, factors that may protect the brain and lower dementia risk.”

While more than 80% of the cheeses eaten by participants in the study were processed, Jeong added that less-processed, or fermented, cheeses, “generally contain more bioactive peptides or probiotics, so it is possible that a higher proportion of fermented cheese intake could show a stronger association with cognitive health.”

“Some epidemiological studies,” said Jeong, “have reported favorable associations between the consumption of fermented foods containing lactic acid bacteria and cognitive function.”

“Not all cheeses are created equal,” explained Routhenstein, “and how you eat them matters as much as the type.”

“Fermented cheeses are more favorable, especially in a modest 1–to–2-ounce portion as part of a balanced diet with vegetables, legumes, or whole grains, rather than on a heavy, high-fat dish.”

“Highly processed, high-sodium cheeses or preparations with refined carbs, heavy cream, or deep-frying are less ideal,” Routhenstein cautioned.

“Large amounts of cheese in dishes like casseroles can increase saturated fat and sodium over recommended limits, reducing potential benefits,” she said.

“In short,” Routhenstein concluded, “cheese can fit into a brain-healthy diet, but it is not just the cheese itself, it is the portion, preparation, and overall context of the meal that matter.”

...

Per one report, if Bayern Munich wants Borussia Dortmund and German national team center-back Nico Schlotterbeck, it will have to pony up €50 million for a transfer fee.

Just €50 million? Per Bild, yes:

Borussia Dortmund would demand a fee of around €50m for Nico Schlotterbeck should he decide to leave the club in the summer. If he joins Bayern, he would earn at least €15m gross per year (BVB are offering him €14m). That makes it a total package of €125m over 5 years

As for Dayot Upamecano, a contract extension would see the Frenchman earn around €20m gross per year, as well as a signing fee of around €20m he's demanding – which takes the total package to €120m over five years.

That number seems….low, especially considering the fact that BVB would likely not want to do anything to help Bayern Munich secure a player like Schlotterbeck.

In addition, Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg and Patrick Berger (via @iMiaSanMia) are reporting that Schlotterbeck is biding his time to see what will develop with Bayern Munich, FC Barcelona., and Real Madrid before making anything official. That said, the report does indicate that Schlotterbeck is leaning toward moving on:

Nico Schlotterbeck is playing for time and waiting for a door to open up at Barcelona, ​​Real Madrid or FC Bayern. Sources close to the player suggest that not extending his contract with Dortmund is currently the more likely outcome. BVB want clarity by January at the latest, but haven't yet put the player under pressure. Dortmund would likely take a similarly firm stance to Leverkusen's handling of Jonathan Tah. Even with only one year remaining on his contract, they would absolutely not let him go for something around €25-30m. They would even accept the risk of losing him on a free transfer in 2027. At FC Bayern, Schlotterbeck, just like Marc Guéhi, remains a candidate. However, extending Upamecano's contract is the clear priority.

To this author, BVB would rather Schlotterbeck rot on the bench than move to Bayern Munich for the paltry fee of €50 million.

According to one report, Bayern Munich is planning a raid for Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez:

Vincent Kompany's Bayern Munich are plotting a raid on Chelsea for their midfield mainstay Enzo Fernandez. Bayern Munich are looking to add more quality to their midfield, and they have their eyes set on Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez, who is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world. According to a report from Fichajes, the German giants are preparing a €120 million bid to sign the Argentine World Cup winner.

Bayern Munich are very keen on signing the Argentine international, as they look to further bolster their midfield. They want to freshen things up in the centre of the park, and believe he could become one of their leaders going forward.

Kompany wants someone who can partner with Joshua Kimmich and is capable enough to control the tempo and increase the speed of play when needed. The German giants have been carefully monitoring his progress, and they are now ready to make an offer worth around €120 million to prise him away from the London club.

Meanwhile, Chelsea do not have any intentions of selling one of the main stars. With his contract running until the summer of 2032, they are in full control of his future. However, a €120 million offer won't be that easy to turn down amidst some financial difficulty.

Bayern are not just monitoring his situation; they are ready to launch a move. They have already received a detailed report on the 24-year-old, and they are set to make initial contact with the London club in the coming days.

Gareth Bale's love of golf while he was at Real Madrid became a punchline and a meme worldwide, but the Welsh legend thinks it that is was just fake news:

Despite rumors to the contrary, Eintracht Frankfurt is not selling Kauã Santos (at least not right now anyway):

🚨🦅 Eintracht Frankfurt have no intention of selling Kaua #Santos in the winter, nor is Santos currently thinking about a move.

There are no offers either. Eintracht remain fully convinced that he will become their number one in the near future. #SGE

His contract runs until 2030.

Bayern Munich wunderkind was named to UEFA”s Champions League Team of the Week:

Bayern Munich has been linked to AZ Alkmaar midfielder Kees Smit, but Chelsea could be leading on the 19-year-old:

Chelsea are the front-runners in the race to sign AZ Alkmaar wunderkind Kees Smit, according to iNews. While the likes of Newcastle United and Manchester United are also keen on signing the 19-year-old midfielder, Chelsea have been quick to establish contact with the player's camp. Kees' transfer is valued at around the £25 million mark, although it's unclear if Chelsea would be willing to stump up such a sum in January. Newcastle, by contrast, are definitely pondering a move for the Netherlands international next month.

Football fandom is often marked by fierce passion, but at times that emotion can erupt in alarming and destructive ways.

Such a moment unfolded in Finland, where anger over a club's relegation led a group of supporters to commit a shocking act of arson.

What FC Haka endured was chaos of an entirely different magnitude. The nine-time Finnish champions were already grappling with the sting of relegation after a punishing Veikkausliiga season, but things took an even darker turn on Sunday night when a stand at their Factory Field stadium was completely destroyed in a fire.

What should have been a symbol of community pride was reduced to a charred wreck, showing just how dangerously fan frustration can spiral out of control.

The club's drop from the top division sparked the chaos. Relegation brings major financial and reputational setbacks, and for a section of the hardcore fan base, the disappointment became unbearable.

Instead of voicing their frustration through peaceful protest, a group – reportedly teenagers – lashed out at the symbol of their grief: club's home ground. The attack on one of the stadium's structures reflected the turmoil and anger that followed the team's poor season.

The visual is pretty striking as well:

Scandal in Finland: a team was relegated and the fans set their own stadium on fire 😢🇫🇮

Top-flight club FC Haka have suffered a fresh blow after relegation.

And a stand at one end of their🏟️Factory Field (Tehtaan kenttä) stadium was destroyed after a fire broke out on Sunday night.

Police have since arrested three teenagers, and a 15-year-old has reportedly confessed to starting the blaze.

Oooof. I don't know what parenting is like in Finland these days, but those kids might be do for a grounding…until they are like 60.

 Carragher and Ferdinand are retired footballers

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has criticised ex-England player Rio Ferdinand for failing to speak out against the high ticket prices for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The controversy began when Ferdinand tagged Carragher on his X page to comment on Mohamed Salah being applauded by Liverpool fans after their Premier League win over Brighton and Hove Albion.

277 and out? Liverpool's Salah turns record breaker again

The former Manchester United defender wrote: “Thoughts @Carra23? ‘Mo Salah' being sung by the Kop.”

Carragher, a Sky Sports analyst, responded by acknowledging Salah's strong performance when given the opportunity to play.

He then went further, questioning Ferdinand on why he has not addressed the exorbitant ticket prices for the 2026 World Cup. 

Carragher hinted that Ferdinand's payment for serving as Master of Ceremonies at the tournament draw may have influenced his silence.

“And rightly so, he was fantastic when he came on. Thoughts on the price of the World Cup tickets @rioferdy5? A man of the people would surely call @FIFAcom & Infantino out. Or was your pay packet for the draw (acting) enough to buy your silence?” Carragher tweeted on X.

FIFA has faced increasing pressure from football fans and advocacy groups, who have criticized the ticket prices for the 2026 tournament, noting they are significantly higher than those for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Read the tweet below:

 President Donald Trump accepts a peace award from FIFA, the international governing body of soccer, during the World Cup drawing on Dec. 5. (White House)

If you were appalled by the spectacle of Donald Trump clumsily accepting a peace trophy that looks like a prop from “Night of the Living Dead,” then brace yourself.

There may be worse in store.

To recount, Trump was given — to nobody's surprise — the inaugural “FIFA Peace Prize” during the World Cup final draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington. You may recall that Trump named himself chair and master of ceremonies at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which for 50 years had been the nation's premier cultural institution and largely insulated from politics. Now, it's simply another reflection of Trump's MAGA whims, and an oddly political choice for the final draw.

I don't follow soccer — sorry, I mean football — but I gather from those who do that the final draw is an important day for fans, because that's when they know which teams will play at various host cities.

Next year's World Cup — which has been touted as the equivalent of 104 Super Bowls — is expected to be the biggest sporting event on the planet. The games will be held at 16 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Canada — including Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.

The first game at Arrowhead will be Argentina (the 2022 Cup champion) versus Algeria on June 16.

But any news about the matchups was overshadowed by Trump's clutching of the prize (or rather, the medal that came with) from FIFA president Gianni Infantino. FIFA is the global governing body for the sport and it has a history of bad behavior. The 2022 Cup was embroiled in bribery claims and concern about human rights violations in the host country, Qatar. In 2015, following an FBI investigation, top FIFA officials were indicted for racketeering and money laundering. You can think of Infantino giving Trump the prize as akin to the world's most historically corrupt sports body giving a trophy to one of the world's most corrupt leaders.

Trump, smarting from not having received the Nobel Peace Prize he so lusted after, accepted the FIFA prize but couldn't resist taking a swipe at the Biden administration.

“The United States one year ago was not doing too well,” he said.

The prize, according to FIFA, is given “to reward individuals who have taken exceptional and extraordinary actions for peace and by doing so have united people across the world.”

FIFA did not reveal whether there were other nominees for the award or why the prize was announced just a month before. Apparently, the extrajudicial killings of alleged drug traffickers in small boats, the demonization and mass deportation of migrants at home, or threatening to invade Venezuela were not disqualifying factors.

The trophy, reputedly made of real gold, matched the absurdity of the award itself. It is a dread object, with zombie-like hands clawing upward, as if from the grave, at a globe that resembles a meatball you left in the microwave too long. But at least it was on brand. His mooning over the FIFA prize reminded me of the 2017 photo of Trump with his hands on a glowing orb in Saudi Arabia. No James Bond movie villain could signal his desire for world domination any clearer.

Why on this or any other Earth would FIFA indulge Trump?

To keep him happy.

Trump, a dangerous combination of ego and avarice, is about the only person who could seriously disrupt the World Cup games. Of the three host countries, the United States has the most locations, 11, and Trump has demonstrated his willingness to send troops to American cities for any reason. Also, most of the 6.5 million fans expected to attend this summer's games are from places that Trump may have taken a dislike to, including Africa and South America. At least one national team — Haiti — is from a place Trump has described as a “s***hole” country.

Travel bans could seriously disrupt the ability of fans to attend games, and without fans there is no fan money. While claims that the World Cup is equivalent to 104 Super Bowls are likely overblown, there is no denying that a staggering amount of money is at stake. Tickets for the 2026 games are the most expensive in the World Cup's history. Admission for the best matches range into the thousands of dollars and “dynamic pricing” — a first for FIFA — will set prices for some games according to demand.

The six games to be played at Arrowhead, including one quarter-final game, are expected to attract 650,000 visitors to the region. To support that tourism, the state of Missouri is giving $74 million, and Kansas is chipping in $28 million.

Infantino, once a Trump critic, now considers the MAGA leader a friend. FIFA's ethics committee has been asked to investigate whether Infantino violated the organization's neutrality rules in giving Trump the peace prize. From a business standpoint, it might seem like a bauble to keep him happy.

But why would Trump accept such a prize when it is so obviously absurd?

He must know that, coming on the heels of his Nobel disappointment, it appears to be some kind of poor substitute. There has been sport over this at Trump's expense, but the joke is probably on us.

We've been here before.

Or at least the world has.

When the 1934 World Cup was hosted by Italy, dictator Benito Mussolini seized the opportunity to turn sport into propaganda.

Consider the official poster, the work of illustrator Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, an early adherent of Italian Fascism and the author of the “Futurist Manifesto.” It presaged a new movement that would glorify war; scorn women; and worship technology, destruction and speed. His World Cup poster is bold and unsettling, a dynamic male figure in an Italian national team shirt poised to kick the living daylights out of a brown ball, a fasces tucked into one corner.

“Mussolini was no great soccer fan, but he recognized the sport's power both in terms of projecting an image of strength and in bringing the country together,” writes Jonathan Wilson in his 2025 book, “The Power and the Glory: The History of the World Cup.”

From its inception, Wilson writes, soccer has always been about far more than soccer. FIFA was organized in 1904, but the first World Cup wasn't held until 1930, in Uruguay. In 1934, the cup was still new enough that much of the football world, including England, simply decided to sit the games out. But for Mussolini, the World Cup was a way to project fascist strength. He made himself central to the games, famously paying for his own tickets and watching from the stands as Italy kicked the daylights out of the United States.

Mussolini also created a trophy — the “Coppa del Duce” — as an additional prize to be given to the winner.

Sculpted in bronze, the trophy depicted players in front of the fasces — the axe and bundle that was the symbol of ancient Rome, co-opted by the fascists. It was also six times the size of the Jules Rimet, the original World Cup trophy named for FIFA's longest-serving president. That trophy depicted the Greek goddess Victory and was used from 1930 to 1970. The current trophy, in use since 1974, is a somewhat abstract representation of two athletes exulting in victory.

I prefer the look of the old trophy, but alas it was stolen in 1983. All that's ever been found is the stone base.

Now, I understand that Trump is no Mussolini.

But he is Il Duce-like in his awareness of image, and by placing himself center stage at the World Cup, he is reaching a vast global audience where football is played with a white ball and you can't touch it with your hands. Typically, when the word “vast” is used it's mostly hype, but in this case no other description comes close. FIFA is projecting that 6 billion people will watch at least one of the games, up about a billion from the last World Cup.

That is 75% of the world's population.

How many people in the world know who won the Nobel Peace Prize?

If you know it was María Corina Machado of Venezuela, pat yourself on the back. You're part of the informed minority. Machado, who was awarded the prize for her peaceful efforts to overthrow Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship, has dedicated the prize to Trump and now supports the use of force for regime change.

Hear that? I'm doing a forehead slap.

The world has become as dangerous as it was in 1934, if not more so. Let's see, there was something else I was going to mention about dictators and sports. Oh yes, it was this: two years after Mussolini muscled his way to the forefront of the World Cup, another leader — Adolf Hitler — used the Olympics in Berlin to show the world the strength of the Nazi regime. But Jesse Owens taught the Führer a thing or two about the myth of the master race.

Save your cards and letters. I'm not saying Trump is Mussolini or Hitler.

But the tune sounds familiar.

Just about everyone with a screen of any kind — a computer, a smartphone, or communal access to a television — is expected to watch come summer. If they're not plugged in individually, they'll be gathered in schools or pubs, experiencing perhaps the national thrill of victory or the cold embrace of defeat, but at some point they are bound to have seen an image of Trump clutching that damned trophy, and for some the image will stick.

A man of peace.

Never mind the dozens of blown-to-bits occupants of the small boats in the Caribbean and the murder of the two survivors of the first strike, on Sept. 2. Never mind that just days after receiving the dread object, he seized an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast as part of a massive military buildup that appears ready to topple the Maduro regime.

For my part, I will avoid as much of the World Cup nonsense as possible. If it's on a television I have control of, I'll change the channel. If it pops up on my feed, I'll swipe past. No ads for World Cup merch will sway me. The “peace prize” alone was enough to persuade me not to spend a single dollar on anything related to FIFA or the World Cup. Well, I did buy Wilson's book, but that taught me how politics have always been deeply embedded in the history of soccer.

Meanwhile, I'll watch how plans for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles are shaping up. Politico reports that nearly all of the new board members to the Olympic planning committee have MAGA ties.

I hope Haiti wins the Cup.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Mexico World Cup Schedule Inspires Outrage From Government Official","https://www.si.com/soccer/mexico-world-cup-schedule-outrage-government-official","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The governor of the Mexican state of Nuevo León, Samuel García, voiced his disappointment after it was confirmed the Mexico national team won't play a single game in the state's host city of Monterrey during its home 2026 World Cup campaign. 

Monterrey's Estadio BBVA, home of Liga MX outfit Rayados de Monterrey, will host four games during the 2026 World Cup, but the Mexico national team won't make a trip to the North East city, instead playing twice in Mexico City and once in the city of Guadalajara in the state of Jalisco during the group stage. 

With El Tri guaranteed three games during the group stage, many expected Javier Aguirre's side to play at least once in all three of the country's host cities. That expectation didn't materialize and García admitted he's not convinced by the reasons that led to the decision. 

The view from C.F. Monterrey's new stadium in Mexico is incredible. RT if you need to go 😍 pic.twitter.com/SKxtHYlxQ6

“It seems to be a somewhat economical decision [El Tri not playing in Monterrey],” García told TUDN. “The national team benefits from playing at the [Estadio] Azteca because of its capacity, far greater than [the stadiums] of Rayados and Chivas [the other two host venues in Mexico].

“Obviously, my question was, ‘if Monterrey's stadium has a greater capacity why [is Mexico playing in] Jalisco?' and they turned around and alluded to the weather ... as if it was so different between between Nuevo León and Jalisco.

“Obviously these are arguments that aren't convincing for me.”

The Estadio BBVA will instead welcome teams like South Africa, South Korea, Japan and Tunisia twice. Some Mexican outlets suggested FIFA gave Monterrey “breadcrumbs,” but Garcia reportedly said, “they gave us lemons, we'll try to make lemonade.”

García eventually said he understands FIFA and the Mexican soccer federation have their own dynamics and their reasons for keeping El Tri away from Monterrey during the World Cup.

However, García also revealed he spoke with federation president Mikel Arriola following the apparent World Cup snub of his host city, looking for El Tri's chief official to do right by fans in Nuevo León. 

“I searched for Mikel and told him ‘you're going to have to compensate me,'” García said. “The final draw can't be altered, that's definitive, but I'm looking to at least get a [Mexico] friendly match against a strong national team to happen in Monterrey before the World Cup.

“I told him that if he didn't want fans in Monterrey to feel a certain way, you [Mexico national team] have to come before the World Cup to play a friendly and that's what they're working on.”

Mexico's men's national team hasn't played a single game at the Estadio BBVA since it opened its doors in 2015. Now, the expectation is that El Tri makes its maiden visit to the ""Giant of Steel” during their final preparations before next summer's spectacle. 

Regardless of how the situation unfolded, García closed the subject touching upon what he along with every El Tri fan deems most relevant. 

“I hope Mexico does well [in the 2026 World Cup], that's the most important thing.”

Iran has harshly criticized the United States for impeding the visa process for Iranian players, officials and fans at the 2026 World Cup.

""Although it is the right of our football community to participate in this event without any obstacles, the US has so far violated its commitments in this regard,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on Sunday.

Iran has lodged a protest with world governing football body FIFA and the US Interest Section at the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, he said.

""We hope that Washington will once and for all refrain from politicising sporting events and also expect FIFA officials to fulfil their responsibilities,"" the spokesman added, the ISNA news agency reported.

There are fears within Iranian football circles that the US may deny visas to several officials and fans of the Iranian Football Federation (IFF).

Even the visa status of the team's star striker, Mehdi Taremi, is also unclear after the Olympiacos Piraeus player made a post on social media in support of Palestine and against Iran's arch-enemy Israel.

Iran is one of the countries that the administration of US Preisdent Donald Trump has imposed an entry ban on. However, exceptions are to be made for athletes, officials and direct family members for the World Cup and the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.

The US had already refused visas to FFI President Mehdi Taj and at least six other officials for last week's World Cup draw in Washington.

In response, Tehran initially decided to boycott the draw but later revised it. Head coach Amir Ghalenoei and two FFI officials were finally dispatched to attend the December 5 event.

Iran will play against Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand, and is optimistic about reaching the knock-out stages for the first time in its World Cup history.

This will be the country's seventh appearance at the tournament, having previously competed in 1978, 1998, 2006, 2014, 2018 and 2022.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

					Bridging the gap				

With Haiti officially headed to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, fans across the U.S. are racing to secure tickets for the team's June matches in Boston, Philadelphia and Atlanta. But with high prices and an increase in scams, fans must navigate both official and unofficial sources with caution. This guide outlines key tips to buy safely and understand the different ticket types.

No one likes to lose their hard-earned money at any time—and even less so on luxury items families save to buy or because of fraudulent activity. However, the risks of being scammed are very high as fans scramble to get their hands on 2026 FIFA World Cup tickets to cheer on their favorite teams. 

With prices already sky high months before the tournament, at a time when the country is facing a persistent “affordability crisis,” any loss will hurt even more. So if you're shopping for Haiti tickets to the Boston, Philadelphia or Atlanta matches next June, here are some general tips to help you stay safe.

Sign up for our free newsletters.

Whether you buy from FIFA directly or an unofficial reseller, there are three different types of tickets floating around. Be clear what you're buying: 

As expected, prices are astronomical. As of Dec. 11, FIFA's list price for the Haiti-Scotland game was $2,350 per person, $3,140 per person for the Haiti-Brazil match and $1,450 per person. 

On unofficial resale sites, tickets posted there — presumably by people who were allowed to buy from FIFA during the first release phases — tickets were significantly lower. But they are not guaranteed.

The three Haiti games were at the lowest for the Atlanta match, at $370 for one ticket. The upper range is well past the tens of thousands, varying by game and location:

“If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is.”

Again, buying from resale platforms other than FIFA's own Marketplace may not guarantee entry at the stadium gate.

It may be a slog, but take the time to read descriptions of what FIFA or an unofficial reseller is offering before you add to cart.

Some platforms list the single ticket prices to entice clicks. Others promote their paired tickets. Whichever you need, be sure to read the printed information. If it's not clear whether the ticket is for one seat or more, consider that a red flag.

If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is.

Fraudulent activity has hit record highs in the number of people scammed and amount of money reported stolen in recent years. Fraudsters have gotten really savvy at reaching people by email, text and social media and at targeting people to earn their trust. 

That's why scammers now reach out not only in English, but also in Haitian Creole via messages, voice notes, WhatsApp groups and other channels. They can also set up fake websites and products, including counterfeit versions of a legitimate company's communications to persuade people to part with their money.

Efforts to use all these means to fleece people as the tournament nears are expected. Many times, they use fear to trigger panic so the target can't think straight.

So beware, and learn to spot fraudulent activity that may be underway. Again, if it seems too good to be true, or if a fear scenario sounds too outlandish, it probably is.

FIFA is using dynamic pricing, meaning prices may increase for high-demand matches, according to Goal, the soccer magazine. Think surge-pricing with Ubers and Lyfts based on demand.

Have your credit or debit card ready to pay when your turn comes to purchase. Tickets are selling fast, especially for popular teams like Brazil; they may be gone if you delay payment.

As with all tickets, they will be delivered via the FIFA World Cup 2026™ App.

Good luck!

Updated on:  December 14, 2025 / 12:57 PM EST
            / CBS New York
          

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says he will appoint a ""World Cup czar"" to push FIFA to lower ticket prices for the 2026 tournament.

Mamdani, a democratic socialist and avid soccer fan, has been openly critical of FIFA's decision to let ticket prices fluctuate based on demand, instead of selling them for a flat rate based on seating, like at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

But as mayor, can he actually do anything about high ticket prices? 

""Yes. This is going to be me using my platform to speak up to FIFA at every opportunity,"" Mamdani said Sunday on CBS News New York's ""The Point with Marcia Kramer.""

FIFA's ticket pricing plan for the tournament across the U.S., Mexico and Canada has drawn international outage, as soccer fans worry about getting priced out, especially with eight matches, including the Final, coming next summer to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. 

""The cheapest ticket to the World Cup Final, which will be here in New York City and New Jersey, according to the Croatian Federation, is $4,000,"" Mamdani said. ""That's five times more expensive than it was to go to the Final in Qatar.""

The group Football Supports Europe contends it would cost fans nearly $7,000 USD to follow their team from its first match to the Final in 2026. Tickets to the previous Final were priced at $380 for an obstructed view seat to $5,850 for one of the best seats in the stadium, according to FIFA. 

FIFA is also involved in ticket resales for the upcoming tournament, charging secondary sellers and buyers 15% each.    

""I want the price to be something that's affordable. This, you'd have to mortgage your house to be able to afford that for a lot of people. And when it was last in the United States, you could get to the final in California for less than $200. That needs to be what we're looking for,"" Mamdani said. 

The first game at MetLife Stadium will be a Group Stage match pitting Brazil, one of the most successful teams in World Cup history, against Morocco on June 13.

The stadium holds a whopping 82,500 fans for soccer, but demand appears to be very high to start and it's likely to rise as the stakes get higher later in the tournament. 

""I am going to appoint a World Cup czar because, I think at the core of it, I'm so excited at the fact that we are going to be hosting eight games across the World Cup next summer,"" Mamdani said. ""I also understand why soccer fans feel the way they do. They have a right to."" 

FIFA also used a dynamic ticket pricing model for the Club World Cup last summer.   

Mamdani also discussed his views on Israel, charter schools, the 2026 midterm elections, his meeting with President Trump and more.

The surprisingly high cost of tickets for the 2026 World Cup is reported to have created a serious risk of empty seats across the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer.

Despite advertising $21 tickets during the bid to win the hosting rights for the tournament, no such value could be found when FIFA confirmed its pricing structure for the World Cup, and fan frustration grew further when learning the cheapest ticket to the final would cost upwards of $4,000—three times more expensive that the premium tier of 2022's showpiece finale.

A European supporters' group branded the prices “extortionate,” while FIFA's defense of its decision to take 15% from both the buyer and seller of any tickets resold through official channels also left fans across the globe furious.

According to The Times, there have been no suggestions that FIFA will lower the cost of tickets and, as a result, many national associations traveling to North America now have genuine concerns about not selling their full allocations.

On top of the obvious issues with ticket prices, overseas fans also have to consider transport and accommodation costs when exploring how to support their teams next summer. Many who registered their interest in tickets months ago have since walked away following the release of ticket prices.

Ticket sales through national associations remain open until Jan. 13, at which point it will be revealed whether any have not sold their full allocations.

FIFA clearly have no concerns about a reduced attendance. Having initially predicted World Cup tickets would generate a total of around $1.8 billion, that estimate has now risen to $3 billion.

Contributing to that drastic rise is FIFA's decision to adopt a dynamic pricing system, which raises the price of in-demand tickets compared to those generating less interest. The process is not unique to FIFA and has long attracted significant criticism.

FIFA claim to have received “extraordinary levels” of interest when it comes to ticket sales, although most of those supporters were based in the three host nations across North America.

Saudi Crown Prince considers shock €10b offer to buy La Liga champions","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/barcelona-saudi-crown-prince-shock-eur10b-offer-buy-la-liga-champions/blt8cea6bdff623c01a","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 12:12:29 GMT","

Barcelona's long-running financial crisis has taken a dramatic twist after reports claimed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is weighing up a staggering €10 billion offer to buy the club. The proposal, which would theoretically wipe out Barca's massive debt and reshape their future, has sparked huge intrigue - even though such a takeover remains a difficult hurdle to overcome.

Reports in Spain have ignited international attention after El Chiringuito's Francois Gallardo claimed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considering a monumental €10 billion (£8.7b/$11.7m) bid to buy FC Barcelona. The rumoured offer stems from Saudi Arabia's accelerating push into global sport, with investments through the Public Investment Fund (PIF) designed to acquire elite assets and elevate the kingdom's sporting influence. According to the report, the bid would account for Barcelona's estimated €2.5 billion (£2b/$2.9b) debt while providing enough capital to give the Crown Prince theoretical full control of the club.

However, the claim immediately faced scrutiny because Barcelona cannot legally be bought outright due to its long-standing socio-ownership model. The club is owned collectively by its members, who control elections and governance, meaning no individual, foreign or domestic, can purchase it. While the Saudi PIF could potentially invest in a separate commercial arm in the future, any attempt at full acquisition would be structurally blocked.

Many within Spain, therefore, see the reported bid as either symbolic or exploratory, rather than a genuine attempt to trigger immediate ownership change. Even so, the scale of the figure, unprecedented in football history, has drawn much fascination as Barcelona continues to navigate their financial turbulence. The story has sparked fierce debate among fans, analysts, and economists regarding both the feasibility and the implications of such a proposal.

The rumoured Saudi interest arrives against the backdrop of Barcelona's years-long financial crisis, which has forced the club into drastic measures. Heavy debt from the Josep Maria Bartomeu era (which ended in 2020), a record-breaking wage bill, and the COVID-19 revenue collapse collectively crippled the club's ability to operate normally. These financial pressures triggered well-documented registration struggles under La Liga's salary cap rules, forcing the club to delay signings, renegotiate contracts and activate multiple 'economic levers' to remain competitive.

Despite president Joan Laporta's assurances that the club is stabilising, Barcelona still face enormous debt obligations, including the long-term repayment structure for the Espai Barca stadium (Camp Nou, the club's training ground, and surrounding area) redevelopment loan. La Liga's financial controls continue to restrict flexibility, meaning the club must constantly manoeuvre to balance registration demands with squad-building ambitions.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia's football expansion has reached unprecedented levels, with the Crown Prince steering vast investment into the Saudi Pro League, high-profile transfers, and major club acquisitions. The magnitude of a Barcelona proposal fits the broader Vision 2030 strategy, which aims to diversify the kingdom's economy and deploy football as a global soft-power tool. Yet even with immense financial resources, the Crown Prince cannot override the structural barriers protecting Barcelona's ownership identity.

Barcelona's governance model makes the rumoured takeover fundamentally incompatible with how the club is built to operate. As one of only two major European clubs still owned by its members (along with Real Madrid), Barcelona's socios (members) elect the president, approve budgets, and have veto power over strategic decisions, including any proposal to sell control of the institution. For many, sociologically and culturally, selling the club outright would be viewed as an abandonment of identity and tradition, making such a scenario virtually unimaginable.

Even so, the club could, in theory, follow a path similar to what has reportedly been explored by Real Madrid: dividing its commercial operations into a separate entertainment arm that could attract outside investment without ceding football decision-making authority. Under this model, Saudi Arabia's PIF could legally invest in non-sporting divisions such as content creation and media rights. However, this would provide neither ownership nor control of Barcelona's sporting department, which remains the heart of the institution.

Barcelona are expected to publicly maintain their long-standing stance that the club is not for sale under any circumstances. Any future discussion will likely focus instead on commercial partnerships, strategic investments, or sponsorship arrangements that comply with La Liga regulations and club governance structures. Internally, the board will continue prioritising wage-bill reduction, revenue growth, and the long-term restructuring of debt rather than entertaining takeover fantasies.

From the Saudi perspective, football investment will continue to expand regardless of Barcelona's status, with the Crown Prince steering towards transformative projects that enhance the kingdom's global sporting footprint. Whether through the Saudi Pro League, international club partnerships, or further acquisitions, the strategic direction is already firmly in motion.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Arne Slot says there is ""no issue to resolve"" with Mohamed Salah after the Liverpool forward returned to the fold in Saturday's 2-0 victory over Brighton. The Egypt star was left out of Tuesday's Champions League win over Inter Milan after an explosive interview in which he accused the club of ""throwing me under the bus"" and saying his relationship with the Reds boss had broken down.

Emerging from the substitutes bench on the 26th-minute mark following an injury to Joe Gomez, Salah made his first appearance since his incendiary remarks about Liverpool and manager Slot in the aftermath of the 3-3 Premier League draw with Leeds United.

The 33-year-old came close to making an immediate impact against Brighton as he teed up Alexis Mac Allister, only for the chance to break down as the Argentina midfielder opted to pass rather than shoot.

However, former Chelsea and Roma winger Salah eventually recorded an assist when his second-half corner was headed home by Hugo Ekitike, who also put Liverpool in front after latching onto Gomez's knockdown inside the opening minute at Anfield.

Watching on as an unused substitute as Liverpool twice threw away the lead to draw with Leeds last Saturday, Salah subsequently conducted an emotionally-charged interview in which he was heavily critical of both the club and Slot.

""I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,"" Salah told a handful of journalists after the game. ""I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager (Slot), and all of a sudden we don't have any relationship.

""I don't know why but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.""

Salah was then absent as Liverpool earned a 1-0 victory over Italian giants Inter in the Champions League in midweek, with Dominik Szoboszlai scoring a decisive penalty in the 88th minute.

However, following Salah's impressive display against Brighton, Slot has since set the record straight on his relationship with the Liverpool talisman.

When asked whether there was still a problem between himself and Salah, the Dutchman said: ""For me, there's no issue to resolve. For me, he's now the same as any other player. You talk to your players if you are happy or unhappy with things. But there's nothing to talk about after what happened against Leeds after the game.""

And in a separate interview with Sky Sports, Slot said: ""I think he (Salah) was a threat. The first ball he touched, he almost made an assist for Mac Allister. He was constantly involved in the fact that we had Mo. Pleasing to see but not a surprise. 

""It was an easy decision to put him in the squad. I have said many times before what has been said between us will stay between us. We needed him and he assisted to the 2-0 which is nice for us. We have been so many times this season on the wrong side of the set-piece battle. He goes to the AFCON and that means for us another player down. This is what we knew before the season started. Hopefully one or two players can come back from injury.""

While Slot has attempted to build bridges following Salah's remarks, it remains to be seen whether Liverpool's No. 11 will remain at the club beyond the January transfer window, which opens in just 18 days' time.

The ex-Fiorentina and Basel ace, who is a target for a host of clubs in the Saudi Pro League, will now head to Egypt's camp ahead of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which begins on Sunday, 21 December in Morocco.

Meanwhile, Liverpool return to league action when they travel to Tottenham next Saturday. Slot's men will then entertain winless Wolves on Saturday, 27 December, in what will be their final home fixture of 2025. They will then play host to Leeds on New Year's Day.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Sandy Baltimore's sublime strike set Chelsea on their way to an important victory in the Women's Super League on Sunday, as the Blues bounced back from last week's shock defeat to Everton with a 3-0 success at Brighton. It was vital that Sonia Bompastor's side got the win here, to prevent Manchester City from further extending their lead at the top of the table, and they did exactly that, to stay six points behind the Cityzens as the WSL hits its winter break.

This game didn't start in the convincing manner with which it finished. Having accumulated their lowest points tally by this stage of a season since the 2018-19 campaign - coincidentally the last season in which they didn't win the WSL - Chelsea looked like a team that has struggled so far this term. However, chances started to come towards the end of the first half, and after Baltimore and then Alyssa Thompson had both forced Sophie Baggaley into a couple of fantastic saves, the former was able to beat her with an outstanding strike into the top corner - and with her weaker foot, no less.

Two half time substitutions then helped Chelsea build on that lead. Bompastor introduced Wieke Kaptein and Sam Kerr at the break and both made a valuable impact, helping to take the Blues' attacking threat up another notch. Indeed, it was the presence of both players that forced Caitlin Hayes to head into the back of her own net shortly after half time, with the Brighton defender needing to intervene to try and prevent what was already a certain goal.

Called up by Sarina Wiegman for England's final two camps of the year, Baggaley continued to pull out impressive saves to keep Brighton in the game for as long as possible, denying Ellie Carpenter, Kaptein and Kerr, twice, but she would be beaten again before the final whistle, with Kerr able to turn provider for Thompson to clinically convert for 3-0 in the latter stages. No team has ever overturned a six-point gap at the halfway point of a WSL title race, underlining the task awaiting Chelsea in the new year. But the winners of the last six crowns will be up for the fight, with Sunday a reminder of what they can do when they get into their groove.

GOAL rates Chelsea's players from Broadfield Stadium...

Livia Peng (7/10):

Had a bit more to do in the second half and looked assured when called upon.

Lucy Bronze (7/10):

Another solid display from a player showcasing her versatility this term.

Millie Bright (6/10):

Had a couple of iffy moments that, fortunately for her, went unpunished.

Naomi Girma (7/10):

A composed and reliable presence at the back, mopping up any danger that presented itself.

Ellie Carpenter (7/10):

Got up and down the right flank brilliantly, posing a serious threat in attack while snuffing any out at the back. 

Keira Walsh (8/10):

A classy display in which her excellence in possession really shone through.

Erin Cuthbert (8/10):

Another quality performer in the middle of the park, with this game highlighting how important she is to this team. Fantastic cross led to Hayes' own goal.

Sandy Baltimore (8/10):

Kickstarted the win with a terrific goal. Provided a valuable outlet throughout.

Alyssa Thompson (8/10):

Unlucky not to break the deadlock in the first half, when only a superb Baggaley save denied her. Ensured a fantastic performance got the goal it deserved in the second half though, with a ruthless finish.

Aggie Beever-Jones (5/10):

Struggled for any real service, not taking a shot before being withdrawn at half time.

Lauren James (7/10):

A lively 45-minute run out as she continued her return to full fitness after injury, with plenty of chances created.

Sam Kerr (7/10):

Changed the game as a half time sub. Should've got a goal or two herself, with her usually clinical touch still lacking slightly, but made up for it with her creativity.

Wieke Kaptein (7/10):

Like Kerr, was a very impactful half time introduction and could've got a goal, but did plenty of other good work as well.

Niamh Charles (N/A):

Replaced Bronze late on and helped see the win out.

Guro Reiten (N/A):

Slipped into the left-back role comfortably to give Baltimore a rest.

Johanna Rytting Kaneryd (N/A):

Another late sub.

Sonia Bompastor (7/10):

Could've rested on her laurels at half time, with her side ahead, but opted to make two subs which really changed the game for the better for Chelsea. Kerr and Kaptein gave the Blues a greater attacking threat and that meant they could really put the result beyond doubt.

Speculation around Real Madrid's search for a potential successor to the under-pressure Xabi Alonso has intensified, but Red Bull chief Oliver Mintzlaff has shut down hopes of luring Jurgen Klopp back to the dugout. With Los Blancos enduring a turbulent run and Klopp named as a dream candidate, Mintzlaff insists the former Liverpool boss is not returning to coaching ""at the moment"".

Madrid's poor run of form under Alonso has forced the club's hierarchy to quietly evaluate alternatives as frustration grows inside the Santiago Bernabeu. Alonso has overseen a troubling stretch in which Los Blancos have dropped points in six of their last eight matches across all competitions, sparking questions about whether his project is unravelling five months into the season. Damaging losses, tactical confusion, and unflattering reports of a dressing room divided over Alonso's methods have only magnified the scrutiny on his role.

Amid this turbulence, Sky Sport Germany's Florian Plettenberg has listed Klopp among the names Madrid would consider if they decide to cut ties with Alonso in the coming weeks. Klopp, who left Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season, has enjoyed a quieter lifestyle since taking over as Red Bull's Head of Global Soccer in early 2025. His stature, Champions League pedigree, and history of reviving underperforming teams naturally make him the type of candidate Madrid gravitates toward in moments of crisis.

However, despite being labelled a potential option, the German quickly became the subject of speculation that was more dream than reality. Klopp has long maintained he stepped away from frontline coaching because he was ""running out of energy"", and nothing in his current role suggests he is eager to re-enter the high-pressure, high-expectation environment Madrid offers. The rumours gained momentum, but those close to Klopp insist the links misrepresent his intentions and current commitment.

Mintzlaff, Red Bull's Global Director of Football, addressed the growing speculation directly and clarified Klopp's stance in unequivocal fashion. ""Jurgen has made it clear that he doesn't want to be a coach at the moment,"" he said during an event hosted by the Leipziger Volkszeitung, making clear there is no fear within Red Bull of losing their headline figure to Madrid or anyone else. He emphasised that while Klopp may one day reconsider a return to coaching, there is no indication that such a decision is imminent.

Mintzlaff expanded further on Klopp's current priorities, noting: ""Whether that changes at some point in his life, of course, is possible. But I can see how passionate he is about this job, how many ideas he has and how much he wants to develop further. Therefore, I'm completely relaxed."" The remarks underline that Klopp is deeply involved in shaping the Red Bull football ecosystem and thriving in the less exhausting demands of an executive role.

Incidentally, with Klopp preparing to work as a pundit during the 2026 World Cup and enjoying his expanded off-pitch responsibilities, Mintzlaff's confidence reflects a level of stability Klopp has not enjoyed in years.

The reason Madrid have found themselves linked so aggressively with a figure like Klopp lies in the depth of their current struggles. Alonso's return to the club as manager promised a modernised tactical approach following his remarkable success at Bayer Leverkusen, but the transition has been far more difficult than anticipated. Injuries to key defenders, including Eder Militao, Antonio Rudiger, and Dani Carvajal, have destabilised Madrid's structure, while Alonso's high-pressing demands have clashed with the squad's rhythm and conditioning.

Off the pitch, reports suggest Madrid's senior players have grown weary of Alonso's lengthy analysis sessions and his insistence on a high defensive line, which some feel leaves them overly exposed. The chaotic shift from Carlo Ancelotti's player-friendly, man-management ethos to Alonso's systematic, detail-heavy style has not been universally embraced. With player dissatisfaction reportedly rising and results deteriorating, the situation bears all the hallmarks of a Madrid project approaching breaking point.

Within this context, Klopp's name inevitably surfaced because he represents both tactical clarity and a commanding personality capable of controlling a restless dressing room. Madrid's leadership has historically pursued managers of Klopp's stature in times of turmoil, even if the probability of landing them is slim. But unlike other elite coaches who remain in the cycle of opportunities, Klopp has removed himself from that carousel entirely, making his candidacy more symbolic than realistic.

Madrid must now decide whether Alonso deserves more time to steady the team or whether the situation demands swift intervention before the season slips further away. With the club still within touching distance of leaders Barcelona, a resurgence could buy Alonso breathing room, but sources in Spain suggest that upcoming fixtures will be critical in determining his fate. Los Blancos know that hesitation can be costly, yet finding a suitable replacement mid-season, not least one willing to assume the pressure, remains a challenge.

For Klopp, the immediate future is far more serene. His role with Red Bull continues to absorb his energy and creativity, and there is no indication that Madrid's struggles, or Liverpool's recent turbulence, will tempt him back to the touchline. He remains clear that rest and long-term planning take precedence over the relentless intensity of management.

Chelsea hero John Terry has declared Cole Palmer the ""best No.10 in the world"" following his role in Saturday's 2-0 win over Everton. The Blues earned a first league victory since their 2-0 victory at Burnley last month to move back into the Champions League spots. And former centre-back Terry lavished praise upon Palmer after his first home league start since the opening weekend of the season.

Palmer returned to his favoured number 10 role as Chelsea welcomed Everton to Stamford Bridge on Saturday. And it took just 21 minutes for the England star to get back among the goals as he fired past Jordan Pickford midway through the first half in west London, having been picked out well by Malo Gusto.

Provider then turned goalscorer as Gusto scored his first and Chelsea's second on the stroke of half-time as the Blues responded well to their 2-1 Champions League defeat at Atalanta in midweek. Palmer was withdrawn to a standing ovation on the hour mark following a lengthy spell on the sidelines owing to a groin injury and a fractured toe, as head coach Enzo Maresca manages the 23-year-old's game time accordingly. And Terry spoke highly of Palmer on his TikTok channel at full time, stating that he's ""not sure there's anyone better"" than the former Manchester City trainee in the role behind the striker.

On the post, Terry started off by praising Chelsea following the victory, saying: ""A big win for Chelsea and back to winning ways. Massive three points, we really needed that.

""I was also delighted to have Cole Palmer back in the team and playing in that No. 10 role. I'm not sure there's anyone better in world football playing in the No. 10 role. If there is Palmer certainly gives them a run for their money. He's so brave, constantly on the half turn trying to get in those little pockets. It's a defender's nightmare when you come up against a player like that. I was delighted to see him back in the starting line-up and delighted to see him score.""

Terry was also happy to see Chelsea keep a clean sheet, and singled out goalkeeper Robert Sanchez for his role in the success over Everton, adding: ""Big clean sheet as well for the boys, we deserved that today. I thought defensively, we were very good. [Robert] Sanchez was excellent as well, and has been very good in recent weeks. Long may that continue.""

Palmer, meanwhile, was thrilled with his goal and the victory, saying after the game: ""It was hugely important to get back to winning ways. It meant a lot to score as well. I've been out for a while, probably the longest I've ever been out, so I was itching to get back out there with the team, so to start and score was a nice feeling.

""We've obviously had a difficult few games, and it's harder than people think, a game every three days. It's a lot of travel and it's difficult, so to get the win is great.""

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca was quick to compliment his side and Palmer at full time, adding: ""Overall, I'm happy with the clean sheet and the performance. We said many times with Cole [Palmer] we are a better team. Unfortunately, he was out for many games for us, but now he's back and for sure he will help us.""

Bizarrely, Maresca also claimed that the build-up to the welcome of Everton was ""the worst 48 hours"" since he took over as Chelsea boss last summer, though he didn't go on to elaborate why that was the case. ""Since I joined the club, the last 48 hours have been the worst because many people didn't support us,"" the Italian said.

Our NFL expert offers his Lions vs Rams predictions, picks, and odds as two NFC heavyweights meet at 4:25pm ET at SoFi Stadium (12/14).

Today is the fourth meeting between the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles Rams (-5.5) since they swapped quarterbacks Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff in 2021. Rams QB Stafford has thrown for 300+ yards in all three games against his former team and is at +200 odds to do so again.

All odds are courtesy of US Sportsbooks, correct at the time of publishing, and subject to change. 

Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is the NFL MVP favorite for a reason. In his 17th season,  Stafford has thrown 35 touchdown passes, which leads the league, compared to just four interceptions. While he leads the league in TD passes, he's also fourth, with 3,354 passing yards.

His strong play is the biggest reason the Rams are 10-3 and currently hold a share of the NFC West lead. Now, he's playing against his former team, which has struggled to defend the pass in recent weeks.

In fact, the Detroit Lions have allowed 318.3 passing yards per game over the last three games. That's 35 yards more per game than any other team has allowed during that time. Stafford has also managed 300 or more passing yards in each of his three career games against the Lions.

At favorable +200 odds to throw for 300+ yards today, it's worth taking a chance on Stafford to continue the trend.

It's no secret that both the Lions and Rams love to air it out. Ever since Lions coach Dan Campbell took over play-calling duties from offensive coordinator John Morton, QB Jared Goff has been throwing even more passes.

Compared to 30 pass attempts per game before Campbell took over play-calling duties, Goff has averaged 34.2 attempts per game in the five games since. Today his over/under pass attempts are at 32.5, and he's gone over that total in four of the previous five games.

The Rams have one of the best offenses in the league and put up a season-high 45 points against the Cardinals in Week 14. To keep up with the Rams, Goff and the Lions are likely going to have to let it fly today. Bet on Jared Goff to throw over 32.5 passes (-115).

Over their last three games, these teams have combined to average 69.7 points per game. During this period, the Rams lead the NFL with 35.7 points per game, and the Lions are right behind them, with 34 points per game.

The Lions, with a banged-up secondary, are also giving up the fourth-most points per game (29.3) in the NFL over the previous three games. Each Lions game during that time has finished with 55 points or more. With two of the NFL's best offenses facing off today, a shootout is expected.

Stafford has thrown nine touchdown passes more than any other quarterback this season, but Goff is tied for second, with 26. The Rams are just a couple of weeks removed from allowing 31 points to a lackluster Carolina Panthers' offense.

Take over 55 points (-110) today.

While the Detroit Lions (8-5) are just outside of a playoff spot, the Los Angeles Rams (10-3) are tied for first in the NFC West. Both teams will be highly motivated to pick up a win in what could be a shootout between two of the best offenses in the league.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Ruben Amorim's stance on Kobbie Mainoo raises questions about Man United's academy pathway","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/ruben-amorim-kobbie-mainoo-joke-man-utd-coach-disrespecting-academy/bltc9e06d6fbd0fc626","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

First Ruben Amorim came for Marcus Rashford but Manchester United fans did not speak out because they had also questioned his commitment and performances. Then he came for Alejandro Garnacho and still they did not speak out as the winger's attitude had become unbearable. But then he came for Kobbie Mainoo and there was total uproar, enough to finally push the patient supporters over the edge.

In Amorim's very first interview as Manchester United manager with the club's website, he said the most important thing was not to get his players to adapt to his new formation but to go back to the basics of what it meant to play for the Red Devils.

""The most important thing is the feeling of belonging of the club. And we have history in that department,"" Amorim said after his first week working at Carrington.

""I think it's important because a lot of people now talk about the 3-4-3 and the 4-3-3 and all that stuff. But when I think as a player or as a team-mate of Manchester United, it is not a system or formation, it's like the character of the players, the way they see the club. The most important thing for me at this moment is to create the principles, the identity and the character that we had in the past.""

Ask any United fan what the club's identity is and two themes will come up: bold, attacking football and young players, particularly homegrown young players. Amorim has given little priority to either principle.

While United fans have been remarkably patient with the coach that presided over their worst campaign in 51 years, continuing to sing that the Portuguese will ""turn the Reds around"" at matches, his sparse use of Mainoo, who is the only academy graduate in the squad with a first-team appearance to his name, is severely testing their faith...

United's fans' feelings towards Mainoo could be seen in the rapturous applause he got when he came off the bench against Wolves on Monday. But the timing of his arrival said all about his lack of importance in the team. It was the 78th minute and United were already 3-1 up against the worst team in the league, perhaps in Premier League history. 

It was hard not to think back to when Mainoo appeared at Molineux for the first time little more than two years ago, playing the whole game and scoring a last-gasp winner with a jinking run and low curled finish right into the bottom corner. There was tangible excitement about Mainoo then after scoring his first Premier League goal against Wolves, which he followed with a stunning curler against Liverpool and then finished off an incredible team goal which proved to be the winner in the FA Cup final against Manchester City. 

His rapid ascension into the England team to play six games at Euro 2024 seemed to cement his rise but his career is now at a crossroads as he is still waiting for his first Premier League start of the season. The most he has played was 45 minutes against Burnley in August when Mason Mount got injured. He is averaging 12 minutes per Premier League game.

Amorim started Mainoo in eight of his first 13 Premier League games, mostly in the double midfield pivot alongside Manuel Ugarte. The most eye-brow-raising moment was when he started him as a false nine against Crystal Palace, a game United lost 2-0. He then suffered an injury in training which kept him out for two months and when he returned Casemiro had re-established his place in the midfield two, with Mainoo only starting when Amorim wanted to rest players for the Europa League knockout rounds. 

Mainoo's brilliant goal against Lyon kept United in the competition but he was not rewarded with a bigger role and in the final against Tottenham he was brought on in added time. But it was still a surprise to see him not start any of the team's first three Premier League games and his continued absence from the line-up four months into the season has led to Amorim, understandably, being frequently asked why he has used Mainoo so little. 

And when Mainoo's name was mentioned in a press conference in the aftermath of the limp 1-1 draw at home to West Ham, Amorim let out a snigger, stunning journalists in the room and angering many fans watching online. To the coach, it would seem, Mainoo had become something of a joke.

""I understand what you are saying - you love Kobbie, he started for England,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision. I just want to win, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.""

Amorim, though, was missing a crucial point: it does matter that Mainoo is the only academy player left and he is barely part of the team any more. It led to heated conversation between the coach and BBC journalist Simon Stone, who suggested Amorim did not “trust” players from the academy. ""Why?"" was the coach's tetchy response, only to be told ""because you never pick any players from it"". To sum up the dire situation, Amorim mentioned Mainoo as one academy player he does pick.

Mainoo's lack of playing time has partly led to a large focus falling on Shea Lacey, the 18-year-old from Liverpool who has been named in the squad for the last four matches.

The mention of Lacey led to more incredulity from Amorim, who reasonably explained that Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo were more reliable options than the untested teenager. United fans are not really up in arms about Lacey's lack of minutes. It is the absence of Mainoo, who started a European Championship final and scored in an FA Cup final, and who many believe could make his stop-start team better, that people find hard to understand.

And for all Amorim talks about wanting to win, his team are not doing it regularly enough.

In the coach's defence, he has far fewer games in which to give opportunities to young players than last season, when Chido Obi, Toby Collyer, Tyler Fredricson and Harry Amass all got their chances. Mainoo, though, had already proven himself but is a victim of Amorim's rigid system and his insistence on playing two midfielders. It means that he is directly competing with Bruno Fernandes, who just happens to be United's most important player and someone who never gets injured.

Amorim has been unable to give any assurances that Mainoo will play more when Mbeumo and Amad head to the AFCON. And while an obvious solution is to play Fernandes further forward to replace Mbeumo in attacking midfield and bring Mainoo back in, it is more likely that Mason Mount will get a greater run in the team and the 20-year-old will stay in the shadows.

For Mainoo to get his career going again, seeking a loan move in January is obligatory. The fact that he does not want to leave permanently, or at least not yet, shows that he is still committed to the club and does not want to jump ship, especially with Amorim's long-term future at the club far from secure. But now prominent former United players are urging him to leave.

""If I think about it and put myself in Kobbie Mainoo's shoes I'm out of there, I've got to,"" said Rio Ferdinand on his Youtube channel. ""He has just wasted 18 months of his career now at Manchester United. He's probably been there six months longer than he should've been. He should've just gone and I think his agent and more importantly his family around him have to protect him.""

Paul Scholes made his feelings clear with a furious outburst on Instagram earlier this month after Amorim had claimed Mainoo was a starter. ""Bulls***,"" Scholes wrote in reaction to Amorim's remarks. ""The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.""

Scholes deleted his comments but he doubled down on the same view in the latest episode of The Good, The Bad and the Football podcast. ""You would have to advise him to go. If he rang me and said 'I think Chelsea are in for me what do you think?' I'd say 'all day long'""

For Scholes, the Mainoo saga is just one example that shows Amorim is not the right manager for United. ""I don't think the manager gets this club, full stop,"" he said. ""I just don't think he's the right man. Man United is about risk and entertainment more than anything, at home having fans on their seat f***ing ready to go, wingers who beat people, shots on goal. 

""There is nothing there. He brought four defenders on against West Ham. If we go 1-0 up, the manager always said you go for the jugular, you get two, three, four. He just doesn't get it, I don't think anyone at the club gets Man United.""

Scholes added: ""They love homegrown players at United, of course they do, so why is Jason Wilcox, Berrada, allowing the manager to treat a homegrown talent like that? If you're winning every week and are top of the league, yeah but they're 12th in the league.""

And that is the key point. Amorim would have very few critics if he was overseeing United's rise to the top with little homegrown influence. In times of trouble, seeing locally raised players break into the team, as Mainoo and Garnacho did during Erik ten Hag's difficult second season, can soothe the wounds.

United's win over Wolves took them into sixth in the Premier League but the real test comes now in a busy Christmas period when United take on Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle United and will have to make do without Amad and Mbeumo. And if the season continues on this pattern of one step forward and one step back then the dissenting voices about the way Amorim is taking the club will turn into a full-on revolt.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'He didn't play good!'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/pep-guardiola-calls-out-phil-foden-shock-dressing-down-after-man-city-star-gets-on-scoresheet-again-win-crystal-palace/blt9f0143d114c6418c","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 17:33:06 GMT","

Phil Foden helped fire Manchester City past Crystal Palace but that did not prevent Pep Guardiola from speaking his mind and berating his player for his overall disappointing performance in the 3-0 win. Foden buried the ball in the net in the second half to score his sixth goal in four Premier League matches but his coach was not happy with how he played.

Foden has well and truly put his troubles from last season behind him and proved to be City's most reliable player this season behind top scorer Erling Haaland. 

Foden has 10 goals and four assists in all competitions and has come into his own in recent weeks. He hit a brace against Leeds last month, including a last-minute winner, got another double in the 5-4 thriller at Fulham in the next game, while scoring and assisting in last weekend's comfortable win at home to Sunderland. 

City had taken a barely-deserved lead at Palace thanks to a header from Haaland and Foden's goal effectively wrapped up the points before Haaland struck again, this time from the penalty spot. But Guardiola was still not pleased with the midfielder's performance.

Guardiola told BBC Match of the Day: ""Today he [Phil Foden] didn't play good, he lost a lot of balls. He was rushing with every action, he needs to play more calm and keep the ball and in the right moment change the gear. Saying that he is doing terrific for the team.""

Foden admitted that Palace had tested City and stressed that his side had to show patience to take the lead and hold on for the win. He told Sky Sports: ""It's a really difficult game. We know what they are about. They make it tricky, set up well and have quality players on the break. The first half we were just trying to figure them out. Second half we started to hurt them more and in the end we killed the game off.

""The most important thing is patience. I think we maybe tried to attack too quickly. In the second half we did a lot better. That was the key for getting the result today. We had more control and more passes that is the City way. It is a full team performance. Really happy. I have been in great form in the Premier League recently and I'm delighted to keep that going.""

Unlike with Foden, Guardiola had plenty of words of praise for Haaland after seeing the Norwegian score his 101st and 102nd Premier League goals for City. ""Erling is a forward to score the goals but in the second half he keeps the ball,"" he said. ""He was able to contain situations. He helped us be together. In the second half he was outstanding.""

The win meant City kept the pressure on Premier League leaders Arsenal, who are two points clear at the top, and on third-placed Aston Villa who are just one point behind Guardiola's side in third. Unai Emery's Villa twice came behind to win at West Ham on Sunday and claim their ninth consecutive win in all competitions.

""It is a really tough place to come,"" Guardiola added when pressed on the significance of City's latest win. ""When you lose the ball they attack incredibly well but we were patient. We were lucky when they hit the post from Wharton but really pleased for the performance and victory to grow our mentality.""

City are in insatiable form at the moment, winning their last five matches in all competitions including beating Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday to increase their chances of advancing directly into the Champions League knockout stage. They face Brentford next at home in the Carabao Cup, with a place in the semi-finals up for grabs. City won the Carabao Cup in four consecutive years between 2018 and 2021 but have not made it to the last four since last winning the competition.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Three days and counting.

With the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF set to begin Wednesday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, American Nishesh Basavareddy was among the 20-and-under emerging stars who got a taste for conditions at the King Abdullah Sports City Sunday.

The Newport Beach, California, native is back for the eight-player tournament for the second year, but with coach Gilles Cervara in his box for the first time. The 20-year-old asked the Frenchman, the former longtime coach of Daniil Medvedev, to join his team at the beginning of December.

“Obviously he had a long and successful partnership with Daniil, who was a good player before they started working together, but they did a lot of great things together,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com.

“I thought that experience at the highest level could help me where I'm at in my career. It's not just the tennis; he's interested in all aspects. He's diligent and professional in areas such as nutrition and fitness and that will help me.”



Croatian Dino Prizmic, a two-time ATP Challenger Tour title winner this year, practised with Spanish 19-year-old Rafael Jodar, who qualified for Jeddah after winning three Challengers in the final three months of the season. Both players are making their tournament debuts.

Belgium's Alexander Blockx, who stands 6'4”, hit a series of crushing forehands during his session with Norwegian Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, a four-time Challenger Tour champion this season.

German 18-year-old Justin Engel practised with countryman and former Top 100 player Michael Kohlmann.

The draw and Day 1 schedule will be made later on Sunday.

All eight players compete on the three days of group play Wednesday through Friday, with the semi-finals Saturday and the final Sunday.

Past winners of the tournament include Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas.

McLaren's unstoppable season | 2025 FIA Awards

McLaren's Lando Norris received his Drivers' Championship trophy at the FIA Awards in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

Lando Norris has reflected on his “incredible” Drivers' Championship win as he was presented with the trophy at the FIA Awards on Friday night in Uzbekistan, 11 years on after he appeared at the awards as karting world champion.

The McLaren driver came out on top in Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix finale as the fight for the drivers' title went down to the final race of an epic 2025 season – Norris, team mate Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen all had a chance of winning at Yas Marina.

While four-time champion Verstappen won the race, Norris' third place result was enough to see him seal the title by just two points, which led to emotional post-race scenes as the Briton realised his childhood dream.

On Friday, in Tashkent, Norris collected his trophy on stage at the FIA Awards, while also looking back on a hard-fought year.

""Where do I start?” Norris said. “Congratulations and thank you to McLaren, the team I've been with for many, many years on giving both of us an incredible car that at times made our life very easy, and beautiful, and we could bring home many wins all the way to the end of the season.

""Of course, Mr Piastri, the incredible team mate that I've had, who has helped me improve so much over the last few seasons and made us the team that we are, allowed us to turn into the team winning two constructors' back-to-back.

""Of course, to Max as well, for challenging us the whole way, putting us under pressure, just doing what Max always does.

""It was incredible. Obviously this is a lot of people's dreams, a lot of racing drivers' dreams and I got to finally live it – live that one dream that I had when I was a little kid.”

Back in 2014, a young Norris was on stage at the FIA Awards to collect his trophy as karting world champion, and he also looked back on his journey through F1 from that moment 11 years ago.

He added: ""It's been amazing to grow up here alongside a lot of you guys, deliver it with McLaren and to get to race all the World Champions that I've been racing against – Lewis [Hamilton], Max [Verstappen], Seb [Vettel], Fernando [Alonso].

""All the incredible drivers that I looked up to and watched when I was a little kid and get that chance to race against them, to try and beat them and to show what I can do against them all and we managed to do that this year.

""So [I'm] very proud, very happy of course. [I] got very emotional on Sunday after the race, then got extremely drunk and had an amazing time!""

There was also a moment of humour on stage as Norris dropped an expletive, saying: ""I and we had our fair share of mistakes and **** ups. Can I say that here? I'm ok?""

He then continued: ""Sorry, yeah. I got fined! I can pay it off now!""

McLaren CEO Zak Brown was also on stage to lift the Teams' Championship trophy alongside the Woking-based squad's Team Principal Andrea Stella – the pair having led McLaren back to the front of the grid in recent seasons.

""Fantastic season,” said Brown. ""All the men and women at McLaren have done an unbelievable job led by our two awesome drivers, of course the job Andrea has done leading.

""To go into the final race with two drivers fighting for the World Championship when everyone said that couldn't be done, I'm just very proud of how McLaren went racing and that's exactly what we plan to do next year.""

	While it hasn't been officially confirmed that the soccer star will appear in the 11th Fast movie, Diesel recently said that Paul Walker's character Brian O'Conner may pop up in the film. At Fuel Fest in June, he revealed the movie will be released in April 2027, a release time he agreed upon with Universal Studios “under three conditions.” 


	“Just yesterday I was with Universal Studios. … The studio said to me, ‘Vin, can we please have the finale of Fast & Furious [in] April 2027?' I said, ‘Under three conditions because I've been listening to my fan base,'” he explained, noting that he wanted the franchise to return to Los Angeles, “return to the car culture, to the street racing” and also reunite his and Walker's characters onscreen. 


	“The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O'Conner,” Diesel said. “That is what you're going to get in the finale.”

	











	Walker died on Nov. 30, 2013 in a car accident. At the time, he was shooting for Fast & Furious 7, and not all of his scenes were finished. However, Walker's Brian was able to appear in the final scene of the movie using CGI, VFX artists and his two brothers, Cody and Caleb Walker, to create 350 shots. 


	The last scene of Fast & Furious 7 saw Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Walker's Brian have a final moment together in their cars before driving off in separate directions. VFX supervisor Joe Letteri explained to THR how they executed the scene through CGI, VFX and Walker's brothers, further acknowledging the weight of the moment. 


	“There really wasn't room to let anything slip. It was too important to complete the story in respect to Paul's memory — to make sure that when you watched it, you didn't think about any of the work that we did,” he said. “If you were a fan, you were watching Paul's performance and saying goodbye.”

""Finally got to break bread and celebrate our milestone birthdays together,"" Fergie captioned the post.

	Fergie has reunited publicly with her former Black Eyed Peas bandmates for the first time in years, marking a rare moment of togetherness nearly eight years after she stepped away from the group.

	The singer shared photos on Instagram on Dec. 13 showing herself alongside will.i.am, Taboo and Apl.de.Ap as they gathered to celebrate their milestone birthdays.

	“Finally got to break bread and celebrate our milestone birthdays together,” Fergie captioned the post. “What a special night with my brothers, filled with so much love.”


	The images show the four artists posing together in coordinated, fashion-forward looks, prompting immediate reaction from longtime fans of the group. 


	Fergie, born Stacy Ann Ferguson, officially exited the group in 2018, shifting her focus toward solo projects and motherhood. The Black Eyed Peas have continued to release music and tour as a trio since then, while maintaining that the split was amicable.


	The birthday reunion follows another recent return to the stage for Fergie. In October, she made a surprise appearance during Ludacris' set at ONE Musicfest in Atlanta, joining him to perform their 2006 hit “Glamorous.” 


	After the performance, Ludacris told the crowd that Fergie hadn't “performed in seven damn years,” later writing on Instagram, “We Got FERGIE OUT THE F—IN HOUSE! ATLANTA WENT CRAZY! Love to my Sis.”

	











	Fergie responded in the comments, writing, “Loved being able to honor you,” before adding, “Cheers to 25 years.”


	Though the Black Eyed Peas reunion was informal and celebratory rather than professional, the moment carries weight given the group's legacy. With Fergie as a core member, the Black Eyed Peas dominated global charts in the 2000s and early 2010s with albums like Elephunk and The E.N.D., producing hits including “Where Is the Love?,” “Boom Boom Pow” and “I Gotta Feeling.”

The couple announced the birth of their first child on Saturday (Dec. 13).

	Ashley Iasimone



	Actress Debby Ryan has given birth to her first child, welcoming baby Felix Winter Dun with husband Josh Dun, drummer of Twenty One Pilots.


	Ryan posted the birth announcement Saturday (Dec. 13) on Instagram, where she shared a personal video clip of herself in a birthing tub, as well as the first public photos of the couple's child, including a snapshot of Josh Dun holding their newborn.


	“We sat under the full moon— the cold supermoon— reminiscing on our life as a family of two, and told the child I was harboring that we were ready to become three. By midday, Felix was born under christmas lights with snow outside our bedroom window, right into her father's hands,” Ryan captioned her post.


	The actress said her husband was “an incredible teammate,” and thanked her birth team and the women who provided support during her pregnancy. Ryan then wrote about baby Felix, whom she affectionately called “lil moonbeam.”“Her hair is made of silk and her breath smells like vanilla ice cream and every chirp, squeak and whimper is music and everytime I look away and look back, she's gotten smaller somehow,” wrote Ryan. “I know too soon, I'll look away and look back and she'll be bigger and bigger still so for now I'd like to spend my days trapped under the immovable 8 pounds of Felix Winter Dun. I've been a lot of things but her home, a grow light, a portal to bring a new soul into the world— these are my greatest honors. Welcome to earth lil moonbeam. Love you forever.”

	











	Dun and Ryan were married in a New Year's Eve ceremony on Dec. 31, 2019, a year after the two got engaged.




	Ryan, who had her breakthrough as a Disney Channel series regular on Jessie (2011-2015) and The Suite Life on Deck (2008-2011), most recently appeared on American Horror Stories and in the film Turtles All the Way Down (both in 2024). She's next expected to be seen in celebrity thriller Famous alongside Zac Efron, Phoebe Dynevor, Nicholas Braun, and is set to topline sci-fi thriller Orion.


	Twenty One Pilots just earned their 13th career No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart with their latest single, “City Walls,” marking their third No. 1 on the chart this year following “The Line” (in August) and “The Contract” (in February). The band ties Cage the Elephant and Green Day for the third-most No. 1s on Alternative Airplay since the chart began in September 1988. (Red Hot Chili Peppers hold the record with 15 Alternative Airplay chart toppers.) 


	Their latest studio album, Breach, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in September.

Weekend Editor


EXCLUSIVE: In Whose Name? — Nico Ballesteros‘ lauded documentary chronicling Kanye West‘s (now legally known as Ye) mental health struggles, bigoted proclamations and dissolution of his high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian — will be made available to stream globally on VOD platforms (Apple, Amazon, Google/YouTube and Fandango) at midnight.


	Crafted from 3,000 hours of unrestricted access to the embattled rapper over a six-year period beginning when Ballesteros was an 18-year-old Orange County native, the doc traces the eccentric artist's bipolar diagnosis amid the rise of his billion-dollar fashion empire, fallout of a collapsing marriage and heightened media scrutiny stemming from public backlash and disappearing brand deals. Throughout the 104-minute runtime, Ballesteros follows Ye from his Chicagoan hometown to the White House, from meetings with Elon Musk to Kenny G.

	“Set against the backdrop of fame, faith, mental health, and power, the film offers unprecedented access to Ye's private world; stripped of spectacle, steeped in contradiction,” reads a portion of the film's synopsis. “It is a coming-of-age story for both artist and filmmaker.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“At just 18, I was barely out of high school when my life changed overnight,” Ballesteros recalled in a statement. “I went from a middle-class upbringing to flying on private jets, shadowing one of the most famous people alive. I had studied documentary filmmaking but didn't yet have a subject. Ye became that subject. His world gave me both purpose and a space to develop my craft. In Whose Name is the culmination of that journey.”

	











	The film, released theatrically on approximately 1,000 screens Sept. 19, held the No. 1 documentary spot for two weeks, opening to critical and audience acclaim. 


	“I am humbled at the reception this movie has gotten from audiences, critics and my peers in the filmmaking community,” Ballesteros continued. “By extending its reach beyond the theater, the film brings its exploration of American belief, power, and identity to a global audience, offering a deeper understanding of America's contradictions while illuminating the life and legacy of one of the most iconic entertainers of our time.”


In Whose Name? is directed, produced and edited by Ballesteros, who also served as the AMSI Entertainment feature's cinematographer. Additional credits include Simran A. Singh as producer, Jack M. Russell and Justin Staple as editors, Nick Jarjour and Amy A. Singh as EPs, as well as Shy Ranje and Russell as co-producers, and Staple as co-EP.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Saturday Night Live opened again with Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson), this time with the president trying to make it through an Air Force One press gaggle having used Adderall and Ambien.


	“Could you comment on the latest batch of Epstein photos released by House Democrats?” one reporter asked him.


	Johnson's Trump responded, “Look, the fact is, these photos are a fake news Democrat hoax.”


	The reporter pressed him again, “Well, even the picture of a bowl of condoms with your face on them and the text saying, ‘I'm huge.' ”

	Trump responded, “They were 100% legit. I love those files. I'm in the files. I took a lot of great pictures.” 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In fact, a new batch of Epstein photos actually were released on Friday by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.


	In the sketch, Trump speaks to the press as he peeks through a curtain on Air Force One, repeatedly leering at his press secretary Karoline Leavitt (Ashley Padilla).


	Among other things, reporters pressed Trump on the U.S. strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats. The situation escalated this week after the U.S. also seized a Venezuelan oil tanker.


	Responding to a reporter's question about the seizure, Trump did “the weave,” or when he gives a meandering, stream-of-consciousness comment.


	“Yes, we're doing pirate now,” Trump said. “Arghh!”


	Trump went on, “You know, it's interesting. Last week, I said Somalis were garbage, and now we're stealing the ships. Ironic, isn't it? Alanis, she's great in Dogma. With regard to danger, you know, I'm captain now. Remember that, Captain Phillips. ‘I'm Captain.' I love that line. You know Captain Phillips, one of my favorite captains, after Crunch! Hoops, all berries. Why do you say hoops? I prefer it. I prefer when it's all Crunch Berries. Oh, me thinks Ambien has pulled into the lead. Don't worry. Adderall is still in the race.”


	When asked about continuing to carry out the boat strikes, Trump said that they are expanding it to planes as well. He then showed reporters declassified video from a strike — the “plane” target is actually Santa and his reindeer, and soon St. Nicholas and his sleigh are blown up.

	











	“Is that Santa?” a reporter asked.


	“Not anymore. Next question,” Trump said.


	“Mr. President, do you have any comments on the potential sale of Warner Bros to Netflix?”


	“I don't know why anyone wants Warner Brothers. They got one of the worst studio lot tours in L.A. You go on that thing and it's just some kid pointing to a tree. ‘Oh, that's the tree from Pretty Little Liars.' … I want to go to the Gilmore Girls gazebo. Let's go there. Or the Batman museum.”


	Leavitt called an end to the gaggle after the Epstein questions.


	“The president really needs to rest,” she told reporters.


	Oh, it's true. I have to begin my pre-bedtime self-care ritual, putting a bandage on my hand and covering it with makeup, then adding more layers of bandage and makeup. It's a medical lasagna. Mamma mia! We should all be very worried about my health I'm very ill, then I will brush my teeth before drifting off and dream about Karoline's mouth.”


	Watch the sketch above.

Yeah this SNL-fixation with Trump berating everywhere is sad,stale and worn-out material.Classic SNL was more entertaining cause not everything was political like today.The skits rang out of imagination,creativity and laughable ratio.

It's funny when they don't go so childishly infantile with the cereal jokes and cringe stuff. They need better writers and less improv.

Barely a parody, its nearly 1 to 1 how Trump actually speaks.

Cold open with Trump every week is getting old and not funny.

It's called a parody and it is funnier than the actual subject matter.

	As Lily Allen returned to the Studio 8H stage for the first time in nearly 20 years, she had some company from a familiar face.


Dakota Johnson made a surprise appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live, joining the Grammy-nominated singer onstage during a performance of ‘Madeline' from Allen's new album West End Girl.


	Appearing on her fifth studio album in October, which was partially inspired by her pending divorce from actor David Harbour, Allen's ‘Madeline' recounts an exchange she had with the titular other woman while her spouse cheated on her.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Johnson appeared as a silhouette from behind a curtain and a voice on the phone throughout the song, emerging onto the stage at the end to give Allen a kiss.

	











	During Saturday's episode, which was hosted by Josh O'Connor, Allen also performed her song ‘Sleepwalking', in addition to making a cameo in a sketch inspired by her music.


	Johnson's surprise appearance comes after she hosted SNL for the second time last year with musical guest Justin Timberlake.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SUNDAY AM Writethru: The 50th weekend of the year is ringing up $80M per ComScore, off -13% from a year ago; but that's only because last year there were two wide-entries, ironically failed fanboy titles, in Sony's dud Kraven the Hunter ($11M) and New Line's misfire Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim ($4.5M). If you subtract those two movies, you essentially had the potency of carryovers (Moana 2 was No. 1 with $26.4M and Wicked No. 2 with $22.6M), and this weekend those are Disney's third frame of Zootopia 2 with $26.3M, -39%, and Universal/Blumhouse's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 with $19.5M, -70%.

	











	The greater glory for Zootopia 2 is offshore with an overall global haul of $1.13 billion making it officially the No. 1 MPA global release of the year (besting Disney's own Lilo & Stitch), and the 7th highest grossing MPA animated title overall. The pic is the No. 2 MPA release in China with $502M behind only Avengers: Endgame (reported, unadjusted total is $632.1M). Disney owns three of the top five spots for MPA titles in the Middle Kingdom.

	Last weekend, Disney became the highest grossing MPA studio YTD, with $5.1 billion, surpassing Warner Bros' $4.2 billion. Disney is the first and only studio to cross that mark YTD, and the only studio to achieve such a feat in back-to-back years. It's also Disney's third time since 2018; no other studio has reached $5B in that span.


Zootopia 2‘s third frame earned $5.2M in global Imax screens raising its cume for the large format exhibitor to $56.6M, and making the movie the second-highest grossing MPA animated title to cross $50M at the Imax box office.  

	











	In general, this weekend before the big Christmas tentpole, historically excels with a wide family entry (Jumanji, Wonka, Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse). We already have Zootopia 2 and Five Nights at Freddy's 2 doing well, so, none needed. But Disney decided to go wide with James L. Brooks' seventh directorial, Ella McCCay, at 2,500 theaters, which sadly didn't find an audience with a Disney-reported $2.1M. It's also the octogenarian's worst reviewed movie ever at 22% on Rotten Tomatoes and his lowest wide release opening as director (his Terms of Endearment back in 1984 debuted to $3.5M at 260 theaters). The opening here is even lower than Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis' Tom Hanks-Robin Wright re-team last year, Here, which really pressed on moviegoers' nerves with its fixed camera shtick, opening at $4.8M.


	Disney selected this date as Brooks' canon historically has gone in the mid-to-late December corridor (Broadcast News, How Do You Know, Spanglish, etc). If reviews were good, the hope was that an older female audience would show up. While you could say that the director shouldn't have gambled entirely on a fresh face to star in the movie in the sublime Emma Mackey, even if this movie starred a more bankable name, i.e. Anne Hathaway, it would still have an uphill battle ala Brooks' failed $120M Reese Witherspoon-Owen Wilson romcom, How Do You Know which opened to $7.4M, topped off at $30.2M domestic and north of $48M global. And that movie came out at a time when Witherspoon and Wilson could open movies. What remains true then, remains true now and that is prestige drama/dramedies, which audiences use to find in theaters thanks to Brooks, are too prevalent on TV at home. Why leave the house to watch them? In 2010, it was HBO, and nowadays it's streaming. Brooks is one of the most lucrative content creators for Disney in The Simpsons. It stands to reason that they'd fully support the guy's passion projects, especially, if it's a new Simpsons movie they crave. Ella McCay is very 1980s in its sensibility and set-up: a newly christened state lieutenant governor who has to contend with the off-kilter men in her life including her father, her little brother, her husband and her boss. It's really not a bad movie; it's just the sign of the times in regards to what transcends and doesn't on the big screen. Once upon a time, Ella McCay, would have clicked.


Ella McCay gets a B- Cinemascore, which is better than How Do You Know‘s C- and the same as Brooks' 1994 I'll Do Anything. Screen Engine/Comscore PostTrak audiences were hard on the film with 2 stars, 62% and a 39% definite recommend. Female leaning movie at 57% with 59% over 45. The under 25 are non-existent in 12%. Though an even play across the country, it's very light. Highest grossing venue was AMC Lincoln Square with $5K. Not a diverse turnout in 68% Caucasian, 15% Hispanic and Latino, 6% Asian American and 4% Black. 


	Social media analytics firm RelishMix counts a reach of 65 million across TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, X and Instagram which is -59% other drama/comedies before opening, i.e. Ticket to Paradise, Marry Me and Fly Me to the Moon. 


	Reports RelishMix, “Mixed-negative leaning chatter for Ella McCay zeroes in on script, tone, and casting logic. Others critique the aesthetics and character logic, from ‘Too many cliches' to ‘a 29-year-old British French actress playing a 34-year-old state Governor of Rhode Island, yep sounds about right.' The screaming-therapy hook creates friction: ‘Screamers. Nope' pairs with ‘I was kind ok with it… but then they started screaming.' Some viewers target Jamie Lee Curtis with ‘Jamie Lee Curtis? Hard pass sadly' and ‘Can't say I'm looking forward to that one, despite the great cast' underline the skepticism toward Ella McCay.”

Nelson directed redo of the 1984 cult horror movie which originally grossed $2.5M.


FRIDAY PM: A quiet pre-Christmas weekend at the box office, though still commendable as two movies could clear $20M+; Disney's Zootopia 2 in its third weekend definitely is with $25M at 3,835 sites, -40%, for a running cume of $257.6M. Nancy already reported that the Disney threequel is the third movie of YTD after Ne Zha 2 ($1.9M) and Lilo & Stitch to clear $1B. The sequel's Friday is around $6M.


	Blumhouse/Universal's Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is No. 2 with $19.6M at 3,579 theaters, -69% for a running cume of $95.7M. As we told you, ala anime, it's a front-loaded type of crowd, even though this sequel was pure theatrical unlike the first chapter's day-and-date on Peacock and multiplexes. Friday is $5.5M. Five Nights at Freddy's fell -76% in its second frame, and that was after massive views on Peacock. Hence, a better hold this weekend for part 2. At the time that movie opened in late October 2023, it posted the best five-day viewership for Peacock for a movie or TV series at the time. 


	Universal's also has No. 3 with the fourth frame of Wicked: For Good with $2.1M today at 3,480 theaters, $8M for the weekend, -54%, and a running total of $311.6M. Wicked 2 crossed the three-century mark on Tuesday, becoming the fifth title to do so YTD after A Minecraft Movie, Lilo & Stitch, Superman, and Jurassic World: Rebirth. However, next Wicked through its fourth weekend, Wicked: For Good is pacing -13% behind that's pic's cume at the same point in time. Final B.O. on Wicked was $474.9M. 

	











	Fourth is 20th Century Studios' James L. Brooks directed dramedy Ella McCay which is no good at $800K today, $3M opening at 2,500 theaters. We heard previews which began at 2PM yesterday were around $200K. We'll assess more as the weekend goes for this latest title from the 3x Oscar winner of Terms of Endearment. Seventy-six reviews just don't get it at 21% Rotten (I, however, did get it; and enjoyed it).Let the record show that the latest from the 85-year old filmmaker is cheaper with a $30M production cost before P&A than his previous movies, 2010's How Do You Know ($120M), 2004's Spanglish ($80M), 1992's As Good As It Gets ($50M uninflated), and his 1994 initially shot musical turned dramedy, I'll Do Anything ($40M unadjusted for inflation). 


	Fifth goes to Gkids' second weekend of Jujutsu Kaisen: Execution with $600K today, $2.1M for the 3-day, -79%, and a ten-day total by Sunday EOD of $14.5M. 


	Coming up solid is Uni's re-release of the Jim Carrey starring, Ron Howard directed, Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas at 2,250 sites with $600K today and $1.8M for the weekend for a running cume of $264.2M.

Funny how China still makes a film a success despite getting hardly any of that box office haul. If Superman or Captain America had done in China what Zoo is, they'd both be hailed as successful but are both bombs because they didn't.

No ur wrong. the break even point was 425 million for both films so they are major successes

Given that part 2 will make 2-300M less and pretty much kill any chance at a potential part 3, I doubt anyone will consider Wicked For Good a success.

Got to see Hamnet tonight. I probably haven't shed that many tears in a film in years. Yet, I left feeling so uplifted. It's such a wonderful film.

Yikes, Wicked has fallen off a cliff. Probably won't even break even given how much it cost to make and the insane amount of money they spent on promotion.

Silent Night, Deadly Night should've stayed a one and done in 1984. Every sequel and now two remakes can't come close to the original at all. At least this remake was better than the previous films but still doesn't hold a candle to the original

was torn between seeing silent night or the shining …chose silent night cuz of the season and I have a soft spot for the original… this movie was really entertaining and well acted and had solid lead characters.. should have been better promoted.. all the nods to the original series were fun too and other Christmas horror films
.too bad it bombed… anyway the shining did well.. happy about that

Should have been released in October. No Christmas slasher does well at the box office in December.

That's like saying Halloween horror movies shouldn't be released in October.

Also, KRAMPUS and VIOLENT NIGHT say hello.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Josh O'Connor recedes pleasantly in his Saturday Night Live debut","https://www.avclub.com/saturday-night-live-recap-season-51-episode-8","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 08:52:00 GMT","

Something that's genuinely unpredictable, sort of fun, and occasionally disorienting about Saturday Night Live's current cast size is how the screentime balance can shift so much from episode to episode. Sometimes the effect is akin to watching different potential eras of the show test themselves out in real time. This week's episode felt as if we had suddenly fast-forwarded a year or two, to a time when Ashley Padilla had gone from the cast member with the strongest fundamentals to a Kate McKinnonesque “just do let her do whatever, it'll get laughs” baroque-stardom period—and then mixed that with an episode from a couple of years ago when it might feel like Bowen Yang would appear in the majority of the night's sketches. This form of time travel also randomly Butterfly Effected Marcello Hernández into a demotion, sending him back to Update for one of those barely-veiled bits where the new guy who hasn't been getting much airtime gets to do some of his stand-up at the desk. There's no shame in that, exactly, but I would have thought Hernández was way too popular to do such a grab-baggy routine in his third season, when there's a bunch of other less established stand-ups probably eyeing that spot.

Regardless, it's not hard to imagine a version of the show dominated by Padilla and Yang; they're both naturally funny in sometimes-complementary ways. It's also a helpful reminder that simply shoving great performers to the foreground to take big swings isn't always enough.

Padilla went first with a game show sketch that went the second of two ways SNL game show sketches tend to go: Either put the concept right in the fake show's title, or generically imitate an extremely familiar format until the sketch lets slip the secret premise. This time, the eventually-revealed deal was that a Dating Game-style show has recently abolished its age limits, allowing an octogenarian played by Padilla to slip in as the third of three potential matches for a thirtysomething bachelor. The joke wasn't precisely that old people are repulsive and unlovable (although… that wasn't not there); it was more just Padilla saying stuff. Some of it was funny, like her demanding “hot, moist cake” at any given wedding; some of it felt like casting about frantically for catchphrases, like her yelling “why should I go?!”

The very next live sketch let Yang do pretty much the same thing: a weirdo who charges into a familiar situation and doesn't do what they're supposed to! It was especially familiar because he was reviving his somewhat more hyperactive version of the classic Will Ferrell patient-vexing doctor bit (and frankly, this isn't too far removed from his Barry the Midwife character). Again: Some individual laughs but it felt like shtick on shuffle. And then later in the show, Padilla and Yang teamed up for a sketch about a twelve-year-old genius (Yang) attending college and nagged by his overbearing mother (Padilla) as he tries to fit in with more traditionally college-aged kids. This sketch combined premise overload with the verbal overload of their back-and-forth, hot-and-cold screaming matches, with Yang petulantly calling his mother “Heather” a solid two-dozen times. Absurd as it might sound, I think I'd like the more character-driven version of this sketch a lot more (and I'm sure Yang and Padilla could play that just as well).

Despite the hit-and-miss results, all this noise made strategic sense for an episode hosted by Josh O'Connor. He's more than capable as a leading man in the movies, about to be widely streamed stealing the new Knives Out movie out from Daniel Craig, but his persona is still quiet and inward, something spoofed by this week's sketch about sensitive male strippers. That's actually where his episode thrived: sketches that didn't feel like they were overcompensating with all-caps performance.



Those less recurring-character-style sketches didn't have all be super-relatable, observational, or even fresh. Did enough people hear Lily Allen's latest record, or get the general idea from context, for that sketch about people's inner monologues reshaped into Allen-style songs to scan? No idea, but directly making some (light) fun of the musical guest's highly specific style, ornamented with oddball character details made the sketch charmingly specific. Similarly, the types of dudes parodied by O'Connor and Ben Marshall in the male-stripper sketch could have been targets 10 or 15 years ago, and even then, only some of the cultural references would change. (It's telling that Mikey Day's character refers to them as Fleet Foxes.)



As for O'Connor himself, he was charming in a low-key way that sometimes turned the dial down to muffled, like in that monologue where it felt like his Ratatouille fixation was a runner cut to the bone. He was dutifully overwhelmed, and despite some great moments, the overall effect was the opposite.

In addition to the strippers and the Lily Allen brunch, the Uber Eats Wrapped ad was an easy layup. Far less easy, given the apparently divisive reactions she prompts, but just as much of a layup: Jane Wickline's song about destroying the Stranger Things kids on Weekend Update. Update was particularly full of cheap laughs this week, and in general has veered toward reporting an outlandish situation and then making up something else outlandish to top it—like, this week, reporting about teenagers caught making a swastika formation and then elaborating that even worse, it was a skydiving accident. Those kinds of jokes are sort of superficially envelope-pushing but aren't quite surprising enough to qualify for shock laughs, and certainly aren't especially smart when the half-hearted surprise wears off. Anyway, Wickline expressing grave suspicion over the dangers posed by the now-grown Stranger Things kids felt like a particularly bracing antidote to the shtickiness, and made me laugh more than the rest of the segment put together.



The softest, most likable miss of the night was that “Characters On Characters” bit, spoofing the Variety video series where actors or filmmakers are paired up so they can interview each other. It was a cute idea with a real nothing of an execution; in light of how lacking even the superficial imitations of Christmas characters were, it felt almost like self-flagellation over the cast's overall weakness in impressions. The Wizard Of Oz sketch suffered from that a little, too, but mostly it was just a mildly funny one-joke premise belabored; standard mediocre sketch, in other words.

Padilla and Yang did the most but Jane Wickline did the best. She was against-type hornily demanding in the stripper sketch; hilarious in her Update piece; and delivered offhand color in the Lily Allen sketch. She wasn't competing with Padilla or Yang at that pitch, which made it easier for her to slip in and steal the episode.

Ariana Grande faces sky-high expectations for the final episode of 2025, coming hot on the heels of a very successful outing last year. I'll try to restrain my bafflement that Cher flogging a couple-years-old Christmas album is considered a treat on the level of Billie Eilish or Lizzo from holiday episodes past. I shrugged off Hozier last year, and wound up quite liking his “Fairytale of New York” cover.

I'm about to interview Hayley Williams but I need to switch gears. Two days ago, Steph Curry dropped a 49-piece on the San Antonio Spurs, tying Michael Jordan's NBA record of 40-point games after age 30 with 44. Hunched over the post-game presser mic, a reporter asked Curry to use a reference to make sense of his performance. The point guard paused for a moment, rubbing his hands all over his head. “I was Hayley Williams in Paramore tonight,” he declared and then exited. 

It's not the first time Curry has been linked to Williams or her band. In 2023, he got on stage at the Chase Center in San Francisco to sing “Misery Business” with them. “He knows ball, literally,” Williams gushes from her home in Nashville. The Venn diagram of NBA players and Paramore fans means a lot to her, because basketball was among her first loves. Her grandfather used to make her shoot free throws until she made ten in a row. If she missed one, she had to start over again. Before her parents' divorce plucked her out of southeast Mississippi, she made her junior high school's girl's team. “I was good, I loved basketball,” Williams remembers. “My mom's dad played and he was amazing. He meant to go to college for it but he loved photography, so he kept doing that for a living.” It's been a minute since she's followed the league consistently, but she's got big goals: “I dream about sitting courtside one day. I don't even care what team. Just let me sit courtside.” 

I use my time with Williams to investigate an old rumor about her. Was NBA journeyman Rodney Hood really her neighbor in Meridian in the late ‘90s? She doesn't talk to many people in town anymore—only a few cousins still actually live there—so getting to the bottom of the mystery has been impossible. She does confirm that, back then, she played ball with a few Black boys in her neighborhood and one of them was named Rodney. “I was told that he went into the NBA and that he lived in Collinsville where I lived,” she recalls. “But if Rodney didn't live in Collinsville, then who was I playing basketball with? Either way—I love Rodney Hood, I don't even care. Neighbors or not.” 



Hayley Williams, now 36, is cool as hell. But we've known that. When she stepped onto Warped Tour's stages in 2006, sporting a crimson-red ‘do, sleeveless hoodies, and slip-on Vans while sitting on the same bill as Against Me!, Thursday, and Joan Jett, you could just tell that she was going to cause a fucking ruckus. And you can thank Avril Lavigne for that. When Let Go broke containment in 2002, label executives began turning every stone, looking for a second-helping. A year after “Complicated” went platinum, Hayley Williams was writing pop music with Nashville songwriters when Dave Steunebrink and Richard Williams “discovered” her, inking the 14-year-old to a 2-year production deal (when indies were teaching majors how to develop their young artists, mind you). Through their lawyers, Steunebrink and Williams got Hayley a meeting with Atlantic. Jason Flom signed her immediately to a developmental contract that's now become a cautionary tale for younger musicians. The plan was for Hayley to be Avril 2.0. But she didn't want to go solo. No, she wanted to be in a band. 

And Williams had experience in bands by then. Well, sort of. In high school she auditioned to sing in The Factory, a funk group from Franklin, where she lived. That's how she met Jeremy Davis, Paramore's first bassist. But, really, she fell in love with bands because they looked like families to her. She was a child of divorce who found safety in music's communal world, like Deftones or the Shangri-Las. Her fantasies about what it would be like to play with other musicians were always peaceful, secure. “I think that's why, when we've faced big dramas in Paramore, it's made me relive the feelings of being a child going back and forth between two young adults,” Williams reveals. “My parents were so young when they had me.” She's working on a lot of those feelings in therapy, but the music has become a place that can hold a lot of them. A place she can return to anytime. 

“But, somehow, even though you store these things in that space that aren't necessarily all roses, it's comforting, because that space holds it,” she says. “The more people you find who connect to that feeling or need that space to go to, the more people you have holding it together. I don't know, I've idealized a band the same way I grew up watching The Goonies or Hook—something where there's this sense of family, but it's not blood. My granny would say to me all the time, ‘Families don't have to all look the same,' which I think was a pretty revolutionary thing for an older white woman from the South to say to me in the early ‘90s. I'm thankful for that, because that is rooted in me and that's why I'm here.”

Williams' Paramore family has changed over the years. Josh Farro, Jeremy Davis, Jason Bynum, Hunter Lamb, and John Hembree have all departed but Zac Farro and Taylor York remain. By 2007, the band went platinum, earning another 15 years of relevancy off the success of “Misery Business” and “That's What You Get.” They were getting Grammy nominations, eventually scoring the Best Rock Song award for “Ain't It Fun” and becoming, for my money, the most important pop-punk group of their generation. This Is Why winning the Best Rock Album Grammy in 2024 was a fitting capstone to their then-20-year anniversary. 



PARAMORE'S ATLANTIC DEAL EXPIRED a few months earlier in December 2023, leaving Williams a free-agent for the first time since she was a teenager. The internet soon rejoiced, celebrating her and the band's newfound freedom from contractual obligations. Paramore had been touring in Australia, wrapping up a long run of dates on the heels of This Is Why, when Williams started free-writing again, blogging on her then-private Substack. “Glum” came around this time. “I let all of it go,” she tells me. “That's when I was like, ‘Oh, man, I'm really scared.' I started noticing it.” She always hated that her name was the only one on the contract. It divided the band, even when things were going well. The growing pains of being an independent artist set in, and she let them. “A lot of times when I'm done with something, say I'm moving houses, I'll get mad at the house to help me let go of it,” she says. “Anger has always been the motivator, but it's also been the buffer, so that I don't have to feel devastation, sadness, whatever else. I felt a lot of anger in my body, but as I was writing I had to admit to myself, ‘This is just fear. I'm gonna free-fall out of this. This is going to be a good thing.'” 

After the contract was up, Williams expected to make another Paramore album with York and Farro, because she “thought the liberation would explode out of us into something.” She started listening to The Bends, wanting to change the band's sound. She thought, “We can do anything! We can really take this opportunity to fuck shit up, because no one knows what to expect, anyway.” But her bandmates weren't ready for that, and Williams was left with a lot to expel and no place to put any of it. “It's so easy to think of what you stand up against, but it can be harder for people to say what they stand for,” she gestures. “It was this feeling of coming up to a cliff and knowing that, with or without a parachute, I've gotta jump and know that the shit's coming out of me one way or another.”

Ego death eventually came, and then the songs. “Realizing that the deconstruction of my faith and the deconstruction of my internalized misogyny were just practice for the deconstruction I would have to do of my identity being so wrapped up in Paramore,” Williams says. “I listen to these songs and I think there's a lot more red herrings than I understood when I was writing them. A lot of it's about Paramore, and I can see that maybe more easily now.” She can see how the This Is Why tour stirred a lot of fear in her. Tig Notaro's One Mississippi helped, too. “There's this scene where her stepfather's like, ‘Well, your mom's dead. I'm not legally bound to you anymore.' And I was like, ‘Woah,'” she remembers. “That, in a very strange way, connects me to this feeling of, if Paramore is not a signed artist to this thing, and we're not bound to the work that we've been expected to do, what are we and who am I if I'm not in that thing? The basket and the eggs got thrown out the window. It hurts. This whole time I've told everyone that Paramore is a band. But, somewhere in my psyche, Paramore is me, too. I know the guys have had those feelings as well. It's very confusing to unravel, so I've been doing that little by little, trying to understand who I am now.”

That understanding began with “Discovery Channel,” a song that came to life at producer Daniel James' house in Nashville. Williams and Daniel's wife, Elise Joseph James, were watching the MTV Classic and heard Bloodhound Gang's “The Bad Touch” come on. “I went to the bathroom and I was like, ‘I know the song's about fucking but it's also about how it feels to be in a relationship,'” she remembers. “Knowing people intimately, you pull each other apart all the time. That can be friends, that can be romantic, whatever. I have felt that so many times with Paramore. God, man, we're so locked into our dynamic that was set in stone when we were teenagers. And I imagine it'll always be that way, and it's always something to pick up and work on.” Even after she and James finished “Discovery Channel,” with the Bloodhound Gang interpolation in her pocket, she didn't realize how much work it was going to take just to find herself in the midst of what Paramore has become.



Williams says she felt disconnected from her body during the This Is Why album cycle. She was sick too often, confused about the meanings of her songs even more so. “I knew what ‘Big Man, Little Dignity' was about, and I knew ‘Thick Skull' had something to do with the accusations that have been thrown at me through all the drama of Paramore's lifespan,” she says. “‘Figure 8'? Kind of the same thing but more directed at the industry we're a part of. I had vague ideas, but I couldn't figure out why I felt so disconnected.” The answer started revealing itself once she put out Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party, this year's greatest pop triumph. “I go back and listen to [This Is Why] and say, ‘Oh, that makes sense now.' I think it's because I was so afraid. I was in a relationship that I'm trying to protect so hard, I'm not gonna say much about that on the Paramore album. I don't know if I really knew what I wanted to talk about on this album, but I couldn't help but talk about shit. Once that faucet turned on, I was discovering all sorts of shit that started flying at me that I thought I had digested and that's why I didn't feel it anymore. But it was in there.”

“Ice In My OJ” started as a joke. A lot of Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party started as a joke. It's something Williams is working on, because she hates how “overly nice” she is and wishes she “could tear apart that Southern nicety type shit.” Writing this record, Williams mourned deconstructions of herself, lingering breakups, contract releases, and two decades of tour exhaustion. There was no room for people-pleasing. “When you're  grieving, I think there's a version of us when we're grieving that is the realest,” she admits. “We have nothing to hide, and there's no use or no energy to do it.” Stoned with James and his wife, Williams showed them a Christian song she was hired to sing on as a kid. “We were laughing about that and Dan was like, ‘We have to sample this. This is too funny. I've never heard this before and it's crazy that your fans know about it but it's not common knowledge,'” she explains. “The night we demoed [‘Ice In My OJ'] I was gone. Just screaming into the mic.” That was 14-year-old Hayley saying all the shit she was trying to say on “Conspiracy,” the first Paramore song ever. “It's this feeling of someone who is older and in a suit taking away my power and I am too young to do anything about it and I'm screaming at them. I'm in a band but they're taking off with my life in a way that I'm not even old enough to understand. It was good for me, whatever it was.”

Williams and Steph Marziano co-wrote “Parachute.” They'd worked together on Williams' solo debut, Petals in Armor, and Denai Moore's We Used to Bloom before that. “The feeling in the stuff that she sends me is so immediate,” Williams beams. “I knew immediately when I heard the piano that it was going to be sad but it was going to feel hopeful and uplifting in some way—that it was going to be so good live, even though at the time I was like, ‘I probably won't be touring but this would be sick at a festival.'” She came up with the “Parachute” verses quickly, but she still doesn't know how to talk about them—about everything that she's been through in the last year, really. That hasn't stopped fans from theorizing online, believing that “Parachute” marks the end of Williams' relationship with York. But it's more complicated than that. “It's hard to talk about anything in life that, for me, is present and feels ongoing in my body, because it feels like I'm talking about things prematurely,” she says. “But that's where songwriting can be prophetic and bring you to a liminal space that exists where you don't have to carry it.” 

Getting “Parachute” over the finish line meant that Williams needed to lend a voice to the versions of herself that existed in the past but had yet to speak. Versions of her that requested a stage. “There was a lot of stuff in my relationship that really confused me. I do this thing—same with the band—where I think that a relationship is going to part the clouds, the sun's going to come out, and I'm going to fully understand why I went through everything that I went through. It's going to make sense, it's going to connect the dots, and then I'll be healed and be able to live the rest of my life from that place.” 

“It's just not the case,” she continues. “I don't think it's the case with anything, let alone romance, which is messy. I put a lot of faith in things that aren't even really supposed to catch me. I'm supposed to learn how to figure that out by myself. The bonus is when you have people around you that support you in that and that you can support in that journey. I felt like I was speaking from the part of me that has severe abandonment issues and who has continuously made decisions to partner with people that were never going to fix me in the first place but, also, maybe weren't willing to look at their own abandonment issues in a way that I think would be productive in a relationship. That's why it's been hard to see some of my lyrics in black and white, because I do think a lot of them have been prophetic for me.”



NEAR THE END OF PARAMORE'S turn opening for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, Williams realized that the band's growing popularity was becoming a dangerous game for her both mentally and physically. “I remember feeling like, ‘I'm performing. I'm having fun. I'm here for this crazy experience, but I really desperately need to get back to whatever's underneath this, because I'm not connected to myself,'” she says. “Once I let that happen, it was all I could do.” She recounts the “Bluebeard” chapter in Clarissa Pinkola Estés' book Women Who Run From the Wolves: “I started reading it seven years ago, and what I took from it is that once you see the damage or the wound, it starts bleeding and you can't stop it. It has to bleed out. You have to witness it, and this was me doing that for myself as a more grown, hopefully wiser [person], but I also feel dumber than I've ever felt. I feel brand new.”

Mitchell: Which song on Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party took the most courage to witness?

Williams: “Love Me Different” I felt a little embarrassed of. Even though that chorus was old, I'd had it bouncing around in my head. “Parachute” and “Good Ol' Days” were also an embarrassing feeling. The further I get away from them, the more connections I make to my feelings about how I idealized Paramore, and that was hard for me to understand.

The release strategy for Petals for Armor was staggered: 15 songs spread out across two EPs and a full-length during COVID. Some people loved the method, many loathed the wait. “I think my preference was, ‘Let's puke it all out at once, just the same way that I felt it,'” Williams laughs. But she liked the idea of prolonging the Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party rollout, mostly because there were no initial plans to tour it (since its release, she's announced a US tour with Water From Your Eyes supporting). “I thought, ‘Well, we can have fun with it. I'm gonna sing with friends and bounce all over the place so we can lengthen the rollout, just so that it gives me time to travel a bit and do some interviews and let the vinyl get pressed, because that takes a while.'” 

Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party arrived in August unnamed, first as a gift to supporters of her hair product company, Good Dye Young. But when Williams got bored with the current album-cycle model, so she tried fucking it up by uploading all 17 songs to a low-quality website and putting them on streaming services as individual singles. It was this grab-bag collection of career standouts with no sequence: depressant tribute (“Mirtazapine”), music industry disavowments (“Blood Bros”), sensual respite (“Zissou”), blood oaths (“Brotherly Hate”), vocal experiments (“Glum”), and pop triages (“Whim,” “Love Me Different”). “True Believer,” Williams' timeliest song yet, reels against Southern gentrification and the region's racist archetypes. Out of nowhere, she had gathered a double album without stumbling through its miscellany. Like the Steph Curry billboard that showed up on West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles last week—an image of the point guard taking a jump-shot, lined up with the moon's nightly orbital radius by an astrophysicist—Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party is not some lucky gimmick but a curated, well-timed spectacle. 



Williams is in the process of deleting all social media off her phone, including her burner accounts. The plan is to stick to Substack, but the back and forth between her and her fans is making it a “painful divorce,” as she calls it. But every good spectacle needs its co-conspirators. Months ago, she asked her fans to make their own Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party tracklists. One person even set up a website that catalogued every fan-submitted playlist globally, which Williams used as a reference for the album's song positions. She knew “Ice In My OJ” was the opener and “Showbiz” the closer, but it took a communal effort to finalize the lineup in-between. “It's hard to innovate on anything at this point. I loved that putting music up for free on a website felt like an ongoing conversation. Being someone who really probably overvalues the community aspect of everything, it felt cool to watch people connect to each other on the internet in the ways that we used to.”

But her team wanted to hold “Parachute” and “Good Ol' Days” for after the LP's initial streaming release. “I've been scared of these songs, because once you put a feeling out there, even if you're not writing it in a song, it's out there and people can make it whatever they want,” she admits. “But because we waited on those two songs, it gave me so much more to think about.” She had stomach aches for days until “Parachute” came out. She couldn't eat the night before “Good Ol' Days” hit streaming. “Unfortunately for me,” she sighs, “learning my biggest lessons comes from suffering, and I do it to myself. Maybe I'm a masochist.” But that suffering allowed her to learn uncomfortable lessons. “The chorus of ‘Good Ol' Days,' when I listen to it, I have romanticized a version of myself that existed post-my divorce in this very free space, in my late-twenties—trying to reconnect with the world after being in a relationship that was bad for me. I think I worshipped that version of myself. I thought she knew it all. She was prettier than I've ever been in my life. She was freer. She was healthier. My body, my internal world was healthier.”

Williams, starving and stressed, figured out that After Laughter-era Hayley was actually not healthy at all. Her marriage had fallen apart but she swore she was making better decisions for herself. “I was still not, really,” she concedes. “I wonder: Are we always going to be like that? Do we just always look back a couple of years or five years and go, ‘Oh my God, what a dumbass?' I don't know. I really hope that it gets a little bit more grounded as I get older. But I'm glad we saved those songs. I'm really proud of them.” And there's something to be said about the version of Hayley Williams on Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party versus the version of Hayley Williams on 20 years' worth of Paramore albums. This is a good document of who she is while surrounded by the people she's most comfortable with. Her lyrics are more visceral now (“I will love you forever if that won't make it worse”), in a way not so dissimilar to the lyrics on After Laughter (“There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine”). I think we've  gotten to know her a lot better this year.

Some of that honesty stems from her coming to terms with the music scene she entered in the mid-2000s—a period in post-punk where bands and fandoms were incredibly cruel to the young women around them (“I got condoms thrown at me [at Warped Tour],” she recalled in 2020). But the good people stood out, Williams says. “Because we were so much younger than most of the other artists, we didn't really hang out with a lot of people. But it was nice to connect with people who didn't blow us off immediately because of our age or because we grew up in the South and the church.” Bands like Underoath, the Chariot, the Starting Line, and mewithoutYou understood that and let Paramore in. “There weren't any girls my age around,” she remembers. “I know now, in hindsight, how hard that was for me and how much that probably damaged me. It's very similar to how I feel about growing up in the church. Going to youth group gave me a sense of community in a town that—we weren't having all-ages shows down the street that my mom could easily drop me off at. Those were downtown. I have a love-hate relationship with how I grew up, and it's mostly hate, but I also have to acknowledge the good foundations it gave me.” 

Mitchell: I'd like to imagine that people our age are happy that we all got to grow up together.

Williams: I would like to imagine that too, because that makes me feel less lonely. That makes me feel like there's chosen family that I haven't even met yet, all over the place.

Most of the people Hayley Williams meets are strangers. But they're all here and the music connects them. The music's always connected us. She has a phrase she keeps repeating: “Life is long.” Nowhere is that more prevalent than on Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party—a sign of what future lies beyond Paramore for Williams when she needs it, even though Paramore isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 20 years ago, she and her band were the youngest musicians on every tour they went on. But it was obvious to her early on that same-aged kids were coming to see them play. “I remember how that felt, and it's been so cool to grow up with a lot of our longtime fans,” Williams says. “I saw a couple of them at one of the EGO NITE events we put on recently, and I teared up. We all look older, and we all have very serious things going on in our lives. But when we see each other, there's all these updates. It does feel like you're growing up together. I really cherish that.” 

Almost every person I know has a Hayley Williams connection. Maybe they met her work for the first time at Eras Tour. Maybe they were a closeted trans kid in the noughties watching her challenge femininity before any of us knew what a binary even was. Maybe they were a jock in a conservative small-town with “Misery Business” on a playlist. Maybe now they're a TURNSTILE, Rico Nasty, Moses Sumney, or David Byrne fan. Rappers love her, moms adore her. She's Steph Curry on the Golden State Warriors, and if “Ain't It Fun” was her only song, she'd still be the greatest frontwoman of the 21st century. She's an artist no one wants to gatekeep, because she kicks down the fence—whether that's by helping artists advocate for better recording contracts, daring Morgan Wallen to square up at Whole Foods, taunting her old label by releasing her album on “Post-Atlantic,” or singing “the South will not rise again ‘til it's paid for every sin” while flanked by a Black string ensemble and a “Mississippi God Damn” sign on Jimmy Fallon's now-apolitical talk show. Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party confirms to the world the hero Hayley Williams has always been.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Lori Loughlin Shocks Crowd at Hallmark Event: ‘Back With My Family' (VIDEO)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/lori-loughlin-appearance-hallmark-christmas-experience/","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 14:53:54 GMT","

It was a wild night at the Hallmark Christmas Experience for fans of Hallmark's long-running series “When Calls The Heart” (WCTH). On December 12, 2025, as the third weekend in a row of festivities kicked off in Kansas City, Hearties packed the Century Ballroom at the Westin Hotel to hear from a panel of the show's biggest stars. 

Series regular Jack Wagner hosted the panel, which featured stars Erin Krakow, Kevin McGarry, Pascale Sutton, Kavan Smith, Viv Leacock, Chris McNally, and Ben Rosenbaum. By the time the stars took their seats on stage, the first big surprise of the night had already been announced: a WCTH prequel, “Hope Valley: 1874,” will premiere on Hallmark+ in March 2026 with Benjamin Ayres and Bethany Joy Lenz leading the cast. 

But the crowd was in for another big surprise when Krakow announced Lori Loughlin, whom Hallmark recently announced will return to the show for season 14, was backstage. 

After the cast members fielded a host of questions from Wagner — with Krakow frequently rubbing her baby bump as her real-life husband, Rosenbaum, sat behind her — he asked which cast member would be most likely to eat all the vanilla cookies from the WCTH set's catering crew. 

There was a knowing murmur in the audience, as many Hearties are aware Loughlin used to love getting the treats from craft services when she was on the show, from 2014 to 2019. 

“I think it would be one of our favorite friends and co-stars, who we are so lucky is joining us for season 14,” Krakow replied. “And, do you think maybe we should bring her out?” 

Loughlin then walked out onto the stage as the audience erupted in screams and applause, overcome with joy to see her hugging her former castmates and taking a seat next to Krakow, who has remained a close friend. As Krakow wiped tears from her eyes, someone in the audience yelled, “We love you Lori!” 

“I love you too,” Loughlin beamed back, holding Krakow's hand. “Thank you so much. Thank you. It is so nice to be here, thank you so much for that warm welcome.”

When Wagner asked Loughlin to describe how her return to WCTH feels and when she got news, Loughlin replied, “It feels amazing. And my girl here has been championing this for a long time.” 

Krakow, who plays series lead Elizabeth Thatcher Thornton, has often said in interviews that she hoped Loughlin would be brought back to the show in her role as Elizabeth's dear friend Abigail Stanton.  

Loughlin continued, “When did I find out? Maybe a month ago? Or two months ago? And I just want to thank everyone at Hallmark for being so loving and so welcoming, and I'm so glad Michelle Vicary is back in the house.” 

After multiple executive changes at Hallmark Media, Vicary — who was part of the cable channel's launch in 2001 but left in 2021 — rejoined the company in August as head of programming. Part of her legacy at the network was introducing “When Calls The Heart” in 2014. 

“It just feels incredible,” Loughlin said. “I mean, you guys all know it — we have such a special cast and such a special bond, and it's just so nice to be back with my family.” 

Later in the panel discussion, Krakow said she couldn't quite think straight because she was basking in the joy of having Loughlin, her “first-ever scene partner” on WCTH, with them on stage, calling herself “thrilled and over the moon.”

Loughlin, who first rose to fame as Aunt Becky on “Full House,” co-starred on WCTH from 2014 to 2019. However, Hallmark cut ties with her during season six and removed her from the cast following her arrest and eventual jail sentence for her involvement in the largest college admissions scandal in U.S. history. 

Following their 2019 arrests, Loughlin and her now-estranged husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, pleaded guilty in 2020 to charges of mail and wire fraud, per Us Weekly, after they and dozens of other parents were charged with paying to help ensure their teenage children were admitted to the colleges they wanted to attend. 

In early October, Loughlin was back in the headlines as news broke of her splitting from Giannulli, her husband of 25 years. Weeks later, her “Full House” castmate and longtime friend John Stamos called Loughlin an “angel” and slammed Giannulli during an appearance on Peck and Ben Soffer's “Good Guys” podcast, claiming the actress “put up with a lot over the years of this guy.” 

Stamos declared, “I'm not going to debate whether she had much to do with (the college scandal) or not. I know she didn't.”

In recent years, many fans and former castmates have expressed hope that Loughlin would be forgiven and allowed to return to Hope Valley. As recently as November 8, Krakow told Us Weekly that Loughlin's return to WCTH was “something I've been hoping for for years and years.”

Season 13 of WCTH will premiere on Hallmark Channel on January 4, 2026. The cast is expected to film season 14 later in the year, with Loughlin on board. 

It's Pascal Hutton, not Sutton.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Family Affair' Star Kathy Garver: Photos Then & Now","https://entertainmentnow.com/soap-operas/kathy-garver-then-and-now-photos/","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:07:41 GMT","

Kathy Garver is marking a milestone birthday with warmth, gratitude, and the company of longtime friends. The beloved actress, best known for her role as Cissy on the classic sitcom “Family Affair,” turned 80 on December 13 and celebrated the moment surrounded by love.

A video of Garver enjoying the occasion with friends was shared on Facebook by her friend B. Harland Boll and later reshared by Garver herself. The post quickly drew an outpouring of birthday messages from fans who grew up watching her on television.

In the video, Garver is seen celebrating alongside close friends, including actress Jeanne Russell, who played Margaret on the classic comedy “Dennis the Menace.”

After Garver reshared the clip on her own page, fans flooded the comments with warm messages.

“Happy Birthday, oh! My 80, you don't look or act 80, may you have many more,” one fan wrote. 

Another sweet comment read: “Happy 80th Birthday, Kathy! How beautiful and still adorable as ever! 🍰🛍🎂❤️🙏”

“Happy 80th Birthday, Dearest Kathy! OMG, you look wonderful for turning 80. I still can't believe you are 80. I hope you had a most wonderful birthday with friends and family!” another added.

“Nobody looks LESS like an 80-year-old than you do, Kathy!! Happy birthday!!” a third fan chimed in.

“Happy 80th Birthday, Kathy. You look fabulous and are an incredible and inspirational woman!” another wrote.

Garver's milestone birthday also came with a meaningful coincidence. She shares her December 13 birthday with former “Family Affair” co-star Johnny Whitaker, who played Jody on the series.

“Family Affair” aired from 1966 to 1971 on CBS and starred Brian Keith as a bachelor raising his late brother's children. 

Garver played the eldest sibling, Cissy, alongside Anissa Jones and Whitaker, who portrayed twins Buffy and Jody. Jones died in 1976 at age 18.

Whitaker, born December 13, 1959, turned 66 this year. Fellow child star Erin Murphy marked the day with a post that read, “Please join me in wishing a very happy 66th birthday to my friend Johnny Whitaker!”

Garver has often reflected on how she nearly missed out on her most famous role. 

In a 2016 interview with The Windy City Times, she recalled being the last leading cast member hired for “Family Affair” and how a quick transformation helped her land the job.

“At the time I was going to UCLA, and Family Affair had been primarily cast except for Cissy,” she said. “Something happened to the original Cissy, so they needed a new one, but they wanted a blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl. At that time I had brown hair and brown eyes.”

Her mother stepped in with a creative solution.

“My mother sprayed my hair with Streaks and Tips Hairspray that makes your hair lighter. It made my hair bronze gold. It was very hard so when you tapped it it would not move,” Garver recalled.

When a producer questioned the unusual look, Garver improvised.

“When I met with the producer, he asked what was wrong with my hair. He said it looked green. I joked, ‘You are not doing a remake of The Boy with Green Hair?' That was my screen test and the rest is history.”

Garver's birthday celebration comes after a devastating year. In August, she announced the death of her husband of 44 years, David Travis. Less than two months later, Garver also lost her sister, actress Beverly Adams.

Despite the heartbreak, Garver's 80th birthday reflected resilience, connection, and love from fans and friends alike.

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Olde English Spelling Bee

Reviewed:

December 14, 2025

Sometimes it's the most unlikely thing that makes you want to hear a record. With Suburban Tours, I read an interview in The Wire magazine with Joe Knight, the one-man-band that is Rangers, in which he described the songs as “dull, numb, and vacant.” An odd way for a musician to characterize his own work, you might think. Odder still, it's this remark that snagged my attention, got me thinking: “I've got to hear this album.”

To understand why a creator might say such a thing and why it might pique a consumer's interest, we need to re-immerse ourselves in the musical climate of the late 2000s and early 2010s. The reigning sensibility on the American underground was something variously dubbed chillwave, hypnagogic pop, and glo-fi (my favorite of the three, and easily the most evocative of how the genre actually sounded, this term sadly never really caught on). Artists like James Ferraro, Oneohtrix Point Never, and Emeralds were exploring hitherto maligned genres like New Age and yacht rock. Meanwhile, over in the UK, hauntologists like the Ghost Box label were sampling, or simulating, the inconspicuous sounds of library music and radiophonics. People were suddenly paying attention to music you were never meant to pay attention to, giving serious consideration to sounds until now considered beneath serious consideration. Square was hip, soporific was exciting, background came to the foreground.

What happened then is what the philosophers call transvaluation: Conventional ideas about what is good, valid, pleasing to the ear were upended. Suddenly, you could no longer think of words like “bland” or “slick” as inherently negative properties. It wasn't so much that hip folk were examining unexamined assumptions as they were simply turned on by the idea of thinking counterintuitively—by the sheer dare of listening to the original uncool music, or the contemporary cool music influenced by it.

This new appreciation for soft rock and sedative New Age made sense as a paradigm shift within the rock dialectic. While initially an invigorating break from late '90s alt-rock blandness, what could be more conventional, played-out, and old hat by 2008 than the standard, White Stripesy palette of “raw,” “dirty,” “warm”? Not that those received associations have ever gone away entirely: They've just wound their way through to the beyond-exhaustion point of what I call “Studio Dirty,” and young bands modeled on this obsolete value system still trundle forth to play the lower rungs of festival line-ups.

Having said all that, when I finally clapped ears on Suburban Tours in spring 2010, it didn't strike me as dull or numb or vacant. It sounded exciting, tingling with feeling, ecstatic. And in a funny way, the record does involve qualities traditionally valorized in underground rock. The sound is rough around the edges; distortion is involved. Suburban Tours is audibly a DIY record, home-made on dirt-cheap equipment, and in no way resembles something cooked up (coked up?) by the Doobie Brothers at Sunset Sound Recorders.

But I could see what Joe Knight was getting at with “dull, numb, and vacant”—there's a serene, empty-headed glide and glisten to the sound. He was living in San Francisco when he recorded Suburban Tours, initially just as a creative outlet from a series of soul-deadening jobs. But as the songs accumulated, the vibe that emerged reminded him of Texas, the home state he'd only recently left behind. The guitar sound has the frazzled dazzle of suburban sprawl in the Sun Belt. Listening, you almost feel like shielding your eyes from light glancing off windows and car roofs and the surfaces of swimming pools.

As the record coalesced around a mood, Knight started to title the tracks after subdivisions where he'd grown up: neighborhoods with names like “Deerfield Village,” “Bear Creek,” “Woodland Hills,” and ""Glencairn” that gesture towards the wilderness they've replaced. He titled “Golden Triangles” after a mall near Denton he used to visit as a kid when staying with his grandparents. “Out Past Curfew” references the regulations that kids love to flout in American towns, even when there's not that much to do out there after dark.

As a title, a “set and setting” theme, Suburban Tours crystallizes the kind of sensations that the music suggests: steady and tranquil transit—driving, cycling, jogging, walking the dog—through the placid plotted neatness of the burbs. A landscape of new-built and often single-story constructions (where space is cheap, why not sprawl sideways rather than build vertically?) alternating with playing fields, public parks and all those artificially irrigated, barely used front lawns.

Rush's 1982 single “Subdivisions” became a talisman for Knight as the album took shape: not so much for its retooled New Wave sound as for its promo video. Aerial shots traverse the characterless cookie-cutter grid of Greater Toronto's suburbs. The camera zooms down to follow the humiliations of a lonely teenage boy, a nerdy individual trapped within soulless surroundings and high-school hierarchies—the archetypal Rush fan, in other words. “Nowhere is the dreamer or the misfit so alone... Conform or be cast out,” sings Geddy Lee. Although Alex Lifeson is one of Knight's guitar heroes, there's nothing on Suburban Tours that sounds like Rush, except for a dated Yamaha synth, seemingly on loan from Geddy, that here and there flickers through the reverb-haze of guitar.

Suburban Tours is my favorite guitar album of the last 15 years. And it's very much the work of a humble guitar hero. Intricate filigrees of soloistic melody thread through the glittering smog. Knight started learning classical guitar from the age of 12. Soon he was an avid reader of guitar technical magazines. If he'd read fanzines, alternative weeklies in the Village Voice mold, or a magazine like Spin, Knight might have assimilated an alternative rock value system. Instead, his pantheon of guitar idols jumbles figures from all over the spectrum: Eddie Van Halen and Felt's Maurice Deebank, Robert Fripp and Royal Trux's Neil Hagerty, Adrian Belew and Johnny Marr. As a result, his head—and his playing—was from the start already in the transvaluated space that chillwave turned into a new kind of cool.

Coming across records by Ariel Pink was a key moment for Knight: the messthetic of classic rock and '80s pop hits hazily heard through a badly tuned transistor radio, but also the inspiring idea that you could make a record entirely on your own, using a Tascam Portastudio or similar 8-track home recording unit. Another catalyst was James Ferraro, particularly in his Lamborghini Crystal identity (“like some kind of weird audio graphic novel” is how Knight describes that project's releases). The earliest Rangers recordings, like the tape Low Cut Fades and the 20-minute-plus no-fi sprawls later released as Europe on TV, are very much in the shadow of Ferraro's flood of tape releases of the late 2000s, along with the noisescapes that Pink included on albums like Worn Copy. But with Suburban Tours, something distinctive took shape: a classic case of genius emerging out of scenius, an individual voice speaking through the common vocabulary of an era.

Recording on his own, using basic equipment, plugging his guitar straight into the multitrack rather than spilling out into the room: This constricted and claustrophobic set-up encouraged Knight to find ways to snazz up what might have otherwise sounded dead-aired and lifeless. Using a $99 Digitech multi effects processor, he piled on reverb, phaser, and other effects. His 8-track had a built-in varispeed, so he used that to slow down tracks to intensify the woozy dreaminess. He used GarageBand to have different effects going on in the separate channels of the stereo-field, to suck the treble out of the sound, and to sluice entire finished songs through another layer of distortion that glued everything together. The hypnotic lope of the rhythm section adds to the record's makeshift charm: There's a sort of sprained funk feel, with gluey, heavily treated bass (often played with a slap element) dovetailing with drum pads played by hand through a 1980s-redolent gated setting. The feel of a band is simulated, without fully masking the fact that this is a man grooving by himself in the absence of musical playmates.

It's hard to pick out favorites on an album that works as a one solid block, each song a slightly differently inflected iteration of a wondrous same. The swirling radiances and plaintive synth pipings of “Deerfield Village”, the opening track, set the template for most of what follows. “Golden Triangles” enchants me because its sweetly sentimental melody recalls the slick jazz-funk on the soundtrack of Gregory's Girl, a 1980s rom-com set in a Scottish high school. At other points during the record, the mood of gentle elation—as opposed to any musical specifics—reminds me of Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts music and Ernest Hood's Neighborhoods. Almost inevitably, the Texas mise en scene suggests an affinity with Richard Linklater's films about rhapsodic meandering like Slacker and Dazed and Confused. Suburban Tours, and indeed the entire chillwave moment, feels like one more fold in the slackerdelic continuum that includes other self-effacing guitar heroes like Dinosaur Jr.'s J. Mascis and Curt Kirkwood of Meat Puppets.

Suburban Tours is so much a guitar feast of an album, I always forget that a bunch of the songs feature Knight's voice, albeit submerged in the mix and heavily processed. Later albums like Texas Rock Bottom and Late Electrics are properly songful, featuring his small, pleasant mumblecore voice on almost every tune. In the large and varied Rangers discography, there's the sample-strewn Spirited Discussions, a metal-oriented, all-instrumental exercise in nostalgia called Out in the Sticks, and Reconsider Lounge, a collation of song shards from the archives. All of it is well worth a listen, but Suburban Tours is where Knight bottled magic. The next closest thing is its immediate successor, 2011's Pan Am Stories, a sprawling double album recorded using all the same settings as on Suburban Tours. “Zeke's Dream” is a 13-minute multi-segmented beauty whose final two minutes of achingly lyrical noise I wish had been elongated to an hour. Then there's “Sacred Cows,” featuring a gorgeous solo in which Knight channels Robby Krieger.

Does Suburban Tours, and the chillwave moment it belonged to, capture anything of the larger era in which it was made? It's hard to reconstruct mentally what life felt like in 2010. The crash of 2008 was in the rear-view mirror, but the economy was still rough. Obama was president, which was nice, but he faced fierce resistance and obstruction both within Congress and without (from the Tea Party). In March 2010, the month that Suburban Tours came out, the Affordable Care Act passed, which was also nice, but then again, the Public Option had been strangled at birth. Overall, it was an interstitial sort of time, a phase of irresolution and centrist muddle-through, that felt frustrating at the time, but from today's vantage seems relatively idyllic.

When I first heard Suburban Tours, I was only a few months away from moving from New York's East Village to suburban east LA: a massive upheaval, but also a renewal, an adventure. My family and I went from bustling streets to sidewalks eerily empty even during daylight and traversed by little gangs of raccoons after dark. Suddenly records by the likes of Ferraro and his former Skaters partner Spencer Clark made a lot more sense in this terrain of palm trees, parakeets, jacaranda, and drive-thru In-and-Out Burger signs juxtaposed with the almost parodically picturesque San Gabriel mountains. In a quite accidental but real and fortuitous way, Suburban Tours spiritually prepared me for this transition—a return to a warmer and drier version of my own childhood habitat, an English commuter town, after a quarter-century of inner-city living in London and Manhattan.

Born out of Knight's own unexpected feelings of nostalgia for his Texas youth (eventually he would leave the Bay Area and return to his home state), the album's baked-in, bittersweet wistfulness is the kind that anybody can wrap around their own particular yearnings. Geddy Lee may have lamented that “the suburbs have no charms to soothe the restless dreams of youth.” But tapping a mood poised between anomie and reverie, Suburban Tours finds the bliss in the blandness.

Lily Allen returned to the Saturday Night Live stage after nearly 19 years away with two performances from her latest pop album, West End Girl.


	Allen, an SNL musical guest in early 2007, opened with “Sleepwalking,” the third entry on the track list.


	Rooted in her separation from Stranger Things actor David Harbour, West End Girl finds the British singer-songwriter “taking a brutal inventory of the scars she amassed while her marriage was falling apart,” Rolling Stone‘s Maura Johnston wrote in a positive review.


	Allen said the trouble in her personal life ended up pulling her out of a bout of writer's block.

	“I thought I didn't have any good songs left,” Allen, 40, told The Times upon the album's October release. “My writing had been really bad and it took something to happen in my life, for everything to be blown up, for me to be able to go, ‘Oh, here she is.'”


	Allen on Saturday returned to the stage alongside actress Dakota Johnson for “Madeline,” with Johnson playing the part of the woman with whom her husband is having an affair.

	











West End Girl, Allen's follow-up to 2018's No Shame, has been named one of Rolling Stone‘s best 100 albums of the year: “Here we find Allen, nearly 20 years after her debut, Alright, Still, delivering her most ruthless music yet, an odyssey of betrayal and heartbreak, a work where musical storytelling is laid out in its barest and sharpest form.”

John Cena fought in what he promised was his final WWE match Saturday, with the wrestler tapping out to end his illustrious career in the ring.


	Back in July 2024, Cena made the stunning announcement that he would retire from the WWE in 2025, with his appearance at WrestleMania in April his last time wrestling in that event. His retirement tour continued sporadically throughout this year, culminating in “The Last Time” he took the ring Saturday, for a match versus Gunther in the Saturday Night's Main Event XLII in Washington, D.C.


	Cena's wrestling career was celebrated in a celebrity-filled tribute video featuring the likes of Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Jimmy Fallon, and Jelly Roll. “John Cena, the legendary, never seen 17 [championships]. Man, thank you for all these years,” Jelly Roll said in the video. “Thank you for the inspiration. Thank you for being the role model that we all needed. You deserve this, brother. Congratulations, happy retirement.”

	The farewell match itself ran for nearly 25 minutes, with the usual ebbs and flows of a WWE match, with Cena showcasing his repertoire one last time. However, the match ended — to the dismay of fans who were chanting “Don't give up!” — with Cena losing by submission after Gunther put him in a sleeper hold.

	After the match, Cena, “the Greatest of All Time” according to WWE, remained in the ring, soaking in the crowd's chants of “Thank you Cena!.” “It's been a pleasure serving you for all these years. Thank you,” Cena said as WWE wrestlers both current and retired gathered outside the ring. Two current WWE champions, Cody Rhodes and CM Punk, symbolically presented their belts to Cena before a tribute video was shown to the Capitol One Arena crowd.

	










One final goodbye.Thank YOU, @JohnCena. 🫡 pic.twitter.com/hg8gNpbILG


	As always with retired wrestlers, it's possible Cena might still participate in WWE events albeit outside the ring. However, for the time being, he'll focus entirely on his acting career, which currently includes Peacemaker, Matchbox, and recent surprise cameos in both The Bear and Pluribus.

	It's never a good sign when the United States' national security plan is praised by Russia as being “largely consistent with our vision.”


	But that's the bizarro world we're living in, where Donald Trump and his administration continue to embolden our autocratic adversaries and alienate our democratic allies.


	This is now official American policy, delivered in the form of the newly released National Security Strategy — a directional document issued by every administration to announce its strategic priorities and posture to the world.


	Full of Trumpian bluster and contradictions, this document represents a complete break from the world America built with its allies in the wake of the Second World War. It is a red, white, and blue middle finger to the free world. In places, it even sounds like it was written by the Kremlin, framing our foreign policy approach to date as being the result of “elites [who] convinced themselves that permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country.”

	











	This is a slander and a slur on the bipartisan liberal internationalism that is based on collective security agreements — among western democracies of all sizes — to act as a counterweight to autocratic aggression, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Literally no American administration — from Truman to Reagan to Obama — has believed that “permanent American domination of the entire world was in the best interests of our country.”

	











	That is, however, a frequent Russian talking point, parroted by useful idiots on the far-right and far-left. The fact that the current Trump administration's 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine drew from Russian documents only highlights the reflexive dictator admiration of this president. It is now backed up by a material retreat from NATO allies, a Christmas gift long on Vladimir Putin's wish list.


	This national security plan codifies that the Trump administration finds common cause with the axis of autocrats by advocating regional hegemony as a vision for the 21st century. This allows Trump to parade high-minded words like “sovereignty” and “peace” in ways that dovetail with Russia and China's preferred direction of the world.

	In this vision, the United States leans into its role as the defender of the Western Hemisphere — which helps explain Trump's repeated, bleated interest in everything from annexing Greenland and Canada to retaking the Panama Canal, and of course the current threats to the odious Maduro regime in Venezuela (more on that later).


	The flipside to Trump's regional power grabs is an uneasy might-makes-right balance-of-power peace with the other regional hegemons China and Russia. China gets to dominate Asia, with Taiwan a tempting target on Chinese president-for-life Xi's to-do list. Russia gets eastern Ukraine and a weakened NATO, dovetailing perfectly with the musings of J.D. Vance's right-wing Svengali Curtis Yarvin, whose stated foreign policy vision for Europe is to “give Russia a free hand on the continent.”


	Dictators throughout history have claimed the pursuit of peace is their only aim. But the peace they advocate is always peace at the point of a bayonet, one that requires surrender under threat of invasion and annihilation. It is a vision of “peace” captured by the great Mel Brooks in his film To Be Or Not To Be, when Brooks, playing Hitler in an onstage satire, protests that all he wants is peace: “A little piece of Poland/A little piece of France/A little piece of Portugal/and Austria perchance…”


	In the recent past, the far-left was stereotypically most susceptible to these appeasing visions of peace. But now we see the rise of what might be called “code pink conservatives” who embrace an isolationist view of the world that doesn't really give a damn what happens past our shores, as Vance infamously proclaimed regarding the fate of Ukraine. This is naïve in the extreme — especially if you believe in peace through strength.

	The contradictions are everywhere. As Washington Post columnist Max Boot points out: “The [National Security Strategy] says ‘we must continue to improve commercial (and other) relations with India' even while U.S.-India relations have been wrecked by Trump's 50 percent tariffs. The NSS also vows ‘to maintain the United States' unrivaled ‘soft power,'' even as the administration eviscerates actual instruments of soft power, such as Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for International Development.”

	In the days after the National Security Strategy was released, Trump added to the whiplash by approving the sale of critical Nvidia AI chips to China, undercutting the tough talk about ensuring American leadership in the AI arms race. And those delusional Trump supporters who convinced themselves that The Donald was a dove, are twisting themselves in knots trying to understand his increasing calls for regime change in Venezuela — without any evident plan for securing the socialist failed state, which only increases the chances of compounding disaster in that already hijacked, once-prosperous nation.


	It is true that America needs to remember that we are a republic, not an empire. But if we really want to secure peace we need to keep in mind the lessons of history and strengthen ties between democratic republics —both military and economic — to act as a determined counterweight to the rising autocratic alliance. There is no real security in the ostrich-like isolationist impulse to ignore aggression or empower aggressors via appeasement. As the NATO secretary general starkly warned this week, “Conflict is at our door. Russia has brought war back to Europe — and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great grandparents endured.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update wondered if there was another reason for Donald Trump‘s chosen winners of the Kennedy Center honors, while also jabbing the 79-year-old president about his health.


	Trump, who installed himself as chairman of the once-dignified arts institution earlier this year, gave out Kennedy Center honors last Sunday to actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor and rock band KISS, among others. Trump also had the Village People perform “YMCA,” one of his favorite songs.


	Co-anchor Michael Che said that slate raises a question: “Is Donald Trump a gay man from 1978?”


Colin Jost then addressed how the Trump administration seized a Venezuelan oil tanker this week, and has been increasing the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean, in part through strikes on alleged drug boats. Trump even said in a recent interview that President Nicolas Maduro's “days are numbered.”


	“As opposed to Trump, whose days are lettered,” Jost joked, as a picture of a pill dispenser—marked with the first letter of each day of the week—showed on screen.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Che later reacted to how Trump has being saying that “affordability” is a “new word” created by Democrats to hurt him politically. Che wasn't buying it.


	“If Democrats were going to make up a word specifically to hurt Trump,” he said, “it would probably be ‘fatmentia.'”

	Jost then turned to Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. At a congressional hearing this week, Noem was interrupted by a protester yelling out to her, “The power of Christ compels you!”—the line that the priest says to the possessed girl in The Exorcist.

	“Noem mostly ignored them, but did take one quick look back,” Jost said, as Noem's head was shown turning around—a full 360 degrees, like in the film.

Saturday Night Live applied Spotify Wrapped's metrics to Uber Eats—and the public's reaction was far less positive. 


	While the streaming platform's year-end wrap up of listeners' habits included Top Genres, Listening Age and Clubs, the Uber Eats summary of eaters' deliveries features what restaurants they couldn't resist. 


	“Taco Bell, Five Guys, Burger King, Chipotle,” one man (Ben Marshall) says in the digital short, with his disgusted girlfriend (Veronika Slowikowska) commenting: “I guess that's why the plumber's always here.”


	The plumber (Kam Patterson) is then seen exiting the bathroom after competing another job, and the two say goodbye with a personalized handshake.


	While one hesitant app user (Andrew Dismuskes) finds out that he's in the top one percent of “nuggets,”  another (James Austin Johnson) learns that his top food was churros—and his Uber Eats age is “dead.” 


	“Better than mine,” his wife (Ashley Padilla) says. “52 and fat.”

	











	The Uber Eats Wrapped also shows users how they appeared to the delivery driver while grabbing their food from their doorway. One customer (Sarah Sherman) is seen on all-fours in one picture, and half-exposed in a bathrobe in another. 


	“Who would I even share these with?” she wonders.

	Finally, the app shows thankful, personalized messages from customers' most frequented restaurants, and calculates the total spent on deliveries. For some, it's the price of a car: $24,000.

Tuesday marked 60 years since something was spotted in the sky over Westmoreland County

Last Tuesday marked 60 years since the famous Kecksburg UFO incident in which something was spotted in the sky over the Westmoreland County community and, according to some witnesses, it made a controlled landing.

Last week, ""4 The Record"" host Michelle Wright interviewed Ronnie Struble, a 50-year veteran of the Kecksburg Volunteer Fire Department, as well as UFO researcher and author Stan Gordon, about the event.

This week, Wright turned her attention to Bob Gatty, a former Greensburg Tribune-Review reporter who was on the scene that night.

Gatty was asked what it was that came out of the sky and he said, “Hard to tell, but I do believe that something happened. I do believe something landed there.”

He also said he never expected that night that this story would continue to follow him for 60 years.

“I'm 82 years old and that thing has followed me my whole life,” he said. “It's the story that won't go away.”

Are we living in the Age of Disclosure? We're certainly living in the age of the documentary film, The Age of Disclosure (Prime Video).

Passionate disclosurists such as Danny Sheehan and the New Paradigm Institute energetically plugged the film's debut along with plugging Global Disclosure Day (October 19, 2025), as if they were readying us for the imminent Apocalypse. Podcaster Colin Cowherd interviewed Dan Farah, director of The Age of Disclosure, because it was “the number one movie on Prime.” The fanfare leading up to the film's debut in late 2025 excited audiences with the equivalent of Chicken Little's, “the sky is falling.” Would we learn secrets kept by the Pentagon for 80 years? Would we learn that the US government has retrieved crashed space ships and dissected alien biologics? Would we learn of reversed alien technology that jump-started AI and related industries? Would we learn that AI dispensed military secrets that make the American military the most powerful on our planet?

My wife, Karen, and I raised the drawbridge, posted lookout guards on the parapets, starved the crocodiles in the moat to make them aggressive to intruders. Then we sat down in our television room undisturbed to watch The Age of Disclosure. Nobody interrupted us. We chomped on our popcorn with eyes glued to the screen.

What we saw, disappointingly, was the same ol' material we've been viewing for nearly eight decades. The film's central question was this: are UAP (Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena) real? Well, this question was answered already in Donald Keyhoe's 1950 best seller, The Flying Saucers Are Real. Nothing in this 2025 documentary said anything qualitatively new that had not been part of the discussion for three-quarters of a century. Same ol' criticism of government conspiracy. Some newer cases, to be sure. But structurally the same ol' documentation of sitings aimed at stressing their importance.

“Here we go…again,” writes Skeptic editor Michael Shermer.

“Another documentary film about how disclosure of alien contact is imminent….The Age of Disclosure is packaged and produced so well that naïve viewers may come away thinking that something strikingly original, shockingly new, and world-shaking is about to be loosed among the world….We have been hearing of pending disclosure for half a century and are always left wanting….Alas, it is not to be. Every fact, opinion, or anecdote in the film has been rehearsed elsewhere in recent years.”

One kinda new theme surprised me. The Age of Disclosure introduced a new hero, Luis Elizondo. My wife and I could put three handfuls of popcorn into our mouths during each long scene where we watched Lou silently staring up at US government buildings, pensively pondering the significance of contact with nonhuman extraterrestrial civilizations.  Sigh. Might Elizando become a new shaman, connecting earth with what lies beyond the heavens?

Shermer and I agree on another point. For a superior film on the same theme, try James Fox's films, such as  The Phenomenon.

In a Substack post, “UAP disclosurism compromises US national security! Really?,” I attempted to formulate the puzzles and paradoxes endemic to the UAP Disclosure movement. Like rear wheels spinning in a Minnesota snow bank that prevent the car from moving forward, ufologists have been spinning the same responses to unanswerable questions from generation to generation. Are UAP real? Why is the government hiding the truth? Are we being visited by extraterrestrial intelligences? Are aliens already living among us?

Here is the kind of thing we keep running into in disclosurism. Popular UFO columnist Ross Coulthart claims that a crashed alien spacecraft was so large that the only option was for the US military to construct a building around it in the country where it was found. Now, that's exciting news. Just where is it? Can we go take a look? No. Coulthart told an interviewer on the Project Unity Podcast that he knows exactly where the craft is, but he won't say. It is my observation that the cloak of secrecy increases our feeling that UAP are important. So disclosurists repeatedly offer the same cocktail: tease and postpone; tease and postpone; tease and postpone.

My observation is this: it is important to disclosurists that such questions never get definitively answered. Why? This puzzles me.

Like the Pythia priestesses discerning the messages of Apollo at Delphi — Delphi was the omphalos of the ancient Greek world — the oracles UAP disclosurists receive today are nearly always ambiguous. Just what could the messages mean? Disclosurists gather repeatedly at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, today's American omphalus. Those testifying declare that UAP are real and that we share our cosmos with nonhuman intelligences. Almost nobody resists. Congressman Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) accuses his own government of a cover-up. And then everyone goes home until the next set of hearings gets scheduled. The drama gets repeated over and over.

Perhaps the best-known Pythia priestess in the disclosure army is medical doctor turned ufologist, Steven Greer. In 1993, he founded the Disclosure Project. Greer believes that UAP are craft ferrying extraterrestrials to Earth. He regularly interviews government authorities and files for freedom of information documents. He pesters Washington like the Delphi priestesses pestered Apollo.

Also among the oracle's priestesses we find the exciting public interest lawyer mentioned above, Daniel Sheehan. Sheehan and the New Paradigms Institute have issued a “new call to action” when presenting at the Contact in the Desert conference May 29-June 2, 2025. See: “Investigate the Use of Disonfo & Classification Abuse.” We also find disclosurists within the US government. U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna (R-Florida), who, according to MUFON investigator Bob Spearing, believes that “interdimensional beings” exist, is a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. She has vowed to get to the bottom of the UAP phenomenon and has even spoken to some very reliable witnesses such as F-15 pilots. And she has also written directly to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Why has Representative Luna not yet definitively disclosed the truth? Because there exists a “national security state” that clandestinely hides the truth from Congress for its own purposes. This means that even if Congress demanded disclosure, the so-called national security state would resist declassifying the information it possesses.

Curiously, Steven Greer suspects that Luis Elizando and Christopher Mellon might belong to a government cabal — to the national security state — to press the national security threat scenario. Greer fears some UAP disclosurists in cahoots with the Pentagon might plan a false flag incident, blaming space aliens, and ask for increased funding for national defence. For this reason, Greer recommends viewers boycott the film, The Age of Disclosure.

So, despite the persistence of these disclosurists, the tires keep spinning. When, oh when, will the spinning tires take traction? Please don't tell me it's imminent.

Wag skeptics, V.J. Ballester-Olmos and Luis Cayetano, have published a lengthy and detailed report, “On the AAWSAP-AATIP Confusion.” They speculate. Had extraterrestrial intelligence really wanted to communicate with us on Earth, after all this time, such intelligence would have found a way to succeed. “We feel that any entity that needs almost 80 years to pose a question or convey a meaning to be understood does not seem very intelligent” (p.64).

Well, despite such pot shots, I maintain a fascination and appreciation for Danny Sheehan and such colleagues who sustain vigorous study of UAP, chronicle events, exact scientific investigative methods, and interview those who have valuable input. There is definitely a mystery here that needs to be resolved.

Let me repeat some observations and hypotheses I've been considering. I call my surmises discourse clarification.

First, it is my observation that disclosurism today is virtually unchanged from what we saw already in the early 1950s. Donald Keyhoe and other popular flying saucer authors of that era depicted a recalcitrant government hiding the truth. The truth the government was hiding had to do with ETI. National security was the smokescreen to keep ETI knowledge secret. So Keyhoe and others claimed. And, of course, this claim was confirmed during the Project Blue Book era.

Curiously, government secrecy is built right into the comprehensive category, the UFO phenomenon. One of the most widely read of today's UAP interpreters, D.W. Pasulka, partially resolves the earlier puzzlement. She contends that the US government purposefully confuses us. “We're talking about why the government is not being forthcoming….Their intention is to make it confusing. And they've done a very good job of that.”

Second, despite frequently used words such as ‘imminent', we are no closer today than we were 75 years ago to the anticipated great moment of revelation. Why? I hypothesize that we find living without disclosure is more exciting than obtaining what information Washington actually has. No matter what Washington reveals, we still want to say that Uncle Sam is hiding something. Uncle Sam's successful secrecy only makes us all the more admire the power of the state.

There is a paradoxical advantage to this. Without final disclosure, ufologists can continue to project imaginaries onto Uncle Sam without fear of factual refutation. A curious kind of paradox is at work: the demand for disclosure is more important than the actual disclosure itself.

Third, the hidden entelechy at work here is power. Of all things the human spirit desires, power is the most coveted. Notions of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations with the power to traverse the immense distances between star systems tantalize our imaginations. Such power could just as easily destroy as save. To add to this imaginary, the notion that the US military has benefited from reverse engineering advanced alien technology only increases our respect for American power. Alien power and American power together awe us. Alien power sanctifies American power. Without ever getting definitive and final disclosure, we can float ecstatically and perpetually in the sea of awe.

Fourth, my observation is that for decades, ufologists have interpreted UAP as benign if not benevolent. In my book, UFOs–God's Chariots?, I describe how extraterrestrials have become, for many, our celestial saviors. But disclosurists are ambiguous. Visiting space aliens could be benevolent or hostile. Or some of each. Disclosurists have ascribed to the Pentagon the fear that alien craft in our skies pose a security risk. This justifies Pentagon secrecy. Ufologists feel empowered by knowing the truth while trying to get the Pentagon to admit it.

Here is a new twist. At least at a certain level. Luis Elizondo and some Silicon Valley conspirators are confusing things. Ufologists are themselves categorizing UAP as a security threat. These ufologists believe they can justify expanding the military budget to defend Earth from an interplanetary invasion. Those who know the UFO phenomenon well — such as Jensine Andresen — are aware that there is no evidence of military threat coming from either UFO experiencers or extraterrestrial visitors. Therefore, this new movement to describe UAP as a security threat is misleading. The puzzles only multiply.

These are my observations and hypotheses. By no means is this the last word. Like a dust devil, disclosurism kicks up enough swirling to blur our vision and cause some stumbling.

Mumbai–Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery emerges as a gripping and atmospheric paranormal series that blends horror, mystery, and emotional depth with notable restraint and intelligence. Inspired by real-life events, the show brings to screen the enigmatic journey of India's most well-known paranormal investigator, Gaurav Tiwari, offering viewers a chilling yet grounded storytelling experience.

What truly anchors the series is Karan Tacker's exceptional performance in the lead role. With quiet authority and emotional subtlety, Tacker captures the essence of a man driven by intellectual curiosity while grappling with inner vulnerability. His portrayal avoids melodrama, relying instead on controlled body language, expressive silences, and understated intensity—particularly effective during investigative sequences. The emotional moments reflecting isolation and psychological pressure add a deeply human layer to the character, making the performance both believable and impactful.

The supporting cast—Kalki Koechlin, Saloni Batra, Danish Sood, Shubham Choudhury, and Nimisha Nair—deliver strong performances, effectively conveying fear, skepticism, and emotional conflict without tipping into excess.

Director Robbie Grewal deserves special mention for handling a sensitive, real-life inspired subject with care while maintaining commercial appeal. Rather than leaning on loud jump scares, the series builds fear through mood, silence, and psychological tension. The paranormal cases unfold methodically, lending authenticity to the narrative and keeping even skeptical viewers engaged.

Technically, the series is well-crafted. The background score heightens the eerie atmosphere without overpowering scenes, while the cinematography smartly uses shadows, low lighting, and confined spaces to amplify dread. Each element works in tandem to sustain a sense of unease throughout.

Streaming on Amazon MX Player, Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery stands out as a rare example of intelligent horror in the Indian streaming space—one that prioritizes emotional resonance and realism over shock value.

Produced by Almighty Motion Picture and released on December 12, the series earns a strong 4-star rating, making it a must-watch for fans of mystery, psychological thrillers, and supernatural storytelling. (Source: IANS)

Egyptologist Zahi Hawass asserted that many of the claims circulating about the pyramids and mentioned in certain books are baseless.

During an interview with Sada al-Balad TV, Hawass added that some people have even fabricated fake papyri and claimed they were preserved in the Vatican.

Any claims about aliens or extraterrestrial involvement in the construction of the pyramids are completely unfounded.

Other claims that pyramids were used to generate electricity or that granite was mainly used in their construction are also incorrect, he explained, as limestone is the primary building material, with the exception of the five upper chambers which do contain granite.

 

He added that the ancient Egyptians used their engineering skills to utilize the limestone and granite of the Giza Plateau in construction with astonishing precision.

Hawass explained that the use of 3D scanning technology revealed the names of the work crews who participated in lifting the stones.

These historical discoveries completely refute any unscientific claims about the intervention of extraterrestrial beings or supernatural forces.

Hawass called on utilizing documented scientific sources before believing any books or claims about the pyramids.

He noted that what is sometimes published under the names of researchers or writers has no basis in reality, and that only the ancient Egyptians alone were responsible for these magnificent engineering feats.

Janata Bank struggles while Sonali recovers

Every December, the internet briefly becomes a giant music confessional. Screenshots flood social feeds. Stories light up with lists no one asked for but everyone shares anyway. And among the data visualisations and neon-coloured slides, one joke seems to come back every year: no matter what you think you listened to, Spotify Wrapped will somehow crown Pritam as your #1 artiste. You could have sworn you spent the entire year immersed in indie music, or Taylor Swift, but Wrapped insists you were actually living inside the ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" soundtrack.

The meme is funny but it also captures something essential about Wrapped: beneath the sleek design and shareable graphics lies a complex, algorithmic machine that processes millions of micro-behaviours to deliver something that looks like a narrative of your year. Most users experience the result as an emotional truth. The science behind Wrapped, however, is built on something far more mechanical, behavioural, and statistical. And to understand why Pritam keeps spontaneously appearing in so many people's Top Artistes lists, you have to unpack how the system collects and weighs data. 

Spotify does not simply tally every single play. Wrapped is built on filtered listening hours, engagement scores, and repeat-play intensity, and it considers patterns in a way that can occasionally surprise users. It divides listening into several categories. The most influential is the intentional play, which includes songs you actively tap on, songs you search for, and songs you add to playlists. These actions signal preference and raise the weighting of an artiste. So even if you listen to only a few Pritam songs, if they happen during high-focus months, say during exam season, work deadlines, or heartbreak episodes, the repeat clustering makes him important to your algorithmic year, even if the raw quantity is low. Another factor is something engineers call the session effect. Wrapped does not count time spent on autoplay the same way it counts deliberate listening, but it also does not fully discount it. If you forget to disconnect your Airpods after playing one Pritam track and the algorithm drifts into similar soundtracks for the next 90 minutes, your Wrapped will politely pretend this was very much part of your personality. Autoplay listening is weighted less but still contributes to overall artiste rankings. Multiply this by dozens of passive listening sessions through the year, and suddenly your assumed #1 artiste loses to someone you barely consciously heard.

Wrapped also draws heavily from loop behaviour, or the number of times you repeated the same track. One heartbreak loop of five consecutive plays in March is worth more algorithmically than listening to twenty new songs once each in June. Spotify interprets looping as a sign of high emotional engagement. This is why one dramatic evening with a Pritam track can outweigh months of casual listening to your favourite international artist. Because, to Spotify, emotional intensity weighs way more than breadth of taste. And then there is also the matter of era detection. Spotify analyses clusters of genres and moods across different periods of the year. If you had a Bollywood soundtrack phase, even a small one, it gets detected as a defined musical era. Artistes from that era are then weighted higher for Wrapped, especially if the rest of your listening was more eclectic or fragmented. When your habits have no clear dominant pattern, the algorithm picks the pattern that is most coherent, not necessarily most representative.

Spotify's engineers have spoken in interviews about the threshold filters. For example, if you listened to an artiste fewer than thirty times in the entire year, they usually would not appear in Top Artistes unless your overall listening was low or extremely diverse. So if you are musically chaotic, even small spikes matter disproportionately. Which is precisely why a person who streams 100 different artists lightly may end up with Pritam topping the list while another person with a highly repetitive playlist distribution ends up with a much more predictable Wrapped. It is also powered by a concept known as affinity modelling. Spotify assigns affinity scores to artists based on your behaviour relative to the behaviour of people similar to you. If a significant percentage of listeners in your region behave similarly, your affinity scores for mainstream artists get boosted. In South Asia, this often benefits artistes like Pritam, Amit Trivedi, or A R Rahman, even for listeners who consider their taste far removed from Hindi film music. 

Then comes the role of skip rate, an underrated but powerful metric. If you skip an artiste's tracks quickly, their ranking plummets. If you let a song play in full, say while multitasking, the algorithm assumes you liked it. Whether you were too busy to hit skip is irrelevant to Spotify because time equals interest. This is how accidental listens accumulate meaning. The viral memes surrounding Wrapped each year are not accidental either. The product team intentionally designs Wrapped to be shareable. The vertical format matches Instagram Stories. The colour-blocking resembles TikTok's saturated edits. The humour in the captions encourages screenshotting. The ranking formats mimic video game achievements, which makes users more likely to publicly compare. It is designed to feel personal and the engineering is tied directly to emotional design. Spotify wraps raw numbers in narrative language and this emotionally charged phrasing reinforces the feeling that this is not simply metadata but a meaningful reflection of your identity. It uses colour theory, dynamic layouts, tiered animations, and compact categorisation to make your year appear aesthetically pleasing. The interface makes listening patterns look like achievement badges. It gamifies something you did not even realise was a game.

Every year, Spotify processes billions of listening events across 574 million users. Data pipelines run for months, cleaning, deduplicating, filtering, and modelling. Engineers have spoken about the annual year-end freeze, a period when Spotify stops pushing new features to ensure that Wrapped's infrastructure remains stable for its December rollout. It is one of the largest coordinated data storytelling operations globally, executed in real time, personalising millions of unique narratives within hours. The science behind Wrapped also hints at the future of personalised analytics. As AI develops richer understanding of mood, context, and multi-device behaviour, future Wrapped reports could integrate emotional detection, time-of-day patterns, biometric syncs with wearables, or even sentiment analysis from lyrics. In other words, the next wave of Wrapped-style features across digital platforms may become even more immersive, predictive, and strangely intimate.

And yet, despite the data complexity, the behavioural modelling, and the scaled infrastructure, it always comes back to the same essential idea of users wanting to see themselves reflected in their digital life. Even if that reflection is partly algorithmic fiction. Even if it decides that you, despite thinking you were a Swiftie, were actually a Pritam loyalist all along. At the end of the day, it works because it delivers a narrative of the year that feels clean, colourful, conclusive. Real life is messy; algorithms tidy it up. Maybe that's why we love Wrapped so much. Maybe that's why we forgive it when it gets things wrong. And maybe that's why we laugh every year when the Pritam meme resurfaces, because the truth is, no matter what we listen to, Wrapped tells us a story we are secretly eager to believe.

New Jersey has received good news about an odd topic. We are among the states where you are least likely to get abducted by an alien.

We don't know if you believe in UFOs or aliens, but we do know that no matter where you land on the topic, the news is that abductions from outer space are low in New Jersey.

While New Jersey residents are not the safest from getting an unwanted trip on an alien spaceship, we are among the top 5 safest states, according to the New York Post.

I'm not going to lie. You can count me among the people who think there is something out there, so this news is a big relief to me.

There are actual statistics to back this up as well. Or at least the odds of your chance of getting abducted.

Read More: A Terrifying Haunted New Jersey Road

In New Jersey, the chance of being taken by an alien is 1 per 3086, which isn't exactly low enough odds in my mind.

The safest state from alien abduction is Louisiana, followed by Mississippi, Alabama, and Virginia.

The state where you are most likely to be taken by an alien is California, where the odds are 1 in 1075.

I don't know if this information will help you sleep better or keep you up all night, but good luck.

Allan Bryant Snr reveals the horrific, taunting messages he receives from amateur detectives and trolls, with one sick letter reading: 'This hunt is going to be fun, your son is in bits'

TRAUMATISED over their son's mystifying disappearance, the family of Allan Bryant have a raft of disturbing questions. Was he murdered on a night out? Did he have a run-in with a criminal gang?

But as his parents search for answers, they today reveal a dark new turn in the tragic case – explaining how callous TikTok sleuths and ‘psychics' have destroyed their lives with gruesome theories, which astonishingly have even been investigated by police without the family's knowledge.

Allan Jr disappeared 12 years ago on a night out, aged just 23, and was last seen on CCTV leaving Styx nightclub in Glenrothes, Scotland, at 2am on November 3, 2013.

His mum, Marie Dugan, and dad, Allan Snr, are convinced he was murdered after allegedly going to a house party after the club – and say the same names have often cropped up over the years, though no one has ever been convicted, and no remains ever found.

Mr Bryant – who fears his son may have made contact with a crime gang before his death – has himself passed thousands of tip-offs to Police Scotland during the investigation – and at one stage, cops even searched a house in the town, though nothing came of it.

He is therefore angry detectives failed to reveal they had followed up on a bogus tip-off of their own last year that Allan Jr's remains were buried on a farm – with the family only finding out by chance a couple of weeks ago.  

It was another example of what he believes was simply a “psychic” claiming to be in the know, providing the police with unverified details out of the blue and bogging down the investigation.

The family are regularly sent social media DMs, including “sick images”, and letters, and even get tagged in TikTok videos by people claiming they have had psychic visions about what's happened.

It follows the rise of TikTok's controversial ‘CrimeTok' community, which sees true crime enthusiasts and amateur sleuths pore over the details of cold cases and missing person riddles – often with little regard for the real-life families affected by the stories.

Mr Bryant said his family have been “hounded by psychics, mediums and clairvoyants” for 12 years and they've “had enough”.

He told The Sun this week: “Some of them go into gruesome detail they don't have to go into.

“Saying what's happened to Allan, that he's been chopped up. You read it and it gets you upset and angry. 

“We need facts, we don't need this. We need things the police can work on, they're not going to work on anything a psychic says.”

One video sees a clairvoyant going over a drawing they've made of an obscure location and says: “I have seen a male person with a lot of scars on his face – and he's very witchy with long dark hair.”

She goes on to describe ruins and a leaking sewage pipe, as well as a cliff.

But there are others who are far more sinister, including one troll who wrote: “This hunt is going to be fun, your son is in bits.”

The Bryant family are sadly no strange to the toxic world of online abuse.

Creep Stewart McInroy was jailed twice for trolling offences against the Bryant family, in 2014 and 2018.

In 2016 BBC documentary Troll Hunters, he admitted he was “addicted” to causing controversy online.

In a Facebook group set up to find Allan, he had posted: “I am the killer of Allan Bryant.”

He later claimed to have abducted Allan, held him hostage and tortured him before killing him and dumping the body.

Mr Bryant says the recent flood of baseless tip-offs from sleuths is causing further pain for his tormented family.

The bogus farm tip-off saw an anonymous person claiming they believed Allan's remains had been in a pond on a farm in Fife for two years before being moved, and had sent Google Map images of the location to police.

Mr Bryant, who wasn't told about the letter at the time, told The Sun: “The police went up and looked at it, but the farmer told them there's no pond there.

“It said in the letter the pond dries up in the summer and cattle were stamping on his remains and so he was moved and dumped on another part of the farm.”

He believes the farm tipster is “just a psychic” who is not familiar with the area, and clearly doesn't understand how big Fife is.

Mr Bryant said he had to delete at least five unsolicited Facebook messages last week alone from either people claiming to have psychic gifts or know clairvoyants who he should speak to.

He said: “For years and years I've received pictures and maps saying ‘Allan's here' or ‘Allan's here'. 

“They don't realise how big Fife is. How far he'd have had to have walked. It's different towns – I get comments and messages all the time saying ‘you should try this psychic'… sometimes they send a number and say ‘contact me, I'm a psychic, I'll give you a reading'.

“I've had enough, after all this carry on – my family don't need this. To me they are just trolls.

“We're not interested, you don't have these gifts. You're just preying on my family, and preying on the families of people who have lost loved ones.

“They shouldn't be allowed to do it – there should be a law to stop it.”

He added: “It's not just letters and messages, they make TikTok videos saying ‘we think this has happened to him, I've got a feeling'. It's a load of crap.”

Mr Bryant added: “I understand why people go and see them, if they've lost family and want a reading, I understand it. 

“But to troll a family who've been through that just so they can post things for likes and views. To me they're just trolls, they don't have special gifts. 

“Go back to the 18th or 19th century.”

Mr Bryant's wife Marie had previously agreed to speak to a couple of psychics early in the investigation.

One claimed their son was in a park that had already been scoured multiple times by cops, while a second psychic, a professor from a university, came to the house.

“He was going over to the chairs, it was like something out of f***ing Poltergeist,” said Mr Bryant. 

“I've got a feeling', I'm looking at him going ‘this c***'s not right in the head, I'm ready to tell him to f*** off'. 

“He went to the nightclub, it's seven miles away. He felt the door knob and came back and said ‘two guys, two girls were there, they've killed Allan'. 

“We said ‘who are they then?' He said ‘I can't tell you, I'll have to talk to the police'. 

“It's like, what do you mean you've got to tell the police? You came into my house. It's just a lot of nonsense.

“There's not one police force that uses them.”

Mr Bryant only found out about the farm tip-off when his local paper also received the same letter in recent weeks.

He said: “This is what annoyed me the most – the police were contacted and they received a letter and they should have told us about it.

“I'm still angry with them, just let us know and otherwise this wouldn't have happened.” 

He added: “We basically know what's going on in Allan's investigation. 

“Police come out and ask me about certain things so I know they're receiving certain information and I'll say ‘it doesn't ring a bell' or whatever. 

“A lot of the information we get always points to the same individuals. We know something happened to Allan that night, somebody killed him. 

“We know just based on the information we've received over the years. Just trying to prove it is the hard part.”

Detective Inspector Steven McLean told The Sun: “Our aim remains to find answers for Allan's family and officers continue to support and regularly update them with relevant information.

“This information was previously passed to police, and extensive enquiries were conducted, with officers attending and assessing the area described. As a result this latest information is not deemed credible at this time.

RECOMMENDED STORIES

“If you have information that could help and have not already spoken to us then please get in touch. Any information, no matter how small, could prove to be vital.

“Allan remains a missing person and officers continue to make enquiries to trace him. Any new information will be assessed and anyone who can assist should call Police Scotland on 101, or email OperationToner@scotland.police.uk if you can help.”

PSYOPS capabilities must be seen as an important element of the defensive system of the Polish state. At the same time, we should consider how certain issues are handled by our allies, but also by adversaries/rivals. That gives a picture of the importance of investing in PSYOPS capabilities in the future, especially in the context of plans to strengthen our Armed Forces. First, let us look at how so-called PSYOPS are approached in selected NATO countries.

When thinking about the contemporary PSYOPS space, we must not forget that we do not operate in a vacuum but in an environment shaped by the activity of our allies as well as potential adversaries/rivals. First of all, it must be stated plainly that within NATO there is a group of states with highly developed PSYOPS toolkits leading the way in developing these capabilities. These include, of course, the United States, and within the European pillar of NATO also the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The Americans naturally boast the largest inventory of PSYOPS units, but also the development of doctrinal support and tools, including their digitization. At this point it is worth referring to the official characterization of the PSYOP soldiers the Americans seek and to a specific definition of their mission. 

In official messaging it is said that candidates for PSYOPS service are „assessed and selected for intellect, critical and analytical thinking skills, adaptive capacity and psychological resilience.” It is recognized that they must be people able to be educated in highly diverse environments, covering influence tools, language, cultural and religious aspects in selected theaters of operations. Today they must understand the dynamics of new forms of communication, hence the ability to influence by classical means (radio, television, leaflets, etc.) but also via modern formats, including social media. 

It is worth again citing the official U.S. description, which notes that military personnel engaged in PSYOPS „analyze the operational environment, physical objectives and target audiences; advise on psychological effects; plan influence options; develop activities and messages targeted at psychological vulnerabilities; optimally time actions and messages; and assess the effectiveness of influence. Operating in small, autonomous teams, PSYOP units conduct military information support operations; deception activities in support of objectives designated by the Department of War; support building partner influence capabilities for partner forces; and, at the president's request, provide informational support to civilian authorities.”

This short public statement highlights the importance of PSYOPS resources for the entire U.S. armed forces, but also more broadly for the state apparatus in the event of a variety of scenarios (from conventional conflict to counter-insurgency (COIN) actions, counter-terrorism and Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW) — a common category after the Cold War).

The information domain requires U.S. commanders to be flexible, to understand its rules and to be capable of creating their own messages as well as steering/influencing others. In the era of current tensions on the U.S.–Venezuela line, it should be noted that lessons from the post-Vietnam era have come from that region, for example attempts to isolate the information battlefield during the invasion of Grenada (1983) and later Panama (1989). The pinnacle of these capabilities naturally became the ability to control messaging during the Gulf War in 1990–91 and the first phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 (later messaging, e.g. due to the emergence of new media such as Al Jazeera and new channels of strategic-level communication, was contested).

Most importantly, in analyzing the approach of this power, one sees that the Americans are doctrinally continually evolving alongside the new needs of the operational and information environment. In recent years they prepared to conduct Military Information Support Operations (MISO) at every level, from tactical to strategic. Regarding MISO, the U.S. Army clarified that MISO „involve providing selected information to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, reasoning and behavior of governments and citizens. This may include cyberspace activities and advanced communication techniques via any media.” It was also specified that this may include deliberately deceiving enemy forces during combat (deception) using a range of PSYOPS tools. Currently the U.S. uses the term PSYWAR (Psychological warfare), which today has joined PSYOPS, MISO, earlier efforts to win „hearts and minds,” and still earlier classical elements of wartime propaganda from the world wars.

Note that it was not by chance that the U.S. Army perspective was discussed: it is the ground forces and the Special Operations Forces (SOF) that derive from them which possess the most significant PSYOPS/PSYWAR resources in the United States. Interestingly, in 2024 the PSYWAR School was reactivated (originally the John F. Kennedy U.S. Army Special Warfare Center and School). It is said that the PSYWAR School trains and qualifies U.S. Army Psychological Operations (PO) personnel for missions associated with special operations worldwide. It is added that this is the only such qualifying course in military occupational specialties (MOS) under the Department of War. Thus, the PSYWAR School trains and qualifies all military personnel in PSYWAR.  

Importantly, this concerns operational military resources and a developed reserve pool intended to strengthen PSYWAR if forces are expanded. Curiously, should new needs arise, for example in the U.S. Navy, certain PSYWAR capabilities could appear there, though they are not as visible as in the land forces (note the Naval Reserve Atlantic Fleet PSYOP Audiovisual Unit). Regarding the U.S. Air Force, note the existence of the 193rd Special Operations Wing stationed at Harrisburg International Airport (Pennsylvania), which provides the only airborne platform for psychological operations in the Department of War, using EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft.

Returning to the U.S. Army, let us focus briefly on active units only, indicating two groupings (according to the current situation, although with forthcoming changes within the U.S. land forces, changes in PSYWAR units are also highly likely):

It should also be added that the Americans have the ability to rapidly reinforce PSYWAR forces with reserve units that were called up, for example, for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the event of a major conflict, the U.S. therefore has the ability to expand its PSYWAR operations. This is one of the undisputed challenges for our country as well, being aware that a crisis or war may require us to develop and quickly incorporate national military PSYOPS resources. 

The Germans have placed their PSYOPS capabilities within the Zentrum für Operative Kommunikation unterstützen die Operationsführung (ZOpKomBw). Germany is distinguished by a much more restrictive approach to operation-related issues in this area, which is undoubtedly a consequence of historical experience and the specifics of the political system's control over the armed forces. According to the official description, ZOpKomBw military personnel support operational commands at national and international levels for various deployments of Bundeswehr units. It is noted that „like a civilian media structure, the ZOpKomBw team analyzes the population situation in deployment areas and engages target groups using printed, audio, video and other materials, including online channels. As part of a direct communication strategy, the Centre conducts planned and targeted conversations with local populations to achieve desired effects.”

To this end, these specialists possess comprehensive knowledge of communication objectives and understand local cultural circumstances and the specific communication habits of target groups. This enables the Bundeswehr to use the information environment as a military operational space. Assigned support tasks include disseminating information about soldiers via radio and maintaining soldier morale through television programs.” The unit's tools also include Radio Andernach and the Bundeswehr-TV channel (BWTV). On the German side one sees a focus primarily on information (operative kommunikation) and creating potentially positive messaging during deployments in environments that may face hostile disinformation campaigns.   

However, one must remember that German resources are highly professional and visible in the NATO space. It is even argued that the German component may today be the most important element for such activities in the European NATO area.

In the Italian Armed Forces the focus is primarily on forces concentrated in the 28º Reggimento „Pavia,” which is part of the Brigata Informazioni Tattiche. This tactical formation is unique because its potential is built around PSYOPS and operational communications (comunicazioni operative) in the information domain, but it also contains elements related to intelligence (HUMINT and IMINT) and electronic warfare (EW). Again, one can observe that in many NATO countries there is an adaptation of how PSYOPS assets are positioned to the national vision of integrating tools from multiple domains. The Italians emphasize synergy between informational and cognitive warfare, broadly supported by intelligence capabilities, EW and cyber.  

Official information refers to an operational communications battalion (comunicazioni operative) composed of several companies. Italian troops are capable of conducting activities with classical communication means, including press, radio and TV, but also new Internet-based forms of communication. Italian PSYOPS, like those of other countries discussed, have many deployments as part of foreign missions where Italian contingents have been present. However, the Italian side is considerably less inclined to boast about its capabilities and is much more laconic in specifying details related to information-domain tools. One can speculate that the proximity of PSYOPS to intelligence and EW tasks does not help transparency regarding the activities of the 28º Reggimento „Pavia.”   

Equally interesting is the French approach to PSYOPS, which, like Germany and the United Kingdom, frames its activities through the prism of operations in the information domain and influence operations (opérations militaires d'influence). It should be noted that for France the information domain is one of the key new spaces for state activity and tools and institutions are being created accordingly. Beyond the military, one example is VIGINUM, the French service for monitoring and protecting against foreign digital interference, which has confronted, for example, Russian influence operations at critical moments for France. Within the French armed forces, since 2012 a key role has been reserved for Le Centre interarmées des actions sur l'environnement (CIAE).  

Interestingly, CIAE for several years sought its place between intelligence and cyber, ultimately falling under the specialist Commandement des actions spéciales Terre (CAST). CIAE's resources are dedicated at tactical, operational and strategic levels. The French note that „contemporary conflicts in the world show that wars are also won through the state's capacity to influence. Recognized as a strategic function in the 2022 National Strategic Review (Revue stratégique nationale), »influence« (l'influence) allows one to affect perception during operations through knowledge and understanding of the information and human environment.” This ties into the popular French saying about having the capacity to „win the war before the war.” Thus, for the French it is necessary to view holistically the capabilities of special operations forces, CIMIC, cyber and influence forces — or, in simpler terms, PSYOPS. In this last case, the emphasis is rather on the concept of „lutte informatique d'influence (L2I) et la formation à l'influence.”     

CIAE, as officially indicated, uses experts in information-combat fields in influence, information environment analysis, but also multimedia production, psychological actions and civil-military relations (CIMIC). A three-part cycle is described: CIAE is tasked with learning, analyzing and understanding the information and human environment for operations; then CIAE must trigger effects that influence attitudes and behaviors through impacting perceptions; and finally CIAE must train soldiers designated for influence activities, pass on knowledge about information warfare within the armed forces, and raise decision-makers« awareness of the importance of these concepts. The latter element is worth emphasizing because it has great significance for any armed forces. Above all, because our own troops are and will be in the orbit of hostile operations in the information domain. Not to mention the growing need to raise awareness of these issues among components responsible for command, and in the political decision-making space of national defense.    

Looking at the U.S., it is also worth pointing to another NATO country whose soldiers already serve in Poland: the United Kingdom. In this case the core of PSYOPS capabilities is the 77th Brigade Information Operations. However, an important caveat should be noted: the British prefer to use the term Information Operations, and they also refer to influence and to military strategic effects. In any case, the British do not hide that by investing in the 77th Brigade's IO capabilities they seek the necessary adaptation to warfare under new information-domain conditions. They note that „war is evolving dynamically, and the ability to compete in the information space is key. We must develop our capabilities and find new ways of operating to confront our adversaries.” Note that the tactical formation discussed is a hybrid unit composed of regulars and reservists with specialist skills for operating in the information environment.      

The armed forces are officially and explicitly assigned the following objectives: the ability to build partnerships and also to conduct operations beyond the state's borders; capabilities with respect to the information environment and the development of means to obtain advantage in that space; the identification, development and conduct of information operations, independently or in cooperation with partners, in order to gain advantage over actual or potential adversaries; and audience analysis to ensure the most effective actions supporting military objectives. It should be noted that the British side emphasizes a very important aspect of activity in the information domain, which points to the synergy between PSYOPS units and intelligence structures. It is stated plainly that, quote, „by using intelligence to understand audiences and systems, to analyse networks and identify intelligence opportunities, the Brigade has a range of means to achieve effect.” In short, when looking at PSYOPS one must also see the cyber domain and a number of elements relating to the state's intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities and those of its armed forces. 

Within the 77th Brigade attention is drawn to the 5 Information Operations Task Force, whose soldiers are the most expeditionary and have the ability to deploy Planning and Liaison Elements and, most importantly, Tactical PsyOps teams—supporting operations of the United Kingdom's armed forces as well as allied/coalition operations in the tactical PSYOPS space.

The 5 IOTF is made up of professional soldiers and officers from all services and all branches who are trained to use unconventional equipment, processes and techniques in order to exert targeted forms of pressure on the United Kingdom's adversaries. The second element of the Brigade is the 101 Information Operations Task Force (101 IOTF). Members of 101 IOTF are recruited by seeking experts in: photography, video and post-production, journalism, marketing and communications, media relations, disinformation, influence, and also media monitoring. Increasingly indispensable are experts with knowledge of social media, digital content creation and online influence activities—especially as the military faces growing requirements to respond to changes in information technologies, including the use of, for example, AI tools.   

Ukrainian military intelligence has reported adding sixteen people to the list of propagandists. Its composition is said to include: 201st Company, which fields a specialist-hybrid subunit covering OSINT collection, data innovation and digital information activities (per the unit description). It is officially stressed that it is highly trained in online communications, security and analysis. The soldiers serving there are characterized by language skills and cultural knowledge. 202 Company is a specialized hybrid subunit producing high-quality video, audio and graphic materials. Interestingly, it is said bluntly that „drawing on a wide range of creative skills from regular soldiers, reservists and specialist reserve soldiers, it is a creative agency in uniform.”    

Another important element is the 6 Military Intelligence Battalion—also a hybrid unit supporting the 77th Brigade but also the Army Special Operations Brigade and the 6th (UK) Division. Its presence is intended to provide the intelligence support necessary for planning and conducting unconventional and information operations. In this case audience analysis is performed in the information domain, as well as analysis of systems and the entire information environment. Importantly, they have a cell for conducting OSINT (open-source intelligence).  

In conclusion, we must remember that having well-developed PSYOPS/PSYWAR resources today is undoubtedly an element that cannot be omitted when constructing armed forces, primarily because of the new operational environment. This is happening in an increasing number of NATO countries, although it must be honestly stated that not all of them are well prepared for the new requirements of the information domain, and, narrowing the focus to PSYOPS/PSYWAR/information activities themselves, military potential within NATO states often revolves around tactical problems rather than higher-level considerations. That said, soldiers (and civilian experts as well, their importance in the information domain is huge) are compelled to respond simultaneously in the cognitive, virtual and real dimensions. At the same time, the complexity of the information domain must be increasingly recognised, where achieving interoperability between PSYOPS, CIMIC, cyber, intelligence and counterintelligence, and even special operations forces, is essential. It should be remembered that PSYOPS are to a large extent offensive rather than defensive, and thus can produce effective influence on an adversary at relatively low cost.

Erika Kirk has one word for Candace Owens, who has been peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband, Charlie Kirk: ""Stop.""

In a town hall, CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss asked Charlie Kirk's widow what she wants to say to Owens and others who are making unfounded claims about his assassination:

""Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.""

Owens used to work for Turning Point USA, the conservative youth organization founded by Charlie Kirk. The two were generally considered friends, with Owens describing their relationship as akin to that of a ""brother and sister."" 

A day after his assassination in September, she posted a nearly 25-minute video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. But in the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

The Treasury Department sent Erika Kirk a letter last week, confirming that none of the tax-exempt entities she oversees are under investigation by the IRS. ""The IRS is able to provide this type of information upon request by the taxpayer. And in this case, it's hideous that malicious lies and smears obligated [Erika Kirk] to make the request,"" a senior Treasury official told CBS News.

Erika Kirk talked more about her husband, her journey through faith and grief, and the state of the American right in the CBS News town hall. It aired just days after Charlie Kirk's book, ""Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,"" was posthumously released.

An extended version of the conversation airs on CBS News 24/7 on Sunday at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET, and will be available on CBS News' YouTube channel.

The genetic link between squids and octopuses may just be found in the vampire squid genome.

Cephalopod evolution has long had a missing chapter in its story: how did squid-like ancestors give rise to today's octopuses? The answer, it turns out, was floating in the deep sea all along.

With its glowing ghostly eyes, eight arms like its octopus cousins and a dark ruby coloring to match, the elusive vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis infernalis) has finally revealed its genetic secrets.

In a study published Nov. 27 in the journal iScience, researchers sequenced the genome of Vampyrotheuthis and discovered its chromosomes still resemble those of squids and cuttlefish — despite belonging to the octopus order. This discovery hints at what the common ancestor of modern squids and octopuses may have looked like at the genetic level 300 million years ago when octopus and squid evolutionarily diverged. The researchers described the vampire squid as a ""living fossil.""

On the cephalopod evolutionary tree, the vampire squid belongs to the group that includes octopuses, but underwent a ""very ancient split"" from the rest of the clade, study lead author Oleg Simakov, a researcher at the Department of Neuroscience and Developmental Biology in the University of Vienna, Austria, told Live Science in an email.

After acquiring a tissue sample from a vampire squid collected as bycatch in the West Pacific Ocean from a research cruise, the researchers used a genetic analysis platform called PacBio to sequence the DNA of the sample. Unfortunately, there were no other vampire squid samples to compare it to, due to their rarity. Using PacBio, the researchers compared the vampire squid's genome to that of other cephalopods like the Argonaut (Argonauta hians), the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) and the curled octopus (Eledone cirrhosa).

The findings revealed the vampire squid has an 11 billion-base-pair-long genome, almost four times the size of the human genome — and the largest cephalopod genome sequenced to date.

While modern octopuses have DNA that consistently gets reshuffled, resulting in some chromosomal mixing, the researchers found that the vampire squid's genome kept much of its ancestral, squid-like chromosomal arrangement. Essentially, it's an octopod that genetically looks like an ancient squid.

The vampire squid has had a long history of being misunderstood. When it was initially discovered in 1903, it was thought to be a cirrate octopus due to its unique webbing between its arms. In the 1950s however, scientists reclassified it as its own group, belonging to neither octopus nor squid but in the order Vampyromorphida, so named because it looks like it's wearing a vampire-like cloak.

—Ancient 10-armed vampire squid relative named for Joe Biden

—Vampire squid fossil 'lost' during the Hungarian Revolution rediscovered

The finding is welcome news for cephalopod scientists as it is ""nice to have resolved"" why vampire squids retain much of their ancestral, squid-like traits, said Bruce Robison, senior scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) who was not involved in the research.

Part of what makes the fully sequenced genome so valuable is how hard it is to study vampire squids, mainly ""because they live in a habitat that is difficult to access, they are solitary, rare, and do not survive well in captivity,"" Robison said. ""Some people think that we can just dive into deep water, and find one whenever we like, which is definitely not the case.""

He added that the findings ""reinforce the notion held by some of us that vamps would be the key to the puzzle. They are interesting to study because they are such cool animals, and because they just look like they are hiding secrets.""

Astronomers used major telescopes across the world to probe a cosmic explosion 8 billion light-years from the solar system.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


What it is: Gamma-ray burst GRB 250702B

Where it is: 8 billion light-years away, in the constellation Scutum

When it was shared: Dec. 8, 2025

A gamma-ray burst (GRB) — the most energetic type of explosion in the universe since the Big Bang — is detected once every day, on average. But what happened on July 2, 2025, was highly unusual: NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which has been orbiting Earth since 2008, recorded an unusually long-lived GRB that continued emitting in bursts for more than seven hours.

Astronomers leaped into action, using the world's telescopes to detect the explosion's afterglow and discover where it came from.

The event, called GRB 250702B, was the longest-duration gamma-ray burst ever recorded. Astronomers now think it came from a previously unobserved or rare type of explosion that launched a narrow jet of material in the direction of the solar system, traveling at least 99% the speed of light.

GRB 250702B was not easy to figure out. Researchers used all kinds of telescopes to track its origin in all wavelengths of light, including the twin 8.1-meter Gemini telescopes in Chile and Hawaii, the Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and the Hubble Space Telescope.

GRBs come from the depths of the universe; even the closest one originated more than 100 million light-years away, according to NASA. GRB 250702B came from a massive galaxy 8 billion light-years distant that, critically, is so dusty that it blocked all visible light.

The only light detected by telescopes was infrared and high-energy X-ray wavelengths. Due to thick dust in its host galaxy, the GRB was almost invisible in ordinary visible light, the researchers reported in a study published Nov. 26 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

 




""This was the longest gamma-ray burst that humans have observed — long enough that it does not fit into any of our existing models for what causes gamma-ray bursts,"" Jonathan Carney, lead author of the study and doctoral student in physics and astronomy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said in a statement.

Analysis shows that GRB 250702B may have been caused by the death of a massive star, a star being ripped apart by a black hole, or the merger of a helium star and a black hole, where the black hole spirals into the core of the massive star, triggering an explosion from within.

""But we can't yet tell which explanation is correct,"" Carney said. ""In the future, this event will serve as a unique benchmark — when astronomers discover similar explosions, they'll ask whether they match GRB 250702B's properties or represent something different entirely.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:reddit.com/r/UFOs","Unidentified moving lights observed during Geminids","https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1pmjnbb/unidentified_moving_lights_observed_during/","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 17:27:17 GMT","


      Hi everyone, I'd like to share an observation we had last night and see if anyone can help identify what we saw.
    


      We went out to take photos of the Geminid meteor shower and spent a long time observing the sky. During that time, we noticed three moving objects that we were unable to identify.
    


      We ruled out satellites, since their movement was not orbital or constant. The objects moved irregularly, and at times they would stop and remain stationary for one or two seconds before continuing. We also ruled out airplanes, as there were no navigation lights and no recognizable flight pattern. They were clearly not stars either, since they were moving.
    


      What made the observation particularly strange was that the three objects repeatedly followed the same looping pattern and then disappeared. We were able to orient ourselves well using two bright reference stars in the same area of the sky.
    


      One object would suddenly appear above the star on the right, seemingly out of nowhere, then move irregularly toward the left star and disappear. At the same time, two other objects would appear below both stars, move toward the left star, and disappear at exactly the same point. We never saw them return to the starting position; instead, they would reappear and repeat the exact same trajectory (with slight irregular movement) over and over again.
    


      Time: December 14, 2025, 1:30–2:30 AM (local time)
    


      Location: Perugorría, Corrientes Province, northeastern Argentina
    


      I'm not drawing any conclusions, i'm simply trying to understand what these objects could have been. I'm attaching one of the photos we took, where the three objects and the reference stars can be seen. The camera was pointing south, slightly above the horizon. The straight lines in the image are due to long exposure, but visually the movements were irregular.
    


      Any insight or possible explanations would be greatly appreciated.

Two students were killed and nine others were seriously wounded during a mass shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon.

Police continued searching the streets of Providence for a gunman “all dressed in black” late into the night as they locked down parts of the Ivy League university and ordered residents to shelter in place.

The shooter was last seen fleeing the campus after firing at students who were preparing for exams in the Barus & Holley building, a seven-storey complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department, just after 4pm local time (9pm GMT).

Footage of the suspect, captured by a camera outside the building, showed a stocky man dressed in a black coat, black trousers and a black hat.

He appears to have a slight limp, and is seen swinging his right arm by his side and placing his hand in his pocket as he strolls down Hope and Waterman streets.

Although multiple witnesses reported seeing a man wearing a grey camouflage mask, a face covering cannot be seen in the video and his face is not visible.

Colonel Oscar L Perez Jnr, the chief of Providence Police, said the possibility that the shooting was targeted is under consideration.

A student who had spoken to a teaching assistant who was present during the incident told the local TV station WPRI that the gunman entered the ground floor classroom – where an exam review session was taking place – and yelled something before opening fire.

Christina H. Paxson, the university president, called it “a deeply tragic day” as she confirmed two students had died.

“There are truly no words that can express the deep sorrow we are feeling for the victims of the shooting,” Ms Paxson said earlier in the night.

“We lost two community members today who were fatal victims of the shooting, and at this point, we know there are at least eight additional victims who were transported to the hospital... our hearts are with their families.”

The ongoing manhunt remained “a source of tremendous fear and anxiety across our community right now”, she said, adding “this is a day that we hoped never would come to our community”.

Theatres, restaurants and hotels across Providence were locked down. At least 400 police were on city streets and had cars stationed outside a number of venues to “ensure safety”, said Brett Smiley, the mayor.

“We have no reason to believe that there are any additional threats at this time,” Mr Smiley added.

Tim O'Hara, the police deputy chief, said the suspect was “male, all dressed in black” and “could be in his 30s”.

No weapon was found at the scene and police were unable to say what kind of firearm was used.

Donald Trump issued a prayer for the victims and confirmed the FBI was assisting the investigation.

“I've been fully briefed on the Brown University situation,” the US president told reporters as he arrived at the White House.

“What a terrible thing it is, and all we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt.”

JD Vance, the vice president, condemned the shooting in a statement on X and said he was “thinking of and praying for the victims tonight”.

Mike Johnson, the US House Speaker, said he was “praying for the safety of students and law enforcement at Brown University as we await more information”.

“May God protect everyone affected and bring comfort to their families and loved ones,” he added in a statement on X.

Dan McKee, the governor of Rhode Island, said: “Our capital city experienced an unthinkable tragedy today. Our hearts are with the people of Providence and all those impacted.”

“A shelter in place remains in effect for the greater Brown University area,” Mr McKee said.

“We're making every resource available as an active investigation continues.”

The shooting took place in a classroom where fourth-year students were preparing for a final exam, WPRI reported.

Chiang-Heng Chien, an engineering PhD student at Brown, said he and his peers hid under their desks in the dark after hearing shots had been fired.

“We decided to turn the lights off and close all the doors and hide under our desks,” he told local television station WJAR.

Another student told The Brown Daily Herald that she was studying in the Engineering Research Centre when she heard gunshots at around 4.10pm (9.10pm GMT) and evacuated the building, leaving her belongings behind.

“It was honestly quite terrifying,” she told the student newspaper.

Footage of the windows of one campus building seen by CNN seemed to show students hunkering down together, some making phone calls while watching as armed officers and ambulances arrived on the scene.

Rodney Chapman, the chief of Brown University's police, said first responders had arrived within “minutes” after the first 911 call.

Mr Chapman said the police received “no warning” or indication in advance that a shooting would take place.

Derek Silva, the Providence Fire Department chief, initially confirmed 10 people were shot.

Two people died at the scene, and eight were transported to hospital in critical but stable condition.

It was later revealed that a ninth person had been injured during the shooting. They sustained non-life-threatening wounds caused by bullet fragments and were expected to make a full recovery.

At least one of the seriously injured victims was still fighting for their life late on Saturday night.

The FBI remained on the scene and will “provide all capabilities necessary”, Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, wrote on X.

“Please pray for all those involved. We will update with more information as we are able,” Mr Patel added.

In his initial statement on the shooting, Mr Trump claimed the suspect had been apprehended before walking back those comments.

“I have been briefed on the shooting that took place at Brown University in Rhode Island,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The suspect is in custody. God bless the victims and the families of the victims!”

He then corrected himself 20 minutes later, writing: “The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement – The suspect is NOT in custody.”

The confusion appeared to stem from an announcement by the university that initially claimed the suspect had been apprehended before later saying that police were still searching for a suspect or suspects, according to alerts issued through Brown's emergency notification system.

Mr Smiley said the initial alert of an arrest was caused by the detention of a preliminary suspect who was later determined not to be involved.

The first reports of the incident emerged at 4.22pm local time (9:22pm GMT) when the university sent out an urgent alert urging people to “lock doors, silence phones and stay hidden until further notice”.

It added that people should run, evacuate safely if they could, hide, or as a last resort “fight” if necessary.

The attack took place on the second day of final exams, with the university confirming that multiple assessments were scheduled to take place in the Barus & Holley building between 2-5pm local time (7pm-9pm GMT).

The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university's website.

Brown University is ranked 13th in the world. Prominent alumni include John F Kennedy Jr, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, and the actor Emma Watson.

There are currently 11,005 students enrolled at the university, many of whom were on campus studying at the time of the shooting.

Ms Paxson urged staff and students to remain “vigilant” by keeping “doors locked and ensuring no movement across campus”.

“Whether or not you spend any time in Barus & Holley, I ask all students, faculty and staff to please be in touch directly with your families to let them know you are safe,” Ms Paxson added.

“They are worried about you.”

The era of ‘Pax Americana' is over for Europe, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said, adding that the global economy and political order are undergoing a “tectonic shift” in centers of power worldwide.

The term ‘Pax Americana' (American Peace) describes the transatlantic order that emerged after 1945 and was institutionalized through NATO, with the US as Europe's primary security guarantor and leading military power.

Speaking at the Christian Social Union (CSU) party convention in Munich on Saturday, Merz urged Europeans to prepare for a “fundamental change in the transatlantic relationship.”

“The decades of the Pax Americana are largely over for us in Europe and for us in Germany as well. It no longer exists in the way we knew it,” he said. “Americans are now very, very firmly pursuing their own interests.”

The chancellor pointed to changes in tariff policy under US President Donald Trump, which led to a trade deal between Brussels and Washington that many criticized as disadvantageous for the EU.

Merz said shifting US priorities mean the EU must focus more on its own competitiveness and defense. He reiterated claims of the “Russian threat,” arguing that continued support for Ukraine and deeper European unity – which includes former EU member the UK – should remain central to foreign and security policy.

Relations between the US and EU have been strained since Trump's return to office, with disputes over trade, defense spending, digital regulation, and the Ukraine conflict.

Merz's remarks followed the release of Trump's new National Security Strategy, which criticizes the EU's political and cultural direction, embraces an ‘America First' doctrine, calls for an end to NATO expansion, and urges “strategic stability” with Russia through a Ukraine ceasefire. The response in the EU was largely negative, with Merz calling the document's statements on Europe “unacceptable.”

Russia has long dismissed claims that it is a threat to the EU as “nonsense” used to distract Europeans from domestic problems and justify inflated military budgets. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has warned that Germany under Merz is showing “clear signs of re-Nazification.”

With cheap drinks and friendly locals, Jimmy's Corner is a New York institution. But a real-estate developer has ordered its closure – can it survive?

Founded by Jimmy Glenn, a former boxer turned trainer, in 1971, Jimmy's Corner has stood, defiantly unchanged, as Times Square has boomed around it.

The neighborhood bar, a New York City institution which attracts locals and tourists alike, has had the same pictures on the walls for decades – some of the bar's regulars have been coming almost as long – kept the same furniture, and maintained remarkably low pricing. In a perhaps unintentional nod to its history, there is also several years' accumulation of dust in some areas.

It's a beloved spot, a piece of New York history that has endured as Times Square transformed from a den of inequity into one of New York's main tourist attractions. But Jimmy's Corner may now have met its match, after the building's landlord ordered its owner to shut down this famous watering hole.

“It felt like losing my parents again,” Adam Glenn, Jimmy Glenn's son, who took over the bar in 2015, told the Guardian.

After being told he was being evicted, Glenn filed a last-ditch lawsuit against the Durst Organization, the giant New York developer which owns the building, alleging Durst took advantage of his father when re-negotiating the bar's lease 10 years ago.

It has left people who drink in the bar on tenterhooks. Jimmy, who also worked as a boxing cutman, ran a gym, and was friendly with Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, died in 2020, aged 89, but Glenn has kept the bar has continued unchanged, even down to the prices: a pint of beer is $3, in a neighborhood where some places charge four times that.

In an area of Manhattan full of bars, most of which are bigger, brighter, and have more modern toilets than Jimmy's, its close-knit atmosphere is just as important to its appeal.

“It's a true dive bar in midtown. It's nice and small and tight. And when you meet people, you have to talk to them. You can't, like, wander off,” said Walter Trice, a Jimmy's regular who was drinking a beer in a small area at the back of the bar on Thursday evening.

“There's no frills here. They don't talk about politics. It's all straightforward. And there's no wifi here, so your phone basically doesn't work. Basically, you have to talk to each other.”

Karolina Collado, 31, was drinking what she described as “the coldest Corona in all of New York City” – something she attributes to the bar's well-functioning fridges. She drinks in the bar most weeks, including to “pre-game” before playing softball.

“I like the bartenders here. They make you feel great, we have genuine conversations. And I've met a lot of people here who are awesome. They all have different personalities, and we all vibe out. It's a nice experience,” she said.

Glenn said his father would be “incredibly hurt” by the potential closure. It's painful for him, too, given Jimmy's is also where Glenn spent key passages of his childhood.

“I've been working in this bar since I was old enough to push or move something. I remember being three years old, and it would take me 20 minutes to load a bucket of ice, but I would stand on the chair and load a bucket of ice and push it to the front,” he said.

“I have so many of my memories here. That's where we had our family time. We celebrated birthdays. We did Thanksgiving here, Christmas, New Year's [Eve]. Most of the major family events were happening at the bar: one, because we loved it there, and two, because we couldn't afford to take a break. We needed to work.”

When Jimmy Glenn opened the bar in 1971, Times Square was very different from the light-strewn, tourist-stricken place it is today. Back then, the area was known as a hub for prostitution, peep shows and general vice, and Jimmy Glenn and his bar served as a safe haven. Glenn said most nights his father would stand outside the bar, keeping an eye on the street.

“For a lot of our neighbors, and people who were young in the 70s and 80s and were in that neighborhood, a lot of them would say, ‘I didn't feel safe coming home late at night if Jimmy wasn't there,'” Glenn said.

“We've been guardians of this block. We have kept people safe.”

Glenn said his father was close to the Dursts for decades, but he believes he was “tricked” into agreeing to a lease provision where the Durst could evict Jimmy's Corner when he died.

“I think my dad would be incredibly hurt and disappointed, because he would have expected better from them,” Glenn said, adding that his father saw the Dursts as “part of the family”.

“But I also think my dad would be very proud of me, because my parents didn't raise me to be the kind of person who lays down just because someone is bigger than you, just because they have more money than you.”

A spokeswoman for Durst said: “For decades, we did everything we could to help keep the bar's doors open, including providing extremely favorable rent. After Jimmy's tragic death, we decided to sell the building, and we went above and beyond our lease obligations due to the personal relationship with Jimmy.”

The spokeswoman said Durst told Glenn over a year ago he would have to vacate the building, and offered him $250,000 to do so – Glenn disputes this, and says he was initially offered no money to leave.

For the Jimmy's Corner patrons, it is unclear what will happen next. Glenn said he always knew the bar couldn't last for ever, given the soaring value of property in Times Square. If he is forced to close, he plans to open a bar somewhere else, keeping true to Jimmy's Corner authenticity and, regulars hope, pricing structure.

Even so, the loss of this last vestige of an older New York would be painful for anyone who has eagerly squeezed their way into Jimmy's for a cheap drink and a vivid experience.

“I gotta to be honest, I'm going to be heartbroken,” said Nelson Martinez, 46. “I've been coming here for years, and for me this is a landmark. It's very historic.”

“One thing I love about this place compared to a lot of other bars is that it's a very friendly environment. As long as I've been coming here, no matter how much people drink, people socialize, you know. People come from all over the world.

“You have your regulars, and you have your tourists. But no matter who comes in this bar, this bar brings out the best in people.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            Vinyl records are popular again, but it's not just audiophiles or nostalgic boomers fueling the resurgence.
    


            Gen Z is playing an outsized role in the revival of vinyl sales, which have grown on average by 18% annually in the past five years. About 60% of Gen Z say they buy records, according to Futuresource Consulting's Audio Tech Lifestyles report.
    


            But Gen Z isn't necessarily buying records for their unique sound. Around 40% of record buyers in the United States don't own a turntable, noted James Duvall, principal analyst and head of entertainment at Futuresource Consulting.
    


            Fifty-six percent of Gen Z fans like vinyl for its aesthetic, while 37% use it as home decor, according to a Vinyl Alliance survey. It's part of what Jared Watson, an assistant professor of marketing at New York University, calls “symbolic consumption.”
    


            “It could show that you're a bigger fan or that you appreciate the artist more,” he noted, adding that albums are “affordable art.”
    


            The vinyl resurgence can largely be traced back to Taylor Swift, who has promoted her albums as artsy collectibles, sometimes including additional songs, posters or poems for her dedicated fanbase.
    


            And her variants are each “a different piece of the story” she curates, which has “raised the bar for everyone,” like singers Lana Del Rey and Olivia Rodrigo, said Jeffrey Smith, vice president of marketing at Discogs.com, a database and marketplace for physical music.
    


            Five of Swift's albums were among the top 10 most sold vinyl albums last year in the US, according to entertainment insight group Luminate's 2024 report.
    


            That included “The Tortured Poets Department,” which sold 1.48 million copies, according to Luminate, and “Midnights,” which sold 188,000 copies. Swift currently sells four variants of “Midnights” on her US website. When the backs of the four are put together, they arrange to form a clock face.
    


            Erin Davila, a 28-year-old from Orlando, Florida, said she may buy one Swift variant but ultimately prefers records with the traditional album cover.
    


            Davila began collecting records in high school, when collecting was popular on social media blogging site Tumblr.
    


            “The physical record was almost like a trophy of all of the music that you love, just sitting on your shelf,” she said.
    


            Davila has set alarms for Swift, Sabrina Carpenter and Kacey Musgraves' vinyl releases, while her husband, Peyton, set an alarm for The Weeknd's vinyl release. Their combined collection totals almost 1,000 records.
    


            The Davilas are among the young adults who post on social media to share their vinyl collection and the rotation of records that hang on their wall.
    


            Dexter Phuong, a 25-year-old content creator and social media coordinator in North Carolina, similarly uses vinyl as wall decoration, swapping albums based on the season. During the fall, he may put up Swift's “Red” or a Phoebe Bridgers variant that suits the season's orange and green aesthetic.
    


            Phuong says he has nearly every Lana Del Rey vinyl, including an estimated 10 variants of her latest album.
    


            “I actually don't listen to the variants much unless they have a bonus song on them,” he told CNN. “I'll typically save those as art.”
    


            Zoomers enjoy little indulgences — whether that's an expensive latte, clothing or a concert ticket, said NYU's Watson. It's largely because major milestones — like buying a house or getting married — have been delayed, so young adults look for gratification elsewhere, he said.
    


            “There's this idea to say, ‘Why can't we treat ourselves today with smaller awards?' That's where we see a rise in the collectibles market,” he said.
    


            Some are spending more time comparing prices from various sellers or increasingly shopping at local record stores in search of the best deal. A local record store could save them from the retail price of a vinyl record, which averages $33, but could be as high as $70 for limited edition releases.
    


            That includes Tony Baker, a 27-year-old in Orlando, who said he will buy any record for the right price and “figure out the rest later.” He purchased Toni Braxton's self-titled album for $100, which is the most he's willing to pay right now.
    


            Baker recently posted a vinyl haul on TikTok featuring more than 20 albums, with prices as high as $42.
    


            According to Smith of Discogs, a nearly perfect-condition record sells on the site for around $15 on average, or 45% below the retail price.
    


            “Going in and buying a record and digging into the marketplace, finding something that's upwards of 70% off, could be a huge win,” Smith said.
    


            Whether they play the record or not, Watson said Gen Z tends to find sentimental value in thrifting records that have an “essence” of being owned previously and the environmental benefit of avoiding overconsumption.
    


            Peyton Davila, the Orlando vinyl collector, compared buying records at local stores for as low as $5 to thrifting for clothes.
    


            “You're just being more sustainable and not contributing to all the excess that we have of these albums that are over-pressed,” he said.

A new House Oversight Committee report takes aim at Washington D.C.‘s Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith, accusing Smith of manipulating the district's crime data.

The Oversight Committee released the interim investigation report on Sunday, just days after Smith announced her resignation, effective Dec. 31. The committee interviewed eight MPD commanders, seven current and one suspended, and found that their testimonies substantiated allegations of manipulated crime statistics and uncovered a “toxic management culture,” according to the report.

“While the Committee continues to investigate documents related to crime statistics reporting, testimony exhibited in this report paints a troubling picture of department leadership placing a higher priority on suppressing public reporting of crime statistics than stopping crime itself,” the report reads.

The report describes an alleged “culture of fear, intimidation, threats, and retaliation by Chief Smith” that was often brought out when Smith heard of a rise in crime statistics. The committee also said the testimonies reported a “drop” in the department's reputation and retention and recruitment difficulties under her leadership.

A recent MPD publication of year-to-date crime statistics for the end of 2025 showed a drop in crime in nearly all areas, including a 28% reduction in all violent crime between 2024 and 2025. In August, President Donald Trump federalized the MPD and mobilized the National Guard in the district in the name of public safety.

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser attributed this reduction in crime to the MPD officers and Smith's leadership in a statement shared with the Washington Examiner on Sunday when asked for comment on the oversight report.

“The men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department run towards danger every day to reduce homicides, carjackings, armed robberies, sexual assaults, and more. The precipitous decline in crime in our city is attributable to their hard work and dedication and Chief Smith's leadership,” Bowser said in the statement.

The Oversight report concluded and warned that crime statistics are still “at risk” of being manipulated following Smith's resignation announcement on Monday. It also recommended that Bowser appoint an MPD chief “who will address the ongoing concerns of crime statistics manipulations and alleviate the retaliatory pressures and threats faced by MPD personnel.”

Bowser, who is not running for a fourth term as mayor, thanked Smith for her efforts as chief in her Sunday statement to the Washington Examiner. Bowser initially nominated Smith, the first black woman to serve as MPD chief, to her role in July 2023.

“I thank Chief Smith for her commitment to the safety of DC residents and for holding the Metropolitan Police Department to an exacting standard, and I expect no less from our next Chief of Police,” Bowser said.

But House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said Smith's resignation should have occurred much earlier.

BOWSER AND NTSB CHAIRWOMAN RIP ‘SHAMEFUL' DC AIRSPACE PROVISION IN NDAA FOLLOWING POTOMAC CRASH

“Testimony from experienced and courageous MPD commanders has exposed the truth: Chief Pamela Smith coerced staff to report artificially low crime data and cultivated a culture of fear to achieve her agenda. Chief Smith's decision to mislead the public by manipulating crime statistics is dangerous and undermines trust in both local leadership and law enforcement.” Comer said in a statement.

Yesterday's attack at Brown University is just the latest example.

Updated at 1:20 p.m. ET on December 14, 2025

Nothing encapsulates the failures of our society more than what just happened to Mia Tretta. When she was 15, she was shot in the stomach by a classmate at her high school in California. Yesterday, she survived the second school shooting of her short life: A person opened fire at Brown University, where Tretta is a junior.

Students were studying for finals when a shooter walked into an economics classroom and started firing, killing two students, injuring nine, and inflicting terror on not just a campus but an entire city. No suspect has been named yet, but authorities have detained a “person of interest.”

I left Brooklyn to attend Brown in 1995, when New York City had yet to shake its rough-and-tumble reputation. Of all the amenities that the Ivy League campus provided—bountiful libraries, a full-service gym—the most luxurious to me was a sense of safety. I'd walk around campus at all hours of the night; just the other day, my freshman roommate and I reminisced about keeping our dorm room unlocked so our friends could come and go. Despite how much has changed in the decades since I was there, it was that sense of security that had, after what she'd endured in high school, appealed to Tretta.

I'm a trustee at Brown now. Many of my friends have children there, and I know and care for countless staff members and administrators. When yet another tragedy like this takes place in America, everyone grieves. But it feels different when it happens so close to home. When you hear that your friend's daughter is hiding in a bathroom in the Sciences Library, you can picture the tiny floor tiles she's staring at. You can conjure the smell of the heat in the dorm where a student you recently had coffee with is sheltering in place. And you're able to picture the streets where the shooter is rumored to have been running at large.

Juliette Kayyem: Why the Brown shooting felt different

I have always believed that the mass shootings that define our nation are preventable. But more and more, I have to wonder if that is not a bit of dated, magical thinking. In Donald Trump's America, the idea of politicians passing “common sense” gun legislation feels as removed and naive as hanging up a HOPE poster. It's possible that the dual ills of creating the violent, misanthropic young men who tend to be the culprits and protecting the guns they arm themselves with are both too endemic to our culture to change.

I was a senior at Brown, sitting in a coffee shop a stone's throw from where yesterday's attack occurred, when I read about two boys in Colorado who'd donned black trench coats, walked into their high school, and opened fire with pump-action shotguns. At the time, it was a shocking story. It inspired a documentary, a film, and songs. If each school shooting that's happened since had inspired such creative output, we could populate an entire streaming service.

Every mass shooting in America fills me with sorrow, but this particular incident has been coupled with a dose of nihilism. Across the nation this week, students will be opening emails announcing their early-decision college acceptances. For many of America's children, it's the culmination of the zero-sum game of elite college admissions. They have been trained from their earliest years to pass exams and write essays so that they may one day be lucky enough to study for their finals in an Ivy League classroom where, randomly, at any moment, a shooter might open fire.

Over the past day, I've found myself ruminating on Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan. In Hobbes's estimation, the natural state of things was chaos: competition, violence, greed, war, self-interest, and economic insecurity. Government was the only solution to provide order and create a functioning society. Even tyranny, according to Hobbes, was better than all of that. Today, we seem to have saddled ourselves with tyranny while being mired in more chaos than ever.

No matter how great our collective amnesia, these mass shootings add up. Tretta is not even the only student at Brown who had already been involved in one. Zoe Weissmann, now 20, was only 12 when gunshots were fired at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida. She was in a classroom in the middle school across campus. Yesterday she told The New York Times, “What I've been feeling most is just, like, how dare this country allow this to happen to someone like me twice?”

12/14 update below. This post was originally published on December 12

Bitcoin and crypto prices have struggled since peaking in early October, with traders fearful the market could be about to take a $1 trillion hit.

The bitcoin price has dropped to around $90,000 per bitcoin, falling from its all-time high of $126,000 in October, even as U.S. president Donald Trump primes the market for an “immidiate” game-changer.

Now, as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issues a “huge” crypto prediction, Michael Saylor has warned of “chaos, confusion,"" and ""profoundly harmful consequences"" if his bitcoin-buying company Strategy is ejected from MSCI indices.

12/14 update: Strategy has retained its place in the Nasdaq 100 one year after being inducted into the tech-heavy exchange's benchmark index.

“The bitcoin hoarding will continue until the complaining stops,” Strategy founder Michael Saylor posted to X, sharing a Reuters report on Nasdaq's latest reshuffle.

Last year, Strategy's inclusion on the Nasdaq 100, which is the basis for the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund, was predicted to result in about $2.1 billion in net buying of the company's shares as portfolios adjust to the move, according to Bernstein analysts.

The company rode the bitcoin price boom into 2024 but has struggled as the bull market has lost momentum in recent months.

The Nasdaq decision is a relief for Strategy share holders following the company's 60% stock price plummet from its all-time highs over the last six months. 

Nasdaq's decision, which could have torpedoed the company's valuation if it had gone the other way, was cheered by bitcoin supporters. 

“Those who don't own bitcoin will become increasingly irrelevant,” author and bitcoin influencer Adam Livingston posted to X. “They can fight all they want. Victory is inevitable.”

Livingston added that the tone of the debate around Strategy and its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 and MSCI indices suggests, “people want Strategy to fail.”

“Have you ever actually seen a group of people consistently advocate for the collapse or liquidation of a company the way they do against Strategy,” he asked.

However, a bitcoin price slump has followed the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates this week, raising fears of a full-blown bitcoin price crash could be looming.

“Fear and greed indices have moved into extreme fear. All of this supports deeper corrective action,” Markus Levin, co-founder of the blockchain company XYO, told DLNews.

Saylor has written to MSCI, asking it to drop a proposal that would bar companies whose crypto holdings exceed 50% of their total assets from its global equity benchmarks.

In the 12-page letter, Saylor and Strategy's chief executive Phong Le warned of ""profoundly harmful consequences"" if MSCI adopts the proposal, with a decision expected by January 15.

""MSCI can either succumb to the reactive short-sightedness that established institutions sometimes display toward innovation, or it can allow its indices to reflect, neutrally and faithfully, the next era of financial technology,"" the pair wrote. “The wiser course—for MSCI, for investors, and for the broader economy—is for MSCI to remain neutral and let the markets decide the course of [digital asset treasury companies].”

If MSCI does adopt the proposal, it could lead to outflows of as much as $8.8 billion from Strategy's stock if other index providers follow suit, according to a JPMorgan estimate.

Saylor's remarks were echoed by Adam Back, the chief executive of bitcoin development company Blockstream who was cited in the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper, telling Yahoo Finance that we are still in the “very early stages” of bitcoin adoption and that all companies will eventually become bitcoin treasury companies.

Meanwhile, Standard Chartered has slashed its end of 2025 bitcoin price prediction, halving it from $200,000 to $100,000.

“We think buying by bitcoin digital asset treasury companies is likely over,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an emailed note, adding bitcoin treasury company ""buying is unlikely to provide further support.""

Bitcoin and crypto treasury companies have hoovered up around 1 million bitcoin worth almost $100 billion this year, rivaling the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that now hold 1.5 million bitcoin worth $1.4 billion.

While bitcoin treasury companies have slowed their buying, analysts expect ETF purchases to continue buying bitcoin into 2026.

“We now think future bitcoin price increases will effectively be driven by one leg only–ETF buying,” Kendrick said.

Others have also pointed to improving bitcoin ETF inflows as a potential catalyst for a coming bitcoin price surge.

“For prices to break higher, the bullish momentum from the rate cut needs to overpower the concentrated short pressure sitting near the $94,500 resistance level,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21shares, said in emailed comments.

“If spot ETF inflows strengthen as expected now that the cost of capital is falling, that could become the spark that transforms caution into momentum and drives bitcoin back above the $100,000 psychological barrier.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Which Cryptocurrency Has More Upside? Bitcoin vs. Cardano","https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/14/which-cryptocurrency-has-more-upside-bitcoin-vs-ca/","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 18:11:00 GMT","

This match-up has a clear winner, but that doesn't mean you should bet the farm on it.

If you ask investors which they would rather own -- a hulking blue chip asset, or a smaller and unproven upstart -- many will prefer the latter option without thinking. After all, it's easy to fall in love with the idea of grabbing a multibagger, and it's also easy to forget how many lottery tickets inevitably expire worthless.

But is that the right lens to analyze whether it's Bitcoin (BTC 1.40%) or Cardano (ADA 2.76%) that has more upside in store for those who buy it right now? Let's investigate which of these assets is better positioned to grow and find out.

Image source: Getty Images.

At this point, Bitcoin is the monetary heavyweight of crypto, and it's also a major financial asset with widespread acceptance in the traditional financial sector.

It represents more than half of total crypto market value, and it has a market cap of $1.8 trillion. Its tokenomics are brutally simple, with its supply capped at 21 million coins, and its new issuance coded to cut roughly in half every four years through the halving. Roughly 95% of that fixed cap has already been mined, so new supply is now only trickling in at the pace of molasses left outside in January (which is really slow).

The possible sources of demand for the coin have exploded since the arrival of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. The approval of the ETFs, long hailed as a major mark of the cryptocurrency's maturity as an asset, have made buying and holding Bitcoin available to practically every investor. But in the context of evaluating the coin's upside, it's also worth mentioning that there isn't necessarily another similarly important catalyst anywhere on the horizon.

So, in that vein, what does ""upside"" really mean for something this large?

A 10X move from here would imply a market cap for Bitcoin eclipsing most categories of global wealth, and approaching that of gold. That isn't impossible if investors continue to believe that Bitcoin is a store of value that's so reliable as to be ""digital gold."" But for the record, during the ongoing inflation flap of the last 12 months, gold's price rose 53%, and Bitcoin's price was flat, so the narrative here does not really match the price action.

Still, if you assume that institutional adoption continues and that spot ETFs keep taking up coins, a world where Bitcoin is 3X to 5X higher a decade from now is entirely plausible, and in fact fairly probable.

Cardano is an entirely different animal than Bitcoin, as it's a smart contract blockchain. It's also a much smaller asset, with a market cap of $17 billion.

At that scale, identically sized inflows would struggle to make Bitcoin's price move even a little, but could move Cardano's price by a lot. That's the essence of the ""Cardano has more upside"" argument: It's simply far less established, which implies the possibility of a big gain if that eventually starts to change.

The thing that could catalyze precisely that change is Cardano's recent move to integrate the x402 internet payment standard. The x402 protocol is a way for websites to take payments from users and display pages or data to them in return. Developers are now wiring this standard into the chain, and it might be used for AI agents to pay each other as well.

If that vision pans out, Cardano could become one of the settlement layers for autonomous software, where every model query or content request has a tiny payment attached. In theory, that's a narrative large enough to justify many multiples of upside compared with today's valuation.

In practice, implementing the x402 protocol so that Cardano's holders benefit is quite complicated. Most sites don't want to change their business models, and they probably aren't aware of the possibilities for x402 anyway, at least for now. The protocol itself provisions for payment in many different kinds of stablecoins and crypto tokens, not just Cardano, so there will be plenty of competition for whatever opportunities end up actually existing.

Nonetheless, in this match-up with Bitcoin, Cardano undeniably has more upside for those who buy it now, even if the odds of it actually realizing that upside are on the low side in comparison to Bitcoin's odds of continuing to chug along and grind upwards over time. Bitcoin is by far the safer bet, but that's also a big part of the reason why it's less likely to grow dramatically.

Ops, si è verificato un problema

Ethereum price action looks quiet, but the entire formation is slowly turning bullish. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has traded almost flat, while the past seven days show a modest 2.6% gain. Price has remained above $3,100 for several sessions, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion.

This sideways move is not random. Ethereum is compressing near key levels, where breakouts often form. The next move depends on whether buyers, who are gradually returning, can turn this consolidation into a continuation.

Ethereum appears to be breaking out after consolidating inside a bull flag. A bull flag forms when the price pauses after a strong upward move, then trades in a narrow range before the next leg higher. This pattern signals consolidation, not weakness.

The structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $3,090. That means, unless there is a daily candle close below this level, the much-anticipated breakout might hold.

This level has acted as firm support, absorbing selling pressure during recent pullbacks. Price has repeatedly bounced from this zone, showing buyers are still defending it.

A clean daily close above $3,130 would be the first confirmation that the flag is resolving higher. That move would signal that consolidation is ending and buyers are regaining control. Without that close, Ethereum remains in compression, but the bullish structure stays valid.

On-chain data support the price structure. Holder Net Position Change, which tracks whether long-term investors are adding or selling ETH, shows that selling pressure has eased compared to earlier sessions.

On December 12, Ethereum holders distributed roughly 958,771 ETH. By December 13, net selling dropped to around 877,958 ETH, marking a decline of roughly 8.4% in selling pressure within 24 hours.

That shift matters. Ethereum is still seeing net distribution, but the pace of selling is slowing as the price compresses near resistance. This behavior typically appears during late-stage consolidation, not during breakdowns.

When selling pressure eases near a key level without price slipping lower, it increases the odds that buyers step in once a breakout confirms. Ethereum is not seeing panic exits. Instead, holders appear more willing to wait.

If the Ethereum price secures a daily close above $3,130, the next resistance sits near $3,390. Clearing that zone would open the path toward the $4,000–$4,020 area, aligning with the measured move from the bull flag structure.

However, the bullish structure would weaken if the Ethereum price drops under $3,090 or even $2,910. Closing below the latter would break the pattern completely.

Willemstad, Curaçao, December 14th, 2025, Chainwire



Whale.io has officially launched the $WHALE NFT collection on Solana, introducing the next phase of the platform's native token rollout and bringing the community one step closer to the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE).

The $WHALE NFTs – presented as fully tradable digital cards – represent a new value layer within the Whale ecosystem. Each card holds a fixed amount of $WHALE tokens locked on-chain and backed 1:1, making them redeemable at any time for the underlying tokens. Minting is now live exclusively at mintwhale.io, where users can acquire these asset-backed cards and begin trading immediately on secondary marketplaces such as Magic Eden.

This format transforms $WHALE into a hybrid asset: a collectible card that behaves like a traditional NFT while carrying real, instantly verifiable token value. Cards can be freely transferred, sold, or held, with the assurance that the locked $WHALE can always be unlocked and returned to the Whale.io platform when needed.

Key Benefits of the $WHALE NFT Model

Because every card is transparently backed by real $WHALE, value remains anchored and fully verifiable on-chain at all times.

Utility Already Live

$WHALE continues to serve as the native currency across Whale Originals titles, including Crock Dentist and Blackjack. Holders use it for gameplay, Battlepass purchases, staking rewards, and exclusive in-platform features – a utility that is available today and will expand significantly after TGE.

Next Steps on the Roadmap

Upcoming features include a Staking mechanism (locking liquid $WHALE into cards) and a dedicated Token Swapping interface for one-click redemption. Whale.io has also reaffirmed its commitment to regular market buybacks followed by permanent token burns to support long-term token health.

Participation Now Open

The $WHALE NFT collection is available for minting exclusively at mintwhale.io. Detailed card tiers, pricing, and redemption instructions are displayed on the site. All on-chain activity remains fully transparent through Whale.io's established Treasury wallets.

Community members are invited to follow @Whalegames_en on X for real-time mint updates, secondary market insights, and announcements on future roadmap milestones.

About Whale.io

Whale.io is an online casino and sportsbook platform, recognized for its proprietary Whale Originals games and innovative reward systems. With $WHALE at its core, the platform combines provably fair gaming with community-owned economics and transparent tokenomics.

For complete details on the $WHALE NFT collection, users can visit mintwhale.io or whale.io.

Welcome to a new moon epoch, y'all.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

When humans get involved in places they weren't invited, things start to change. The Moon is no different. 

A team of researchers at the University of Kansas believes that human involvement—including the more than 100 spacecraft interactions we have had with our natural satellite over the past 64 years—makes us one of the most dominant forces shaping the Moon. 

That's enough, they believe, to declare a new epoch on the Moon—the “Lunar Anthropocene.” 

The researchers published a paper detailing this proposal in the journal Nature Geoscience. In it, they highlight the fact that the Moon is not the unchanging environment barely impacted by humanity that we sometimes think it to be. Since the Soviet Union's  Luna 2 spacecraft first hit the surface in September of 1959, humans have played a key role in the evolution of our closest cosmic companion. 

“This idea is much the same as the discussion of the Anthropocene on Earth—the exploration of how much humans have impacted our planet,” Justin Holcomb, the study's lead author, said in a statement. “The consensus is on Earth the Anthropocene began at some point in the past, whether hundreds of thousands of years ago or in the 1950s. Similarly, on the Moon, we argue the Lunar Anthropocene already has commenced, but we want to prevent massive damage or a delay of its recognition until we can measure a significant lunar halo cause by human activities, which would be too late.” 

The team says that, with over 100 spacecraft touching the Moon—sometimes crash-landing, and sometimes bringing actual humans to the surface—there's been enough interaction to signify a geological epoch.

“In the context of the new space race, the lunar landscape will be entirely different in 50 years,” Holcomb said, noting how human involvement is already moving sediments and significantly disturbing the surface. “Multiple countries will be present, leading to numerous challenges.” 

Holcomb added that the outdoor community's mantra of “leave no trace” doesn't exist on the Moon. The list of items already brought to and left on the surface by humans is long, though the abandoned spacecraft are far and away the most impactful in terms of size. The study's authors claim that various aspects of the Moon—including the delicate exosphere composed of dust and gas, and any ice found in permanently shadowed areas—are susceptible to exhaust gas propagation. “Future missions,” they wrote, “must consider mitigating deleterious effects on lunar environments.”

The research team hopes to accomplish multiple goals by declaring the Lunar Anthropocene. They want to call attention to the vulnerability of lunar sites, especially considering the current lack of legal or policy protections against destructive disturbance of the Moon. They also want to ensure that each human interaction with and impact on the satellite is well chronicled, and aim to work with archeologists and anthropologists along the way to ensure that recording. 

By cataloging each footprint on the Moon's surface—not to mention the presence of rovers, golf balls, and the left-behind bags of human waste—we could hope to could preserve a detailed record of human interaction. 

“As archaeologists, we perceive footprints on the Moon as an extension of humanity's journey out of Africa, a pivotal milestone in our species' existence,” Holcomb said. “These imprints are intertwined with the overarching narrative of evolution.”

Whether or not Netflix's $82.6 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. goes through, the deal encapsulates a fraught moment for Hollywood, as the entertainment business is increasingly overshadowed by tech giants.

On the latest episode of the Equity podcast, Kirsten Korosec and I discussed the deal's implications, both for Netflix and the larger Hollywood ecosystem. Kirsten noted that it's just the latest move bringing more consolidation to the media business, and she wondered whether it's “too big a risk” for Netflix.

Meanwhile, I discussed a call with Netflix executives where Wall Street analysts also seemed to be struggling to wrap their heads around the deal. And then of course there's Paramount's competing hostile bid — whatever happens, Warner Bros.' days as a standalone company seem to be numbered.

You can read an edited preview of our conversation below.

Kirsten: I remember when Netflix was just a little baby startup and I got their [DVDs] in the mail. Here they are, all grown up, bidding for a legacy company. Did that run through your head when you saw the news?

Anthony: Certainly symbolically, it's this moment where the upstart has eaten Hollywood. There've been all these articles, even before this deal, saying, “Netflix is eating Hollywood, Netflix is transforming Hollywood.” Regardless of whether or not this deal ends up going through, Netflix will have transformed Hollywood, but this seems like the biggest — both symbolically but also substantively — one of the most dramatic things that can happen. 

Then there are all these other questions about: Will Netflix get regulatory approval? Will Paramount's hostile bid succeed?

What jumped out to you is you were catching up on it, Kirsten?

Kirsten: Well, the first thing was I was like, can there be any more consolidation in this market? I mean, that was the big one for me, because if memory serves, Warner Bros. already went through like this consolidation with Discovery, right? So here we are again. There's been so much consolidation that I have lost track of all of that.

But the second thought was what I immediately thought, what I kicked [off our discussion] with, which is really thinking about how Netflix [has grown], and there have been these dips in the road along its way, where the headlines have been about how it's struggling, and will it remain relevant, and how can it do that? If they're successful in the actual deal, [it would] potentially reflect [that] they have made it.

But then again, they have to execute on [running] an even bigger company than ever before. And so I guess my third thought on this is: Should they be buying this? Is this what it takes for them to expand? Is it a risk for them to take on so much? Why not just stay as they are? And I don't know if you agree with me on that one. Is it too big of a risk? 

Anthony: I can see how it makes sense for Netflix. It's a way to take a [content] library that is already quite large, and they've obviously had some very successful TV shows — less so on the movie side — [but] potentially, they just become so much stronger on the content side.

[And] they're suddenly now involved in all these other businesses, although the question is to what extent are they going to invest in things like the theatrical business, theme parks, making TV shows for other streaming services and networks, which are all businesses that Warner Bros is in, and Netflix says it will continue to support. But we'll see to what extent that's true.

So it seems like something that can really benefit Netflix in some ways, but, at the same time, it does seem like this is a huge risk. If you go and look at the analyst call that Netflix's executives did after announcing the deal, you can see that the analysts are wrestling with it and wondering “Okay, I can see that this grows your business, but does it grow your business [so much that it's] worth an $82 billion deal?”

And then of course, beyond the Netflix perspective, you have everybody else in Hollywood. There are all these maybe accurately hyperbolic headlines about: Is this the end of Hollywood? Is this the end of the movie theater business? All the unions are basically saying either, “This deal should be blocked” or “We're very, very, very worried about this deal.” The theater owners are saying that

And so I think there's A) Is this a good deal for Netflix? And B) is this a good deal for the entertainment business? I don't have a good answer for either, [but] I think it's more likely to be a good deal for Netflix than it is to be a good deal for the entertainment business.

Though again, part of what to keep in mind as people weigh those options or think about possible outcomes here, is that because of the way that Paramount has forced Warner Bros. to consider these acquisition offers, it seems unlikely that Warner Bros. is going to be able to continue as an independent company — which, if you're not a fan of media consolidation, that is disappointing.

Senior reporter Sean O'Kane popped over to Palo Alto to check out Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day, which some insiders told us would be the company's most important event. I'm not sure I would categorize it as such, but how about I let the journalist on the ground give his assessment? 

Via Sean (and a few of my thoughts sprinkled in) after the event …

It was easy to get lost in the buzz words at times during Rivian's “Autonomy & AI Day” this week. But there was a clear underlying message being shared: Rivian is trying to build a company that is about more than just selling cars. 

It's not going as far as Tesla. For instance, there were no humanoid robots wandering around the company's Palo Alto campus.

But it is clearly building out other revenue-generating products — and advanced driver assistance is at the starting gates. 

Rivian's hands-free version of its driver-assistance software — which today can be used on about 135,000 miles of road — will expand to 3.5 million miles and include surface streets. This expanded capability, which will launch in early 2026 and eventually include point-to-point hands-free (but eyes on) automated driving comes with a cost of $2,500 or $49.99 per month.

Then there is its future hands-off, eyes-off system. Rivian revealed it has developed its own custom 5nm processor, which it says will be built in collaboration with both Arm and TSMC. That chip will power Rivian's “autonomy computer” — the backbone of an upgraded automated-driving system —that will debut in the R2 SUV in late 2026. 

That will probably be an upcharge, although Rivian didn't say if it would be more than the $2,500 fee. 

But there's another scenario we should also consider: licensing its tech to others. 

After all, Rivian already has a joint venture with Volkswagen Group to share its electrical architecture and base-level software. And Rivian spun out two startups this year with Also (mobility) and Mind Robotics (industrial AI and robotics). 

Barclays' Dan Levy wrote Friday that “subsequent discussions reiterated hopes/potential” for Rivian to license its whole AV platform, or just components like the customs processor. And when I asked CEO RJ Scaringe if Rivian will sell the processor to Mind Robotics, he responded wryly: “It doesn't take a lot of imagination.”  

At the most abstracted level, bolting new revenue lines to the existing car business (especially if those new projects play nice with the cars) makes sense. Who doesn't love more money?  

Here's our coverage of the event:

Rivian is building its own AI assistant (deeper dive into the tech). And it is coming to its EVs in early 2026.

Rivian goes big on autonomy with custom silicon, lidar, and a hint at robotaxis

Nothing this week — or should I say, thanks for the tips, everyone, but there is nothing I can share yet.

In the meantime, here's a tiny tidbit to hold you over. As you read above, senior reporter Sean O'Kane was at Rivian's AI & Autonomy Day and one of the whispers he heard was about the company's public demo of its AI assistant and concerns it might not work. Apparently, the testing the morning of the event was a bit touch and go.

Alas, the public demo went just fine after one tense moment at the start. The risks are high for public demos, which is why many companies avoid them. Kudos to Rivian for going for it.

Got a tip for us? Email Kirsten Korosec at kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or my Signal at kkorosec.07, or email Sean O'Kane at sean.okane@techcrunch.com.

At the start of 2025, I didn't think TechCrunch would publish an aviation-startup-meets-data-center story. But here we are. 

Aircraft startup Boom Supersonic kicked off 2025 by breaking the sound barrier with its XB-1 demonstrator civil aircraft. And it's ending the year with a plan to sell a version of its turbine engine as a stationary power plant. Its first customer will be data center startup Crusoe.

Under the deal, Crusoe will buy 29 of Boom's 42-megawatt turbines for $1.25 billion to generate 1.21 gigawatts for its data centers.

Boom has raised $300 million to help commercialize this new business. The round was led by Darsana Capital Partners with participation from Altimeter Capital, Ark Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures, and Y Combinator. 

The plan is to use money from its Superpower stationary turbine business to fund the development of its supersonic aircraft. 

Other deals that got my attention …

Self-driving trucks company Aurora Innovation made a commercial agreement with Detmar Logistics to autonomously transport frac sand in the Permian Basin.

Some deals don't always work out, or they change. Take SK On and Ford, for instance.

Four years ago, Ford and South Korean battery maker SK On struck a deal to form a joint venture and spend $11.4 billion to build factories in Tennessee and Kentucky that would produce batteries for the next generation of electric F-Series trucks. Now the joint venture is ending and the two companies will divide the assets: Ford will take ownership and operation of the twin battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will operate the factory at the massive BlueOval SK campus in Tennessee.

Vatn Systems, a Rhode Island-based startup developing autonomous underwater vehicles, raised $60 million in a Series A funding round led by BVVC.

700Credit, a company that runs credit checks and identity verification services for auto dealerships across the United States, said a data breach affected at least 5.6 million people who had their names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers stolen.

The former CEO of bankrupt EV startup Canoo had pledged to provide support to NASA and the United States Postal Service so it could continue to use the vans. Apparently, that wasn't a convincing argument; NASA and USPS have stopped using them.

Ford and Renault agreed to work together to bring two affordable Ford-branded vehicles to the European market in 2028. Ford will lead the design and Renault will assemble the vehicles at its factory in northern France. 

Lucid is being sued by its former chief engineer Eric Bach, who alleges wrongful termination, discrimination, and retaliation. Bach, who is of German heritage, also claims one of the automaker's top HR executives referred to him as a “German Nazi.”

Subaru unveiled its Uncharted EV and the specs might attract buyers. The Uncharted Premium trim EV will have a 300-mile range and be priced a skosh above $36,000. Potential deal killer among Subie diehards? The Premium version is front-wheel drive only. 

A pregnant woman in San Francisco gave birth inside a Waymo robotaxi en route to UCSF Medical Center. And nope, this is not the first baby born in a Waymo. Read on to learn more. 

Meanwhile on the Waymo news front, a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to its investors disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring. Waymo declined to comment. 

Zevo wants to add robotaxis to its car-share fleet, starting with newcomer Tensor. Senior reporter Sean O'Kane digs in.

I asked and you answered. Thanks to all the readers who participated in the last poll. As a reminder, I asked: The pace of autonomous vehicle development has quickened, prompting more scrutiny and questions around safety and accountability. Should companies stay the course, scale faster, or tap the brakes?

About 48% of you picked “stay the course.” Nearly 23% chose scale faster, while 29.4% of readers want companies to tap the brakes.

The way I'd read this sentiment is that the arrangement of society is ultimately arbitrary and if we could only choose a different system we could by truly free. I'm not sure if I'm reading you correctly or not. That said, my impression is that people will not really be able to get away from something like that looks like traditional jobs. The core traits seem to be group dynamics, hierarchical competition, status-attainment -- all where resources are not infinite nor are opportunities for status.We've already had sufficient technological advances such that people would not need to do much labor, but functionally speaking I just don't think people can organize themselves into _any_ possible arrangement. I think the potential arrangements that could exist are limited by nature.

The expectation for everyone to retrain and do something else is not necessarily reasonable, especially in an environment that does not have much of a social support system for education, training, and extended periods away from the workforce.And we all know that the market doesn't magically make replacement jobs better or the same as the previous ones.

I posit that until this point in history there has never been a time where technology would allow us to grow and distribute food for free (in terms of both financial cost and labour of time). With the rise and convergence of AI, robotics, low-cost renewable energy, advances in optimal light-biomass conversion, diminishing costs on vertical farms, and self-driving vehicles, we have within our reach a way to produce food at essentially no cost.Think through what would happen to society and our economy if food was free for anyone, anywhere. Think about the meaning of work.If these ideas intrigue you, beta are readers wanted, see my profile for contact.

While there are issues that are AI specific, I don't feel as if this is one of them.  This happens for many reasons, of which AI is just one.  In turn, I think this means that the way to address the problem of job loss should not be AI soecific.If it turns out that AI does not create more jobs than are lost; that will be a new thing.  I think that can happen, but on a longer timeframe.When most jobs can be done by AI, we will need a societal change to deal with that.  That will be where people need a livelihood, not necessarily a job.  I have read pieces nearly a hundred years old saying this, there are almost certainly much earlier writings that identify this needs to be addressed.There will undoubtedly be a few individuals that will seek to accumulate wealth and power who aim to just not employ humans.  I don't think that can happen on a systemic scale because it would be too unstable.Two of the things that supports wealth inequality is 1) people do not want to risk what they currently have, and 2) they are too busy surviving to do anything about it.A world where people lose their jobs and have no support results in a populace with nothing to lose and time to act.  That state would not last long.

We change the world. It's not happening to you; you're doing it. You're doing it right now with your parent comment - you're not an observer on the sideline, you're in the thick of it, doing it, your every action - my every action - has consequences. Who will we be in our communities and societies?> I have read pieces nearly a hundred years old saying thisYou can read pieces 100 years old talking about famine, polio, Communist and fascist dictatorships, the subordination of women, etc. We changed the world, not by crying about inevitability but with vision, confidence, and getting to work. We'd better because we are completely responsible for the results.Also, inevitability is a common argument of people doing bad things. 'I am inevitable.' 'Human nature is ...' (nature being inevitable). How f-ing lazy and utterly irresponsible. Could you imagine telling your boss that? Your family? I hope you don't tell yourself that.

A problem I have with Brian Merchant's reporting on this is that he put out a call for stories from people who have lost their jobs to AI and so that's what he got.What's missing is a clear indication of the size of this problems. Are there a small number of copywriters who have been affected in this way or is it endemic to the industry as a whole?I'd love to see larger scale data on this. As far as I can tell (from a quick ChatGPT search session) freelance copywriting jobs are difficult to track because there 
isn't a single US labor statistic that covers that category.

Not only are you unlikely to know if you didn't find work because an AI successfully replaced you, but it's likely to attract the most bitter people in the industry looking for someone to blame.And, btw, I hate how steeply online content has obviously crashed in quality. It's very obvious that AI has destroyed most of what passed as ""reporting"" or even just ""listicles"". But there are better ways to measure this than approaching this from a labor perspective, especially as these jobs likely aren't coming back from private equity slash-and-burning the industry.

It doesn't tell the whole story though. That's why I always look for multiple angles and sources on an issue like this (here that's the impact of AI on freelance copywriting.)

reply

But it's probably a great way create a story to generate clicks. The people who respond to calls like this one are going to come from the extreme end of the distribution. That makes for a sensational story. But that also makes for a story that doesn't represent the reality as most people will experience it, rather the worst case.

In this instance, and probably most instances of art/craft, copywriters need to figure out what is creative again, because what is considered ""creative"" has changed.I could also see this being the journey that AI customer support took, where all staff were laid off and customers were punted to an AI agent, but then the shortcomings of AI were realized and the humans were reintroduced (albeit to a lesser degree). I suspect the pendulum will swing back to AI as the memory problems are resolved though.

The sad part is that the managers deciding on using AI are the ones who rarely understand what is good public communication - that's why they were hiring someone to help them with it.With AI they get some text that seems legit but the whole process of figuring out why&how is simply skipped. It might sometimes work but it's doubtful it builds knowledge in the organisation.

I believe that good skillful writing, drawing, or coding, by a human who actually understands and believes in what they're doing can really elevate the merely ""good"" to excellent.However, when I think about the reality of most corporate output, we're not talking about ""good"" as a baseline level that we are trying to elevate. We're usually talking about ""just barely not crap"" in the best case, to straight up garbage in maybe a more common case.Everyone understands this, from the consumer to the ""artist"" (perhaps programmer), to the manager, to the business owner. And this is why using AI slop is so easy to embrace in so many areas. The human touch was previously being used in barely successful attempts to put a coat of paint over some obvious turds. They were barely succeeding anyways, the crap stunk through. May as well let AI pretend to try, and we'll keep trying until the wheels finally fall off.

They can actually just hire the worst of you (who will do unpaid overtime, and let you call him a dummy when you're upset), because it's not a big deal that he's only 5x as fast as you used to be compared to your 10x as fast as you used to be. They can't even attract that much business now because the lowest end of the market completely disappeared and is doing it at home by themselves.Prepress/typesetting work went from a highly-specialized job that you spent years mastering and could raise a family with to a still moderately difficult job that paid just above minimum wage within a single generation, just due to Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Those tools don't even generate anything resembling a final product, they just make the job digital instead of physical. In the case of copywriting, AI instantly generates something that a lazy person could ship with.

I stand by my opinion that if a major AI company says they aren't training on something it means they aren't training on that thing.I continue to be annoyed that they won't confirm what they ARE training on though. Saying ""we don't train on data submitted is our API"" isn't exactly transparent, I want to know what they ARE training on.That lack of transparency is why they have a trust crisis in the first place!

Look at how things went for the ""Learn to code"" workforce. They were told that software would be a valuable skill to have, and sunk a lot of time and money into fronted coding bootcamps. The job market in 2025 looks very different with Sonnet 4.5, which is particularly good at frontend code. What skills would you tell all those copywriters to go re-train in? How confident are you that won't be useless in 10, 15 years? Maybe you can say that they should have trained in other fields of software, but hindsight is 20/20.I am not saying automation is bad, or that the jobs we have today should be set in stone and nothing change. But, there will be society level ramifications if we take some significant fraction of the workforce and tell them they're out of a job. Society can absorb the impact of a small fraction of the workforce going out of a job, but not a big one.

The REINDEX CONCURRENTLY mentioned in OP could also be run at other times of the day - the main issue is again I/O impact (with potentially some locking concerns at the very end of the reindex concurrently to swap out the index).There are no magic solutions here - other databases have to deal with the same practical limitations, though Postgres sometimes is a bit slow to adopt operational best practices in core (e.g. the mentioned pg_squeeze from OP may finally get an in-core ""REPACK CONCURRENTLY"" equivalent in Postgres 19, but its been a long time to get there)

Is this true? I was of the belief that standard vacuum doesnt move any data even within a page... It merely enables dead tuples to be reused in the future. But I could be mistaken

reply

1) When do pages get removed? (file on disk gets smaller)Regular vacuum can truncate the tail of a table if those pages at the end are fully empty. That may or may not happen in a typical workload, and Postgres isn't particular about placing new entries in earlier pages. Otherwise you do need a VACUUM FULL/pg_squeeze.2) Does a regular VACUUM rearrange a single page when it works on it? (i.e. remove empty pockets of data within an 8kb page, which I think the author calls compacting)I think the answer to that is yes, e.g. when looking at the Postgres docs on page layout [0] the following sentence stands out: ""Because an item identifier is never moved until it is freed, its index can be used on a long-term basis to reference an item, even when the item itself is moved around on the page to compact free space"". That means things like HOT pruning can occur without breaking index references (which modify the versions of the tuple on the same page, but keep the item identifier in the same place), but (I think) during VACUUM, even breaking index references is allowed when cleaning up dead item identifiers.[0]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-page-layout....Edit: And of course you should trust the parallel comment by anarazel to be the correct answer to this :)

No it doesn't. It just removes unused line pointers and marks the space as free in the FSM.

But it's important for normal vacuum to compact the tuples on the page, otherwise the space of deleted tuples couldn't effectively be reused. Imagine a page that's entirely filled with 100 byte tuples, then every other tuple is deleted. Then, after a vacuum, a single 108 byte tuple should be inserted onto the page.  Without compacting the space in the page during the vacuum, there would not be any space for that larger tuple.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the most expensive version of the tournament ever. Despite it coming to KC, many won't be able to attend.

Published

When it was announced that the 2026 FIFA World Cup was coming to Kansas City, people were thrilled! It was a chance to see the largest sporting event in the world, right in our backyard. For many, it was an “upset” that Kansas City was awarded the right to host games, despite our Soccer Capital of America moniker.

KC is the smallest market that landed games. With about 2.2 million people, KC is 31st in the United States in metro population. Chicago's 9.4 million metro is the third largest in the country and has no games.

Washington DC's 6.4 million metro is the next largest unrepresented area, and the first time a nation's capital isn't hosting games when the country is hosting the World Cup. Detroit, Seattle, Minneapolis, San Diego, Denver and many other larger cities are left traveling to other cities to watch games.

The lack of population in Kansas City shouldn't be an issue. It's a soccer crazed city. Even the overly long FIFA World Cup draw on December 5th, drew great TV ratings in KC. That's nothing new for KC, which consistently ranks at the top of the television ratings for all things soccer.

Top markets (ratings) for World Cup draw on Fox:

1. Kansas City2. Tulsa3. Dallas4. New Orleans5. Atlanta

— Steven Goff (@SoccerInsider) December 10, 2025



The sad thing is, TV may be the way Kansas Citians and non-wealthy fans everywhere will have to watch the games. Because no matter where the games are, they are very expensive. There has been a lot of attention given to the pricing around the 2026 World Cup and deservedly so.

Part of the reason prices for this World Cup are so high is because it's in the United States. Things are just more expensive here. From Taylor Swift tickets to the Super Bowl pricing out average fans, prices are astronomical. And the United States is the richest country in the world. However, that wealth is highly concentrated at the top. The top one percent owns nearly as much of the wealth as the bottom 90 percent. And income inequality is out of control. Imagine coming from a poor nation and trying to watch your country play. It seems nearly impossible.

The other part of the inflated cost of World Cup tickets is the use of dynamic pricing or variable pricing. Essentially, moving the costs of the tickets up and down based on what people are willing to spend. However, so far, they have only gone up. Way up.

This isn't a concept unique to sporting events or concerts. Companies are actively using customers data to charge more for items based on the zip code you buy them from when you shop online. Sometimes referred to as algorithmic pricing, some states have started to fight back with new laws preventing this form of price gouging.

If you want to attend a game in Kansas City, as of this writing, the cheapest available ticket to sit in a fairly bad seat, is $140 per ticket. That's a category 3 ticket to Algeria vs. Austria. The category 4 tickets, the cheapest offered, are not even available anymore after the first two presales.

And as you can see, these prices are already increased over the prices before the games were known.

That doesn't even factor in pricing. In some areas, parking alone is $195! Kansas City has a plan to avoid paying for parking.

Yes!

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the most expensive ever. The category 4 tickets, all of which are no longer available, are typically reserved for residents of the host country. This ensures the country putting on the costs of the tournament gets to ensure their residents attend. Often the costs of transportation, security and other costs come partially from taxpayer dollars.

In 2026, FIFA isn't reserving these tickets for locals.

The costs of those tickets — $20 in 2010, $15 in 2014, $22 in 2018 and $11 in 2022 — have also ballooned. These tickets, which again are all gone, started between $60 and $140 in the group stage. On the resale market, they are at astronomical levels.

Ticket price increases have been seen at all levels. According to The Athletic:

“Even in Category 3, though, the 2026 prices stand out. A Category 3 group-stage ticket, adjusted for inflation, cost $91 in 2006; $120 in 2010; $125 in 2014; $138 in 2018; and $79 in 2022. In 2026, prices vary from match to match, but the average Category 3 ticket costs more than $200 in the group stage. (The group-stage average is $433 in Category 2, compared to $190 in Qatar; and $563 in Category 1, compared to $253 in Qatar.)”

“In every category, for every game, 2026 prices are the highest World Cup ticket prices on record. And in many cases, they're more than twice the previous high.”

There is the possibility 2026 FIFA World Cup tickets could come down in price. At the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, also held in the United States, tickets plummeted in the days leading up to games that weren't sold out. There were reports of tickets available for as little as $4. There are almost certainly no chance prices will get that low in Kansas City or other host cities, but they could come down.

The only thing you can do right now is not buy and hope the massive number of unsold tickets will force prices down.

That's unlikely to happen for the most premier games, but for a family just wanting to see the World Cup in their backyard, a lower tier game or a game that matters little in the group stage, could come down in price. But for fans dead set on seeing a specific team or game, it's going to be tough.

For many people, the prices will simply mean they stay home. Or perhaps they go to a fan festival while games are going on in their own city. To Kansas City's credit, despite FIFA giving them the option to charge, their Fan Fest will be free.

As of right now, I'll be there, Power and Light or simply watching at home on TV. I know I'm not the only one.

Erling Haaland and Phil Foden raised their game as Manchester City beat Crystal Palace 3-0 despite producing an underwhelming performance in south London. The Eagles hit the woodwork in either half, but Haaland gave Pep Guardiola's side the lead late in the first with a towering header before Foden slammed the ball into the net with his favoured left foot to put the game out of Palace's sight.

City monopolised possession in the first half but had only four touches in the Palace box, compared to the hosts' 18. Palace posed a threat with their frequent quick and direct breaks, such as when Yeremy Pino clattered the bar after being played in by Adam Wharton or Ismaila Sarr getting into the area and flashing a shot across the face of goal. 

City had struggled to get going despite hogging the ball but took the lead in the 40th minute after an elaborate move involving more than 20 passes, which culminated in Nunes crossing for Haaland, who leapt high into the air to head into the far corner.

The visitors had another scare early in the second half when Wharton hit the post, but they managed the game well as Palace grew more frustrated. Foden's strike, which owed a lot to a brilliant jinking run from Rayan Cherki, delivered what was effectively the fatal blow in the 69th minute before Haaland added his second and City's third from the penalty spot in the 89th.

GOAL rates Man City's players from Selhurst Park...

Gianluigi Donnarumma (7/10):

Had to be alert throughout due to Palace's bright play and was ready for everything they threw at him. Won two battles with Jean-Philippe Mateta.

Matheus Nunes (7/10):

Delivered a perfect cross for Haaland to break the deadlock and gave a solid performance defensively, a big improvement on his display against Real Madrid.

Ruben Dias (6/10):

Mostly solid apart from when he gave the ball straight to Warton, which led to a Palace break.

Josko Gvardiol (6/10):

An early blow to the head didn't stop him from making crunching tackles and getting on top of Palace's attacks.

Nico O'Reilly (6/10):

Had a testing first half, struggling to handle Sarr. Grew more composed as the game went on and reasserted himself by picking Sarr's pocket to snuff out a good chance.

Bernardo Silva (6/10):

Much better than his rusty display in Madrid as he kept the ball well. Fed Nunes when he crossed for Haaland.

Nico Gonzalez (5/10):

Sat very deep and was overwhelmed on several occasions, getting mugged by Pino in the first half and again when Wharton hit the post.

Tijjani Reijnders (6/10):

Didn't get the rub of the green with his opportunities, shooting straight at Dean Henderson and being dispossessed by Chris Richards when he was about to pull the trigger.

Rayan Cherki (7/10):

Showed more dazzling footwork to beat three defenders and lay the ball off for Foden to score. Had little joy before then but he is developing a great habit of making key contributions at key moments.

Erling Haaland (7/10):

Had little involvement in the game but all he needed was one sight of goal to give City the lead. Held the ball up well when Foden scored and faced down taunts from Palace fans for not taking the penalty in the FA Cup final by coolly dispatching his spot-kick.

Phil Foden (7/10):

Turned it on in the second half to score his fifth goal in three league games.

Savinho (8/10):

Stormed forward from his own half and won the penalty just a minute after coming on.

Rayan Ait-Nouri (N/A):

Brought on in added time.

Rico Lewis (N/A):

Brought on in added time.

Omar Marmoush (N/A):

Brought on in added time.

Pep Guardiola (7/10):

Not a fluid performance despite the scoreline but given the quality of Palace he will be delighted with how the team navigated the game and managed to win despite being far from their best.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Lionel Messi's long-held Barcelona record broken as Hansi Flick favourite makes history in Osasuna win","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/lionel-messi-barcelona-record-broken-hansi-flick-favourite-history-osasuna-win/bltc4bd4cddaee05fba","Sun, 14 Dec 2025 15:12:40 GMT","

A long-standing Lionel Messi record at Barcelona has finally fallen after Pedri etched his name into Blaugrana history during a La Liga win over Osasuna. The 23-year-old became the youngest player ever to reach 150 La Liga appearances for the Catalan side, surpassing Messi, while once again pulling the strings in midfield under Hansi Flick in a 2-0 win.

Barcelona continued their La Liga title charge on Saturday with a hard-fought victory over Osasuna, a result that allowed the Catalan giants to strengthen their grip at the top of the table. Goals from Raphinha secured all three points for Flick's side, who were seeking to move seven points clear of Real Madrid ahead of their rivals' fixture the following day. While the Brazilian forward provided the decisive moments in attack, much of Barcelona's control stemmed from midfield.

Pedri was handed a starting role at the base of Flick's double-pivot system, a position that has increasingly become his natural role this season. The Spain international dictated tempo throughout the contest, offering calmness and structure during periods when Osasuna threatened to disrupt Barcelona's rhythm. His involvement ensured that Barcelona maintained territorial dominance and managed the game intelligently despite the tight scoreline.

Beyond his influence on the match itself, Pedri's appearance carried historic significance. As per Opta, at just 23 years and 18 days old, he reached 150 La Liga appearances for Barcelona, becoming the youngest player ever to do so. In the process, he surpassed a record previously held by Messi.

Pedri's record-breaking milestone highlights his remarkable consistency and durability at a club where young players are often burdened with enormous expectations. Reaching 150 league appearances at such an early age places him in rare company and reinforces Barcelona's long-term commitment to building their midfield around him. That he overtook Messi's record only adds weight to the achievement, given the Argentine's central role in shaping the club's identity for over a decade.

The midfielder's influence did not go unnoticed by his teammates, with Eric Garcia offering a light-hearted but telling assessment after the match. Speaking to the media, Garcia said, ""We knew it was going to be a very tight game. We lacked rhythm in our passing. In the end, against these teams, if you don't move the ball quickly, it's tough. In the end, I'm happy with the three points."" He then added, ""When you play before your rivals and increase your lead, you have a relaxed Sunday at home. When things get complicated, give the ball to Pedri, and he solves everything.""

Head coach Flick was equally emphatic in his praise, singling Pedri out despite Raphinha's two-goal contribution. The German said: ""Pedri is a fantastic player, top class. What can I say about him? He's an absolutely amazing player.""

Pedri's rise at Barcelona has been nothing short of extraordinary since his arrival from Las Palmas in 2020. Thrust into the first team almost immediately, he became a regular starter during the 2020–21 season, amassing 52 appearances and playing a key role in Barcelona's Copa del Rey triumph. That campaign laid the foundation for what would quickly become one of the most intense early-career workloads in European football.

His performances on the club stage were mirrored internationally, with Pedri shining at Euro 2020, where he was named Young Player of the Tournament, before going on to represent Spain at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Those efforts earned him both the Golden Boy and Kopa Trophy in 2021, confirming his status as the most highly regarded young midfielder in world football. Comparisons with Andres Iniesta soon followed, driven by his composure, close control, and ability to glide through crowded midfields.

In recent seasons, injuries have provided the main obstacle to Pedri's sustained momentum. A series of muscle issues disrupted parts of the 2022–23 and 2023–24 campaigns, forcing Barcelona to carefully manage his minutes. However, under Flick, he has re-emerged as a central figure, once fit, already surpassing 220 appearances in all competitions by the age of 23 and continuing to shape games with maturity well beyond his years.

Barcelona now turn their focus to maintaining their advantage at the top of La Liga as the season enters a decisive phase. With Pedri once again available and influencing matches, Flick's side look better equipped to manage the demands of both domestic and European competitions.

For Pedri personally, breaking Messi's record is unlikely to be an endpoint, but rather another marker in a rapidly expanding legacy at Camp Nou. With assists in three consecutive league games and a growing leadership role in midfield, his influence continues to increase with each appearance.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Kim Cattrall has never truly stepped away from Samantha Jones. Years after “Sex and the City,” the actor still radiates the same confidence, glamour, and fearless self-expression that made the character unforgettable.

From a bold bikini moment to chic vacation snapshots, Cattrall continues to embody that unmistakable SATC energy, and fans cannot get enough.

Cattrall has long leaned into the bold, fearless style synonymous with Samantha Jones. In recent years, she has continued to share striking swimwear photos that celebrate confidence and self-assurance at every age.

She regularly offers followers glimpses into her travels, blending relaxed luxury with her signature fashion sense. During a stay in the Maldives, Cattrall shared photos from her getaway at One&Only Reethi Rah.

“A dream come true spending an extraordinary vacation at One&Only Reethi Rah @ooreethirah @ooresorts 😎💋❤️”

The post captured the same joy and confidence fans have long associated with her most famous role. Fashion-forward and unapologetically herself, Cattrall continues to blur the line between character and personal style.

The image quickly resonated with fans, who praised her strength and confidence. Her toned arms and legs stood out, reinforcing why she remains admired well beyond her “Sex and the City” years. One fan wrote: “Stunning Queen 🔥❤️”

Another fan wrote: “The Lady is living her best life ❤️😍” “Sex and the City” Writer Candace Bushnell wrote: “Beautiful! You and the scenery 🩷🩷🩷.”

Cattrall's personal life is also thriving. The “Sex and the City” alum recently married longtime partner Russell Thomas in an intimate London ceremony.

According to photos published by People, the couple tied the knot on December 4 with just 12 guests in attendance. The low-key celebration reflected Cattrall's preference for privacy while marking a joyful new chapter in her life.

Cattrall has also spoken openly about her relationship with Thomas. The two first met in 2016 when Cattrall appeared at BBC studios for an episode of “Woman's Hour.”

“He direct messaged me,” Cattrall told Glamour in 2018. “It was very, very modern [and] it's just been very easy.”

She later recalled that the relationship grew when Thomas traveled to Vancouver to see her.

“It was very brave of him because we didn't really know each other other than having a few meals together,” she told People in 2020. “But he came, and we got along great. And we've been together ever since!”

Whether she is sharing a bikini moment, celebrating love, or posting sun-soaked vacation snapshots, Cattrall continues to show that confidence, style, and self-assurance only grow stronger with time.

Officials refuse to share name of person or details of arrest; Donald Trump says ‘Things can happen' in comments shared by White House

Person of interest detained in Brown University shooting that left two dead

What we know so far

Politicians and law enforcement officials held a press conference in Providence, Rhode Island, a day after a shooter killed two people and injured several others at Brown University.

Here is what we know about the attack after the latest update:

A man in his 20s was taken into custody on Sunday morning. Police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say whether the person of interest was the same person seen in surveillance footage released by authorities on Saturday. Officials did not name the person.

A shooter dressed in black killed at least two people and wounded nine others at Brown University during final exams on the Ivy League campus.

Brown University president Christina Paxson confirmed that the two people killed were students. A shelter-in-place in effect for the area was lifted on Sunday morning.

Eight people with gunshot wounds were taken to Rhode Island hospital, where six were in critical but stable condition, according to Kelly Brennan, a spokesperson for the hospital. A ninth person was later found to have been injured, but was reportedly not in a critical situation.

Providence's mayor said he had visited the victims of the attack in hospital, praising their resilience and the efforts of emergency medical staff who treated them.

Smiley declined to name any of the shooting victims as not all relatives had been contacted yet.

Officials refused to say whether a gun used in the attack had been found. Earlier reports on CNN said the person of interest had two firearms with them. The Associated press reported officials said two loaded 30-round magazines had been found. Officials did not comment on any speculation.

Law enforcement agencies were seen at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, roping off rooms as part of the investigation into the shooting. An FBI agent said the person of interest had been arrested at the hotel, which is a short drive from Brown University.

The FBI used cellphone data to locate the person of interest, FBI Director Kash Patel said.

President Donald Trump told reporters that he had been briefed on the shooting and “all we can do right now is pray for the victims.” Earlier he claimed a suspect was in custody before rowing back on that statement.

The shooting occurred in the Barus and Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. According to the university's website, the building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices. Brown, one of the America's most prestigious colleges, has roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students.

More politicians are reacting to the shooting at Brown University yesterday, sending tributes to victims and their families while calling for urgent action to end gun violence.

California senator Adam Schiff posted on X, saying:

I'm praying for all of the victims, their families, and the entire Brown University community as it grieves this horrific act of gun violence. How many more tragedies, more lives lost, more grieving families, before we act? We can and we must end our gun violence epidemic.”

Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted:

On this solemn anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, we remember the 26 beautiful souls taken in an act of unimaginable violence. Yesterday's shooting at Brown University is a painful reminder that this grief is not confined to history. Thirteen years later, communities are still being torn apart by gun violence—and the weight of that loss continues to demand action. We must not stop fighting until the job is done.

California senator Alex Padilla wrote:

Angela and I are horrified by last night's shooting at Brown University that left two students dead, nine injured, and hundreds more traumatized. We pray for the victims, their families, and the entire Brown community. Gun violence in America must come to an end. I refuse to give into the notion that there's nothing more we can do to try to prevent these tragedies.

Teaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked.

“The first couple of gunshots went straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,” Oduro said. “Who knows, if I didn't duck, maybe I'm not here today.“

A student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said.

First lady Melania Trump spoke after the US president at a White House holiday event to pay tribute to the people killed in attacks in Providence, Rhode Island, and Bondi Beach, Sydney.

Melania said: “My thoughts and prayers go to the families of, the people who lost the loved ones around the world in this, difficult time.”

The White House has shared video on social media of Donald Trump's remarks on the mass shooting at Brown at a holiday reception at the White House on Sunday.

“Before we begin, I want to just pay my respects to the people, unfortunately two are no longer with us, Brown University, nine injured and two are looking down on us right now from Heaven,” the president said.

“Likewise, in Australia, as you know, that was a terrible attack: 11 dead, 29 wounded, and that was an antisemitic attack, obviously,” Trump said.

The president also mentioned the deadly attack on three Americans serving in Syria on Saturday. “In Syria, also, we had an attack in Syria, and we had three great patriots terminated by bad people, and not the Syrian government, it was Isis,” Trump said.

“Brown University,” Trump added, “great school, really one of the greatest schools anywhere in the world. Things can happen,” the president said.

“So to the nine injured: get well fast. And to the families of those two that are no longer with us: I pay my deepest regards and respects, from the United States of America. Thank you very much. It's a very important thing to say, and we mean it.”

Trump also said that in Syria “there will be big damage done” to those responsible for the attack on US service members.

The president also praised the man who tackled one of the attackers in Australia.

Earlier on Sunday, Georgia senator Raphael Warnock urged people to find “common humanity” after a deadly shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, Warnock said: “I can tell you that as a pastor who has presided over many funerals, I don't think that there's any pain deeper than when nature is violently reversed and rather than children burying their parents, the parent has to bury the child. And so we pray prayers for these families.”

Warnock, who pushed Congress to pass more gun control legislation after two students and two teachers at a high school in his home state of Georgia were shot to death in 2024, went on to call for action after yet another mass shooting at an education facility in America.

He told NBC: “We have to pray not only with our lips, but with our action. Any nation that tolerates this kind of violence year after year, decade after decade in random places on our college and school campuses without doing all that we can to stop it is broken and in need of moral repair.”

During the press conference, Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez declined to say if the person of interest had any connection to Brown University.

“I'm not ready to confirm or comment on any of that,” Perez told reporters. “Again, I got to respect the process, and so at this point, we're just going to continue, like the mayor stated. It's complex, but we want to make sure that we have a successful prosecution.”

Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez said at this moment an eventual case against a shooting suspect is being treated as a state prosecution, rather than a federal one.

Providence police chief Col Oscar Perez has said the person of interest in custody is in his 20s, not in his 30s as officials stated earlier on Sunday.

Police refused to comment on a social media post by FBI director Kash Patel that claimed the arrest of a person of interest was based on a lead from Providence police.

Writing on X, Patel said the FBI “established a command post to intake, develop and analyze leads, and run them to ground. We activated the FBI's Cellular Analysis Survey Team, to provide critical geolocation capabilities.

“As a result, early this morning, FBI Boston's Safe Streets Task Force, with assistance from the @USMarshalsHQ & the @Coventry_RI_PD, detained a person of interest in a hotel room in Coventry, RI, based off a lead by the @ProvidenceRIPD.

“We have deployed local and national resources to process and reconstruct the shooting scene - providing HQ and Lab elements on scene. We set up a digital media intake portal to ingest images and video from the public related to this incident.

“And the FBI's victim specialists are fully integrating with our partners to provide resources to victims and survivors of this horrific violence. This FBI will continue an all out 24/7 campaign until justice is fully served. Thanks to the men and women of the FBI and our partners for their continued teamwork. Please continue praying for the victims and their families - as well as all those at Brown University.

Mayor Brett Smiley says he won't share names of the victims yet as he believes some of their families have not yet been contacted because they might be travelling for the holidays.

He adds that bringing the person responsible for the shooting to justice is the top priority for officials. He reiterates the reason he's not sharing unconfirmed information so as to not compromise any future prosecution.

Col Oscar Perez refused to say whether the person in custody is the same person as the one seen in surveillance footage released on Saturday night.

Perez declined to comment on whether officials had found the gun used in the attack.

Col Oscar Perez was asked whether officials had been able to establish any connection between the suspects and the university or find out why the suspect targeted the university.

Perez said: “So that's all part of the investigation that we're conducting. And again, it's, it's complex.”

Police chief Col Oscar Perez addresses reporters and says he is aware of speculation around a suspect's name. He says he is not ready to provide a name or names.

He told reporters the “investigation continues to progress extremely fast” He added: We're in the process of collecting evidence and seizing items that we need to seize such location that we need to search.”

Mayor Smiley went on to say he visited victims of the attack and their families in hospital on Sunday.

He thanked the medical staff at Brown Health and Rhode Island Hospital, saying: “These folks, just like our law enforcement professionals, have been up all night working. But the level of care and professionalism that they're exhibiting is extraordinary.

“These survivors received an excellent care. And the resilience that these survivors showed and shared with me is, frankly, pretty overwhelming. It pales in comparison what they've gone through for the rest of us here. We're all saddened and scared and tired.

“But what they've been through something entirely different. And yet they showed courage and hope and gratitude for how this community has stood up for them, and how the health care providers care for them.”

Mayor Brett Smiley says the community would now turn “our attention to caring for our neighbors”.

He pointed to a website set up by the city of Providence where the community find resources for mental health care.

He said a vigil would be held at 5pm ET at Olympic Park, where there had been plans to light a Christmas tree and to light a menorah for the first night of Hanukkah.

He said: “And for those who know at least a little bit of a Hanukkah story, it is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light, if there's nothing better that we could be doing this community.”

Providence mayor Brett Smiley begins the press conference. He starts by praising the level of collaboration between law enforcement agencies.

He says there is no update to share on the investigation, that the investigation is ongoing and that officials are cooperating with law enforcement agencies.

He said he would not share any information that could jeopardize the investigation or compromise any future charges.

The person in custody after the Brown University shooting had two firearms with them when they were detained, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN.

Students in a lab near to where a shooting took place at Brown University hid under desks and turned off the lights, one student told The Associated Press as witnesses described their shock over the incident on Saturday afternoon.

Officers were hunting through buildings on the Ivy League campus after the shooting erupted on the second day of final exams. Providence City Mayor Brett Smiley said those are the only known injuries and casualties. The mayor said a shooter is not in custody.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A person of interest was in custody Sunday after a shooting during final exams at Brown University that killed two students and wounded nine others, though key questions remained unanswered nearly 24 hours after the attack.

The attack Saturday afternoon set off hours of chaos across the Ivy League campus and surrounding Providence neighborhoods as hundreds of officers searched for the shooter and urged students and staff to shelter in place. The lockdown, which stretched into the night, was lifted early Sunday, but authorities had not yet released information about a potential motive.

Col. Oscar Perez, the Providence police chief, said Sunday afternoon that the person in custody was in their 20s and that no one has been charged yet. Perez, who earlier had said the person was in their 30s and that no one else was being sought, declined to say whether the detained person had any connection to Brown. 

The person was taken into custody at a Hampton Inn hotel in Coventry, Rhode Island, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Providence, where police officers and FBI agents remained Sunday, blocking off a hallway with crime scene tape as they searched the area.

The shooting occurred during one of the busiest moments of the academic calendar, as final exams were underway. Brown canceled all remaining classes, exams, papers and projects for the semester and told students they were free to leave campus, underscoring the scale of the disruption and the gravity of the attack.

College President Christina Paxson teared up while describing her conversations with students both on campus and in the hospital.




“They are amazing and they're supporting each other,” she said at an afternoon news conference. “There's just a lot of gratitude.”

The gunman opened fire inside a classroom in the engineering building, firing more than 40 rounds from a 9 mm handgun, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. Two handguns were recovered when the person of interest was taken into custody and authorities also found two loaded 30-round magazines, the official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on the condition of anonymity.

One student of the nine wounded students had been released from the hospital, said Paxson. Seven others were in critical but stable condition, and one was in critical condition.

Providence leaders said residents would notice a heavier police presence, and many area businesses announced Sunday that they would remain closed. A scheduled 5K run was postponed until next weekend. 

Mayor Brett Smiley invited residents to gather Sunday evening in a city park where an event had been scheduled to light a Christmas tree and Hanukkah menorah.

“For those who know at least bit of the Hanukkah story, it is quite clear that if we can come together as a community to shine a little bit of light tonight, there's nothing better that we can be doing,” he told reporters.

Smiley said he visited some of the wounded students and was inspired by their courage, hope and gratitude. One told him that active shooting drills done in high school proved helpful.

“The resilience that these survivors showed and shared with me, is frankly pretty overwhelming,” he said. “We're all saddened, scared, tired, but what they've been through is something different entirely.”

Investigators were not immediately sure how the shooter got inside the first-floor classroom at the Barus & Holley building, a seven-story complex that houses the School of Engineering and physics department. The building includes more than 100 laboratories, dozens of classrooms and offices, according to the university's website.

Engineering design exams were underway. Outer doors of the building were unlocked but rooms being used for final exams required badge access, Smiley said.

Emma Ferraro, a chemical engineering student, was in the lobby working on a final project when she heard loud pops coming from the east side. Once she realized they were gunshots, she darted for the door and ran to a nearby building where she waited for hours.

Surveillance video released by police showed a suspect, dressed in black, walking from the scene. 

Eva Erickson, a doctoral candidate who was the runner-up earlier this year on the CBS reality competition show “Survivor,” said she left her lab in the engineering building 15 minutes before shots rang out.

The engineering and thermal science student shared candid moments on “Survivor” as the show's first openly autistic contestant. She was locked down in the campus gym following the shooting and shared on social media that the only other member of her lab who was present was safely evacuated.

Brown senior biochemistry student Alex Bruce was working on a final research project in his dorm across the street from the building when he heard sirens outside.

“I'm just in here shaking,” he said, watching through the window as armed officers surrounded his dorm. 

Students in a nearby lab turned off the lights and hid under desks after receiving an alert, said Chiangheng Chien, a doctoral student in engineering who was about a block from where the shooting occurred.

Mari Camara, 20, a junior from New York City, was coming out of the library and rushed inside a taqueria to seek shelter. She spent more than three hours there, texting friends while police searched the campus.

“Everyone is the same as me, shocked and terrified that something like this happened,” she said.

Brown, the seventh-oldest higher education institution in the U.S., is one of the nation's most prestigious colleges, with roughly 7,300 undergraduates and more than 3,000 graduate students. 

Crystal McCollaum, of Chicopee, Massachusetts, was staying at the hotel where the person of interest was taken into custody. She was with her daughter to attend a cheerleading competition in Providence, but after hearing about the shooting, she thought they would be safer staying outside the city.

“It was just weird and scary,” she said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation between writer Jennifer Jane and her mom, Jane Post. It has been edited for length and clarity.

After moving out of the home I loved and lived in for 31 years, it took me a few years to settle on a housing situation that suited me. I was used to living alone and liked it, but my home became too much work and responsibility once I reached my mid-70s, and I needed something different.

I lived with a friend for a few months, then moved across the country from Florida to New York in 2020 to live with my older daughter for a couple of years. However, neither of those arrangements was the right fit for me.

I left New York and moved back to Florida without a plan. My younger daughter offered me a mobile home on her property to stay in while I figured it out. I moved in and didn't move out. It felt just right. It is small and easy for me to take care of. It's the perfect size to fit the things I hold dear. I call it ""The Teapot.""

I have always loved teapots. I once read a story about a retired Colonel who bought a very tiny cottage in England that had belonged to a little old lady who used it as a tearoom for walkers that wandered by. It was so small that it had just one tiny table and two chairs. The Colonel said it was like living in a teapot. I recalled this story when I stepped into the mobile home, and I knew I had at last found my home sweet home…The Teapot.

I like nearly everything about living in my Teapot. Old people often have balance issues... if I lose my balance, I always have a nearby wall, table, or counter to bounce off of. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough electrical outlets.

I share my little home with a cast of characters: Penny, the tubby brown mystery mutt mix; Choccy, the chihuahua who has difficulty walking due to old age; Little Thing, a three-legged tiny chihuahua mix; Pinkie, the cat; Agatha Raisin, the bantam chicken; Sarose, her evilness, a seabrite chicken; Jaeger, the barn cat; and then there's me, the human who does their bidding. My animals bring a huge amount of joy into my small space.

My day begins around 5 am when I start taking care of my animals. I take the ones with special needs outside one by one. I feed and water them. I make my tea. I take Penny for a walk, then put the chickens outside in their pen. I make more tea. I feed and water the wild birds.

I spend the afternoon doing whatever I want. It's heavenly to sit and watch the birds at the feeders, just six feet away, and sip tea. Everything I want is close by and easy to reach. There is a stack of books sitting on a table to be read.

There are shallow boxes of fossilized shells on top of the two chickens' indoor overnight pen. I love looking through the shells, thinking about how to make them into lovely works of art. I can't do that if they are in a box out of sight. I have made many beautiful things in my small world. I think the smallness helps me to focus and be even more creative.

I love that my two great-grandsons, ages 4 and 8, who live nearby, enjoy visiting my little enchanted world. They pop in and out to spend time with me and my collection of little creatures. They feel the magic and love the Teapot as I do.

I was very ill recently, and all I could manage was to feed all my animals and get them in and out, then I had to go back to bed, too sick to read or watch a movie. As I lay there, I really felt as if the Teapot was giving me comfort like a warm hug. I could look around and see, with one glance, all the things I hold dear that bring me happy memories.

When you get old, the list of things you'll never get to do, have, or own might seem never-ending, and past memories are your lifeline. Every memory I've fit into my little home brings me happiness and comfort.

Living in a small space is not for everyone, but for me, the Teapot is heaven on Earth. I'm in my 80s now. My younger daughter is nearby if I need anything or want company, but I am able to live independently in a way that works for me. I can have everything that's important to me at this time of my life — family, freedom from the responsibilities and demands of home ownership, my animals, privacy, peace, and most everything I love at my fingertips.
