                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UCLA scientists have characterized the structure and function of a key survival protein in breast cancer cells that helps explain how these tumors resist environmental stress and thrive in acidic, low-oxygen environments that would normally be toxic to healthy cells. Breast cancer cells rely on a transporter protein called NBCn1 to bring alkali ions into the cell and maintain a favorable internal pH. Using advanced cryo-electron microscopy combined with computational modeling, the researchers showed that NBCn1 moves two sodium ions and one carbonate ion through an efficient "elevator-like" motion that minimizes energy use. This allows NBCn1 to achieve a high transport rate of approximately 15,000 ions per second, helping tumor cells maintain an internal pH that promotes survival, division and resistance to acidic stress. Tumor microenvironments are often acidic due to low oxygen levels and high metabolic activity. NBCn1 is a plasma membrane transporter known to help control cellular pH, but until now, little was understood about its precise structure or how it achieves such efficient ion transport. To understand how this protein works, the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to capture the first atomic, three-dimensional structure of human NBCn1. They then applied computational modeling to study the protein's dynamics and how it interacts with ions. By understanding the structure and function of NBCn1, the study provides a blueprint for designing drugs that could potentially block this transporter and disrupt the internal chemical balance that cancer cells depend on. Targeting this protein in cancer cells specifically could offer a precise way to weaken tumors while minimizing harm to normal tissue. By linking the protein's structure, ion energetics, and function, the study shows how small molecular motions can generate high transport efficiency. These insights bridge a critical knowledge gap between basic biophysics and cancer therapeutics and lay the groundwork for new strategies that target pH regulation as a vulnerability in tumor cells."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, new research from Johns Hopkins Medicine adds to existing evidence that smoking fewer cigarettes does not eliminate cardiovascular disease risk, and quitting entirely is the most effective strategy for improving health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 16 million Americans are living with a smoking-related disease, making cigarette smoking a major public health concern. In an effort to further address this issue, researchers sought to demonstrate the relationships among smoking burden, intensity and cessation duration across multiple heart and vascular-related health conditions. These findings, published Nov. 18 in the journal PLOS Medicine, add important evidence underscoring the urgent need to encourage early smoking cessation. Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research, Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and study's corresponding author Researchers used baseline variables from a standardized data set developed by the Cross-Cohort Collaboration-Tobacco Working Group, which combined data from 22 cohort studies involving 323,826 adults, following participants for up to 19.9 years and documenting more than 125,000 deaths and 54,000 cardiovascular events. Researchers then applied Cox proportional hazard models to assess associations among overall smoking history, cigarettes per day and years since cessation in relation to cardiovascular outcomes. A multivariable model was adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity and education status. A second multivariable model was adjusted for nine harmonized covariates, including body mass index, diabetes, history of coronary heart disease at baseline and any alcohol use. The reference group for all analyses was individuals who had never smoked. "This study shows that even low levels of smoking - for example, only a few cigarettes a day - carry substantial cardiovascular risks," says Blaha. Quitting completely - not just cutting back - provides the greatest health benefit." Additionally, these research findings provide specific estimates showing how much risk former and current smokers face, especially those who smoke only a few cigarettes per day, with the use of three factors - how long someone has smoked, how many cigarettes they smoke per day and how long it has been since they quit - each related to the risk of heart disease and death. "Our findings illustrate the complex relationship between how much someone has smoked over time and how long it has been since they quit," says Blaha. The study was led by Erfan Tasdighi, M.D., who conducted the research while at Johns Hopkins Medicine and is now a resident at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That is the conclusion of dentist- periodontist Tim Thomassen in his dissertation Oral Disease Prevention, which he will defend on 12 December at the University of Amsterdam. In his research, he examines how effective different types of toothbrushes are and how much impact the actual time people spend brushing has on oral health. But what does 'good' actually mean?Thomassen investigated various aspects of preventing tooth and gum diseases, including the effectiveness of toothbrushes, brushing duration, and oral hygiene instructions. Expensive technology plays a much smaller role in preventing cavities and gum diseases than many people think. Because the differences between products are often minimal in practice, it is people themselves who ultimately make the biggest difference." The price differences are significant, but does that also apply to how well they clean our teeth? According to Thomassen, manufacturers would be better off investing in user education and affordable, sustainable designs rather than launching yet another - and often even more expensive - model. The global recommendation is clear: brush twice a day for two minutes to effectively remove dental plaque. Thomassen's research confirms that two minutes of brushing removes more plaque than one minute. He then examined whether brushing for three minutes works even better. It doesn't - the added benefit is minimal. People who use a manual toothbrush, still the majority worldwide, brush for less time: on average just under 1.5 minutes. 'We know brushing works, and fortunately the average brushing time has been increasing in recent years, but many people still don't brush long enough,' Thomassen says.Users of powered toothbrushes do reach the two-minute mark more often, and even exceed it, brushing for almost 2.5 minutes on average. 'Built-in timers may help people brush longer,' he notes. 'Good oral care starts with accessible, understandable, and practical information that people can apply immediately. 'He therefore advocates for practical guidelines tailored to people's lifestyles, abilities, and budgets so that good oral care becomes achievable for everyone. 'There is a clear need for a national oral-care guideline that is evidence-based and adapted to different needs and preferences. 'Thomassen hopes that his research can contribute to this goal. Preparations for such a guideline are already underway - the next challenge he is committed to taking on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company developing polymer-free sustained release drug delivery systems, has entered into an evaluation and licensing option agreement with an affiliate of Bausch + Lomb. Ripple's proprietary technology platform is based on the discovery that drugs can be chemically engineered into controlled-release prodrugs without relying on polymers, a component often associated with inflammation. These prodrugs utilize a surface erosion mechanism, enabling zero-order release kinetics, and can be precisely engineered to control both drug dose and duration. As part of the agreement, Bausch + Lomb will fund early-stage feasibility and preclinical evaluation of a selected target molecule. Licensing would be subject to additional financial terms, including milestone payments and royalties. This collaboration aims to advance sustained-release ophthalmic therapies that may offer improved safety profiles and extended treatment duration. Wendy Neimark, Co-Founder and CTO from Ripple Therapeutics, will be speaking at the Panel Session on “Unlocking Biotech-Pharma Collaboration: How Agile Small Teams & Experienced Pharma Combine Strengths to Accelerate Innovation & Deliver Real-World Impact”, focusing on strategies to leverage the speed and innovation of biotech startups alongside deep experience and resources of pharma giant AbbVie and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new USC study shows teens with higher blood levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) measured before bariatric surgery had smaller improvements in blood sugar over five years, including fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), which measures average blood sugar levels over the past 60-90 days. The results, published in the journal Environmental Endocrinology, suggest that PFAS exposure may help explain why metabolic outcomes differ among patients. They have been detected in the blood of nearly all U.S. adults and have been linked to a number of health problems, including kidney and liver problems and several types of cancer. A growing body of evidence now suggests that PFAS could also play a role in metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes. The study was led by researchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Southern California Superfund Research and Training Program for PFAS Assessment, Remediation and Prevention (ShARP) Center, which is funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences to identify the health effects of hazardous chemicals and use those insights to drive prevention and policy. Recent findings from the USC team showed that teens with higher blood levels of PFAS also tend to regain more weight after bariatric surgery. Broadly, the team is studying what factors influence why some patients do better than others. Their research could help guide a more targeted approach to treatment, taking into account how environmental toxins like PFAS may affect patient outcomes. For example, screening for PFAS before surgery could identify patients who need extra monitoring or additional interventions to keep their blood sugar healthy over time. Our findings show that it's important for environmental epidemiologists and physicians to collaborate. Targeted precision medicine based on our growing knowledge of PFAS and environmental health may help ensure patients have the greatest success with this weight loss intervention." Brittney Baumert, PhD, MPH, postdoctoral research fellow in population and public health sciences, Keck School of Medicine and study's joint first author They also measured insulin and estimated insulin resistance, or how hard the body has to work to keep blood sugar under control. Overall, most Teen-LABS patients had significant improvements in metabolic health after surgery. But teens with higher exposure to all eight PFAS together showed a smaller improvement in long-term blood sugar, with their HbA1c rising, on average, 0.27 percentage points three years after surgery. One PFAS in particular, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), had an outsized impact. Teens with higher PFHxS exposure before surgery had average annual increases of 0.15 percentage points in HbA1c, a rate that could move someone from normal blood sugar to prediabetes-or from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes-within a few years. Researchers did not observe a clear association between pre-surgery PFAS levels and post-surgery insulin levels and say more research is needed on that link. The Teen-LABS study allowed researchers to explore metabolic outcomes related to diabetes, even though diabetes was not its primary focus. Future research could build on these findings by including gold-standard diabetes tests, detailed dietary data and larger patient populations, the researchers said. But many questions remain unanswered," said joint first author Elizabeth Costello, PhD, a research scientist at the Brown University School of Public Health who was a postdoctoral researcher at the Keck School of Medicine when the study was done. Baumert is now leading a follow-up study to investigate biological mechanisms that may explain why some patients have better outcomes after bariatric surgery. This study adds to growing evidence that PFAS can interfere with the body's ability to regulate glucose, even after substantial weight loss, said last author Vaia Lida Chatzi, MD, PhD, professor of population and public health sciences and pediatrics and director of the ShARP Center at the Keck School of Medicine.

An international team led by Prof. Marcus Conrad, Director of the Institute of Metabolism and Cell Death at Helmholtz Munich and Chair of Translational Redox Biology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), now describes in Cell how neurons protect themselves against ferroptotic cell death. Central to this defense mechanism is the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). A single mutation in the gene that encodes GPX4 can disrupt a crucial, previously unknown component of the enzyme's function. In affected children, this leads to severe early-onset dementia. When fully functional, GPX4 inserts a short protein loop – a kind of "fin" – into the inner side of the neuronal cell membrane, enabling the enzyme to neutralize harmful substances known as lipid peroxides. With its fin immersed into the cell membrane, it rides along the inner surface and swiftly detoxifies lipid peroxides as it goes." A single point mutation found in children with early-onset dementia alters this fin-like protein loop: the enzyme can no longer insert into the membrane properly to perform its cell-protective function. Lipid peroxides are then free to damage the membrane, triggering ferroptosis and cell rupture, and the neurons die. The study started with three children in the United States who suffer from an extremely rare form of early childhood dementia. From these reprogrammed stem cells, they then generated cortical neurons and three-dimensional tissue structures resembling early brain tissue – so-called brain organoids. They observed a pattern strikingly similar to that seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease: numerous proteins that are increased or decreased in Alzheimer's were likewise dysregulated in mice lacking functional GPX4. This suggests that ferroptotic stress may play a role not only in this rare early-onset disorder, but potentially also in more common forms of dementia. "Our data indicate that ferroptosis can be a driving force behind neuronal death – not just a side effect," says Dr. Svenja Lorenz, one of the first authors of the study. "Until now, dementia research has often focused on protein deposits in the brain, so-called amyloid ß plaques. We are now putting more emphasis on the damage to cell membranes that sets this degeneration in motion in the first place." Initial experiments also show that cell death triggered by loss of GPX4 can be slowed in cell cultures and in the mouse model using compounds that specifically inhibit ferroptosis. "This is an important proof of principle, but it is not yet a therapy," says Dr. Tobias Seibt, nephrologist at LMU University Hospital Munich and co-first author. Dr. Adam Wahida, also a first author of the study, adds: "In the long term, we can imagine genetic or molecular strategies to stabilize this protective system. For now, however, our work clearly remains in the realm of basic research." The study is the result of a research network that has grown over many years bringing together genetics, structural biology, stem cell research, and neuroscience, with several dozen scientists at multiple sites worldwide. "Projects like this vividly demonstrate why we need long-term funding for basic research and international multidisciplinary teams if we are to truly understand complex diseases such as dementia and other neurodegenerative disease conditions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Mass General Brigham have modified a herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) that stimulates the immune system to attack glioblastoma cells. A single dose of the modified virus increased T-cell, natural killer cell, and myeloid cell responses in the tumor microenvironment and increased the overall survival in preclinical models. Glioblastoma is among the most aggressive and treatment-resistant brain tumors. Previous attempts to stimulate the immune system to attack tumor cells in the brain have shown limited benefit, in part because glioblastoma cells release multiple molecules that dampen immune responses. They engineered the virus to express five different immunomodulatory molecules to help reprogram the tumor environment, including IL-12, anti-PD1, a bispecific T cell engager, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and anti-TREM2. Researchers also added safety mutations, or "off-switches," that prevent the virus from spreading to neurons or healthy central nervous system cells. So that the reach of the virus could be visualized on PET scan, the team inserted a gene that expresses a protein capable of trapping a PET-tracer molecule. Mice treated with the virus showed increased infiltration of tumor-fighting T cells, as well as reduced T-cell exhaustion markers. Mice injected with the virus also lived longer than glioblastoma-harboring mice not injected with the virus. This platform offers a multipronged approach-precise tumor targeting, local delivery of immunotherapeutic payloads, and a built-in safety system to protect normal brain cells." Francisco J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of nearly 10,000 long-lasting chemical compounds that stay in the environment and have been linked to adverse health effects on humans, including pregnant women and their unborn children. Although the placenta plays an important role as a protective barrier for the fetus, previous studies have not adequately assessed the true extent of foetal exposure to PFAS during early pregnancy. Researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ), in cooperation with the Dessau Municipal Hospital, have now further developed a 3D placenta model so that it can be used to better analyse the risks of PFAS exposure during pregnancy. The first 90 days of pregnancy are particularly important, because the baby's organs begin to develop during this sensitive period. "For an accurate risk assessment, it is important to document PFAS exposure more precisely, especially during the first trimester of pregnancy", says UFZ reproductive scientist Dr Violeta Stojanovska, author and principal investigator. So far, little is known about this because most reproductive studies rely on PFAS detection in the blood or the placenta obtained in the final months of pregnancy or on experiments performed in simplified cellular models that use individual PFAS compounds rather than mixtures. "These PFAS were relevant for our investigations because we detected them in high concentrations in placenta and there was literature indication that they might trigger pregnancy complications", says doctoral candidate and lead author of the study Yu Xia. These six compounds were then used to obtain a placenta-relevant PFAS mixture that later was tested in a 3D trophoblast model to simulate placental exposure. Trophoblasts are placental cells that invade maternal tissue early in pregnancy and establish contact with the mother's bloodstream. With these 3D models the research team was able to investigate various placental functions, including hormone production and invasiveness. The placental cells showed disrupted ability to invade. This invasiveness is crucial for optimal foetal growth by facilitating nutrient transfer from the mother. Gene expression analysis revealed that apoptosis (programmed cell death) and proliferation (the cell growth needed for placental development), processes important for the development of the placenta, are also impaired by PFAS. The research team also found that PFAS exposure reduces β-hCG production, which is the first hormone produced by the placenta and a key regulator of pregnancy: it stimulates progesterone production, which creates healthy uterine lining, and helps prevent fetus rejection. Reduced production of β-hCG could therefore indicate hormone regulation disorders. "These minor changes haven't received much attention so far, but taken collectively might cause significant impact on pregnancy progression", says Stojanovska. 3D trophoblast models are extremely helpful because they provide a more comprehensive understanding of PFAS risk assessment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When someone walks into an emergency room with symptoms of a stroke, every second matters. But today, diagnosing the type of stroke, the life-or-death distinction between a clot and a bleed, requires large, stationary machines like CT scanners that may not be available everywhere. In ambulances, rural clinics, and many hospitals worldwide, doctors often have no way to make this determination in time. Microwave imaging technology already exists and can detect changes in the electrical properties of tissues - changes that happen when stroke, swelling, or tumors disrupt the brain's normal structure. But the computations needed to turn the raw microwave data into an actual image have been far too slow. Stephen Kim, Research Professor, Department of Biomedical Engineering, NYU Tandon Kim, along with BME Ph.D. student Lara Pinar and Department Chair Andreas Hielscher, believes that barrier may now be disappearing. In a new study published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, the team describes an innovative algorithm that reconstructs microwave images 10 to 30 times faster than the best existing methods, a leap that could bring real-time microwave imaging from theory into practice. It's a breakthrough that didn't come from building new devices or designing faster hardware, but from rethinking the mathematics behind the imaging itself. "You could almost hear the computer groan," he said. "It was like trying to push a boulder uphill. We knew there had to be a better way." This is a tedious process that can require solving large electromagnetic equations hundreds of times. The team's new method takes a different path. Instead of demanding a perfectly accurate intermediate solution at every iteration, their algorithm allows quick, imperfect approximations early on and tightens the accuracy only as needed. This shift, which is simple in concept, but powerful in practice, dramatically reduces the number of heavy computations. To make the process even more efficient, the team incorporated several clever tricks: using a compact mathematical representation to shrink the size of the problem, streamlining how updates are computed, and using a modeling approach that remains stable even for complex head shapes. Reconstructions that once took nearly an hour now appear in under 40 seconds. In tests with real experimental data, including cylindrical targets imaged using a microwave scanner from the University of Manitoba, the method consistently delivered high-quality results in seconds instead of minutes. For Kim and Hielscher, who have worked collaboratively for decades on optical and microwave imaging techniques, the speed improvement feels like a long-awaited turning point. "We always knew microwave imaging had the potential to be portable and affordable. Portable microwave devices could one day provide an accessible alternative to mammography in low-resource settings, monitor brain swelling in intensive care units without repeated CT scans, or track tumor responses to therapy by observing subtle changes in tissue composition. The team is now focused on extending the algorithm to full 3D imaging, a step that would bring microwave tomography even closer to practical deployment. "We're taking a technology that has been stuck in the lab for years and giving it the speed it needs to matter clinically," Kim said. Kim, S. H., et al.

Ciaranello, MD, MPH, of the MPEC and Department of Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, “Long-acting antiretroviral therapy for breastfeeding women with HIV experiencing barriers to adherence in Zimbabwe: Modeling clinical impact and cost-effectiveness. Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience? For breastfeeding women who have HIV, consistently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for their own health and the health of their infants. New long-acting (LA) injectable ART options, such as LA cabotegravir with rilpivirine (CAB/RPV), can help women suppress the HIV virus within their bodies - keeping them healthy and reducing transmission to their infants. Instead of daily oral pills, the injection is received every two months, making it easier for women to sustain treatment during the postpartum period and keep their medical diagnoses private. Our study focused on Zimbabwe, a country with high maternal HIV prevalence where LA-CAB/RPV is not yet available outside of research settings. We used microsimulation modeling to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of offering this potentially game-changing therapy to postpartum women. There were two main questions we set out to answer: Q: What methods or approach did you use? We used the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) model to simulate how HIV is passed on and how it progresses. This framework enabled us to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes for a hypothetical group of women and their babies undergoing different treatment strategies - in this case, LA-CAB/RPV versus daily oral ART. For women whose HIV has not been fully suppressed by their daily pills at the time of delivery, switching to LA-CAB/RPV could be cost-saving if priced at $156/year or lower. For women whose HIV has already been suppressed at the time of delivery, but who face challenges in adhering to oral ART, switching to LA-CAB/RPV would offer slightly less value, but could be cost-effective if priced at $84/year or lower. We propose that these formulations should be made available globally at an affordable price to ensure they reach the people who may benefit from them most. Looking ahead, we'll build on this important work by evaluating the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of newer long-acting ART formulations, such as long-acting cabotegravir with lenacapavir, among pregnant and breastfeeding women.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who report high levels of psychosocial stress, such as from caregiving and lack of emotional support, show signs of early heart tissue changes associated with cardiovascular disease – an association not observed in men, a new study reveals. The results support the notion that there are sex-specific ways in which stress affects cardiovascular health and that risk-assessment processes should take psychosocial factors and mental wellness into account, the researchers said. From an epidemiological point of view, we have known for about two decades that stress is an important risk factor in cardiovascular health for people born female. But with this research stream, we're really aiming to understand how stress physiologically impacts the heart." The team, comprising researchers from McGill and Concordia universities, published a paper earlier this year linking early signs of heart inflammation and perceived social status in women. In the current study, the researchers examined MRI heart scans of 219 adult participants (ages 43 to 65), around half of whom were female. In addition to demographic and basic physiological data, they also collected information such as perceived stress, responsibility for caregiving within the household and perceived emotional support. The participants, who were part of the Courtois Cardiovascular Signature Program at McGill University Health Centre, were divided in two groups: individuals presenting at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (for example, diabetes, hypertension or smoking) but without actual heart disease, and healthy control subjects. In both groups, the scans of female participants who reported high psychosocial stress revealed significantly higher values for one of the markers (T1) than did the scans of low-stress female participants. In both cases, no significant difference was observed between high- and low-stress male participants. Though the T1 and T2 values didn't quite pass the clinical thresholds for abnormal values, said Luu, they were still at an elevated level that calls for further investigation. She added that down the road, higher values portend worse prognosis. According to the professor, the sex differences observed are not only a social question, but also a biological question.

Our findings show that many have stepped back from some of those time-consuming therapies thanks to ETI." ETI helps the malfunctioning protein that causes CF work more effectively, allowing the lungs to function better from the inside rather than simply treating symptoms like thick mucus or frequent infections. As more people with CF are being treated with ETI, researchers have been eager to understand whether long-standing respiratory therapies such as inhaled antibiotics and mucus-thinning treatments are still being used at the same level. To explore this question, the team followed more than 600 children and adults after they began ETI. Across all age groups, use of chronic respiratory therapies including hypertonic saline, dornase alfa, inhaled antibiotics and oral azithromycin fell steadily over time. Teens and adults cut their use of these treatments by nearly half and younger children showed similar trends. A key finding was that stopping multiple daily therapies did not appear to lead to loss of lung function or more respiratory symptoms. This was true across age, sex, and baseline lung function. Those who discontinued therapies tended to have higher lung function at the start of ETI and were less likely to be infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common CF-related lung infection. Because the study did not capture individuals' reasons for stopping therapies, Sagel stresses the importance of discussing any changes with a CF clinician. "Seeing people maintain good health while doing fewer respiratory therapies is incredibly encouraging. Sagel emphasized the need for personalized care in those on long-term ETI therapy. "The opportunity to simplify daily treatment is exciting but decisions to stop or continue therapies should be made through shared decision-making with a clinician who understands each person's overall health," said Sagel. Next, researchers will investigate whether some therapies may still be useful when used only during respiratory illnesses and whether mechanical forms of airway clearance remain necessary for people who no longer depend on inhaled mucus-thinning medications. "The goal is to help people with CF and their care teams maintain strong long-term health while easing daily treatment demands," said Sagel.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study from the University of East Anglia is helping scientists better understand how our brains remember past events - and how those memories can change over time.A new paper published today explores episodic memory - the kind of memory we use to recall personal experiences like a birthday party or a holiday.The team say their work has important implications for mental health, education, and legal settings where memory plays a key role.Working collaboratively with the University of Texas in Dallas, the team show that memories aren't just stored like files in a computer.Instead, they're made up of different parts. And while some are active and easy to recall, others stay hidden until something triggers them.Importantly, the review shows that for something to count as a real memory, it must be linked to a real event from the past. But even then, the memory we recall might not be a perfect copy.It can include extra details from our general knowledge, past experiences, or even the situation we're in when we remember it.Memories of older events often go through a process called re-encoding, which means the brain updates or reshapes the memory over time. This creates a chain of connections from the original experience to the version of the memory we can access now.This work helps us understand why our memories aren't always reliable and how they can be influenced by time, context, and even our own imaginations." Prof. Louis Renoult, lead researcher from UEA's School of Psychology The team looked at almost 200 psychology and neuroscience studies about memory representations, as well philosophical papers and recent studies using animal models.Prof Renoult said: "We wanted to suggest a new way of looking at things by combining ideas from different fields. The goal was to make sense of problems that haven't been solved yet and spark fresh research. "These conscious representations of our past are typically a combination of retrieved information of the original experience, generic knowledge about the world and information relevant for the current situation," explained Prof Renoult. "This means that memories can and do change. They might become less accurate or include new information, making them feel different from the original event.A crucial part of our daily lives"Understanding how memories are formed, stored, and reshaped over time is crucial because memory underpins so much of our daily lives - from learning and mental health to decisions made in courtrooms. "By revealing that memories are dynamic rather than fixed, this research helps us better understand why they can change and how that impacts the way we think, feel, and act," he added.
