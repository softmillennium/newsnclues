TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

Lando Norris led the field in both of Friday's practice sessions for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lando Norris continued his strong form in a busy second practice session for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, topping the times ahead of Max Verstappen and George Russell.

After he beat his Red Bull rival to first place in FP1 by just 0.008s, Norris extended his advantage in FP2 to 0.363s. This session has the most similar conditions to the upcoming Qualifying hour, putting the Standings leader in a good position to chase down another podium position.

Elsewhere, Ollie Bearman took an impressive P4 for Haas and remarked over the radio: "I don't know how it's so good." Just behind him in fifth and sixth were the Kick Sauber pair, with Nico Hulkenberg leading the charge in the team's final weekend before they adopt the Audi name in 2026.

Oscar Piastri, after sitting out of FP1 for Pato O'Ward, struggled to put a lap together that was good enough for the top 10 – he locked up on his flying lap to end up in P11, just under seven tenths off his team mate's pace.

There was plenty of traffic throughout FP2 as many fought to get the most out of the soft tyres before switching focus to their long-run pace on harder compounds, leaving the order predominantly unchanged in the final quarter of the session.

TECH TALK – Farewell to Sauber    

Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi

Roman Stanek clinched pole position as the final F2 weekend of the year at the Yas Marina Circuit got underway.

Roman Stanek was in flying form at the Yas Marina Circuit, putting in a fine performance to beat Jak Crawford and Invicta Racing team mate Leonardo Fornaroli to pole position.

The Czech driver's 1m 36.836s was good enough to beat Crawford, who was fresh from his FP1 outing with Aston Martin, by just 0.087s.

2025 Champion, and recently announced member of the McLaren Driver Development Programme, Fornaroli had looked on course to beat Stanek on his final lap, but lost time in the last two sectors, before settling for third.

Hitech TGR driver, and Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy prospect, Dino Beganovic was fourth, ahead of PREMA Racing's Sebastian Montoya.

MP Motorsport's Oliver Goethe recovered from losing his fastest time for exceeding track limits, to go up to sixth late on, ahead of ART Grand Prix driver Victor Martins.

AIX Racing's Joshua Duerksen wound up in eighth, in front of the Campos Racing pairing of Nikola Tsolov and Arvid Lindblad, who rounded out the top 10.

This means the 2026 Racing Bulls driver, Lindblad, is set to line up on reverse grid pole in his final Formula 2 Sprint Race, with lights out scheduled for 1615 local time on Saturday afternoon.

Before that gets underway, you can read a full report on the FIA Formula 2 website here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi George Russell ended Friday's running eager to help Mercedes find improvements overnight, despite finishing in the top three in FP2. George Russell has admitted that Mercedes have work to do if they want to fight towards the front in Abu Dhabi after a highly competitive day of practice left him anticipating “surprises” in the field. As the sun set and temperatures dropped at the Yas Marina Circuit, Russell improved from sixth to third between FP1 and FP2, albeit ending up 0.379s away from Lando Norris' pace-setting lap in the later session. Ollie Bearman was an impressive fourth for Haas, just 0.039s slower than Russell's best lap, and the Kick Sauber pair of Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were within hundredths of the 20-year-old's time in P5 and P6. The results have left Russell keen to extract more pace as he explained: “It was definitely feeling better this evening. It always tends to feel a bit nicer when you're driving in the dark and the track is a bit cooler. “I think it's going to be tight in Qualifying, probably between ourselves, Red Bull and Ferrari. There are some other teams who were a bit unexpected as well – Bearman was right up there, and Hulkenberg as well, so we may have some surprises. "The race pace wasn't great in all honesty. “It's not easy when you've got that C5 tyre – there's a lot of grip. In FP2, he dropped to P10 as the McLaren driver's advantage opened up, leaving Antonelli 0.667s adrift, but less than three tenths behind Russell. “We started the day pretty well,” he summarised. “I think FP2 didn't really show the pace. The last lap on softs was looking pretty strong, but then I made a mistake in the last corner and lost a lot of time. Of course, McLaren look a step ahead of everyone but the gaps are very, very close and every little mistake can really punish you.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris has 'nothing to smile about just yet' despite topping FP1 and FP2 in Abu Dhabi The 2025 Formula 1 season reaches its conclusion this weekend in exciting style, with three drivers still in contention to clinch the World Championship – but what do the odds say about who might come out on top in Abu Dhabi? Odds are provided by F1's Official Betting Data Supplier ALT Sports Data, are subject to change and are presented in decimal form: for every $1 wagered you would win the figure represented by the odds; so, if Verstappen is favourite at 1.50, you would win $1.50 for every dollar bet. Lando Norris arrives as the championship leader at the Yas Marina Circuit; however, he struggled in the previous two rounds amid a disqualification in Las Vegas and fourth place in Qatar. Team mate Oscar Piastri, meanwhile, produced his best weekend since Monza last time out. The Australian starts with seven victories in his portfolio this term. He was 104 points adrift of the leader before Monza, but starts this weekend in second place, only 12 points away from Norris. Verstappen is the in-form driver on the grid, boasting nine consecutive podiums between Zandvoort and Lusail with five of those results being victories. Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli continues his impressive run at the backend of the campaign, producing two podiums in three races. He held onto fourth spot until the 56th lap in Qatar, when an error nudged him off track, giving Norris a gap to pass him. The Italian is showing that he can consistently deliver, and offers value for money for a top-three performance. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc also can't be written off at this venue, having stood on the rostrum in his last three visits to the UAE Capital. He's also remarkably consistent, averaging 4.0 in his past 10 appearances. One driver who has also found his rhythm is Carlos Sainz. Alex Albon also remains a contender for a top six, despite last achieving the feat in the Netherlands. He's collected five top-six results across the campaign, better than any of his midfield rivals. Double World Champion Fernando Alonso crossed the line in seventh in the last round, his fourth such result this year. Red Bull number two Yuki Tsunoda starts the weekend ahead of Albon and Alonso in the betting, but he's only cracked the top six once this year and is a better option for a top 10 outing in the final round. Over in the Racing Bulls pen, Isack Hadjar is worth a look, after finishing as one of the first six cars three times this year. From youth to experience, Nico Hulkenberg was unlucky in Qatar, just clipping Pierre Gasly and crashing out. Speaking of Gasly, the Alpine senior drove well all weekend and showed immense promise until the contact with Hulkenberg. He's registered five top-10s this year, but only one in the previous 10 races. Another rookie who has excelled late in the year is Haas' Ollie Bearman, but Qatar didn't go according to plan. He eventually retired from the race, leaving Doha point-less. Bearman's team mate Esteban Ocon struggled at Lusail, but he's been reliable of late, posting a 50% top-10 return in four starts. Verstappen and Piastri desperately need a win if they have a shot of leapfrogging Norris for the title. Norris clocked the fastest time on Saturday last year at this venue and proceeded to win the race, and the papaya driver is tied with Verstappen on seven Pirelli Pole Position awards this year. Elsewhere, Russell has proudly captured two poles this year, but both of them were on street circuits or at the minimum hybrid layouts. Mercedes contributed one to the cause, through Russell in Singapore, but other than that, it's been all Red Bull. The Milton-Keynes garage has taken home five team trophies in the last eight races, all thanks to Verstappen. They are also seeking to end their campaign on a hat-trick. Ferrari have faced a challenging season this year, but we can't ignore their history at this venue, as the squad from Maranello have delivered a podium-performing vehicle since 2021 in Abu Dhabi. Can they finally come right and grab the chequered flag? If Verstappen wants a fifth title, he'll need to seal victory in Abu Dhabi and hope Norris finishes outside of the top three. Norris' team mate, Piastri, has more ground to make up. Prices are correct at the time of publication but can fluctuate.
