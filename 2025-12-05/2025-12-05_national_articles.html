                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syrian refugee Hayat Fatah, 65, cleans dishes at her home in Irbil, Iraq, Nov. 16, 2025. When President Donald Trump suspended the refugee program on day one of his current administration, thousands of people around the world who had been so close to a new life in America found themselves abandoned. Many had already sold possessions or ended leases in preparation for travel. They had submitted reams of documents supporting their cases, been interviewed by U.S. officials and in many cases already had tickets to fly to America. As part of Trump's crackdown on both legal and illegal migration, the Republican president has upended the decades-old refugee program that has served as a beacon for those fleeing war and persecution. In October, he resumed the program but set a historic low of refugee admissions at just 7,500 — mostly white South Africans. A litany of new restrictions was announced after an Afghan national became the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members last week. Trump's administration has cited economic and national security concerns for its policy changes. Dozens of white South Africans have been let in this year. “It's important that we don't abandon those families and that we don't abandon the thousands of people who were relying on the promise of coming here as refugees,” said Akay Alp, with the International Refugee Assistance Project. The Associated Press spoke to three families whose lives have been thrown into disarray because of the changing policies. Syrian refugee Mohammed Dawood, 30, left, poses for a photo with his parents, Hayat Fatah, 65, center, and Abdulilah Amin Dawoud, 73, at their home in Irbil, Iraq, Nov. 16, 2025. They hoped to find a home that could provide better medical care for a daughter who had fallen from the fourth floor of the family's apartment building. After they were accepted as refugees to the U.S., son Ibrahim and his sister Ava relocated to New Haven, Connecticut, in November 2024. But just two days before they were to board their flight, mother Hayat Fatah fainted at a medical check and her departure was postponed. Mohammed, another sibling, didn't want to leave his parents behind. But I had to stay with my father and mother,” Mohammed said. Nearly a year later, he and his parents are still waiting. The family gets by on money sent from relatives abroad. “Whether it was now, a year from now, two years later or four years, I will wait and hope that I will go,” he said. In America, Ibrahim often wakes up early to tutor people online before going to his job as a math teacher at a private school, and then he takes care of his sister when he gets home. He said his mother often cries when they talk because she wishes she were in America to help care for her daughter. Lu Taizhi, a Chinese Christian who is waiting to be resettled in the United States, points to the webpage of the International Rescue Committee, which is under maintenance and not operational in Ban Wawee village, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, Nov. 27, 2025. Chinese Christian Lu Taizhi fled to Thailand more than a decade ago, fearing persecution for his beliefs. Many are fake refugees, or illegal immigrants, they've never faced oppression. Lu comes from a long lineage of dissent: He was born into a family branded as “hostile elements” by the Chinese Communist Party for its land ownership and ties to a competing political party. A teacher and poet, Lu grew interested in history banned by the Chinese state, penning tributes to the bloody 1989 Tiananmen crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing. Lu Taizhi a Chinese Christian who is waiting to be resettled in the United States, teaches a math class at a Chinese school in Ban Wawee village, Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, Nov. 27, 2025. In 2004, Lu was arrested after police found poems and essays he secretly published criticizing Chinese politics and the education system. After his release, Lu became a Christian and began preaching, drawing scrutiny from local authorities. Year after year, officers knocked on his door, warning him not to organize protests or publish commentary criticizing the Party. With Chinese leader Xi Jinping's rise to power, controls tightened. When Beijing arrested hundreds of rights lawyers in 2015, Lu took his family and fled, worried police would come for him. After traveling across Southeast Asia, Lu and his family settled in Thailand, where they applied for refugee status with the United Nations. But their first flight, in April 2024, was postponed because Lu's sons' passports had expired. A second, scheduled for Jan. 22, 2025, was canceled without explanation, and the most recent one, scheduled for Feb. 26, was canceled shortly after Trump's inauguration. His application has been put on hold indefinitely, Lu said. “I am very supportive of all of Trump's policies because I think only President Trump can dismantle the CCP,” Lu said, using an acronym referring to the Chinese Communist Party.

(AP Photo/Jon Cherry) But that dream faded a few months later with Trump's return to the presidency. Louis, who insisted on being identified only by his first name out of concern that speaking publicly could complicate his case, was told in January that a request he had made to bring his family to the U.S. had been frozen due to changes in refugee policies. Now, the family members live thousands of miles apart without knowing when they will be reunited. “I don't want to lose her, and she does not want to lose me,” said Louis, who resettled in Kentucky with the help of the International Rescue Committee. “The hope that I had went slowly down. I thought that we would never meet again,” he said referring to the moment when he received the notice. Louis and Apolina's families applied for refugee status after fleeing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Louis, a Congolese refugee, sits for an anonymous portrait at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) office, Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025, in Louisville, Ky. (AP Photo/Jon Cherry) Apolina thought that, as the wife of a refugee, it would take her no more than one year to reunite with her husband, who now works in an appliance factory and has already applied for permanent residency. The younger one, who was 7 months old when Louis left, cries every time he sees his father in a video call. The older one keeps asking where Louis is and when he will see him. Apolina fears that as time drags on, the children will forget their father.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE — Audrey Strauss, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, speaks during a news conference to announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell for her alleged role in the sexual exploitation and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein, July 2, 2020, in New York. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A federal judge on Friday gave the Justice Department permission to release transcripts of a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of underage girls in Florida — a case that ultimately ended without any federal charges being filed against the millionaire sex offender. U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith said a recently passed federal law ordering the release of records related to the cases overrode a federal rule prohibiting the release of matters before a grand jury. The law signed last month by President Donald Trump compels the Justice Department, FBI and federal prosecutors to release later this month the vast troves of material they have amassed during investigations into Epstein. When the documents will be released is unknown. The Justice Department hasn't set a timetable for when it plans to start releasing information, but the law set a deadline of Dec. 19. However, the law also allows the Justice Department to withhold files that it says could jeopardize an active federal investigation. Files can also be withheld if they're found to be classified or if they pertain to national defense or foreign policy. Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. The Justice Department had requested the unsealing of documents from three Epstein-related separate cases: the 2006-2007 Florida grand jury investigation into Epstein, his 2019 sex trafficking case in New York and Ghislaine Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking case, also in New York. The Florida request was approved Friday. The New York requests are pending, with the Justice Department facing a Monday deadline to make its final filing — a response to submissions by victims, Epstein's estate and Maxwell's lawyers. The judges in those matters have said they plan to rule expeditiously.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• A spectacle in Washington: President Donald Trump was awarded the newly created FIFA Peace Prize during an opening ceremony that featured celebrity hosts, musical performances and plenty of fanfare in the US capital. The United States knows two of its three opponents in Group D — and neither is considered a powerhouse. Mauricio Pochettino's USA squad will face Australia, which is ranked No. Los Guaraníes advanced to the World Cup quarterfinals in 2010. Now that we know which teams will play each other in the group stage, attention turns to when and where they will face each other. Fans will have to wait until tomorrow, though, when FIFA will confirm the kickoffs times and host stadiums for the all games. The full match schedule will be revealed during a live broadcast from Washington, DC which starts at 12 p.m. The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw ended on a familiar note for events in Washington, DC: “YMCA.” The Village People came out and sang their hit “YMCA.” President Donald Trump, who often dances to the song at his events, is in attendance. Here's the final group list for fans to revel in or stress about. Group B: Canada, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs A, Qatar, Switzerland Group D: USA, Paraguay, Australia, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs C Group F: Netherlands, Japan, whichever team claims the spot from European Playoffs B, Tunisia Group I: France, Senegal, whichever team claims the spot from FIFA Playoffs Tournament 2, Norway Group K: Portugal, the winner of FIFA Playoffs Tournament 1, Colombia, Uzbekistan World Cup draws aren't just an exciting look to the future, they can also be incredibly nostalgic. My father jumped from the sofa, shouted, “Goal,” clapped twice and turned up the TV so we could hear better. Scotland hasn't played in the World Cup since then. The Tartan Army can only hope, but it's so good to be back. Curaçao made history as the smallest nation by population to ever qualify for a World Cup and it's got an amazing game to start: European juggernaut Germany. Both have been drawn into Group E, alongside Ivory Coast and Ecuador. Those inside the Curaçao camp wanted to play a big team on its debut and it's certainly got its wish. It means we will see two of the best strikers on the planet go head-to-head, with France's Kylian Mbappé coming up against Norway's Erling Haaland. Baseball's Aaron Judge, the New York Yankees' MVP, drew teams from Pot 3 into groups. They will play on June 11 in Mexico City to kick off the race for the ultimate prize in international soccer. All the Pot 2 teams have now been drawn out, and this is where we stand: South Korea will go into Group A, joining Mexico there. Meanwhile, Switzerland will go into Group B, joining Canada. Morocco will join Brazil in Group C, which should be a good match to watch. No team is likely looking forward to a potential matchup with Norway, which is through to its first FIFA World Cup since the France 1998 tournament. One of the main reasons for that is Manchester City goal machine Erling Haaland. Haaland was born in England and could have theoretically represented the Three Lions. He plundered a staggering 16 goals in eight qualifying matches. Haaland is in red-hot form right now, having just become the quickest player to reach 100 Premier League goals in just 111 matches. So keep an eye on the Norwegians in Pot 3. So far, he's netted 55 times for his country in just 48 matches. At the age of just 25, there are surely many more to come. Spain, the reigning European champion and current world number one, has been drawn into Group H. Meantime, Cristiano Ronaldo will look to guide his team to victory in his last chance at the trophy for Portugal. First ball out of the official draw and it's already a team many will want to avoid. Brazil maintains its record of qualifying for every World Cup competition to date and will be a tough team to beat next year. That was followed by another musical performance, more comments from the ceremony hosts, and a couple video features. But now we're witnessing the real McCoy, and a group of sports icons has taken the stage to begin the draw: hockey's Wayne Gretzky, American football's Tom Brady, basketball's Shaquille O'Neal and baseball's Aaron Judge. Remember: We already knew which groups Mexico, Canada and the United States would be in, but now, the rest of the world — minus six countries that will be decided in a playoff in March — will find out who they play. Her debut solo album, ‘The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” was released in August 1998 and won five Grammys, including album of the year and best new artist for Hill. Robbie Williams and Nicole Scherzinger sang “Desire,” according to FIFA, and Andrea Bocelli performed a rendiiton of “Nessun Dorma” from the opera Turandot. On top of it all, the event is being hosted by stars Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart. All eyes are currently on the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington DC for the World Cup group-stage draw, a process which will decide who plays who at next year's tournament. The 48 countries (only 42 have been confirmed, but we'll get to that bit later) have been split into four equal pots, depending on their world ranking – or status as co-hosts. In this draw, a team from each pot will be randomly selected into one of the 12 groups, until each group has four teams in it. First, we already know where each of the three co-host nations will go. That's due to where the matches will be played across North America. Also, no team from the same confederation can be drawn in the same group, excluding teams from Europe – a maximum of two UEFA nations can be drawn into the same group. It doesn't feel right to say Brazil has been flying under the radar in the run-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but by their lofty standards — to some degree at least — they have been. CNN Sports' Andy Scholes has been busy asking fans about what they're hoping for during this World Cup draw.</p>

Club for Growth president David McIntosh says deep-pocketed conservative political group ‘will be there to back up' President Donald Trump's push for red states to redraw congressional maps to create more GOP-leaning districts. The Republican-controlled Indiana House on Friday pushed through congressional redistricting championed by President Donald Trump. The new map, drawn by a national Republican-aligned group, would create two more right-leaning congressional districts in the solidly red Midwestern state, where the GOP currently controls 7 of Indiana's 9 U.S. House seats. The vote — coming less than 24 hours after the Supreme Court cleared the way for GOP-dominated Texas to use its newly redrawn map, which creates five more right-leaning House seats — marks the latest front in Trump's aggressive national campaign to reshape congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will defend their razor-thin House majority. The GOP-controlled Indiana House, meeting in the Statehouse — seen in a file photo from 2017 — on Friday passed along party lines a congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump. In debate ahead of the vote, state Rep. Matt Pierce, who is the Assistant Democratic Floor Leader, pointed to his Republican colleagues and argued "you really want to erase the Democratic Party when it comes to Congress." And Pierce claimed that Trump, by pushing redistricting through red states across the country, is basically saying "I need to cheat to win." But GOP state Rep. Ben Smaltz defended the new map from accusations of racial gerrymandering. Smaltz, making a final pitch for his bill just ahead of the vote, emphasized that "nothing in the law prevents the legislature from revisiting maps when circumstances demand it. The Supreme Court could not be clearer – states may redraw districts whenever they deem appropriate, provided constitutional and statutory requirements are met." Despite pressure from Trump and his political team, Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray has repeatedly said there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting. President Donald Trump, seen pointing as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Sept. 11, 2025, is targeting Indiana Republican lawmakers who are not supportive of the president's congressional redistricting push. Trump, in response, repeatedly threatened to back primary challenges against state Republican lawmakers who didn't support his congressional redistricting push. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity," Trump warned in a recent social media post. Bray, in announcing that the state Senate would reconvene to take action on redistricting, said "the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state." Trump has been twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting. Trump has also taken some jabs at Republican Gov. While Trump has called Braun "a good man," he has warned he "must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't." Mike Braun, seen speaking during a press conference on Oct. 30, 2025, supports President Donald Trump's push for congressional redistricting. But Braun, pointing to the president, has touted that he is "committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress." Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned conservative outside group the Club for Growth Action, has dished out big bucks to run ads in Indiana supporting redistricting, and along with Turning Point Action, will target Republican state lawmakers opposed to the new map. Trump, by championing rare but not unheard of mid-decade redistricting, is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. State lawmakers in GOP-dominated Florida this week took the first steps towards passing a redistricting measure, and right-leaning Kansas is also mulling redrawing their map. Two federal judges in Texas last month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state couldn't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. But the Supreme Court on Thursday gave a big thumbs up to the Lone Star State's new congressional map. Gavin Newsom speaks during an election night press conference at a California Democratic Party office Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Sacramento, Calif. (Godofredo A. Vásquez/AP Photo) That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting. And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The 'Fox & Friends' hosts discuss more red states joining President Trump's push to 'Make America Healthy Again' by banning the use of food assistance programs for sugary drinks and junk food. Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, grocery, pharmacy, liquor and convenience stores in California will not be able to provide any single-use thin plastic bags or even "reusable" plastic film bags. The updated law stems from Senate Bill 270, which was first introduced in 2014. Senate Bill 1053 now "eliminates the distribution of thicker film plastic bags." Recycled paper bags may be offered to shoppers in the Golden State, but they must be "sold for not less than 10 cents." People on specific food programs may be available to get these for free. California is banning all plastic bags at its grocery stores starting in 2026. The bill's text says the bags must "contain a minimum of 50% post-consumer recycled materials" to be counted as a paper bag beginning Jan. 1, 2028. The legislation hopes to "support sustainable and thriving communities and natural environments that are not littered with plastic waste." In 2022, California Attorney General Rob Bonta launched an investigation into plastic carry-out bags that claimed to be recyclable. Officials investigated seven manufacturers to see if the bags were actually accepted and processed by recycling facilities in California. A statewide survey of 69 recycling and processing facilities showed that only two claimed to accept plastic carry-out bags, but it could not be confirmed if they were actually recyclable, according to the AG's press release. Senate Bill 1053 now "eliminates the distribution of thicker film plastic bags." Nate Rose of the California Grocers Association told SF Gate the change will not have a very big impact on shoppers or stores. "We don't expect a lot of hiccups for either grocers or shoppers," Rose said. Ashley J. DiMella is a lifestyle reporter with Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A visitor walks past portraits of DC Comics superheroes as she enters the “Action and Magic Made Here” interactive experience at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood media preview on June 24, 2021, in Burbank, Calif. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello, File) NEW YORK (AP) — Netflix struck a deal Friday to buy Warner Bros. “By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.” The cash and stock deal is valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt. Not included in the deal are networks such as CNN and Discovery. The proposed merger could draw intense antitrust scrutiny, particularly for its effect on streaming subscriptions. Now combined with HBO Max, it will absolutely cement itself as the Goliath in the streaming industry,” said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester, a market research company. One of the big unanswered questions, Proulx added, is whether HBO Max and Netflix would “stay as separate streaming services or combine into a mega streaming service.” But either way, he said, customers could see some price relief in the form of a single subscription bill or bundle promotions, which would be a welcome change as streaming prices continue to rise and consumers feel the pinch of paying for multiple services. Of course, that all depends on whether the deal goes through. Netflix on Friday maintained that the addition of HBO and HBO Max programming will give its members “even more high-quality titles from which to choose” and “optimize its plans for consumers.” Others warned that a Netflix-Warner combo could create an even bigger entertainment titan with ramifications for both consumers and people working across the film and TV industry. Gaining Warner's legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix, particularly its presence in theaters. But there have been exceptions, including qualifying runs for its awards contenders, including this year's “Frankenstein,” limited theater screenings of a “KPop Demon Hunters” sing-a-long and its coming “Stranger Things” series finale. Though the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales, “KPop Demon Hunters” unofficially topped the box office in late August taking in nearly $20 million. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix said in a statement, adding that merging with Warner will “give audiences more of what they love.” Critics say a Netflix-Warner combo would be bad news for people who love to go to movie theaters and for those who work in them. Netflix had previously avoided venturing into other parts of the legacy entertainment landscape. Friday's announcement arrived after a monthslong bidding war for Warner Bros. Skydance-owned Paramount, which completed its own $8 billion merger in August, also reportedly made several all-cash offers. Paramount seemed like the front-runner for some time — and unlike Netflix or Comcast, was reportedly vying to buy Warner's entire company, including its cable business housing CNN and Discovery. Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday from The Associated Press. While Netflix's bid won over Warner's approval, experts stressed that a bumpy regulatory road lies ahead. “No doubt politics are going to come into play,” Proulx said. Warner announced its intention to split its streaming and studio operations from its cable business back in June, outlining plans for HBO, HBO Max, as well as Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group and DC Studios, to become part of a new streaming and studios company. Meanwhile, networks such as CNN, Discovery and TNT Sports and digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report would make up a separate cable counterpart called “Discovery Global.” Discovery Global is set to become a new publicly traded company, in a process now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? America's vaccine playbook is being rewritten by people who don't believe in them. The federal government is ending its recommendation that every infant receive a hepatitis B vaccination at birth, the most substantive change to the childhood immunization schedule yet under US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. If the new guidelines are adopted by the CDC, as expected, most parents will be left to decide on their own in consultation with their doctor. (Mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose hep B status is unknown will still be advised to give their baby the shot at birth.) The new recommendations will suggest, however, that if your child does not receive the birth dose, you should wait until they are at least two months old before giving it to them. At least two members of the committee — Dr. Joseph Hibbeln and Dr. Cody Meissener — argued that there was no scientific basis for the two-month recommendation and that no data had been presented to justify it. “It's unconscionable,” Hibblen said Friday shortly before the final vote. Nevertheless, the change was approved as part of a 8-3 vote. The changes are in keeping with Kennedy's track record so far on vaccines, seeking to cast doubt on their value and remove official recommendations for them, leaving decisions instead to individual patients. But the hepatitis B vaccine is a different case. It has been universally recommended since 1982, and more than 70 percent of newborns have received it within their first three days of life in the US in recent years. Before the 1980s, there were about 300,000 new cases of hepatitis B every year. During this week's meeting, the new vaccine committee — whose membership had been completely overhauled by Kennedy Jr. in June to better reflect his own vaccine skepticism — challenged the long-held consensus that every newborn should receive their first dose within days of being born. “They were picking data, whatever it is that supports their argument.” Meissner pressed the presenters on whether there was any confirmed case of somebody who was otherwise healthy and received the recommended hep B birth dose but later developed an infection. CDC staff later said they were not aware of any such case. Likewise, the presentation on safety risk was largely limited to appealing to an absence of evidence, arguing that the available data was simply too limited. I wouldn't want to speculate on safety or harm.” This shift in policy represents the victory of anti-public health vibes. Over and over again in this week's meetings, the committee members who wanted to make a change to hep B vaccine guidance acknowledged the limited evidence to justify their decision but argued that, because so many Americans no longer trust public health experts, they had to do something. “I've also been a critic of the CDC for many years,” Blaxill said, “so it's been an honor and a privilege to work on the inside.” Many of Kennedy's vaccine committee members were specifically selected because they shared fringe views on vaccines that aligned more with Kennedy's, who has long pushed the debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, as well as other health problems. While the Trump administration claims to believe in “gold-standard science,” its vaccine experts are clearly willing to skirt the science if it fits their agenda. More than once during this week's meetings, committee members and federal health officials — even some of those who were supportive of the changes — acknowledged a lack of data-based justification for the two-month timeline for the first shot or a new recommendation approved by the committee that parents may administer antibody tests to check their child's immunity before administering later doses. Many Republicans were already dubious about the government's health guidance, and now Democrats are losing faith, too. If vaccination rates drop far enough, more people may get sick. One doctor who spoke during the public comment period at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting urged panel members to consider the possibility that even a single child could get infected hepatitis B because of this change. As vaccination rates slide, there are still ways you can protect yourself from cold, flu, RSV, and Covid this year. Yes, there is a downside to GLP-1 drugs — if you aren't careful. Supporting groups that work on malaria, lead poisoning, and other health issues can make a big difference with just a little money.</p>

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Supreme Court reinstated a Texas gerrymander that is expected to give Republicans five additional seats in the US House on Thursday evening, after a lower federal court struck that gerrymander down. And it is likely to have brutal implications for all future federal lawsuits challenging gerrymandered maps. Though the Court's order in LULAC is brief, it imposes such heavy burdens on gerrymandering plaintiffs that few, if any, such plaintiffs will be able to succeed in future cases. Indeed, LULAC is so hostile to anti-gerrymandering suits that many civil rights lawyers and plaintiffs may simply decide not to bother challenging illegal maps, because their chances of prevailing in court will be so hopeless. As a practical matter, the line between racial and partisan gerrymanders is often thin. So a map that seeks to maximize Republican power will often closely resemble a map that seeks to minimize Black representation. Prior to LULAC, however, it mattered a great deal whether courts determined that a particular map was drawn for partisan or racial reasons. In Rucho v. Common Cause (2019), the Supreme Court's Republican majority held that federal courts may not hear challenges to partisan gerrymanders. So, if a court determined that a disputed map was drawn entirely for partisan reasons, the map would be upheld. The Court has also taken several steps to undercut plaintiffs challenging racial gerrymanders, and it is expected to eliminate the Voting Rights Act's safeguards against these gerrymanders later in its current term. But, prior to LULAC, there was still one set of circumstances when a plaintiff challenging a racial gerrymander could prevail. As the Court held in Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP (2024), “if a legislature gives race a predominant role in redistricting decisions, the resulting map is subjected” to the most skeptical level of constitutional scrutiny. This matters because, before Texas enacted the gerrymander at the heart of the LULAC case, President Donald Trump's Justice Department sent a letter to Texas that essentially ordered it to redraw its maps to change their racial makeup. The DOJ claimed, falsely, that it is illegal for a state to draw any map that includes a district where white people are in the minority, and two other racial groups combine to make up the majority. And it threatened to sue Texas unless the state eliminated districts that fit this description. As the lower court that struck down the maps explained in its opinion, there is considerable evidence that Texas decided to draw its new gerrymandered maps in order to comply with this letter. The Supreme Court's order in LULAC doesn't explicitly contest this conclusion. The first is that the Court's Republican majority has said, in Abbott v. Perez (2018) and some later decisions, that state legislatures enjoy a presumption of racial innocence when they draw legislative districts. The second is that, in LULAC, there was in fact considerable evidence supporting both the plaintiffs' claim that Texas drew its lines for racial reasons, and Texas's claim that it drew them for partisan reasons. But LULAC seems to conclude that, when there is evidence on either side, courts must construe that evidence in favor of the state and uphold the challenged map. It may still be possible for civil rights plaintiffs to challenge racial gerrymanders when the evidence of racial bias is simply overwhelming, but cases like that are exceedingly rare. LULAC's strong presumption against anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs, moreover, will likely make it nearly impossible to challenge maps that target Black voters. Because nearly any map that seeks to diminish Black representation will closely resemble a map drawn for partisan purposes, there will almost always be some evidence that an anti-Black racial gerrymander was drawn solely to achieve partisan ends. The LULAC majority also faults the plaintiffs in this case for not producing “a viable alternative map that met the State's avowedly partisan goals.” This line imposes a rigid rule that anyone challenging an alleged racial gerrymander must produce a map that is just as partisan as the one drawn by the state, but that does not divide voters based on race. The Court did previously say, in Alexander, that a plaintiff's failure to submit such a map “may be dispositive in many, if not most, cases where the plaintiff lacks direct evidence or some extraordinarily powerful circumstantial evidence” that a state drew its lines for racial reasons. But the lower court in LULAC found considerable direct evidence that Texas drew its lines to comply with the DOJ's demand for a racial gerrymander. LULAC, by contrast, says that any plaintiff's failure to produce an alternative map is a “near-dispositive” reason for them to lose their case. The upshot of this new, “near-dispositive” requirement is that racial gerrymanders will only be vulnerable when it is possible to draw an equally partisan map with fewer racial implications. If the only way for Texas to maximize Republican voting power is to crack up Black and Latino communities, LULAC establishes that Texas may nearly always do so. In any event, it is fair to describe the LULAC decision as merely an incremental step towards full lawsuit immunity for states that draw gerrymandered maps. The Court, in cases like Rucho, Perez, and Alexander, already made it very difficult to challenge a gerrymander of any kind. LULAC merely adds new burdens to already beleaguered plaintiffs. But the cumulative effect of these burdens is likely to prove overwhelming for nearly all litigants who oppose racial or partisan gerrymanders. The Court's Republican majority appears to be washing its hands of responsibility for gerrymandering altogether. Trump is using a tragedy to stop immigration applications from 19 countries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Rep. Cory Mills‘s (R-FL) closest friends in Congress is distancing himself from the congressman amid several allegations. Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), a candidate for Florida governor, called the accusations against Mills “very troubling” and questioned whether he could clear his name. I hope he gets his stuff worked out and cleaned up, but it has to go through ethics. And he has to, you know, basically, do that hard work to clear his name, if it can be cleared,” he told NOTUS on Thursday. Donalds voted to refer the matter to the Ethics Committee while Reps. Kat Cammack (R-FL) and Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) voted against referring, joining Democrats. Donalds dismissed a reporter's question on Thursday about whether he ever considered Mills as a candidate to be his understudy in the Florida governor's race. “That was an offhand comment from almost two years ago. The Ethics Committee will pore over Mills's conduct and make a decision on whether to recommend consequences against him, which could include expulsion from the House. Former Republican New York Rep. George Santos was expelled from the House in 2023 after the Ethics Committee released a report concluding he “cannot be trusted.” Mills could dodge the consequences of an Ethics Committee report if he chooses not to run for reelection next year. Luna has openly said Mills should not seek another term in Congress. “House leadership exchanged the vote to protect a Republican that's having a lot of issues and should NOT seek re-election,” she posted on X, referencing censure attempts that have fallen flat because of alleged attempts to protect Mills from the same fate. He's running against right-wing investor James Fishback and former Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, among others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House quietly released President Donald Trump's new national security strategy late Thursday, a 33-page document that elevates his “America First” doctrine and sets out the administration's realignment of US foreign policy, from shifting military resources in the Western Hemisphere to taking an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe. It comes as the administration has pursued a deadly campaign against alleged drug boats in international waters, so far, destroying at least 23 boats and killing 87 people. The strategy's section on Europe represents a more dramatic escalation, warning that European nations face “economic decline” that could be “eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.” The document goes on to argue that “over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European,” raising what it calls “an open question” about whether those countries would continue to view their alliance with the United States in the same way. The administration's strategy also asserts that the “Ukraine War has had the perverse effect of increasing Europe's, especially Germany's, external dependencies” and claims “a large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.” The strategy blames European officials for blocking US-backed efforts to end the conflict and states that an end to “hostilities” is needed to stabilize European economies, prevent war, and reestablish stability with Russia: “It is a core interest of the United States to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine, in order to stabilize European economies, prevent unintended escalation or expansion of the war, and reestablish strategic stability with Russia, as well as to enable the post-hostilities reconstruction of Ukraine to enable its survival as a viable state.” “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less. In a speech in Munich, Germany, in February, Vice President JD Vance told European leaders that the biggest threat to their security was “from within,” rather than from China or Russia. “What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values,” Vance told a stone-faced audience at the Munich Security Conference. The Trump administration's strategy also outlines a dual-track approach to China, pushing to contain Beijing's global influence while preserving economic ties and maintaining the current conditions on Taiwan, saying that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.” It also calls for “maintaining a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship” with China by prioritizing “reciprocity and fairness” and reducing US dependence on the country. The strategy describes alliances as instrumental rather than intrinsic, labeling them “a broad network of alliances, with treaty allies and partners in the world's most strategically important regions,” deployed as tools within a broader framework grounded in Trump's affinity to break with traditional norms. “President Trump uses unconventional diplomacy, America's military might, and economic leverage to surgically extinguish embers of division between nuclear-capable nations and violent wars caused by centuries-long hatred,” it says.</p>

Fox News' Eric Shawn provides details on the third reported radio outage and the continuing flight delays and cancelations at Newark Airport. Now, as Americans prepare to travel across the nation for the Christmas and holiday season, a new study is pinpointing the airport that ranks as "most stressful" of all. The study, conducted by Australian travel insurance company iSelect, analyzed 50 major airports around the globe by looking at average departure delays, canceled flights, security checks, baggage claim issues and more. Coming in first place: Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, which scored an 18.46 out of a possible 100 — making it the "most stressful," according to the study. Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey was ranked as the "most stressful" airport in the world even as it's in the midst of major upgrades and redevelopment. It was also reported to have an average departure delay time of 21.40 minutes. It scored as the third worst in baggage retrieval. "The new system will meet an increasing number of travelers and deliver the airport experience they deserve." In October, construction on a new AirTrain Newark system began — a new $3.5 billion system, the airport says on its website, to replace the existing AirTrain, "which opened in 1996 and has become outdated, over capacity and unable to accommodate Newark Liberty's rapid growth." "Newark Airport is the front door to our region — and modernizing the AirTrain system is part of our commitment to reimagining a world-class airport that is worthy of our state," said New Jersey Gov. The study ranked 50 major airports around the world based on departure delays, canceled flights, location, security checks, baggage claim issues and more. Fox News Digital reached out to the airport for comment. Security check wait times came in at 69%. Coming in fourth and fifth, respectively, on the "most stressful" list: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City and Chicago O'Hare International. After Newark Liberty, Humberto Delgado Airport in Lisbon and Manchester Airport in the U.K. ranked second and third on a high-stress list. Newark Airport was also called out in J.D. Power's annual airport satisfaction survey, which ranked "mega" U.S. airports. The survey looked at ease of travel, airport trust, terminal facilities, airport staff, food and retail options, plus the experience of arriving and departing at airports. Newark came in last place, reflecting a year of ground delays and flight cancellations. Fox News Digital reached out to iSelect for further comment on the study. On its website, the company said its "comprehensive list" was created to "help travelers identify and prepare in advance for stress-free travel." Ashley J.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The saga is emblematic of Trump's most dangerous and self-serving tendencies. Early in his administration, Donald Trump strong-armed senators to confirm Cabinet appointees; later, unable to get around the objections of a few Democratic senators, he deployed a complicated legal shell game to install a handful of prosecutors to top positions in blue states across the country. Five courts have now rejected this scheme—creating a significant mess for the Justice Department and calling into question the longevity of Trump's strategy to evade congressional checks and hand prosecutorial power to his loyalists. On Monday, a panel of appeals-court judges upheld a lower court's ruling that Alina Habba—formerly Trump's personal lawyer—had no authority to lead the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office. The specifics of these legal disputes are dry and hypertechnical. But the chaos crystallizes Trump's disregard for rules, distaste for professionalism, and obsessive need to turn the regular work of government into an engine of personal advantage. For that reason, these illegal appointees are central to Trump's effort to use the Justice Department as a political tool: Without any Senate oversight, the president granted them the authority to harass his enemies. In this way, Trump has contorted an appointments process meant to restrain his power into a means of maximizing it. Appointed to the role as part of Trump's push for vengeance against his political enemies, Halligan briskly secured indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James—both of which the court has since tossed out, on the reasoning that Halligan had no authority to bring those charges in the first place. Other districts might face similar challenges; Democratic Senator Chris Coons has suggested that the U.S. attorney in his state of Delaware is “probably” serving illegally. The legal rules that Trump is abusing are so complicated that multiple judges have resorted to bullet points and spreadsheets to explain how the president violated them. As he does with other Senate-confirmed officials, the president nominates candidates to lead U.S. Attorney's Offices, whom the Senate can then confirm or reject. The president will be less likely to put forward candidates qualified only by his own “favoritism,” Hamilton argued, given the prospect of embarrassment before an unimpressed Senate. Likewise, senators can use the confirmation process as a means of extracting information from the nominee and securing commitments—ensuring that officials are accountable not just to the president but also to another branch of government as well. Practically speaking, this does not always happen with the speed that presidents, senators, and nominees would like. The top job can be left vacant—sometimes for lengthy stretches—either because a president can't decide who should fill the role or because the Senate hasn't had a chance to approve a nominee yet. For this reason, Congress has established alternative means of temporarily filling these positions, which allow another prosecutor to step into the role as either an “acting” or an “interim” U.S. attorney. Anne Joseph O'Connell, a Stanford law professor and an expert in these temporary appointments, describes this legal structure as attempting a “balance between accountability and workability.” Trump chafed against the confirmation process during his first four years in office, relying heavily on acting officials across government: “I like acting,” he said in 2019. Witness the antics of Trump's Senate-confirmed Cabinet members such as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel. But much to Trump's fury, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, continues to recognize so-called blue slips for U.S. attorney nominees. Under this system, senators from the state where a nominee's new office will be located gain veto power over potential appointments. Trump has therefore been limited in his ability to appoint MAGA prosecutors in the Democratic states through the normal confirmation process. That's a significant problem for his revenge campaign, given that the targets of his ire largely live and work in those blue states and are most easily prosecuted in them. To work around this, he and Attorney General Pam Bondi have exploited the silences and ambiguities of the system for installing temporary appointees, cobbling together questionable legal mechanisms for extending those appointments well past their expiration date. For months, this strategy of extending temporary appointments produced results that Trump could be happy with. In New Jersey, Habba oversaw charges against Newark's Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka and Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver following a scuffle at an immigration detention center. (The charges against Baraka were rapidly dismissed; McIver is seeking to have her case thrown out.) In New York, the temporary U.S. Attorney John Sarcone subpoenaed Letitia James's office over her past investigations into Trump and the National Rifle Association. The other prosecutors who would soon be questioned in court have, variously, urged the FBI to investigate supposed anti-Trump conspiracies, clashed with judges, and aggressively prosecuted anti-ICE protesters. Read: The Trump administration's favorite tool for criminalizing dissent Habba was the first prosecutor to face judicial skepticism. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled her appointment illegal in late August, holding that she had been serving unlawfully since July 1. But doing so was necessary to satisfy Trump's desire for retribution. After Halligan's predecessor, Erik Siebert, reportedly refused to move forward with spurious prosecutions of Comey and James, Trump pushed him out and installed Halligan, who promptly brought the charges that Siebert had refused. (Siebert had garnered the approval of Virginia's two Democratic senators, a fact the president pointed to when calling for his dismissal.) According to Judge Cameron McGowen Currie, who last week found Halligan's appointment illegal, Halligan is distinguished by having served illegally from the very beginning of her time in the Eastern District of Virginia, thanks to the Justice Department's decision to put her into her role as a backfill for Siebert. (This is distinct from the other prosecutors, who were reappointed to extend their own tenure.) Attorneys must be independent and installed consistent with the rule of law, not because of their political loyalty or through political maneuvering.” After Habba's original disqualification, in August, the Justice Department responded pugnaciously. Yesterday, a district court in the Northern District of New York heard arguments in Letitia James's challenge to John Sarcone's appointment. The Justice Department did not return a request for comment on whether it plans to battle the Third Circuit's ruling on Habba. As for Halligan, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially said that the administration would fight to keep the former insurance lawyer in her current post. Halligan was “legally appointed,” Leavitt insisted, and “extremely qualified.” A week and a half later, however, the Justice Department has yet to file an appeal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Chad Curry busily ferries his teenage children through the streets of their Chicago neighborhood of West Ridge, he eyes passing vehicles with a skepticism he didn't have just a few months ago. Some models – Chevy Tahoes, Dodge Chargers, Ford Explorers – give him extra pause. The 52-year-old software consultant also knows what to do if the doors fly open and masked, khaki-clad agents leap out and beeline for one of his neighbors. Curry is among thousands of parents, teachers, clergy and community organizers who have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration raid unfold. They've learned how to document federal immigration agents' actions and quickly warn migrant neighbors – part of an emerging national blueprint for how concerned residents respond when President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown operations arrive at their doorstep. Similar scenarios have played out in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina: ﻿Fearing an encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Patrol, or one of several other federal agencies involved in the crackdowns, many migrants retreated into isolation. Local businesses felt the blow as workers stayed home, and classroom seats sat empty as immigrant parents dared not drive their kids to school. “I want to live in an area of solidarity,” Curry said. But, like every other city that came before them, he said, “We're making it our own.” Honking car horns and shrill whistles have become the de facto soundtrack of local resistance as some residents have learned to create a cacophony of noise to warn anyone in earshot that immigration agents are present. Buckets of free whistles have appeared on local diner counters and outside popular shopping centers. They have become a fixture around the necks of some suburban Chicago moms and Charlotte school volunteers. It is one of several strategies some city residents are learning in trainings being dubbed “community defense,” “ICE Watch” or “Migra Watch.” In cities targeted by the immigration crackdown, local and national organizers have taught thousands of people how to proactively patrol areas around busy streets, churches, schools and daycares looking for agents. While Trump's immigration policy continues to draw large support from his GOP base, a November poll from CBS News noted that 54% of people felt immigration agents were stopping and detaining more people than necessary. Attendees flooded the online chat, saying they were from Alabama, California, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon and more than a dozen other states. A woman from central Texas said she feels like her community is “drowning.” Another person said they were desperate to help but were unsure what to do. Over the next two hours, trainers laid out a roadmap for how to identify immigration agents, film their actions with cellphones and spread the word that arrests are underway. During the November training, Jill Garvey, co-director of States at the Core, explained patrols have three goals when they are witnessing an arrest: “document, support, de-escalate.” “We should be documenting every single thing they're doing,” Garvey told the virtual attendees. “We want to get a better understanding of their tactics. We also want to document their activity that runs afoul of the law.” Garvey and other trainers offered frank advice during the training: People have the right to “observe and document,” but patrollers should not interfere with agents. At times, federal immigration arrests in several cities have become tense as protesting crowds swarmed around agents, screamed obscenities and came within feet of law enforcement as they wrestled a person to the ground. But Garvey and other trainers emphasized that ICE Watch is nonviolent. The trainings have evolved after federal agents in Chicago were accused of liberally deploying tear gas and pepper balls on protesters and other bystanders, Garvey said. SATC has given 7,000 virtual trainings this year, more than 80% of which have happened over the last two months, she said. Nikki Marín Baena, co-director of North Carolina immigrant rights group Siembra NC, said hundreds of volunteers in the state have attended the group's trainings in person. “Otherwise, there's just this kind of a looming feeling that they might be around at all times,” she said. While programs like ICE Watch have taken hold in several cities, everyday community members – teachers, parents, clergy – have also adapted lessons from other cities as they look for ways to support migrant neighbors. On that day, more than 30,000 students – about 20% of district enrollment – were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Hearing that Charlotte would be the next stop on the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, many in the city's deeply rooted migrant community had retreated into their homes, fearful of venturing outside even to go to work, buy groceries or drive their children to school. Samantha knew that many of the absent children depended on the meals, and like parents in Chicago, Los Angeles and Memphis, she began to concoct a plan to get food onto the tables of sheltering migrant families – and get kids back to class. She has asked to use only her first name over harassment concerns. Makeshift food pantries overflowed with stacks of canned milk, cereal and instant oatmeal ready to be delivered. Volunteers armed with plastic whistles patrolled busy bus routes and posted up outside of schools, ready to sound the alarm if ICE or CBP agents approached. By the following Monday, a group of other parents had organized rides to school for more than 70 children, she told CNN. When she saw school families were being deeply impacted, North Carolina Association of Educators president Tamika Walker Kelly looked to her colleagues in Chicago for advice. The Chicago Teachers Union advised the North Carolina educators on what trainings they had found most useful, and they shared how Chicago parents formed school patrols to make students and families feel safer. “Having to be on that constant state of alert is one of the things that our educators, both in Charlotte and in Raleigh, are concerned about,” Walker Kelly said. If educators in New Orleans call looking for advice, Walker Kelly said she is ready to pick up the phone. He thinks they are motivated in part by the thought that migrant families face every parent's worst nightmare: being unwillingly separated from their child. Faith leaders have become some of the most prominent faces of local resistance as they hold prayer at protests, offer up their churches as meeting places, and make (unsuccessful) attempts to deliver communion to detainees. Though ICE has had a longstanding policy against making arrests in “sensitive locations” such as churches and schools, the Trump administration ended the directive this year. Sara Green, a Unitarian Universalist pastor in New Orleans, heard her city would be the next immigration enforcement target, she knew exactly who to call for guidance. Black, who is at the center of a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration, was repeatedly shot with pepper balls outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, in October, drawing sharp public criticism over agents' treatment of clergy at national protests. For her, that will likely mean supporting community organizers, holding prayer vigils, and spending long and emotional nights by the sides of families whose loved ones are detained. Chicago religious leaders from several faiths have formed a coalition called “Faith over Fear” to respond to ICE raids and support congregations through interfaith prayer services and “know your rights” trainings. Coalition member Rami Nashashibi said the group's members have taken inspiration from religious groups in Los Angeles, who rallied around the message “Families are Sacred.” Nashashibi pointed out that “faith and spirituality has undergirded movements for decades,” including the American Civil Rights Movement. Though the playbook may feel familiar, each city adds its unique spin. In Los Angeles, large-scale protests clogged downtown city blocks for days. Chicago, a historic union city, has leaned on several existing coalitions, including strong ties between Black churches and other faith groups. As the Trump administration rolls out an operation in the Twin Cities, the mayor of Minneapolis has banned local state and federal law enforcement from using any city-owned parking lots, ramps or garages for immigration enforcement, citing how agents previously used those spaces as staging grounds in Chicago. Though an operation has only just begun in New Orleans, organizers there say music and faith have always played a role in the city's protests. But while state leaders in Illinois and California have strongly denounced federal raids, the people of Louisiana who oppose immigration enforcement will not find an ally in their governor, Republican Jeff Landry. Landry is embracing the presence of federal agents, telling Fox News, “I'm welcoming them to come in. We're going to take these dangerous criminals off the streets in Louisiana.” Green, the local Unitarian pastor, believes New Orleans already has much of the community organizing experience it already needs, after decades of supporting neighbors through natural disasters, poverty and crumbling city infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While no U.S. personnel were seriously hurt in any of the incidents, naval investigators acknowledge that there could've been “catastrophic” outcomes had they played out a little differently. “The Navy's sustained combat operations in the U.S. Central Command area of operations for the past two years demonstrated our battle effectiveness and ability to maintain freedom of navigation,” said Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jim Kilby. “As we reflect on these incidents and ongoing improvement efforts, the Navy remains laser-focused on producing battle-ready Sailors and forces to ensure the Navy provides our nation with the most lethal, combat-credible, and ready force possible.” During the deployment, the carrier collided with a merchant vessel, shot down one of its own fighter aircraft, lost another one of its fighting aircraft while trying to evade an incoming ballistic missile, and lost a third fighter jet due to an arresting cable failure as the pilot attempted to land on it. The public versions of the reports, which include heavy redactions, paint a picture of sailors under significant stress and pressure, failing to communicate properly during those high-pressure moments. A senior Navy official told reporters, “I assure you that accountability actions were taken across all the operators involved in this, and that could be from an administrative reaction to take away someone's watch qualification to have them re-qualify, to administrative procedures in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Navy investigation into this incident concluded that the Gettysburg's commanding officer's decision “to engage was neither reasonable nor prudent and could have been prevented by action at multiple levels.” “As it was, there were eight Sailors in a space less than 10 ft from the impact locations; a 1-degree change in trajectory could have destroyed the space and caused eight fatalities. My team spoke with those eight Sailors, and they will never forget how close they came to losing their lives.” About a week after the collision, Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of Carrier Strike Group 8, relieved the commanding officer of USS Harry S. Truman, Capt. Dave Snowden, from duty due to “a loss of confidence in his ability to command,” the Navy announced. Christopher “Chowdah” Hill, commanding officer of USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), assumed the duty as Truman's interim commanding officer. “This carrier striker conducted 52 days of 24/7 sustained combat operations,” Kilby told reporters on Thursday. On April 28, 2025, the Truman had to make an evasive maneuver to avoid an incoming Houthi-fired ballistic missile. However, in doing so, an F/A-18E Super Hornet and a tow tractor that were being moved around in the hangar bay skidded right off the deck. This aircraft cost more than $36 million, and the dolly cost more than $61,000, per the report. About a week later, the failure of one of the arresting wires as an F/A-18 aircraft tried to land sent it careening off the edge as well.</p>
