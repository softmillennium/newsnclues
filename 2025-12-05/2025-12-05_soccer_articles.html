                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We know fans from around Massachusetts, and the world, will be curious about who is coming to Gillette Stadium, which will be called Boston Stadium, and this story will be updated throughout the day. Exact schedules, locations and kickoff times will be confirmed tomorrow on Saturday, Dec. 6. (We'll have coverage so check back tomorrow.) Group I: France, Senegal, [Winner of Play-off 2*], Norway The United States Men's National Team, which is in Group D, now knows its opponents for the group stage of competition. Here's a look at every team in the group: It's the only stage where every nation is guaranteed matches (three games to be exact). There are12 groups, with four teams in each. Each team plays the other teams in its group exactly once. Once every team has played its three allotted matches — and a total of 16 teams have been eliminated — the next round (the Round of 32) will be set in stone. (Scroll down through this article for more details.) Group stage matches make up most of the tournament's gameplay. Cape Verde, which has a large population of immigrants in the Brockton area, was drawn to Group H, meaning they will play at least one game in Miami Stadium, Atlanta Stadium, Houston Stadium and Estadio Guadalajara. Haiti also has a prominent population in the Brockton area and throughout Massachusetts. Portugal has a considerable fan base in the Brockton and Southcoast area of Massachusetts. The team was drawn to Group K, along with Colombia. In Group L, England was drawn from Pot 1. However, there will only be a single Group L match played in Boston Stadium. Drawing officially began around 1:27 p.m. at the group stage final draw. The game schedule will be announced tomorrow (Saturday), starting at noon Easterntime. Group A: Mexico, Korea Republic, South Africa, [winner of Playoff D] Group B: Canada, Switzerland, Qatar, [Winner of Playoff A] There will also be Group C matches at MetLife Stadium (NY/NJ), Philadelphia, Miami and Atlanta Group D: United States, Australia, Paraguay, [Winner of Playoff C] Group F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, [Winner of Playoff B] Group G: Belgium, IR Iran, Egypt, New Zealand Group H: Spain, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Cabo Verde *Group I: France, Senegal, Norway, [Winner of Playoff 2] There will also be Group I matches at MetLife Stadium (NY/NJ), Philadelphia, and Toronto Group K: Portugal, Colombia, Uzbekistan, [Winner of Playoff 1] There will also be Group L matches in Dallas, MetLife Stadium (NY/NJ), Philadelphia, and Toronto The former New England Patriots quarterback has officially taken the stage to help pull teams out of their pots. "Certainly incredible to have this incredible event coming to North America," Brady said, who played at Gillette Stadium for 20 seasons. There's huge anticipation always for this event." Brady is one of four celebrities touted to help with the draw. He is joined onstage by Aaron Judge, Shaquille O'Neal and Wayne Gretzky. Unsurprisingly, no teams have been drawn yet. However, hosts Kevin Hart and Heidi Klum kicked off the ceremony with some speeches and Andrea Bocelli, Nicole Scherzinger and Robbie Williams introduced thefestivities with some songs. FIFA President Gianni Infantino then gave a speech welcoming everyone to the ceremony before presenting President Donald Trump with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. As of 12:42 p.m., "Top Gun: Maverick" actor Manny Ramirez is interviewing Brazilian legend Roberto Carlos about his career and Brazil's chances at the upcoming tournament. Patriot Place is a shopping and dining center located adjacent to Boston Stadium. "Patriot Place features more than 1.3 million square feet of shopping, dining, and entertainment," Patriot Place said on its website. "You will find major fashion retailers, live and interactive entertainment, eateries, a four-star hotel, state of the art theatre and much, much more." Moments ago, President Donald Trump took the stage at the final draw to receive the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize, awarded to individuals recognized as striving for peace. "In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognize the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace," FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in an Instagram post. Nothing has happened just yet, but we will keep you updated as the group stage for the world's biggest sporting tournament is formed — especially when we're able to narrow down which teams might play in Boston. The event will include seven-time NFL Super Bowl champion and former New England Patriot quarterback Tom Brady, four-time NBA championship winner and Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, NHL Hall of Famer and four-time Stanley Cup champion Wayne Gretzky, and seven-time MLB All-Star Aaron Judge. Additionally, two-time NFL Super Bowl champion Eli Manning will serve as the red-carpet host. Thierry Henry, a World Cup winner who cemented himself as a legend with France and Arsenal, has given his prediction for the winner of the tournament. The player-turned-pundit noted that Les Bleushave made it to the finals of the previous two FIFA World Cups, and he expects his France side to make it to their third consecutive final. The stadium is located around 29 miles southwest of downtown Boston in Foxborough, Massachusetts. There are four "pots" that the 48 teams have been organized in, corresponding to team rankings in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. Today, teams will each be assigned to one of the 12 groups — designated as groups A-L — with each group containing one team from each of the four pots. We already know that Boston Stadium will host some of the games for groups C, I and L, but the exact teams that will be traveling to Boston Stadium will not be known until tomorrow, Saturday, Dec. 6, when the full schedule is expected to be released. In total, there are 16 cities hosting matches in this year's World Cup, split between Canada, Mexico and the United States. The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) has its schedule for FIFA World Cup group stage matches laid out, as do the teams for Mexico and Canada. In the final draw, which is scheduled for Dec. 5, teams are selected from four "pots" which correspond to their FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking. Because of this, group stage matches for the USMNT have already been determined. Each team plays three group stage matches — one game against each of the other three teams in their group. Here's when and where the U.S. team is expected to play: Gillette Stadium has a seating capacity of 64,628. The venue has undergone considerable updates since its opening over two decades ago. "It includes the Gillette Stadium Lighthouse, a new signature 22-story lighthouse with a 360-degree observation deck open to guests year-round," it said. FIFA said the third phase of 2026 World Cup tickets will begin on Dec. 11 at 11 a.m. ET as part of an update about its ticket sales inventory. It is the initial phase in which fans can submit applications for tickets after the group-stage matchups are revealed. World Cup tickets can also be bought through secondary ticket marketplaces, including the official FIFA resale/exchange and Stubhub. FIFA will also offer a last-minute sales phase closer to the start of the 2026 World Cup in June. Fans will be able to purchase any remaining ticket inventory on a first-come, first-serve basis. Tickets are selling fast on platforms like Stubhub and SeatGeek. Here's a look at the current starting prices for each game on SeatGeek as of Dec. 1: Previously, there were only 32 teams in the tournament, so, therefore, the first knockout round used to be a round of 16. These pots are determined based on skill level. So the best teams are in Pot 1. That way, ideally, the groups are all of equal strength. The host teams are automatically placed into Pot 1. Which means, Canada, Mexico and the United States could have a slightly easier tournament than they otherwise would've, because they will not play any of the other "elite" teams from Pot 1. During the 2022 tournament, for example, the U.S. and Mexico were both in Pot 2 while Canada was drawn from Pot 4. Keep in mind that teams from the same soccer confederation (essentially, continents) cannot be drawn into the same group. Here are the teams in each pot: There are a total of 12 groups, with four teams in each. Each team plays the other teams in its group exactly once. Once every team has played its three allotted matches — and a total of 16 teams have been eliminated — the next round (the Round of 32) will be set in stone. Group stage matches make up most of the tournament's gameplay. Expect a lot of glitz and glamour. It's going to somewhat resemble an industry awards ceremony. The whole thing will be interspersed with song and dance numbers. Historically, FIFA tends to bring up soccer legends to help physically pull team names out of the pots. So, don't be surprised if the likes of David Beckham or Zinedine Zidane make an appearance. It will also be streamed live at foxsports.com if you're stuck in front of a computer. The draw itself is scheduled to take about two hours. In the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup, five matches took place at what was then called Foxboro Stadium. Four years later, when the United States hosted another Women's World Cup in 2003, the tournament returned to Foxboro. This time, Gillette Stadium hosted four of the tournament's matches. On the men's side of things, the U.S. has hosted one World Cup (until next year, of course). In 1994, six matches were played at Foxboro Stadium. The Patriots have a bye week and will return to Gillette field on Sunday, Dec. 15, at 1 p.m. when theytake on the Buffalo Bills. This week the Gillette Stadium hosts a different kind of Super Bowl, the Massachusetts High School Football Championships. Last night in the first game, top-seeded Cohasset outlasted Amesbury, 22-14, to capture the program's third state championship all-time and first since 2021. In the second game, thetop-seeded Norwood Clippers beat No. 3 Fairhaven in the MIAA Division 6 Super Bowl 28-14. The Patriot Ledger will provide coverage from all eight Super Bowls. We'll have live blogs, stories, photos and videos from all eight games. All eight games will be streamed live. Long answer: We know that groups C, I and L will all play some of their matches in Boston. Boston Stadium was awarded a total of seven World Cup matches. Five of those are group stage matches, one is a Round of 32 matchup and Boston's final match is a quarterfinal matchup on Thursday, July 9. Here's what we know about all the matches so far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazil have been drawn with Morocco, while France will play Senegal and Argentina must face Austria. Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, drew his nation into Group B as the first pick, while Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum drew her nation into Group A. Thomas Tuchel's side will subsequently be playing their first game in either Toronto or Dallas, their second in Toronto or Boston, and their third in New York or Philadelphia. Shaquille O'Neal, the NBA legend, drew from Pot 2, before NFL star Aaron Judge drew from Pot 3, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky drew from Pot 4. Group B: Canada, Qatar, Switzerland, Italy/ Northern Ireland / Wales / Bosnia and Herzegovina. Group D: USMNT, Paraguay, Australia, Turkiye / Romania / Slovakia / Kosovo. Group E: Germany, Curacao, Cote D'Ivoire, Ecuador. Group F: Netherlands, Japan, Tunisia, Ukraine / Sweden / Poland / Albania. Group G: Belgium, Egypt, Iran, New Zealand. Group H: Spain, Cabo Verde, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia Group I: France, Senegal, Norway, Iraq / Bolivia / Suriname Group K: Portugal, Congo DR / Jamaica / New Caledonia, Uzbekistan, Colombia. England will face Croatia in a rerun of the 2018 World Cup semi-final and will also meet familiar opponents in Panama, having played them at the same tournament. Tuchel's side will also face Ghana, but have only played them once before, doing so in a friendly in 2011. England's first game will take place on June 17 against Croatia, before their second game on June 23 against Ghana, and they then round out the initial phase of the tournament on June 27, with their clash against minnows Panama. Pundit Dion Dublin said on BBC Sport: "Regarding England, I think the African nations always give England a hard game. Ghana and Croatia I'm a little bit worried about." Scottish pundit Scott Brown added on their draw: "We've got to look to beat Haiti, it will be a huge game for us. Morocco, we'll be underdogs from looking at the world rankings, it's a hard game. Everyone will want to be at that Scotland v Brazil game. Seeing that yellow shirt, they've got top quality players. The semi-finals will take place on Thursday March 26 and the finals on Tuesday March 31 with kick-off times of 5pm or 7.45pm.</p>

As co-hosts alongside Canada and Mexico, the United States was an automatic qualifier for the 2026 World Cup. It'll mark the 12th time that the USMNT will compete at the World Cup.

In the World Cup draw on Dec. 5, the U.S. was placed in a group with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA's Playoff C – Turkey, Slovakia, Kosovo or Romania.

The USMNT has made it through the group stage but could not advance past the Round of 16 in three of the last four World Cups (it did not qualify for the 2018 tournament). After a third-place finish at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the USMNT's best performance in the tournament came in 2002 when it reached the quarterfinals.

Managed by Mauricio Pochettino, the USMNT is captained by defender Tim Ream and features Christian Pulisic as its key player.

Here's what to know about the USMNT's 2026 World Cup group and schedule:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“This is your prize, this is your peace prize,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said as he bestowed the honor ahead of the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington, DC. Trump accepted a gold medal and put it around his own neck as the FIFA boss heaped praise on him for his actions in promoting world peace. Trump, who had his sights on the Nobel Peace Prize, was also presented with a gold trophy bearing his name and a pair of hands holding up the world. “This is truly one of the great honors of my life,” Trump said as he hailed the fact he had ended wars and “saved millions and millions of lives.” “The world is a safer place now,” he continued. “The United States, one year ago, was not doing too well, and now I have to say we're the hottest country anywhere in the world that we're going to keep it that way.” I've been hearing about a peace prize — and I'm here to represent our country in a different sense,” Trump told reporters as he lapped up the cameras. “We have to come up with another name for the other one. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Infantino, for his part, has previously made it clear that he believed Trump should have been given the Nobel for his efforts to broker a cease-fire in Gaza. Trump missed out on the Nobel this year after it was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado. Meanwhile, a defiant Trump insisted the FIFA peace prize didn't conflict with his recent vow to strike Venezuelan drug traffickers. “I mean, I settled eight wars,” he told reporters ahead of the draw when asked about the likelihood of him taking it home. It comes after Trump threatened earlier this week to order strikes on land-based Venezuelan drug traffickers in an expansion of his military campaign — and added that Colombian operators were also at risk. Since Sept. 2, the US military has attacked at least 22 vessels allegedly carrying drugs in international waters off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia, killing at least 83 people.</p>

It was widely expected that Trump, who arrived at the ceremony with Infantino and has made several public appearances with him in recent months, would be the winner. That was confirmed at the ceremony in Washington DC on Friday. Donald Trump was presented with the Fifa Peace Prize trophy Trump stated he had saved "tens of millions of lives" through diplomatic interventions and had "stopped wars happening just before they started". "This is truly one of the great honours of my life," Trump said, before claiming that the 2026 World Cup has set a new record for ticket sales. It is beyond the numbers we thought were possible," Trump said. Afterwards, the trio posed for a selfie taken by Infantino. "We have to find another name for the NFL," Trump said. Trump and Infantino have appeared together at many public events in recent months England start World Cup against Croatia, Scotland to face Brazil Alongside stars from football, US sports and show business, Trump was in attendance, as will the leaders of the other two co-hosts - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney. Proceedings, however, seem to have been planned with the US president very much in mind. Seventies group Village People were booked to play YMCA, a Trump favourite that is regularly heard at his campaign rallies. For critics, such moves are a threat to Fifa's commitment to political neutrality, one enshrined in its statutes, and risk turning the draw - and the tournament itself - into propaganda tools. Those critics believe Infantino and Trump are effectively too close for comfort, and that it sends a message that world football's governing body is aligning with the Make America Great Again (Maga) movement, and endorsing what many feel is a divisive administration. They pointed to the fact that in 2019 there was no such controversy when Fifa gave the president of Argentina an award to honour his contribution to football, and said the organisation deserves praise for endorsing peace in a divided world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Exclusive Interview with Tobin Heath and Christen Press: they have changed the game on and off the pitch. They have also revolutionized storytelling, coverage, fashion, and so much. Legends on the pitch and gamechangers off it, Tobin Heath and Christen Press have revolutionized athlete storytelling, coverage, fashion and more throughout their playing careers. Now, they're looking to build a lasting legacy off it. The pair have combined to make over 336 caps for the United States Women's National Team, contributing 185 goals (100 goals, 85 assists) and playing key roles in two Women's World Cup winning sides (2015, 2019). And that's just on the international stage, with both shaping their own legacy at the club level. Press finished her NWSL career with 50 goals, while Heath still holds the record for the most assists in a single season (10 in 2016). Most of all, they are fierce advocates for justice, equality, and refuse to back down from any challenge. As they move on to the next chapter of their careers, their voices will continue to have a everlasting impact moving forward. Ahead of the 2025 NWSL Championship, All For XI had the privilege to speak with the legends and discuss RE, their respective journeys, how far the league has come, post-retirement bucket lists, Wicked, new merch and more. Can you speak to us about how you're using RE's platform to completely change the game? How has that set the tone for storytelling, coverage, fashion and everything you're doing not just now but into the future? Tobin Heath: It has been such an interesting journey so far. I think about our careers and lives as both dreaming and doing at the same time; that it's like dreaming in action. I mean, it's like we're in Inception or something. So much about our our own careers, and even starting RE, was just an extension and a natural progression of what we were already doing. RE really came out of our pay equity fight, and also revamping our own Players Association, which is its own business in itself. So we had a lot of learning and education in kind of this weird way while we were players - of what it would even mean to create a company. All we have built came out of our frustrations as women's athletes and what was lacking. In a lot of ways, we have created this awesome surfboard - the waves are coming and the waves are getting bigger, and we're excited to to ride them, to shape the culture, shape the narrative into one that actually represents our culture, our voices, our stories and our diverse community. Women's sports has yet to even scratch the surface of what it is. It's so unique and exciting, women actually getting to tell their stories from their perspective. It's so powerful, and we don't even know what's going to come of it. It's not sports, you're not really reinventing how to kick a soccer ball, although we can get into that. Just looking back at it all, what was the most rewarding aspect of your journey? Christen Press: That's a really tough question, because so much of who we are is because of football. One thing that comes to mind is the relationship we have built with this community. I felt really lucky in 2025 to play this year, and feel like I was a little bit in the future as a 36 year old with teammates that were 16 to 20 years old. I often say, I was given a gift in football so that I could be a part of a larger movement for social justice, rights and opportunity. Now that the soccer playing itself is over, it feels like I'm more perfectly situated in what my dharma is and what my purpose is on this earth. I know I'm doing it in the right group of people, if that makes sense. NWSL Championship week has celebrated the players. Having the first-ever NWSL Awards Show… Now players are headlining the whole week of wonderful activities. How have you seen those things change and the exponential growth that has come. TH: If you think back to 2013 until now, I don't know if there's anything more exciting and more investable on this planet than women's sports and AI. The players are the biggest drivers of the transformation and I love seeing them be amplified, their voices and their stories being heard, because that's what makes you love sports. People think, oh, you know, women's sports all of a sudden is like, new and exciting. But social media completely changed the game for women's sports because now there is no middleman that you have to beg, ask and plead to put you on TV so people in the world know you exist. There's an audience that resonates with women's sports and resonates with the culture that is women's sports. We have only connected a few of them and look at what the ecosystem is doing. Imagine if we connect a few more and you actually create a cohesive ecosystem around the thing people love to cheer for. You both have always used your platform to promote inclusivity in the women's soccer community, especially with regards to the queer community. What has it meant for you to see your impact in those spaces? I think all we had to do was be authentic in our love and our relationship and be intentional about what we kept sacred, private and what we share. I think women's sports is one of the most inclusive, wonderful pockets of this world, and we're lucky to be in it. Now that you're done playing, do you have any bucket list items or fun plans that are coming up? CP: I mean Men's World Cup, then the Women's World Cup, and then the LA Olympics. I'm so excited, it's going to be an epic three years. And it feels like so fun that we got to end our career this year and be wide open to seize these opportunities. I saw your amazing wicked costumes and loved them. How are you feeling about new movie, Wicked: For Good? CP: Well, we are here at the NWSL Final, and I think people have actually seen the movie and I haven't, so that's very upsetting. But we have tickets, and I'm a little nervous because I didn't have any expectations for the first movie, and it was so, so good. I'm a little nervous because these characters mean so much to me, and I hope that they don't get it wrong. I just hope Elphaba and Glinda, like, make up. We saw new apparel dropping… Can you talk about that, share more info about RE moving forward? TH: Yeah, RE has so many facets to the business. But also, physical product is so important to connect with our community. Our RE box logo in particular, for me it's a sign of our Reimaginers, our community members and it's a sign of Reimagination. You're here and showing up in a different way. I want people all over the world to see (RE) and to be like, ‘those are my people. This is where I want to be.' That's why physical products are so important to me. They are products I want to wear. I wear my RE boxers every single day because they're an incredible product, but also because it represents my values. CP: I'm really excited about this drop because we went back to our core. It's our first time having TRS products available. We have had such an incredible reception for the show. We got to be playful and put in some themes that have come up in the show, right into the product. So it feels really like a special collection for us as we go into this holiday and continue to expand who's a part of the RE-INC world and RE-INC ecosystem. We have been seeing the RE merch everywhere. What has that been like for you both? To see that support from not just fans, but fellow players too. There have been a couple times where I feel like I get my own RE history reflected back at me. Anytime we do a RE party, people will come in wearing the very first thing we did, all the way up to something we dropped yesterday. You can see our own evolution as a brand and as humans right in front of us. I would see as much RE as I would see (number) 23 and it means something to me to see something that I created, and often Tobin designed, on people's bodies. The way that our teammates, colleagues and players love the product, it's my favorite thing. I bring merch into the locker room and the girls go nuts and are fighting over their sizes. We actually stopped doing as much merch this year, but now we're kind of back. I hope that next year you see even more people walking around in gear, because I think it's a really cool connection point for the women's soccer community. We're all in this together, and that's quite beautiful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA, Dec. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Soccer today unveiled Never Chase Reality™, its official 2026 World Cup Men's National Team campaign, narrated by Marcello Hernandez. The 90-second film honors the past, challenges expectations, and invites fans to believe in what's possible. Never Chase Reality™ guides fans through a powerful reimagining of some of the most iconic moments in U.S. Men's National Team history. From Paul Caligiuri's stunning goal in 1989 to help qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 40 years to Tyler Adams' 35-yard screamer that clinched the CONCACAF Nations League title over Mexico, each scene embodies a century-long, unwavering pursuit of greatness and reflects the team's grit and determination to rise above every expectation. His voice brings humor, heart, and authenticity to a campaign built for a new era of fandom. Never chasing reality means ignoring the odds and daring to dream," said Marcello Hernandez. "I played soccer since I was 4 years old until college and have been a fan of the Men's and Women's U.S. National Team since I was a kid, so it's an honor to bring my passion and enthusiasm for the game to U.S. Never Chase Reality™ marks U.S. Soccer's largest national campaign to date, launching at a pivotal moment for the sport as the United States prepares to host the FIFA Men's World Cup for the first time since 1994. Designed to reach fans across all 50 states, the campaign will live at the intersection of sport and culture, appearing across broadcast, digital, out-of-home, and fan experiences throughout the year. The campaign debuted publicly today in New York City's Times Square, where thousands of fans gathered to watch the World Cup Draw and experience the Never Chase Reality™ film on iconic LED screens. With the FIFA World Cup returning to North America, Never Chase Reality™ is designed to inspire a new generation of fans and unify the country behind the U.S. Men's National Team. The campaign was developed in-house by the new MarComms Department at U.S. Soccer, and captures the relentlessness, fearlessness, and unyielding spirit that defines both players and fans. "Soccer has always been about more than what happens on the field, it lives in our communities, in our fans, and in every person who believes in this team," said Catherine Newman, Chief Marketing & Communications Officer, U.S. Soccer. It celebrates the resilience of our players and the passion of our fans as we unite behind a common purpose heading into 2026." Our vision is clear; we exist in service to soccer. Our ambition, working across the soccer ecosystem, is to ignite a national passion for the game. We are focused on three areas: Soccer Everywhere, ensuring everyone, everywhere experiences the joy of soccer; Soccer Success, our 27 National Teams and Pro Leagues winning on the world stage; and Soccer Investment, maximizing and diversifying investments to sustainably grow the game at all levels.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many headlines from this draw, however, will likely be dominated by one man: U.S. President Donald Trump. This, after all, appears to be an event World Cup organizer FIFA has constructed in his image and to his taste. FIFA had originally formulated plans for an all-singing and all-dancing draw in Las Vegas, replicating the event that preceded the 1994 World Cup, where there were star turns by Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Robin Williams. Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York City mayor and Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, is the director of the White House FIFA World Cup Task Force, which is chaired by Trump. This will be most obvious during the draw when FIFA awards its inaugural peace prize to Trump. FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who describes himself as a close friend of Trump, wrote on Instagram to say Trump deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which instead went to Venezuelan democracy advocate Maria Corina Machado. FIFA is not expected to stringently enforce a time limit. The event will also include several hallmarks of MAGA culture. The Village People, whose 1978 hit song “Y.M.C.A.” has been adopted by Trump as a personal anthem during rallies and campaign events, have been invited to perform at the draw. So too has one of his favorite tenors, Andrea Bocelli, who will open the ceremony. Gretzky and his wife, Janet, also attended Trump's presidential inauguration in January, along with Infantino. Tom Brady, seven-time Super Bowl champion, is another draw assistant. He is a former golf buddy of Trump's who served as a judge at Trump's Miss USA pageant in 2002, while he was also in Trump's suite during the Club World Cup final this past summer. Earlier this year, FIFA took office space at Trump Tower in New York City, despite already having a U.S. office in Miami. “Our success is your success,” Infantino said, while thanking the president's son Eric and the Trump Organization for their support. Infantino even gave Trump a little hold of the World Cup trophy in August, explaining that only the FIFA president and presidents of countries who win the trophy can touch it “because it is for winners only, and you are a winner.” In the 1970s, Trump caught his first taste of elite soccer. “Many years ago, when I was young, there was a player named Pelé who played for a team called the Cosmos,” Trump told DAZN in July. “I went to see him play, and he was fantastic. More than 20 million Americans now participate in soccer, which is more than the combined participation of flag, tackle, touch and 7-on-7 football. Like many parents across the U.S., Trump's awareness of soccer has also been stimulated by his children, most notably 19-year-old Barron, who had a soccer goal in the White House garden during Trump's first term. He was once photographed on the White House lawn in an Arsenal jersey. When the former Manchester United player Wayne Rooney played for D.C. United in MLS, Rooney met up with a teenage Barron at the White House to offer advice, with Barron then playing in youth teams for Rooney's club. Trump's interest in major sports has not been limited to soccer. Yet FIFA appears uniquely in thrall to the U.S. president, with Infantino taking more trips to the Oval Office than any world leader since January. Since beginning his second term, he has often repeated this claim in speeches. Certainly, Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, became a key contact in the White House for the bid and helped secure key votes. According to reporting by Vanity Fair, Kushner “directly asked” Prince Mohammed for his nation's support as early as the summer of 2017 during a visit to the country. Most people might have presumed he would either be re-elected in 2020 for a second consecutive term, or exit presidential politics, rather than returning for a second term in 2025. After three visits to the White House during Trump's first term, as well as golfing trips and a lunch at Davos, the pair remained in touch even during Trump's period in the relative political wilderness. After Trump won last November's election, Infantino visited him at Mar-a-Lago during the presidential transition. He invited Trump's daughter Ivanka and grandson Theo to make the ceremonial first pick of the FIFA Club World Cup draw last December. Infantino's relationship with Trump has, at times, irritated his own colleagues in soccer. In May, Infantino arrived hours late for FIFA's congress in Paraguay after he prioritized a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia with Trump. We had an issue with our flight, which made this delay happen — apologies, sorry, and I am looking forward to spending time with you here.” Infantino also joined Trump at a summit in Egypt in October as Trump and world leaders signed a declaration aimed at bringing peace to Gaza. The men's World Cup, which drives the vast proportion of FIFA revenues, still required White House assistance on multiple issues, most notably a $625million funding commitment on security which Trump signed off following intensive lobbying by the World Cup host cities. This is particularly important because wait times for visa appointments remain around a year in several nations who have qualified for the tournament. Trump continues to threaten host cities with relocating games if he does not deem them sufficiently “safe”. Infantino's position has been made more delicate by relations between Trump, Canada and Mexico, with trade wars and hostile rhetoric bubbling up in his second term. Jesse Marsch, the American coach of Canada's national team, described Trump's comments calling for Canada to be the 51st U.S. state “unsettling and frankly insulting.” This is a big moment for every team that's made it to the World Cup. I'm really hopeful just to have a very clean, uneventful draw where everybody can appreciate the experience of what the World Cup is going to be.” In an interview with The Athletic, sports minister Adam van Koeverden said he was not prepared to speak about “hypotheticals” of what the draw might be like, when asked how he would feel about a MAGA-themed draw. Asked if the U.S. president deserves a FIFA Peace Prize, he said: ‘That's not up to me…it is not my place to say.” On Wednesday, Human Rights Watch organized a news conference which included speakers from many of the U.S.'s leading civil society organizations. Jamal Watkins, a vice-President of the NAACP, an American civil rights organization founded in 1909, described the relationship between Infantino and Trump as “too close for comfort.” He said: “What we're finding is that when Infantino aligns with Donald Trump, then you're sending a signal not only to the United States, but to the world, that all the practices and policies coming out of this administration are OK or justified.” Dakwar said FIFA is at risk of becoming a public relations tool to “normalize an increasingly authoritarian U.S. government.” “Look at football's reach around the world,” they continued. “And look at the impact it makes to people's lives. When approached about plans for Trump to speak at the draw, White House spokesman David Ingle told The Athletic: “The United States of America has never been more respected or successful than it is now under President Trump's historic leadership.</p>

The United States has a new mascot, and it's definitely a good dog.

Ahead of Friday's World Cup draw, U.S. Soccer announced the team's mascot, which is inspired by a Chesapeake Bay retriever. The federation said the choice was made due to the retriever's "bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, and intelligence," adding that it will wear No. 27 to represent the 27 national teams under U.S. Soccer's umbrella.

The mascot has not yet been named. Fans can vote by becoming a U.S. Soccer insider and downloading its official app.

It's not the first time the U.S. has selected a canine mascot around a home World Cup. The 1994 World Cup, hosted by the United States, was represented by Striker, an earnest and friendly pup designed by the Warner Bros. Animation team. U.S. fans will be hoping the men's national team will embody the new mascot's traits at the 2026 World Cup, which begins June 11.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Airlines is expanding its flight schedule during next year's FIFA World Cup, helping its customers to travel between host cities during the upcoming tournament in June and July 2026. This will add around 27,000 additional seats across 12 routes next summer, with tickets for these flights already on sale. The carrier has unveiled a sweeping expansion of its network during the world's biggest sporting event next summer, adding more routes, flights, and perks for its customers. Between June and July 2026, American will add an extra 27,000 seats on 12 key routes, enabling its customers to travel seamlessly between the US     World Cup host cities during the tournament. Brian Znotins, American's Senior Vice President of Network Planning, commented: "American is ready with its game plan for the FIFA World Cup 26, adding an extra 27,000 seats on 12 routes this summer. With more flights to all host cities, we're making sure fans don't miss the chance to take part in this once-in-a-lifetime moment across North America." This follows a successful first round of ticket redemptions, with American also launching daily sweepstakes offering prizes like match tickets. The world's oldest operating airline program offers a lot of benefits to loyal customers. There are expected to be around 5.3 million stadium spectators in the US during next year's FIFA World Cup, along with a further two million in Canada and Mexico. American Airlines is the official 'North American Airline Supplier' of the FIFA World Cup 2026, so it is set to play a crucial role in delivering connectivity between cities. Air travel during the tournament will be strong both domestically and internationally, as, unlike most World Cups in the past, next year involves 16 host cities across three countries. This represents just the second time a tournament has been jointly hosted, after 2002 in Japan and South Korea. The distances between venues are also greater than ever before, meaning airlines will be benefiting from significant demand. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. More likely that sides like Iran and Haiti, to name a couple, will have group stage games in Canada or Mexico instead. This World Cup is ostensibly a continental affair, but both FIFA and Uncle Sam have made it very clear who the main character of this play is (and has been).</p>
