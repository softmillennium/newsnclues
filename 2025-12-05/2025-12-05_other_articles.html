                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, I do know that whenever something alarming enough happens, various authorities rush to deny it, usually with a press conference, or at least to reassure public opinion. But now, after growing alarmism about national security due to the overflights of the infamous "drones" over sensitive areas and the strong accusations coming from authoritative figures against the main agencies involved in civil and military defense, has no one yet rushed to deny it? Is it a prelude to other events, or is each government agency simply hiding behind its own hole? When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and credible cases: Description: Over 60 children at Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings emerging. Credibility: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. It was investigated by a well known psychologist, you can find a documentary on YouTube so go check it out!" The incident was also tracked by ground radar. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well. The pilot was put on desk duty for speaking on this too, and for me it's hard to imagine a professional Japanese man to outright make this shit up." Description: Military personnel at an Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in Rendlesham Forest. They even had audio tape recordings of the event. Description: Thousands of people in Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights in the sky. Credibility: "I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice). It was never given a reasonable explanation, and even our Governor at the time admits he was told to dismiss the story and make fun of it." Credibility: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Description: Navy pilots encountered a white, tic-tac-shaped object that performed incredible maneuvers, captured on FLIR footage. The footage was investigated and determined to be authentic by a Turkish scientific agency. Description: The military had to use anti-aircraft weapons against a supposed "weather balloon" over Los Angeles. Credibility: "The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'." Description: Several witnesses saw a large object crash into the water off Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. She captured multiple images, and investigators found no clear signs of manipulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French navy troops opened fire on unidentified drones over a military site housing nuclear submarines in the latest in a series of drone incursions into European airspace. According to French news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP), five drones were detected on Thursday night over the submarine base of Île Longue in Brittany, western France. It is a strategic military site and home to nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines – a key part of France's nuclear deterrent. So once again we have unidentified objects flying over nuclear bases, which presumably are protected by radar, visual and infrared sensors. Yet once again - no evidence produced to show that these are conventional drones. When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's new blueprint for international policy is racist and claims that Europe faces ‘civilization erasure' in a boost to far right and conspiracy theorists, says world affairs editor Sam Kiley Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. “Over the long term, it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,” it says. There is no mainstream population analysis that shows that any European nation will ever become a majority “non-European”. The Trump administration is getting its demographic guidance on Europe from the so-called Great Replacement Theory – a term coined by French conspiracy theorist Renaud Camus, in which he argues that a "global elite" is colluding against the white population of Europe to replace them with non-European peoples. It has a powerful following among far-right groups, Q-Anon fanatics and Maga supporters. And now it is the official long-term view of America itself. So concerned is the US that it is going to lean in and force a change of direction on Europe by supporting groups which align closely with American policies and undermining those which do not. The Trump administration is fighting Europe's Digital Services Act, which requires internet companies, mostly US-based like Meta, Apple, and Google, to moderate content, remove illegal or harmful content, and regulate disinformation. The White House has made allegations of “censorship” against European countries for their efforts to regulate companies that generate huge profits but are anxious that new regulations would be costly to police for them. Its contents closely reflect his startling attacks on Nato and European democracy at his first trip in office to the continent in February. He also threw his weight behind far-right groups and parties then. “America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit, and the growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the new document says. His regime has become a beacon to many on the far right and Christian evangelicals who support Trump. His unashamed claims to represent traditional white Christian values are catnip to conspiracy fans of the great replacement theory. Trump has backed Russia at every stage since returning to office. He has set his face against Europe's support for Kyiv and for arguments that show Ukraine can eject Russian forces if it gets the support it needs. Trump has cut all aid except for intelligence support to Ukraine while demanding enormous 50 per cent shares in future profits for the US and US companies in any future Ukrainian peace deal. He, like Trump, seeks to amplify disinformation and doubt in Western civil society by claiming that governments, like Volodymyr Zelensky's administration in Ukraine, are illegitimate and undemocratic. The new US foreign policy blueprint for the future claims that when it comes to Ukraine: “A large European majority wants peace, yet that desire is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments' subversion of democratic processes.” While that persists and Trump writes outright lies into copper-plated national policy, it is no longer possible to see America as an ally, or even a frenemy.

Ostensibly grounded in Venusian wellness technology, the Integratron now provides a unique meditation experience for guests. In newsletters to his fellow believers, Van Tassel explained how Solgonda had given him information about a technology that could rejuvenate the human body. Later that year, Van Tassel began work constructing it. Whatever one makes of Van Tassel's galactic tales, this striking white dome has earned a listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Now under new management, the Integratron these days is mostly known as a retreat for sound bath meditation. ****Van Tassel's parabolic design is said to be acoustically perfect, with sounds evenly balanced throughout the room. In Van Tassel's time, the Integratron was ostensibly a research laboratory for an organization he called the College of Universal Wisdom. He imagined it as part of a larger campus dedicated to UFO research and metaphysics. After he died in 1978, the property bounced between various owners, including his widow. In 2000, sisters Joanne, Nancy and Patty Karl bought it for sound bath therapy. Although sound baths are more grounded in science from Earth, the Karl sisters nonetheless lean into Integratron's unique history, with Van Tassel and his beliefs featuring prominently on an official website. When it was time, the Integratron's stewards ushered their guests into a rustic first-floor room inside the large domed building. The exposed Douglas fir walls and faint faint scent of palo santo are a marked contrast to its bright, futuristic exterior. Phones must be not only silent but powered off completely. “There are no secrets in the Integratron,” sound therapist Kristine Atkinson told the group as they settled onto their mats. Sitting near the front of the room, Atkinson surrounded herself with 22 white crystalline singing bowls ranging in size from mixing bowl to garden planter. Although they can veer into alternative wellness and are not the panacea that some proponents claim, a growingbody of evidence suggests that auditory meditation does have real benefits, including improved mood, sleep and pain management. “It's like nutrition for your nervous system,” Atkinson told the group. “No two bowls are the same, so it is a process. You have to develop an ear for the space.” Atkinson invited each guest to stand in the magic square and say something they were grateful for. Some guests covered themselves with small blankets and put sleeping masks over their eyes. Atkinson instructed the group to take a few deep breaths. A couple of snores broke the silence but were quickly hushed. One visitor — Irina Contreras, a Los Angeles resident on a trip to Joshua Tree — explained how images came to her as the singing bowls increased in pitch and volume. There were more images carved in the stone, “and then I saw someone's face, and then I got a little freaked out.” “We're very stuck in this kind of 2D, 3D world.” Also visiting from Los Angeles, Phoebe Darling said she'd participated in sound baths before, but none as immersive as this. As the bowls began to sing, Darling said she could feel physical sensations inside of her. “The first one, it felt like a little bit of pain,” she said. Atkinson, Nancy Karl's daughter, has been working with singing bowls for 10 years. Although the Karl sisters didn't take ownership of the Integratron until 2000, their roots at this place stretch back further. According to Atkinson, her mother and aunt had left corporate jobs to lead wilderness meditation retreats when, in 1986, a friend suggested they check out this unique landmark. The Karls have turned the Integratron into more of a UFO-themed meditation retreat while paying tribute to its original DNA. In a statement, they said they have “deep respect for Van Tassel's gift to humanity and his commitment to frequency, vibration and human potential.” Asked whether they'd had their own UFO experiences like Van Tassel did, Atkinson was circumspect. “Let's just say we've had experiences that expanded our understanding of what's possible,” she wrote in an email. Van Tassel left his job at Lockheed in 1947, when he was 37 years old. 1947 was the same year a mysterious craft crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, igniting America's fascination with UFOs. Van Tassel certainly had an interest in otherworldly topics. Around that time, he started holding weekly meditation meetings under Giant Rock, a free-standing boulder in the region that was once a meeting point for Indigenous people. He even lived beneath it for a period. According to Van Tassel's newsletter, these benevolent, egalitarian beings resided in highly developed technological societies on the moon, Mars, Venus and even farther-flung planets. Unsurprisingly for the Cold War era, the United States government took an interest in this unusual man who was operating an air strip and lecturing about secret technologies. The FBI investigated, then seemed to lose interest. “He has been described as eccentric and [an] apparent mental case,” they concluded. His meditation gatherings eventually evolved into an annual convention for the UFO-curious. More curious than culty, the beings he wrote about have nonetheless been described as angelic. Atkinson sums up his thinking with a favorite quote by him: “Science and religion are two sides of the same wall.” It's not exactly clear how the Integratron was supposed to work. According to documents from the U.S. National Register of Historic Places, the “primary function” was “as a negative ion-producing cell regenerator.” The Integratron's stewards aren't quite sure what that means, either. Ostensibly, the dome's upper level can collect and store energy, which is then directed downward to the first floor for visitors to receive. Van Tassel believed the building would be critical for other breakthroughs too, including time travel and the anti-gravity fields needed to run flying saucers. In a sense, Van Tassel's Integratron is an incomplete project. Today, people of all ages, backgrounds and interests visit this strange building in the desert. According to Atkinson, the building has become a destination for meditators, audio professionals, scientists, Tibetan monks, artists and veterans with PTSD, among many others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A massive new sunspot complex, dubbed AR 4294-4296, has emerged on the sun and is facing directly at Earth. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. While auroras and some technological disturbances are possible over the coming week, the new sunspot complex seems unlikely to unleash a second Carrington Event. However, the dark patches were first spotted around a week earlier by NASA's Perseverance Mars rover, which was spying on the sun's far side relative to Earth. At first glance, the new sunspot complex appears to be larger. Sunspots have the capacity to unleash powerful blasts of radiation, or solar flares, when their invisible magnetic field lines contort and snap, unleashing energy into space. These explosive outbursts can trigger temporary radio blackouts on Earth and launch massive, fast-moving clouds of plasma, or coronal mass ejections (CMEs), at our planet. When this happens, it can subsequently cause disturbances in our planet's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic storms, which can interfere with electronics and paint vibrant auroras in the night sky. If it does blow and unleashes a CME, then the resulting solar storm "will be geoeffective," they added. The Carrington Event unleashed an estimated X45 magnitude solar flare in 1859, which remains a record, although there is geological evidence that even more powerful blasts occurred long before humans emerged. For context, an X45 flare is more than five times stronger than the most powerful solar flare of the last decade — an X7 blast in October 2024. If an equally powerful blast impacted Earth today, the radiation would knock out every satellite in orbit around our planet, recent simulations revealed. Experts estimate that the total damages would easily exceed $1 trillion. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. If AR 4294-4296 is close in size to the sunspot that birthed the Carrington Event, that means a huge solar storm is likely, right? Larger sunspots do have the potential to launch more powerful solar flares. Whether or not a sunspot reaches its maximum explosive potential is also tied to the configuration of its magnetic field and the frequency with which it explodes, meaning that some giant sunspots can be completely harmless. However, despite this, experts say there is no clear sign of a superstorm on par with the Carrington Event in the immediate future. But if it happens to rotate past Earth without any outbursts, the hefty dark spots are likely large enough to survive more than one trip around the sun, meaning they could be back for "round two" sometime closer to Christmas. —'The sun is slowly waking up': NASA warns that there may be more extreme space weather for decades to come —Invisible 'flickering' on the sun could predict potentially dangerous solar flares hours in advance —We are fast approaching the sun's 'battle zone' — and it could be even worse than solar maximum, experts warn The sun has been particularly active in recent years, because it has recently been in the most active phase of its roughly 11-year solar cycle, known as solar maximum. That has fueled several recent X-class flares, including two back-to-back explosions, which triggered a G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm between Nov. 11-12. A lot of these flares have triggered geomagnetic storms on Earth, including the extreme disturbance in May 2024, which was the most powerful of its kind for 21 years and triggered some of the most widespread auroras in centuries.

An analysis in 1905 revealed that most of the gas was nonflammable nitrogen, just 15% was methane — and a little less than 2% was a colorless, odorless, elusive element that scientists had discovered only a few decades earlier. This marked the first discovery of helium in a natural gas field. Helium does not react with other elements, and it mostly accumulates in Earth's crust as radioactive uranium and thorium decay, which takes billions of years. Because it takes much longer to replenish helium reserves than it does to deplete them, helium is a nonrenewable resource. Unlike hydrogen-filled airships, those carrying helium didn't explode when the enemy shot them down. And helium's properties, particularly its ability to be liquid at close to absolute zero (minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or minus 273.15 degrees Celsius), meant it could cool machine parts like engines and magnets better than any other element could. Today, helium is an essential cooling component in nuclear reactors, rockets and medical diagnostic equipment such as MRI machines. The gas keeps fiber optics, superconductors, quantum computers and semiconductors cool, but skyrocketing demand has pushed supply chains to their limit, resulting in a global shortage that has persisted for more than a decade. Helium extraction also has a huge carbon footprint — almost equivalent to the U.K.'s per year — because currently, it is exclusively produced together with natural gas. However, in recent years, pioneering discoveries have led to a pivotal change in scientists' understanding of the geology that helps helium accumulate. Researchers have uncovered reservoirs of primary, "carbon-free" helium — large accumulations of the gas that are highly concentrated and don't contain methane — that could revolutionize the industry. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. This new understanding has fueled exploration projects in a handful of regions around the world. "It's a new industry," Thomas Abraham-James, co-founder and CEO of the exploration company Pulsar Helium, told Live Science. Gas wells with helium levels of 0.3% and above were tapped to fuel a growing number of industries and form a stockpile, the Federal Helium Reserve in Amarillo, Texas. But helium has been produced only as a minor byproduct, usually found in tiny amounts mixed in with natural gases such as methane. That's because gases like methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) are required to transport helium from the middle part of Earth's crust to shallower regions, Chris Ballentine, a professor of geochemistry at the University of Oxford, told Live Science in an email. Helium forms in the top 16 miles (25 kilometers) of Earth's crust when uranium and thorium break down into other radioactive elements, emitting alpha particles, or helium nuclei, in the process. These helium nuclei gain two electrons from atoms in their environment to form helium atoms, which then migrate and gradually collect in groundwater down to 10 miles (16 km) below Earth's surface, Ballentine said. So other, more ubiquitous gases, like methane and CO2, are typically needed to entrain helium and form the bubbles that rise toward geological traps, Ballentine said. But helium also gets trapped, because natural gas fields often have strong seals, research suggests. Natural gas reservoirs form beneath layers of fine-grained "cap" rocks "and minerals. In Australia's Amadeus Basin, for example, helium and natural gas are locked beneath a thick layer of salt, which is a "perfect" seal, Jon Gluyas, a professor of geoenergy, carbon capture and storage at Durham University in the U.K., told Live Science. As a result, most regions with helium-producing rocks emit some helium, so "if you went out with a sensitive enough instrument, you would find it," he said. Helium's association with natural gas means producers can extract both at the same time, but this approach has major drawbacks. For one, the helium industry currently has an indirect carbon footprint of about 350 million tons (320 million metric tons) per year, which is bigger than all but 20 countries' carbon footprints. A second downside is that countries with natural gas deposits and the companies drilling these deposits control the world's supply of helium. Depending on other countries for helium introduces risks related to regional geopolitics, Gluyas said. Algeria and Russia are also leading helium producers, raising similar concerns. In the U.S., the lower profitable limit to separate helium from natural gas is 0.3%, but some countries with different production and transport methods have much smaller thresholds. Data show that only about 1 in 6 natural gas reservoirs in the U.S. has helium levels higher than 0.3% and that levels above 7% are extremely rare, meaning economically useful helium concentrations are the exception in the U.S. Crucially, the Rukwa Rift Basin doesn't have reservoirs of natural gas or other hydrocarbons. This was the first major confirmed discovery of a hydrocarbon-free helium reservoir, and it sparked an ongoing worldwide hunt for other such reservoirs. "The approach we adopted essentially is similar to that which any explorer would use for petroleum — we went looking for seeps," Gluyas said. Helium seeps are "all over the show," he said, but locating them is trickier than finding petroleum because helium is odorless, colorless and usually at low concentrations. From then on, researchers and exploration companies tried to determine whether known helium seeps led to hydrocarbon-free reservoirs with high concentrations of the noble gas. In 2021, for example, the exploration company Pulsar Helium acquired land near Babbitt, Minnesota, where a company searching for nickel had previously found gas with high helium concentrations. Pulsar Helium drilled a well down to 2,200 feet (670 meters) in early 2024 and found a huge gas reservoir with helium concentrations up to 14.5% — the highest the industry has ever seen in North America. CO2 concentrations were above 70%, but the company views this as an opportunity rather than a problem, because the gas is pure enough to be used for carbonated beverages, water treatment, food preservation and medicine. Shortly after the discovery in Tanzania, geologists identified five key conditions needed to form accumulations of helium without natural gas. The best helium source rocks are ones that contain uranium or thorium, and are usually composed entirely of crystallized minerals, Gluyas, Ballentine and their colleagues wrote in a 2024 article for the Energy Geoscience Conference Series. That's because crystalline rocks solidify from magma cooling extremely slowly underground. This unhurried process concentrates radioactive uranium and thorium, which are unstable elements in mineral structures and therefore among the last to be incorporated. Granite is one of the best helium sources, Ballentine said. Normally, helium is frozen in a mineral's lattice structure because that structure is "blocked" — or doesn't exchange molecules with its surroundings. That temperature varies, but can be above about 160 F (70 C) for one of the most common helium-containing minerals. Often the source of heat is volcanism or geothermal heat, so hydrocarbon-free helium reservoirs typically occur in regions where there is, or once was, volcanism. Similarly, Pulsar Helium's exploration site in Minnesota sits on an ancient tear in North America's crust called the Midcontinent Rift System. This rift system started and then failed about 1.1 billion years ago, producing intense volcanic activity during the roughly 100,000 years it was active. That's because when nitrogen reaches its bubble point, it captures helium atoms and taxies them until the gases either escape into the atmosphere or are trapped. But for that to happen, the cap rocks must form an impermeable seal. The fifth and final condition is that these cap rocks must sit atop fractured, porous "reservoir" rocks that can store gas, Ballentine, Gluyas and their colleagues wrote in the 2024 article. Helium reservoirs with impermeable seals can hold gases for long periods of geological time. Tests over the summer showed high flow rates to the surface and stable helium concentrations of up to 8% at both wells, "providing a robust foundation for future development," Abraham-James said in a September statement. Since then, Pulsar Helium has drilled an additional well down to 3,507 feet (1,069 m) and opened two more wells. "Like Minnesota, its helium is not associated with hydrocarbons. We conducted a seismic survey last year, and that went some ways to mapping the reservoir." Located about 3 miles (5 km) from the coastal settlement of Ittoqqortoormiit, the site in East Greenland looks promising for helium and geothermal energy production, which could limit the settlement's dependency on fossil fuels, Abraham-James said. Mapping in 2024 revealed a zone of crust with temperatures reaching 266 F (130 C), as well as a fractured reservoir that researchers linked to gas emissions at the surface containing up to 0.8% helium, according to a statement from Pulsar Helium. Any helium produced in East Greenland would likely go to the local community, Abraham-James said. Similarly, helium produced in Minnesota would be sold inside the U.S. to supply MRI scanners, semiconductor fabrication and space launches, he said. Helium shortages in the U.S. have eased somewhat since early 2024, partly thanks to additional supplies from natural gas fields, said Nicholas Fitzkee, a professor of chemistry at Mississippi State University. "But having a larger domestic supply would be valuable, because it could insulate the U.S. from geopolitical instabilities that have contributed to past helium shortages," Fitzkee told Live Science in an email. Halfway across the globe, prospecting in Tanzania is also ongoing, with two exploration companies currently reporting helium levels of 5.5% and 2.46% at different ends of the Rukwa Rift Basin. But these wells don't provide a clear picture of the reservoir yet, and the reservoir may not end up fulfilling researchers' expectations. The Bakreswar-Tantloi area sits on ancient granitic rocks that are rich in uranium and therefore produce helium. Closer to home, researchers are analyzing the conditions for potential helium accumulations beneath and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is rooted in the Wyoming Craton, a prehistoric region of crust and upper mantle that contains 3.5 billion-year-old rocks known to produce huge quantities of helium. Thanks to Yellowstone's countless geothermal features and volcanic structures, helium may be accumulating in reservoirs beneath or peripheral to the park, although it's more likely that the gas is circulating and escaping into the atmosphere through a complex system of natural pipes. —Giant reserves of 'gold' hydrogen may be lurking beneath at least 30 US states, 1st-of-its-kind map reveals But beyond Yellowstone, it's important for existing hydrocarbon-free helium projects to complete their evaluations and start selling the gas as soon as possible, Gluyas said. "There is a huge need for helium," he said. However, Fitzkee sees another way forward — rolling out technologies that can recycle or lower our helium consumption. That could be through installing helium recovery systems or engineering room-temperature alternatives to current helium-hungry technologies, he added. "Ultimately, we cannot mine our way out of future helium shortages," he said. "Helium is non-renewable, and we have no easy way to make more at scale."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, December 5, Logan Paul wrote a lengthy tweet about one of his team members spotting a potential UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena) in the sky on Thursday evening. Attaching a screenshot of his text message exchange with Jorge in his tweet, the podcaster spoke about an "Orb shoot straight up into the sky above the marina in Puerto Rico," which Jorge was convinced was an "hyper-advanced technology." Yesterday at 6:29pm, my teammate Jorge texted me saying he'd just watched an Orb shoot straight up into the sky above the marina in Puerto Rico. Paul then connected that conversation to the next day, when the owner of a local pizza store he walked into mentioned a similar incident, describing it as "a bright light flying across the sky". The tweet has since gone viral with over 1.1 million views.

According to Marca, Paul acknowledged conversations about Trump possibly attending the WWE star's retirement match, while stressing that nothing is confirmed yet. For the unversed, John Cena's final match is scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C.'s Capital One Arena next week, on December 13. WWE's CEO, Nick Khan praised Cena's attitude as "unparalleled" on the Impaulsive podcast, adding:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural fans made it clear that they were thrilled about the cast's latest reunion — and that was even before a barb about President Donald Trump seemed to conjure up positive feelings from the boisterous crowd. Former co-stars Misha Collins, Kathryn Newton, Jim Beaver and Rob Benedict, along with show director Richard Speight Jr., took the stage at CCXP in São Paulo on Thursday to celebrate 20 years of the series that launched in 2006. Red Sea: Michael Caine, Adrien Brody, Vin Diesel, Jessica Alba and Uma Thurman Spotted in Saudi Arabia as Fest Kicks Off With 'Giant' “But here, there must be a lag or something because you still know what Supernatural is.” “You mean like, what kind of an evil monster character would we want to go up against?” Collins asked for clarification. This spurred a significant cheer from the onlookers, leading Collins to add, “We've found our people. So, not a big MAGA crowd here?” The moderator did not respond to his remarks and promptly moved along to a video portion of the event. “I'm sure Claire's out there, still kicking ass and taking names,” Newton responded.
