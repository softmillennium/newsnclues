Finally, in 2025, over the course of a fortnight at Roland Garros, they passed it to a new generation.The tournament began with Nadal waving good-bye to the game in a special ceremony inside his home away from home, Court Philippe Chatrier.Twelve days later, Djokovic walked out of that same arena with a clump of its sacred clay in his hands, and said he may never be back.Two days after that, their young successors, Carlos Alcaraz, 22, and Jannik Sinner, then 23, played their first Grand Slam final. By the time it was over, they had proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were ready to pick up the torch and keep sprinting with it.

It ended, after all of that, with Alcaraz raising his game to a place where no one else—Sinner included—could go.“There were a few moments of the match that, I mean, the level was insane,” Alcaraz said.“Best match that I've played in my career in a Grand Slam.”It didn't always look like it would end up that way. And that king didn't appear to be Alcaraz. Alcaraz's 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (2) win took 5 hours and 29 minutes, making it the longest final in Roland Garros history.

He chattered angrily with his coaches, unable to land on a successful tactic.“His head's gone a bit AWOL here,” John McEnroe said in the commentary booth.Even when Alcaraz regained his concentration, it didn't seem to matter. The second set ended with the Spaniard belting a forehand crosscourt, only to see Sinner stretch wide and snap back an even better forehand, at a sharper angle. The Italian had now won 20 straight sets at Roland Garros, and needed just one more. After he broke to start the third, it felt like he had a clear path to perfection, and the title. “I felt like everything he's doing was going to be in.” “His head's gone a bit AWOL here,” John McEnroe said in the commentary booth.Even when Alcaraz regained his concentration, it didn't seem to matter.

Just as often, it can make him feel the weight of what he's trying to accomplish. Sinner really only made one mistake early in the third set, but against Alcaraz it was one more than he could afford.Serving at 1-0, up 40-30, he hit a forehand that landed just wide. Two games later, with Alcaraz serving at 3-5, Sinner reached 0-40, triple championship point.Now it was Alcaraz's turn to find his best when he had to have it. He immediately cut out the errors, and forced Sinner to beat him. From there, the Spaniard, like a man freed from jail, happily rampaged through a fourth-set tiebreaker, and went up an early break in the fifth.“I just believe all the time,” Alcaraz said. “I never have doubt about myself, even though in those match points down. I thought just one point at a time.” Serving at 1-0, up 40-30, he hit a forehand that landed just wide.

There was no way he could lose now, right? Sinner went on the attack, won a point with a seemingly impossible get and winning re-drop, broke for 5-5 and held for 6-5. “In Grand Slams you try to start from zero again. But again, I stayed there mentally.”Sadly for Sinner, his finest moment would just be a prelude to an even better one for Alcaraz.Down 5-6 in the fifth, Alcaraz fell behind 15-30 when Sinner played an immaculate half-volley from behind his body. On the next point, Sinner fired what looked to be a winning crosscourt forehand, which would have given him two more match points. Somehow, Alcaraz tracked it down, stuck out his racquet, and sliced a forehand that landed on the sideline.
