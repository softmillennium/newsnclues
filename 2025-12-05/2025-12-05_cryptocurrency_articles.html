                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Milk Mocha takes a different route by turning digital collectibles into access keys. These NFTs aren't just art; they unlock features, rewards, and experiences inside a rapidly growing ecosystem. It's part of a larger economy powered by $HUGS tokens, aiming to appeal to users looking for emotional value and crypto with high ROI potential. By embedding utility, scarcity, and community governance into each NFT, Milk Mocha offers a blueprint for how digital ownership can feel meaningful, interactive, and rewarding. The goal of Milk Mocha NFTs isn't just to sit in a wallet and look cute. Holders can enter exclusive mini-games, join private in-game events, or unlock areas non-holders can't see. These privileges cannot be bought with traditional currency, only through verified NFT ownership using $HUGS tokens. Instead of simply appreciating in value, they provide ongoing utility. For users exploring crypto with high ROI potential, utility-backed NFTs provide more stability than speculation alone. Milk Mocha adds a gaming twist to NFT ownership through its burn-to-upgrade system. Instead of relying on luck or blind minting, users can actively improve their digital assets. This system mirrors game mechanics people are already used to, leveling up, customizing, and earning status. At the same time, it supports a shrinking token supply, which long-term supporters will appreciate. While many projects issue NFTs and move on, Milk Mocha creates a continuous loop where users participate, upgrade, and reinvest within the ecosystem. This simple rule creates consistent demand every time someone wants to mint, upgrade, or trade. The system is built to reward active participants and limit passive speculation. Unlike standard collectibles, these assets fuel both engagement and token velocity. For holders focused on the future of Web3 economies rather than quick trends, this design creates an ecosystem where utility, ownership, and spending are all connected. What makes Milk Mocha stand out is how the NFTs plug into wider community features rather than existing in isolation. Ownership gives access to governance through the Milk Mocha DAO, where holders can vote on new features, NFT themes, or merchandise lines. In addition, NFTs may unlock early access to charity initiatives, aligning with the brand's message of kindness. This mix of emotional branding and functional design builds user loyalty without forcing hype. There's also the bridge to physical products, certain plushies and collectibles are available only to NFT holders, turning digital ownership into real-world access. While it's not guaranteed to be a crypto with high ROI potential, the project builds real value through utility instead of speculation. Each utility is tied to $HUGS tokens, creating natural demand and token circulation. The burn-to-upgrade system adds progression and reduces supply over time. While no project guarantees profit, these mechanics may appeal to those exploring digital assets beyond surface-level art. Instead of passive holding, Milk Mocha encourages active participation, creativity, and community decision-making, an approach that could influence how future NFT ecosystems function.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (CBS12) — Famous-faced robo-dogs excreting NFT portraits offers a spectacle with a serious question beneath it: who controls the algorithms deciding what we see?

Michael Joseph Winkelmann, professionally known as the artist "Beeple," unveiled his newest interactive exhibit, "Regular Animals," to awestruck Art fans at Art Basel in Miami Beach on Wednesday. 

The Bizarre exhibit features hyper-realistic masks of Andy Warhol, Pablo Picasso, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and more on flesh colored robo-dog bodies that poop out pictures of the crowd in their respective aesthetics.

Elon Musk's robot pooped black and white photos, Zuckerberg's robot in a blue filter, Picasso in a pixelated "cubism," etc.

But the digital dumps are more than photos; they're Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that serve as free souvenirs for event goers, according to CNN. 

CNN spoke with Beeple in an exclusive interview where he revealed the meaning behind the viral art:

Beeple first hit the headlines during the surge of NFTs in 2021 when he broke records by selling a 5,000 photo collage for $69.3 million at Christie's.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto prices fell sharply again Friday, with Bitcoin diving below the $90,000 mark while Ethereum flirted with a drop below the $3,000 mark—all while crypto liquidations piled up across the board. Bitcoin fell to $88,420 on Friday morning and was recently trading at $89,215, marking a more than 3% drop over the last 24 hours as the leading cryptocurrency dove from a price above the $92,000 level. That continues a trend of Bitcoin being especially volatile in recent weeks, including diving to a seven-month low of about $81,000 in late November. That slump came following a new all-time high mark for Bitcoin of $126,080, set in early October. Bitcoin is now down almost 30% since setting that record. Liquidations over the last day have tallied more than $493 million, as of this writing, according to data from CoinGlass, after sitting right at the $500 million mark not long ago. Bitcoin leads the carnage with $191 million worth of liquidations, and the vast majority—$412 million worth—of the total liquidations were long positions, or bets that an asset's price will increase. Why crypto prices are falling again isn't immediately obvious, particularly since major stock market indices are slightly green on the day, with the S&P 500 nearing another all-time high as traders increasingly expect a third interest rate cut for this year at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Crypto-centric stocks, however, are falling alongside digital assets, with Bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK) down 8% with others like Bitfarms (BITF) and Hive Digital (HIVE) both falling about 5% on the day. Coinbase (COIN) has fallen less than 1% on the day, with Strategy (MSTR) and Robinhood (HOOD) both showing roughly 3% drops.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House's freshly unveiled National Security Strategy reads less like a traditional diplomatic blueprint and more like a call for global fiscal expansion. The core of the strategy, signed by President Donald Trump, explicitly champions an "America First" agenda backed by significant economic and military reorientation both at home and abroad. Consider the directives: the strategy mandates that NATO allies raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, a hefty increase from its long-standing mandate of 2%. Japan and South Korea are also expected to spend more. "Given President Trump's insistence on increased burden-sharing from Japan and South Korea, we must urge these countries to increase defense spending, with a focus on the capabilities—including new capabilities—necessary to deter adversaries and protect the First Island Chain," the strategy says. Funding this kind of monumental expenditure inevitably means more government borrowing or bond supply worldwide, which would drive up bond yields, the cost of capital, and inflation, making it harder for central banks to cut rates. In fact, rate cuts may have little impact as increasing bond supply will likely keep yields elevated. Moreover, increased borrowing by many of the already heavily indebted advanced nations could raise fiscal crisis risks. It means that the U.S. may not import cheap labour at a pace seen in earlier years, which could make wages sticky, adding to inflation. Gold has surged 60% this year despite the U.S. 10-year yield staying stubbornly above 4%, while BTC is now down nearly 5% on a year-to-date basis. Only time will tell if it evolves into digital gold in a world increasingly fiscally emboldened.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Traders and analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Ethereum (ETH) closely. This simple tool could hint at whether Ethereum is about to bounce back, or if it might dip further. When RSI is high (often above 70), it can mean Ethereum may be “overbought”meaning many have bought recently and a price drop is possible. Using these signals helps traders guess when ETH might bounce or fall. Recently, Ethereum's RSI dropped sharply, with some charts showing “oversold” signals for the first time in a while. For example, when ETH got deeply oversold earlier in 2025, it eventually bounced hard. Some analysts now suggest that ETH's low RSI could mean the worst of the recent drop is behind us or at least a relief bounce could be nearing. In April 2025, ETH's RSI had dipped to a low point; soon after, the coin rallied significantly. Historically, when Ethereum's RSI dropped below oversold levels, that often marked a bottom — at least in the short term. But it's not always smooth: after oversold conditions, Ethereum can bounce, but the rebound might stall if broader market conditions stay weak. So while low RSI often signals opportunity, it doesn't guarantee smooth sailing upward. Many traders seem to be watching ETH carefully after recent dips. If Ethereum fails to hold key support zones, price could dip further regardless of RSI. This split between cautious optimism and risk‑awareness reflects just how fragile momentum can be right now. RSI suggests possible recovery — but nothing is certain yet. Why RSI Alone Isn't Enough Look at the Bigger Picture RSI doesn't factor in big news, economic events, or external shocks. Ethereum's price also depends on broader market sentiment, overall crypto demand, and interest from large investors. Sometimes, RSI may show oversold yet price still drops if external conditions worsen. That's why many analysts combine RSI with other tools support/resistance levels, moving averages, and on‑chain data to form a fuller picture. If ETH bounces from those zones while RSI stays low or recovers, that could signal a strong rebound. On the flip side, if support fails, look out: price corrections could resume despite bullish RSI signals. In short: RSI gives a hint but support/resistance zones might decide the real outcome. Here are a few paths ETH might take depending on how things play out: Bounce + Rally: RSI stays low, support holds, and price climbs back toward recent highs. Which scenario plays out depends on many factors not just RSI. Use it as one tool among several to make informed decisions. With current chart signals showing low RSI, many feel ETH could be near a turning point. Others remain wary and that split is exactly what makes this moment interesting. The “ethereum rsi now” condition suggests we could be nearing a bottom, but nothing is certain. Watch for support zones, broader market signals, and trading volume. If things line up oversold RSI, stable support levels, and renewed interest ETH might rebound. I'm an SEO expert specializing in keyword optimization, on-page strategy, and content visibility growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Key indicators such as daily RSI are trending higher despite muted volume and weak OBV, suggesting momentum is building for an upside continuation. Low weekend trading volumes and potential CME gaps warrant caution. Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin, piercing overhead resistance on consecutive sessions and positioning for a short-term target of $3,435 from the October 10 low. While volume remains below its moving average, on-balance volume holds above its MA, and Ethereum rests within the bullish consolidation of the daily TBO Cloud. Notably, the ETH/BTC ratio continues its ascent, historically a precursor to broader altcoin rallies. Combined stablecoin dominance briefly closed above its daily TBO Cloud but is poised to drop back inside, a bullish sign for altcoins that may be confirmed with a TBO Close Long on the stablecoin dominance chart. Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) remains macro bearish as indicated by the TBO Slow line, with expectations for a decline toward 57% and below. When both stablecoin and Bitcoin dominance fall in tandem, historical patterns favor altcoin strength. S&P 500 futures display thin volume and a cautious advance above short-term resistance, though the VIX confirmed a TBO Open Short and fell to 15.79, indicating reduced market fear. The Nikkei 225 is testing highs near 50,390 on subdued volume, trading above the daily TBO Cloud with rising RSI—signs of strength yet potential exhaustion at current levels. Traders should monitor altcoins that have entered the daily TBO Cloud, indicating bullish consolidation. TRX and LINK have recently re-entered their clouds, while SOL's bear flag offers a short-selling setup. ZEC is targeting its TBO Fast line near 450, and FARTCOIN presents a bullish consolidation entry at its daily fast line with supportive volume and OBV. DASH has formed a cluster of TBT Bullish Divergences on the 4-hour chart, aiming for overhead resistance near 57, and ZORA is developing a daily TBT Bullish Divergence cluster to watch.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get the latest news and updates from Dawn Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib announced that Pakistan is set to launch its first “stablecoin” as part of its drive to make virtual assets a part of the economy. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in Dubai, the crypto czar said that Pakistan will “definitely launch” a stablecoin, adding that the country is working on both that and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). “I think it is a great way to collateralise the government debt,” Saqib said. “We want to be at the forefront of this financial digital innovation that is happening. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) said that Saqib also participated in a panel discussion on the future of virtual assets and emerging-market regulation, according to a post on their X account. “He emphasised that for countries like Pakistan, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulation is a key driver of economic growth,” the post read. Earlier this year, Saqib unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beeple Made Robot Dogs With Musk, Zuckerberg, and Warhol Heads That Poop NFTs Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, has brought NFTs back on the scene at Art Basel with a pack of robot quadrupeds that snap photos of visitors and poop printed artworks that double as crypto collectibles. The interactive installation, titled “Regular Animals,” is on show through December 7 at the Miami Beach Convention Center as part of Art Basel's program for new digital works, Zero 10. Each four-legged robot carries a sculpted silicone head based on figures from the worlds of art and tech, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and Beeple himself. “We're increasingly seeing the world through the lens of how they would like us to see it, because they control these very powerful algorithms, and they have unilateral control over how we see the world in many ways,” Beeple said in a video interview with CNN. Here at the Art Basel Awards, @beeple arrives with a couple friends. The robots will “only take pictures and develop these memories, and the memories will be logged on a certain blockchain, because I think that's a great use for this technology,” he added. Artists and tech leaders, like those represented in the robot dogs' heads, continue to “shape what we see, probably more than anybody else,” he added. Each robot was priced at $100,000, except the one with Bezos for its head, which wasn't for sale at the VIP preview on Wednesday, when all pieces sold out. Print photos produced by the robot dogs contain a disclaimer describing the artwork as having been “tested and verified as 100% pure GMO-free, organic dogshit originating from a medium adult dog anus.” Decrypt has reached out to Beeple Studios and Art Basel for comment. Beeple's latest work arrives more than four years since his record-breaking 2021 sale of “Everydays: The First 5000 Days,” a 5,000-image digital collage whose NFT went for a whopping $69.3 million at Christie's. The frenzy for NFTs had largely cooled by mid-2022, with volumes and prices falling across most segments. “It's crazy to me to think about those times, because NFTs have been hated for so much longer than they were loved,” Beeple said in an October 2024 interview. By July this year, industry analytics showed that NFT sales have surged 78%, largely due to lower floor prices, although to the detriment of overall trading volume, which took a 45% quarterly plunge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's latest slide is closely tied to the powerful moves taking place in currency and bond markets. The US dollar has been on a strong upward trend, rising against most major currencies. A stronger dollar tends to pressure assets priced in dollars, and crypto is no exception. Rising yields signal tighter financial conditions and increase the appeal of safer, income-generating assets. Analysts from QuantExperts Group note that this shift raises the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Higher yields also influence funding costs for leveraged traders, which can trigger forced unwinds during sharp market movements. These combined pressures (rising yields and a firming dollar) form the core macro backdrop behind Bitcoin's current weakness. Another important factor weighing on Bitcoin has been the broader retreat from risk. Large technology companies, often viewed as bellwethers for investor sentiment, have been under pressure due to slower revenue forecasts, regulatory concerns and ongoing valuation adjustments. As specialists at QuantExperts Group explain, this behavior creates synchronized selling across tech and crypto, reinforcing downward momentum in both areas. Rising bond yields increase the cost of maintaining leveraged positions, leading some traders to reduce exposure earlier than they normally would. Analysts at QuantExperts Group point out that these structural factors often surface during macro-driven sell-offs. The next phase for Bitcoin will depend heavily on whether current macro trends continue. If the US dollar remains strong and government bond yields keep rising, Bitcoin may face ongoing challenges. Renewed weakness there could pull Bitcoin lower through correlated risk reduction, while signs of stabilization might help crypto prices find a firmer footing. For now, traders are watching currency moves, bond markets and tech-sector sentiment as key indicators of where Bitcoin might head next.

Signing Day Sports (NYSE American: SGN) released a shareholder letter updating its proposed business combination with BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure. The Registration Statement on Form S-4 was filed on Dec 1, 2025 and the transaction is expected to close in Q1 2026, subject to shareholder and NYSE American approvals. The deal converts Signing Day stock into ~8.5% of the combined company (~$20.0M) and BlockchAIn equity into ~91.5% (~$215.0M), plus an 11.628% earnout if BlockchAIn achieves EBITDA of $25M in 2026. BlockchAIn operates a 40 MW South Carolina data center (2024 revenue ~$22.9M, net income ~$5.7M) and plans a 150 MW Texas campus with 34.5kV interconnect for activation in 2027. SGN is up 6.78% while peers are mixed: ELWS -0.28%, IDAI +2.97%, FTFT +4.58%, SOPA +4.17%, MASK flat. Over the last few months, SGN has repeatedly highlighted its proposed business combination with One Blockchain/BlockchAIn and modest operating progress. Today's AI/HPC-focused shareholder letter continues this strategic narrative against a backdrop of prior sell-the-news reactions. An effective S-3 shelf dated Aug 29, 2025 registers up to 1,297,322 shares with modeled proceeds between $1.62M and $2.59M. Although not yet effective, this structure allows SGN to raise equity capital relatively quickly once usable, which could support operations or the combination but would be dilutive to existing holders if fully utilized. This announcement highlights SGN's proposed combination with a historically profitable AI/HPC data-center platform and clarifies that SGN holders would own about 8.5% of a business valued near the latest $646.0M midpoint fairness estimate. Investors may track progress of the S-4 process, shareholder approvals, and execution on the 40 MW South Carolina and planned 150 MW Texas sites. Attention to SGN's separate liquidity options under its S-3 shelf and ongoing operating performance remains important. SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Dec.  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Signing Day Sports, Inc. (“Signing Day Sports” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: SGN) today announced the release of a shareholder letter from its Chairman and CEO, Daniel Nelson. As previously announced, Signing Day Sports entered into a Business Combination Agreement with BlockchAIn and certain other affiliates of BlockchAIn on May 27, 2025, as amended on November 10, 2025 (as amended, the “Business Combination Agreement”). BlockchAIn LLC's securityholders at closing will be eligible for an earnout equal to an additional 11.628% of the total shares of the combined company before consideration to third parties, if BlockchAIn Inc. achieves or exceeds net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $25 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2026. On December 1, 2025, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the “Registration Statement”) was publicly filed by BlockchAIn Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As we work toward completing our proposed business combination with BlockchAIn, I want to provide an update on why we believe it positions our shareholders for significant long-term value creation. The most recent fairness opinion, delivered in November 2025, assessed BlockchAIn using updated 2026 revenue projections and comparable company data. The foregoing valuations are subject to certain limitations, assumptions, and qualifications. BlockchAIn's value proposition is grounded in its plans to expand its portfolio of high-density compute assets designed for AI applications, bitcoin mining, and potentially other high-performance computing (HPC) applications. BlockchAIn is currently a company with a track record of revenue and profitability that is poised for growth within the HPC and AI-related digital infrastructure markets. Amid increasing sustainability standards and renewed emphasis on domestic infrastructure, BlockchAIn is positioned to pursue opportunities across a wide range of compute-intensive applications. Key infrastructure assets include a 40 MW high-density data center in South Carolina, one of the most extensive crypto-mining facilities in the state, and a planned 150 MW data center campus in Texas with favorable economics with 34.5kV of interconnectivity to the grid for activation in 2027. The Texas facility can be modularly built providing flexibility for crypto mining and/or AI and HPC data hosting activities. This capital-efficient and flexible modular business model will provide BlockchAIn with optionality to pursue different revenue mixes. The combination may also create meaningful strategic benefits for Signing Day Sports, including to support the launch of new Signing Day Sports platform features, while also enabling potential new revenue streams through third-party data hosting services in adjacent sports technology and education markets. Signing Day Sports will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary following completion of the transaction, enabling the Company to preserve its mission and brand while benefiting from the combined business's infrastructure, scale, and cash flow profile. In light of all of the above, the Signing Day Sports Board believes the proposed business combination offers shareholders access to a historically profitable, scalable AI and HPC data-center platform under favorable terms. The combined company will be larger, more diversified, and better positioned to compete in high-growth technology markets, while maintaining support for student-athletes and college programs. We view this as a compelling opportunity for shareholders to gain exposure at an attractive entry point into the HPC and AI infrastructure sectors. Thank you for your continued support as we advance this transformative transaction. Daniel NelsonChief Executive Officer and ChairmanSigning Day Sports, Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home > CryptoCurrency News > China Issues $600M in On-Chain Digital Yuan Bonds, Signaling Blockchain Shift Huaxia Bank has just set a precedent in the trend of financial technology and digital currency. The operation was executed through its commercial shipping subsidiary, Huaxia Financial Leasing. This mechanism not only ensures the immutability of all transactions but also allows investors to verify relevant information at any time. This step could simplify the cost structure and accelerate the path for more Chinese companies to launch loans and financial products powered by Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The bonds, described as a “national-first” move by the entity, are scheduled to mature in three years and offer an annual yield (coupon rate) of 1.84%. It is worth noting that, unlike many CBDCs under development, the digital yuan itself does not use blockchain technology. However, its integration into this distributed ledger platform underscores China's willingness to experiment with new forms of financing. The digital yuan pilot program, which began in April 2021, has already achieved cumulative transactions of $2 trillion and boasts more than 225 million people with open personal digital wallets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its supporters now include some of the country's most powerful people, including President Donald Trump and initially hesitant financial institutions, while the first major piece of crypto legislation passed Congress earlier this year. Now, Indiana is looking for a slice of the windfall. The topic was one of just a few to get an earlier-than-usual hearing as lawmakers consider redistricting, signaling it's a major topic of interest among Republicans. “Crypto policy will become a mainstay of this committee's work for probably years to come,” said bill author Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson, at a House Financial Institutions Committee meeting Dec. 4. Though the bill would allow public investment funds to delve into the world of digital currency, it stops short of allowing direct crypto investments. The state investment programs required to provide such options include the 529 education savings plan and certain retirement funds for teachers, public employees and lawmakers. It also allows other state investment funds to place their assets in crypto EFTs. While less volatile than a direct investment, it's not entirely without risk. Because there is less oversight in the underlying crypto market, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned it's difficult to prevent fraud and ensure fairness, even for EFT investors. Though neutral on the bill, Green said IPRS would want to ensure there were proper disclaimers about volatility. Another aspect of the bill limits how local governments and state agencies can regulate crypto, though Pierce said it's only intended to ensure laws don't unfairly target crypto. Specifically, it would prohibit regulation of an individual or a business' ability to accept digital currency as payment, including by taxing use of the payment method.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This has given an estimated 80% of UK internet users over the age of 14 - equating to around 40 million people - greater control over how they are tracked for personalised advertising. Our assessment focused on three key areas of compliance: Of the sites that were compliant with our testing criteria, 415 passed without any intervention. This involved sending letters to website operators highlighting their shortcomings in compliance and, where this did not lead to change, opening investigations and, in 17 cases, issuing preliminary enforcement notices (PENs). We continue with action in relation to the 21 websites that have still not passed our testing criteria. We are committed to upholding cookie compliance and will continue to periodically test the UK's top 1,000 websites, ensuring they meet their legal requirements. We want to ensure that websites that we have brought into compliance with the cookie rules do not simply revert to their previously unlawful practices because they think it will go under the radar. We will continue to monitor compliance and engage with industry to ensure they uphold their legal obligations, while also supporting innovation that respects people's privacy.” Our action to tackle cookie compliance has seen significant changes that have improved user experiences online, including a greater prevalence of “reject” options on cookie banners and a lower prevalence of cookies being placed before consent has been given or after it has been refused. The next update on our work will be provided in 2026. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a series of enforcement notices and practice recommendations to several public authorities after identifying significant failures to comply with the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2000. The ICO yesterday announced that they will be scrutinising how popular mobile games played by children in the UK protect their online privacy. But our goal is always broader: to raise standards across entire sectors. That means choosing the right regulatory tools to hold decision-makers accountable, set clear expectations, and secure lasting improvements. We have issued an enforcement notice to South Wales Police (SWP) over serious delays in handling subject access requests (SARs). We have fined Carmarthenshire sole trader Bharat Singh Chand £200,000 for sending almost one million spam texts about debt solutions and energy saving grants. Today we've launched a consultation on our approach to how charities can use new rules that allow greater use of electronic marketing when engaging with supporters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Their failure to keep pace with technological change has eroded their ability to deliver – and with it, the trust of citizens who increasingly feel their taxes are not funding a state capable of getting things done. Sensibly embracing new technologies is one path to tackling both the policy challenge of delivery and the political challenge of trust: rebuilding state capacity and, in doing so, re-establishing belief in the social contract. But governments cannot simply “plug and play” technologies such as artificial intelligence and expect them to solve deep-rooted problems. Adopted on top of brittle, opaque or siloed infrastructure, AI could automate dysfunction rather than fix it – making services less accountable and citizens more disillusioned. Blockchain – a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) – is best understood as part of a broader “digital trust stack”: technologies that help actors who do not fully know or trust one another to share data, verify information and coordinate action in reliable, auditable ways. As governments race to harness AI and other emerging technologies, the strength of this digital trust stack will shape whether technology renews the state's ability to deliver or simply accelerates existing problems. Unlike many other technologies, blockchain does not just require governance – it can enable governance, because auditability and traceability are built into how it works. This commentary offers a clear-eyed analysis that sets out: How governments are already using it today – from verifying digital credentials to improving the reliability of cross-border trade. What policymakers can do now to unlock the long-term value of blockchain and related technologies, from investing in strong data foundations to clarifying governance and regulatory frameworks. Of course, blockchain is no silver bullet for addressing digital trust. [_] It proposed an electronic cash system that worked without banks, clearing houses or central authorities. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer network where everyone could verify the ledger for themselves. At the heart of this system is the blockchain: a distributed digital ledger that lives on many computers across a network. Nakamoto's key innovation was not inventing entirely new technologies, but combining existing tools in a way that created trust without a central authority. These are digital “fingerprints” that uniquely represent data. This allows users to verify authenticity and ownership without exposing sensitive personal information. Copies of the ledger are held across many nodes. These are rules by which a decentralised network agrees on which transactions are valid and in what order, ensuring a single, consistent version of the truth. In bitcoin, this is a mechanism called Proof of Work, in which nodes compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks. Other systems use alternative mechanisms such as Proof of Stake, which can greatly reduce energy consumption and increase throughput. In the digital world, information can be copied endlessly. Bitcoin showed that a decentralised network, following clear rules, could do this automatically. Digital value could be transacted without a central mint or administrator. Beyond money, this architecture opened up new ways to create online records and contracts that anyone could verify but no single actor could secretly alter. Records need not sit in opaque back-office systems. Once recorded, entries cannot be changed without leaving a trace. No single ministry, bank or technology vendor can unilaterally manipulate the record, and the system can be more resilient to outages or attacks because it does not depend on a single database. In the years since the financial crisis, blockchain has therefore been seen not just as a financial innovation, but as an institutional one: a new way of generating and maintaining trust in records and processes. The key policy question is: where does a shared, tamper-evident record genuinely add value over existing infrastructure? The core political and policy question is how blockchain can help governments tackle the twin challenges of delivery and trust. Where multiple parties – ministries, private actors, other states or citizens – need to rely on shared records without fully trusting each other, blockchain components can improve transparency, accountability and resilience. The best-known application is finance (see our case study for an overview): cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, stablecoins such as USDC and smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum that enable programmable transactions (a digital agreement that automatically does what it is designed to do when certain conditions are met). But over the past decade, blockchain has evolved from being seen as a single financial tool to a broader technology stack – a collection of interoperable tools, protocols and ideas that can be combined differently depending on the problem. Underpinning all these examples is a central idea: because blockchain is inherently transparent and auditable, it can help build more trustworthy digital public services. Digital wallets built on blockchain infrastructure can be used to deliver payments and entitlements more transparently and efficiently, especially for those without access to traditional banking. [_] This reduced costs, improved speed and strengthened auditability compared with manual reconciliation processes. Programmable public money – whether via tokenised vouchers, stablecoins or other digital instruments – could enable rapid targeted distribution of aid during crises, such as Oxfam's Unblocked Chain Project in Vanuatu, where programmable rules controlled how and where aid recipients could spend funds (for example, specifying allowable merchants or time limits). In India, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported pilots that record disbursements of state payments and entitlements on distributed ledgers to improve transparency in welfare programmes such as the Public Distribution System. These initiatives remain experimental, but they demonstrate how blockchain can make public spending more traceable, reduce leakage and provide real-time visibility over where funds are going. Modern states depend on data sharing across ministries and agencies. Yet many systems remain siloed, fragile or vulnerable to manipulation. Blockchain and related distributed-trust infrastructures can help log access, prove provenance and reduce single points of failure while preserving privacy. In Estonia, the X-Road platform underpins secure data exchange between public and private entities, enabling citizens to access more than 1,700 services seamlessly. [_] Hash-based ledger techniques are used to timestamp and tag critical logs and data records, enabling authorities to prove that data have not been altered retrospectively and to verify records across systems. [_] Unlike X-Road, which operates within a single national ecosystem, EBSI is designed for a multi-country environment, extending secure interoperability beyond borders. Used well, these infrastructures allow governments to maintain verifiable audit trails, reduce the risk of undetected tampering, and make services more portable and user-centric. Global trade still relies heavily on paper documents, fragmented IT systems and limited visibility across supply chains. Blockchain can help by acting as a shared ledger for tracking goods and documents, while enabling faster, programmable payments. In Singapore, the government-led TradeTrust framework uses blockchain to authenticate and exchange electronic trade documents across jurisdictions, supporting faster customs clearance and reducing fraud risks. But the direction of travel is clear: trusted shared records can reduce friction in trade, strengthen resilience and support more inclusive participation in global markets. Property and land registries are the bedrock of economic security. Yet in many countries, records are incomplete, paper-based or vulnerable to manipulation. Blockchain-related technologies can provide tamper-evident registries where ownership histories are transparent and easier to audit. In Georgia, the national land registry has experimented with blockchain to record property transactions, aiming to give citizens greater confidence in ownership records and reducing opportunities for fraud. [_],[_] These initiatives signal how tokenisation – representing real-world assets as digital tokens – could modernise securities and other asset markets. Tokenisation can, in principle, allow assets such as land, infrastructure or securities to be divided into fractional digital units, broadening the pool of participating investors and improving market efficiency. But the policy challenges – from investor protection to prudential regulation – are significant and require careful design. As governments deploy AI, they face growing pressure to ensure systems are transparent, accountable and secure. [_] The integration of AI, blockchain and smart contracts is still nascent but could enable more trustworthy automated decision-making. In principle, governments could record model versions, key training-data characteristics and performance logs on distributed ledgers, creating tamper-evident audit trails while using privacy-preserving techniques to protect sensitive data. This would support better oversight of how models evolve over time, stronger evidence for regulatory compliance and clearer accountability when decisions are challenged. Some early pilots – for example in South Korea and within EU-funded research projects – have explored blockchain for AI data governance and digital content authentication, particularly in areas such as disinformation and deepfake detection. These examples are early and should not be overstated. But they illustrate a broader point: blockchain's institutional significance for policymakers lies less in any one use case, and more in the fact that transparency, reliability and auditability are built into how it works. Blockchain technologies are reshaping payments, especially across borders – offering faster and cheaper alternatives to the traditional financial-system actors. Stablecoins are the most established of the different forms of digital money, now exceeding $300 billion in circulation (up from $200 billion in 2024), with projections of $500 billion (and in some optimistic cases up to $2 trillion) by 2028. New US regulation has given additional momentum to the stablecoin market this year, with established firms such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup publicly exploring how to participate. At the heart of this varied regulatory landscape lies a complex policy trade-off: regulators are attempting to safeguard consumers and preserve financial stability while also harnessing the potential benefits of digital-asset innovation, including faster payments, financial inclusion and reduced transaction costs. Cross-border payment fees today average 1.5 to 2.5 per cent (and over 6 per cent for remittances),[_] whereas live stablecoin deployment (for example, MoneyGram's use of the Stellar blockchain to move funds) shows sub-five-second settlement with fees below 0.1 per cent. Moving from multi-day correspondent banking to instant or near-instant settlement reduces counterparty risk and releases working capital for businesses. Stablecoins allow conditional, programmable payments – for example, funds automatically released when shipment or customs data are verified – linking payment, compliance and documentation within a single digital workflow, reducing administrative friction and error. For some countries, blockchain-based payments provide a credible alternative to legacy cross-border systems that rely on specific countries, supporting national financial resilience and sovereignty. By enabling low-cost, near-instant transfers without traditional intermediaries, stablecoins can expand global market access for SMEs and suppliers, which would be especially powerful for developing economies. Blockchain-enabled payment systems support faster, cheaper and more inclusive payments – but only if governments make these systems safe, reliable and economically useful. The programmable, borderless nature of blockchain transactions brings powerful advantages, but it also introduces new considerations and risks. Irreversible transfers and a reliance on private platforms – with varying levels of security – expose users to fraud, scams and operational failures. Governments can strengthen user confidence by setting standards for secure custody of backed assets, robust identity-verification rules and clear redress mechanisms so users are protected without stifling innovation. While stablecoins have the potential to strengthen digital financial infrastructure by enabling efficient, programmable and globally interoperable payments, they could also create liquidity pressures or lose their peg during stress events, especially if reserves are opaque or low-quality. To ensure they remain reliable, clear standards around reserve quality, transparency and routine stress testing can help maintain confidence and stability. Well-designed frameworks not only mitigate liquidity risks but also support the development of robust, trustworthy stablecoin markets that complement the broader financial system. The growing use of stablecoins creates opportunities to modernise payments and expand financial access. However, heavy use of foreign-denominated stablecoins may weaken domestic monetary control, and unclear rules push activity offshore. These risks vary depending on a country's local economic conditions, especially around inflation stability and financial openness. Proportionate, predictable and context-sensitive regulation can help preserve monetary sovereignty while also keeping responsible innovation benefits onshore. Overall, building simple, secure and low-cost digital payment rails will be central to future economic growth – requiring swift regulatory clarity, continued experimentation with digital currencies and the integration of blockchain into a trusted digital infrastructure. Use blockchain only where it adds real value. Governments should adopt distributed ledgers only when doing so would clearly improve trust, auditability or cross-institution coordination. Blockchain systems must connect smoothly to existing infrastructure, and because immutable records can lock in mistakes, strong data governance, correction mechanisms and clear technical standards are essential to keep systems accurate, fair and workable in practice. Newer blockchain architectures improve efficiency but trade-offs remain, so governments need to select technologies with realistic performance characteristics and establish unambiguous rules on liability, responsibility and oversight to ensure systems remain resilient and accountable at scale. Blockchain is not a cure-all for problems related to data, trust or service delivery. But perfection should not be the enemy of progress. Drawing on lessons from pilots around the world, four policy priorities stand out. Multiple, potentially mistrusting parties need to maintain a shared record of state, and there is scope for a new intermediary or process to build trust among the transacting stakeholders. Improved data auditability, programmability and resilience would create measurable public value. Before choosing a blockchain-based approach, policymakers should ask: Could a conventional database or API-based integration (coupled with strong identity access management and cyber-security protocols) meet the need more simply? Publishing short case studies of both successful and unsuccessful pilots can help future teams avoid repeating mistakes and clarify where blockchain genuinely adds value. Blockchain pilots succeed or fail largely based on the broader digital foundations in which they are embedded. Governments are uniquely positioned to provide these shared infrastructures. They can also adopt open standards that allow multiple vendors and solutions to interoperate, preventing lock-in and enabling local innovators – especially SMEs and startups – to build services without hoarding user data in proprietary formats. Establish simple, standardised frameworks for pilot design and evaluation. What problem was the pilot meant to solve, and for whom? Publishing even short summaries can have outsized benefits. For example, UK pilots in areas such as digital trade documentation and regulatory reporting have highlighted not only the promise of distributed ledgers, but also the importance of legal recognition of electronic documents and the difficulty of translating complex legal rules into code. [_] Sharing such insights avoids repeating mistakes and refines future designs. Blockchain introduces new roles (validators, token issuers, node operators), new risks (from immutability of incorrect data to novel financial instruments) and new regulatory questions (for example, applications operating across borders, as we highlight in the case study). Clarify responsibilities, liabilities and the legal standing of on-chain records, including how they interact with existing laws on contracts, evidence and data protection. Ensure that regulatory frameworks are technology-neutral but capable of accommodating decentralised architectures, cryptographic proofs and privacy-enhancing technologies. Provide guidance and, where necessary, regulatory sandboxes (for example, safe-harbour environments) where public bodies and firms can test blockchain-based systems under supervision. Interpret privacy and accountability principles in a way that enables privacy-by-design, for instance through encryption, zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure, rather than seeing blockchain and data protection as inherently in conflict. Done well, regulation can be an enabler of responsible innovation rather than a barrier to it, providing the certainty that serious public-sector deployments require. It is whether to build the institutional, legal and technical foundations that allow tools such as blockchain to be used where they add genuine value – and to say no where they do not. Jurisdictions that focus on real problems, adopt principled yet innovation-friendly regulation and invest in shared digital foundations will be best placed to turn promising pilots into lasting institutional capability. In doing so, they can not only harness new technologies, but also rebuild the trust and effectiveness on which the social contract ultimately depends.

It has been a wild ride for cryptos this week. According to Bloomberg, the sell-off erased nearly $1 trillion in fresh leveraged bets on bitcoin. Plus, opportunistic investors have been jumping on the opportunity to snap up crypto at a discount, supporting its price. Nonetheless, bitcoin is still down around 25% off the October highs amid concerns about overvaluations in risky assets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptos. Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) shares skyrocketed over 8% on Tuesday on the back of comments from Ming-Chi Kuo, a respected supply chain analyst from TF International, who said the company could start building Apple's M processors for its MacBook Air and iPad Pro in early 2027. Kuo said the chances of Intel becoming an Apple chip supplier “has recently improved significantly”. It looks like Anthropic could be preparing for an IPO. According to the Financial Times, the AI safety and research company and major rival to OpenAI, held talks with major investment banks and has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to start working on its potential stock market flotation, which could take place as early as next year. Anthropic hired Krishna Rao who worked at Airbnb for six years and focused on its IPO. Although OpenAI has not provided official confirmation, there have been several recent media reports to suggest the company behind ChatGPT could also be laying the groundwork for an IPO. The Bank of England has said: “risks to financial stability have increased during 2025”. The central bank warned that “many risky asset valuations remain materially stretched”, particularly for AI tech companies, which “heightens the risk of a sharp correction”. It said financial stability consequences could arise if AI progress “does not deliver the returns expected by investors”. This adds to a series of warnings from top voices and institutions across the global economy that have raised concerns about fears of an AI bubble. Coinbase Global Inc Ordinary Shares - Class A (NASDAQ:COIN) Palantir Technologies Inc Ordinary Shares - Class A (NASDAQ:PLTR) However, shares fell sharply as investors were hoping for an even bigger beat in terms of its current quarter top line guidance. Shares in Snowflake have sharply outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, surging more than 70%. Strategy Inc Class A (NASDAQ:MSTR) has been caught up in the bitcoin volatility. However, it is the most-bought tech stock on the ii platform so far this week, outpacing even tech giants NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in second and third place respectively. Strategy Inc said it created a $1.4 billion reserve fund so that it does not have to sell some of its $56 billion crypto holdings to cover dividend payments. However, the announcement spooked investors, with Strategy's shares falling sharply on Monday. Strategy has become a popular proxy play on bitcoin via the public markets. However, investors have suffered lately, with shares sliding around 60% from the recent peak this summer. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) will announce its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings after the market close on Wednesday 10 December. In September, Oracle announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI, and Deutsche Bank notes the company “getting little, if any, credit” for this tie-up. However, shares have fallen sharply since September's peak, caught up in the market's concerns about an AI bubble. In its previous quarterly earnings release three months ago, new cloud contracts resulted in impressive growth forecasts, sending its share price soaring. Shares are up 27% year-to-date and analysts are positive, with a consensus buy on the stock and an average target price of $336.82, up 62% from the current share price.
