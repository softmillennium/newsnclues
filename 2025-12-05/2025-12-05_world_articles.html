                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. This particular strike has garnered significant attention due to its clear violation of U.S. and international law because shipwrecked sailors should never be targeted. But it is crucial to note that Donald Trump's entire bombing campaign against vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific is illegal as well. Trump's campaign of extrajudicial violence under the pretext of fighting a “drug war” is reminiscent of the policies of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is currently in custody in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, awaiting trial for murdering alleged drug dealers and users. Like Duterte, Trump's bombing campaign should be considered a crime against humanity. Earlier this morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. Since that double tap bombing, 21 publicly known U.S. airstrikes on 22 vessels have killed at least 83 people. The legal rationale for these bombings has shifted over time, but it is apparently based on a classified memorandum from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel. The memo reportedly claims that the United States is in a state of armed conflict with drug cartels that use drug proceeds to buy weapons and fund violence, so the U.S. is acting in collective self-defense. But on December 1, international law scholars Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman, and Tess Bridgeman argued in Just Security: There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. “There is no evidence that this group is committing an armed attack against the U.S. that would allow the U.S. to use military force against it in national self-defence,” three UN experts have also said. “International law does not allow governments to simply murder alleged drug traffickers,” the experts noted, calling Trump's strikes extrajudicial executions. “Criminal activities should be disrupted, investigated and prosecuted in accordance with the rule of law, including through international cooperation.” An assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies dated February 26 found that Tren de Aragua was neither controlled by the Venezuelan government, nor committing crimes in the United States on its orders. Even if there was a state of armed conflict, these would be war crimes. Without a state of armed conflict, this is just plain murder. But regardless of whether or not there is proof that the victims were trafficking drugs, there is no legal justification for killing them. On October 28, in a post decrying the murder of 57 civilians in attacks on 14 civilian boats up to that point, Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur for the protection of human rights while countering terrorism, and Challis Chair of International Law at the University of Sydney, wrote “A systematic attack on civilians is a crime against humanity under international law.” Rodrigo Duterte was charged by the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber I on March 7, with the crime against humanity of murder committed pursuant to his “war on drugs” while he served as mayor of Davao City and president of the Philippines. While both Duterte and Trump have enacted state violence in their drug wars, they have used different mechanisms — both of them illegal. Whereas Trump launched a military operation to kill alleged drug traffickers, Duterte established police “death squads” to kill the targets of his so-called war on drugs. Unlike Trump, Duterte was supposedly able to identify the targets of his drug war, but that still did not shield him from legal accountability. In a campaign that Catholic leaders called a reign of terror, Duterte ordered that alleged criminals be “neutralized,” which, the ICC chamber said, meant “kill.” Trump has similarly ordered the killing of “narcoterrorists,” with no evidence to support such a designation. Furthermore, Hegseth, Bradley, and all service members who participated in the bombings had a duty to disobey the illegal orders to launch those strikes. Both the ICC's Rome Statute and customary international law punish crimes against humanity, so any state can prosecute them under the well-established doctrine of universal jurisdiction. On October 23, Trump said, “I think we're just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. Trump's hypocrisy became all the more transparent on December 1, when he issued a pardon to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year sentence for expediting the importation of over 400 tons of cocaine into the United States over nearly two decades. During Trump's first term, he praised then-President Duterte, telling him in a telephone call that he was doing “an unbelievable job on the drug problem.” Whereas Duterte used his “war on drugs” as a pretext to neutralize his political opponents, Trump appears to be using his strikes on “drug boats” as a potential lead-up to an unlawful military attack on Venezuela in order to engage in illegal forcible regime change and secure control over the proven oil reserves in Venezuela, the largest in the world. On December 2, Trump declared that he could attack accused drug traffickers who cross Latin America by land “very soon.” Trump also warned it's not just Venezuela he has in his sights but Colombia as well. A few days prior, he announced that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered closed. As Congress remains mute in the face of Trump's impending military attacks, we must mount a full court press. It could issue subpoenas, gather facts, and garner media attention. On December 3, Democratic Senators Tim Kaine (Virginia), Chuck Schumer (New York), and Adam Schiff (California), and Republican Senator Rand Paul (Kentucky) introduced a war powers resolution that “directs the President to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.” This resolution should be supported and senators urged to co-sponsor it, although it is unlikely to pass in the House of Representatives. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Cup athletes, fans, and personnel fear Trump's anti-immigration policies may disrupt the tournament's operation. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. On Saturday, December 6, soccer fans around the world will find out where their favorite teams will be playing in the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Holding the games in three countries means that ease of crossing borders is a fundamental part of the World Cup going smoothly. But already, months before the games begin, concerns are mounting over whether attendees will be able to enter the host countries at all. “Trump has made clear that U.S. restrictions on immigration visas, travel bans, and ongoing ICE kidnappings apply to World Cup fans and, in several cases, to athletes' delegations as well,” Harsha Walia — the author of Border and Rule: Global Migration, Capitalism, and the Rise of Racist Nationalism — told Truthout. “The fact that FIFA is continuing to host the World Cup as planned and has not at all leveraged their business relationship to advocate for human rights commitments signals FIFA's capitulation to growing authoritarianism and protection of capitalist interests,” added Walia, who lives in Vancouver. Cross-border travel has dropped as Canadians seek out other destinations for travel, scared off by images and stories of people being caught up in immigration enforcement, or even disappeared. With 20 new Canadian-built armored vehicles on their way into ICE's possession, oppression from ICE will continue and likely get even worse. Some refugees who have crossed into Canada have been turned away by Canadian border agents only to then be placed into ICE custody and face deportation. On November 28, 2025, Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would prevent migration to the United States by people who are from, in his words, from “the Third World.” One month earlier, he announced that the United States would only accept 7,500 refugees per year, a shockingly low number given that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are 117.3 million forcibly displaced people on the planet. To facilitate entry to the United States to watch the games, the U.S. has created a special FIFA visa for World Cup ticket holders, the U.S. State Department announced in November, which will give fans priority appointments for their visa requirements, or give fans from certain countries access to visa waivers. In October, a star of the international mountain biking world, Jolanda Neff, arrived at the Lake Placid World Cup just 45 minutes before her race started due to visa issues. Coach and veteran of the sport Steve Peat was denied entry entirely. In Canadian MTB magazine, Terry McCall wrote, “to be very clear, both Peaty and Neff are very experienced professionals with solid team backing. This isn't a couple juniors winging it on their first trip overseas,” warning that fans, athletes, and team staff may face similar struggles at future U.S.-based sporting events. Foot Africa reports that already, the U.S. administration has signaled that staff from Iranian and Haitian teams, like player analysts, kinesiologists, and other technical staff, won't be allowed to enter the U.S. for the games. Iranian citizens who are part of that support staff, for example, will likely be rejected. Meanwhile, Canada has not announced a special program for the World Cup. The Government of Canada advises applicants to mention that they're coming to Canada for the World Cup in their application. Toronto Star sports columnist Bruce Arthur notes that while Brazil required ticket holders from some countries to hold visas at the 2014 World Cup, they waived the fees. Simon Black, professor of labor studies at Brock University, says that by increasing the number of teams at the World Cup from the usual 32 teams to 48, there are many more teams from small countries in the Global South where, “under ‘normal' circumstances, it would probably be difficult to get in [to Canada] regardless.” Entering Canada is difficult for people from countries outside of Europe or the United States. A spokesperson from the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said in an email statement: “Canada is excited to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors for the FIFA World Cup 2026, including athletes, coaches, officials, medical staff, media, corporate sponsors and fans from around the world. To head off some of these issues, the Canadian government issued a temporary policy to exempt people who carry a FIFA invitation from work authorization requirements. Canada's visa problems might be overshadowed by an erratic U.S. president who has made immigration enforcement and deportations a key part of his administration's work, but they have increasingly plagued large-scale international events. When the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture was held in Montreal in 2023, a quarter of conference attendees had their visas denied. In a joint letter signed by 76 computer scientists, they wrote “In order to advocate for the best interests of our academic communities, we can only recommend a moratorium in selecting Canada as a destination for such events.” In July 2024, the International Health Economics Association decided to relocate their 2025 conference to Indonesia, asserting they could not process the visas fast enough. Conference organizers had anticipated 1500 people would attend from all over the world. To head off some of these issues, on November 14, 2025, the Canadian government issued a temporary policy to exempt people who carry a FIFA invitation from work authorization requirements that usually apply to foreign nationals who enter Canada. But he points to the detention of Democracy Now! In an ideal world, Orr would like to see FIFA place personnel needs at the center of planning the World Cup. “I expect that there be a robust human rights framework attached to FIFA, and I know the city is working on it, but what does that mean when it comes to enforcement? What does that mean, on the ground, to protect people, sex workers, fans and residents? FIFA is in control of so much,” Orr told Truthout. Black says that given the problems that so many people have had with immigration enforcement in the United States, “I can't not see there being some sort of issue,” during the games. As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Ukraine talks: Delegations from the US and Ukraine will meet again in Florida later today, according to a Ukrainian official, as they attempt to make a breakthrough in ongoing peace talks to end the war. President Donald Trump has been awarded the newly created FIFA Peace Prize during today's World Cup Draw at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. You can follow live updates of the event here. FIFA had remained tight-lipped over who will be bestowed the inaugural Peace Prize amid rumors it was destined for the US president. Infantino and Trump have seemingly developed a close relationship in the buildup to next year's World Cup. He was a vocal supporter of Trump's bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize, an award ultimately given to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado. President Donald Trump — who's expected to receive the FIFA Peace Prize during today's World Cup Draw in Washington — didn't answer a question about whether receiving the award would conflict with his vow to strike “on land” soon in Venezuela. And the administration is facing scrutiny from Congress, including some GOP lawmakers, in the wake of revelations about a so-called “double-tap” strike that killed survivors of an initial strike on an alleged drug vessel. “I think you're going to find that there's a very receptive ear to doing exactly what they're doing, taking out those boats,” he told reporters at the White House Wednesday. “We've done a lot of work at the Kennedy Center. The president's comments come as he continues reshaping Washington's landmarks during his second term. In the months since returning to office, the president has left a visible imprint on the nation's capital, from the Kennedy Center's newly painted columns and planned new carpet and seating, to his vow to rebuild Dulles International Airport, which he recently described as “a terrible airport.” Follow live updates of the 2026 World Cup draw here. Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, the military officer who oversaw the controversial September 2 attack on an alleged drug boat, told lawmakers on Thursday that he had consulted with the uniformed lawyer on duty during the operation before approving a secondary strike that killed survivors, according to two sources with direct knowledge of his congressional briefings. An initial strike killed 9 crew members leaving two survivors clinging to a component of the overturned boat, CNN has reported. During that period Bradley consulted the JAG officer, or judge advocate general officer, who assessed it would be legal to move forward with a second strike, the sources added. The legality of the strike has become a deeply contested topic on Capitol Hill where lawmakers have split along party lines, with most Republicans saying the strikes was justified and Democrats suggesting a war crime may have been committed. First lady Melania Trump held a meaningful reunion Friday, meeting with 24-year-old Caoilinn McLane during a holiday visit to Children's National Hospital. In 2017, McLane was a patient here, battling childhood acute myeloid leukemia at age 15, spending months between the pediatric intensive care unit and the oncology unit at Children's National. Eight years later, Trump returned to the hospital for the annual first lady holiday visit, where she was introduced by McLane, now grown up and in remission, a student at Virginia Military Institute. In a hospital atrium decorated with colorful hot air balloons suspended from the ceiling, a towering, sparkly Christmas tree, and stacks of wrapped presents, Trump also met dozens of children gathered to see her — and Santa Claus. Trump read “How Does Santa Go Down the Chimney,” shook hands with Santa and Mrs. Claus, and shared hugs with some of the children gathered before privately visiting with young patients in the oncology unit. The White House quietly released President Donald Trump's new national security strategy late yesterday, a 33-page document that elevates his “America First” doctrine and sets out the administration's realignment of US foreign policy, from shifting military resources in the Western Hemisphere to taking an unprecedentedly confrontational posture toward Europe. Catch up on some key points in the document: On Europe: The strategy's section on Europe represents a more dramatic escalation, warning that European nations face “economic decline” that could be “eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.” On China: The Trump administration's strategy also outlines a dual-track approach to China, pushing to contain Beijing's global influence while preserving economic ties and maintaining the current conditions on Taiwan, saying that “deterring a conflict over Taiwan, ideally by preserving military overmatch, is a priority.” Read more about Trump's strategy outlined in the document here. Delegations from the US and Ukraine will meet again in Miami later today, according to a Ukrainian official, as they attempt to make a breakthrough in ongoing peace talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine. Ukraine's negotiating team held “constructive talks … on key aspects of the peace process” with their American counterparts yesterday, Oleksandr Bevz, adviser to Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, said on Facebook. “Today, the delegation will continue its work in Miami. The Ukrainian delegation was expected to discuss the outcome of Tuesday's meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. President Donald Trump announced Friday that he has approved “tiny cars” to be manufactured in the United States, although there isn't a specific federal regulation prohibiting small micro cars in the US. “I have just approved TINY CARS to be built in America. Manufacturers have long wanted to do this, just like they are so successfully built in other countries,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They can be propelled by gasoline, electric, or hybrid. These cars of the very near future are inexpensive, safe, fuel efficient and, quite simply, AMAZING!!! The president also praised the idea during a televised Cabinet meeting Wednesday, telling his team he had been struck by “a very small car” he saw during his recent Asia trip, calling them “really cute.” However, some of these small cars from Asia that Trump speaks of have been imported already, although not in significant numbers. There are local regulations on which roads they can drive on, and there are federal rules requiring certain levels of safety for car occupants in case of crashes. But it has been mostly market forces, not regulation, that has stopped the production of ultra small vehicles in the United States. American car buyers have shown a desire for bigger trucks and SUVs, enough so that the traditional “Big Three” US automakers essentially stopped producing small sedans years ago. CNN's Samantha Waldenberg and Chris Isidore contributed to this post. Democratic House Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts has called for the public release of a video showing the so-called double-tap strike on an alleged Caribbean drug boat in September. “I think that we should take (US President Donald Trump) up on what he said … that he's not against releasing this video.” Earlier this week, Trump said that his administration would “certainly” release the footage, which reportedly shows survivors of an initial strike on the vessel being killed. That is critical to keeping the American people safe,” she said, accusing US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Trump administration of an “unprecedented withdrawal of information.” The two men killed in a second strike on a suspected drug vessel in early September did not appear to have communications devices, the top military official overseeing the strike told lawmakers, according to sources. This new information is stoking criticism of the strike, adding to growing questions about its legality. Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a retired US Army pilot, says the new information “tells you the Defense Department has been lying to everybody” for months. “I know what drug interdiction looks like…it is not killing shipwrecked sailors,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss. “We got someone who was charged with a very, very dangerous crime off the streets, and more to come,” Bondi told Fox News. And again, I believe there are more charges to come.” The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., was arrested yesterday and is currently facing two federal explosives charges. Cole is expected to appear before a federal judge in court later today. This post has been updated with reporting on the FBI interviews. CNN's Evan Perez and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed reporting to this post. Still, Macron emphasized that the US needs European input too, as “this is happening on the European continent and we are the providers of security guarantees, as it's we who can speak about sanctions, as it's we that have in our hands the frozen Russian assets, to give some examples.” GOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas — who was briefed by Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley yesterday on the September so-called double-tap strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean — said this morning he did not see evidence of the men on the boat trying to use a radio to call for help. When pressed by John Berman on “CNN News Central” if he saw any evidence of the men trying to use a radio, Cotton said, “No I didn't.” “They were trying to get the boat back up and to continue their mission of spreading these drugs all across America,” Cotton said. CNN exclusively reported yesterday that Bradley told lawmakers during congressional briefings that the two men killed in the strikes did not appear to have radio or other communications devices, according to sources with direct knowledge of his briefings. This revelation comes after defense officials have been quietly pushing back on criticism that killing the two survivors amounted to a war crime by arguing, in part, that they were legitimate targets because they appeared to be radioing for help or backup — reinforcements that, if they had received it, could have theoretically allowed them to continue to traffic the alleged drugs aboard their sinking ship. Suspilne did not give any other details of the meeting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address yesterday: “Our task now is to obtain full information about what was said in Russia, what other reasons Putin found to prolong the war and put pressure on Ukraine, on us, on our independence.” Ukrainian and US officials last held talks on Sunday, also in Miami. At the time, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the meeting as “a very productive and useful session where… additional progress was made.” In Moscow: Russia is awaiting a response from the US following Tuesday's discussions, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russian state media TASS. There are currently no plans for a phone conversation between Putin and Trump, but one can easily be arranged if necessary, Ushakov said, TASS reported. That US-Russia meeting did not yield any breakthroughs on a possible peace deal, but Putin characterized it as “productive.” Putin is currently in India, where he said that Russia was ready to provide an “uninterrupted” supply of fuel to the Indian economy as both countries grapple with the fallout from US sanctions on Russian oil companies. The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams (up from 32) and is set to be played across 16 cities in three countries. Hear from Paul Tenorio, senior writer for The Athletic, as he talks to CNN Sports' Don Riddell about the newly expanded tournament: Trump said he would oversee a sweeping revamp of the center and its programming. Sideline meetings: Trump is also expected to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on the sidelines of the draw, a senior White House official told CNN. Just over three months after a double-tap attack on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean that killed surviving crew members, lawmakers had a private briefing yesterday with Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who oversaw the attack. Since that first attack in September, the US military has killed at least 87 people in strikes that have destroyed 23 boats as part of a campaign that Washington says is aimed at curtailing the flow of drugs into the US. Survivors didn't radio for backup: The two men killed in the second strike were holding onto their capsized boat and did not appear to have communications devices, according to three sources with knowledge of the briefings. Defense officials had previously argued, in part, that they were legitimate targets because they appeared to be radioing for help — reinforcements that could have theoretically allowed them to continue to traffic the drugs aboard their sinking ship. Lawmakers divided: Lawmakers were divided along party lines after the briefing, with a top Democrat calling a video of the incident “one of the most troubling things” he had seen as a congressman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has drawn a stark new line in the war: Ukraine must withdraw its forces from the eastern Donbas region, or Moscow will seize it "by force," he warned on Dec. 4. The word has been in use since the 19th century and has referred not only to modern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but also parts of Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and even regions of southern Russia, where the Siverskyi Donets River also flows. Yet parts of Donbas are also agricultural, with sprawling farmlands surrounding its industrial centers. Donetsk and Luhansk, the two oblasts that make up the core of Donbas, have long been economic powerhouses built on coal, steel, and machinery. Russia's war against Ukraine started not in 2022 but in 2014 — with the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Donbas. That's why Ukrainians often refer to 2022 as the start of the full-scale phase of a war that had already been raging for years. From the beginning, Moscow tried to disguise its aggression. While boasting about the annexation of Crimea, it denied involvement in its war in Donbas, promoting a false narrative that allegedly local "separatists" were responsible for the fighting. The proxy republics were Kremlin creations — armed, funded, and directed from Moscow as part of a broader campaign to destabilize Ukraine. For much of Ukraine's modern history, Donbas was its economic engine. According to the London-based Center for Economics and Business Research, the region accounted for roughly 15.7% of Ukraine's GDP and 14.7% of its population before 2014. The work of many of these enterprises came to a standstill as Russian attacks damaged industrial property, millions of locals fled the hostilities, and blockades between Ukraine and Russian-occupied territories abolished trade. The invasion also led to a fall in Ukraine's international exports and foreign investment. Between 2014 and 2021, the same research center estimated Ukraine lost $102 billion due to the war in Donbas — about 8% of its pre-war GDP each year. Still, many businesses continued to operate, in spite of a front line that moved closer after 2022. Earlier this year, however, a critical Donbas coal mine was forced to close due Russia's advances in the area. At least two million people were forced to flee their homes because of the fighting. Roughly the same amount of people continued to live under Russian occupation — amid poverty, Kremlin indoctrination, and crossfire along the front, as Ukraine fought off continuous Russian attacks. Since 2022, Russia has destroyed many cities and villages in the region. In Mariupol alone, which was home to about 500,000 people before Moscow's full-scale invasion, estimates suggest that Russia has killed up to 75,000 civilians. "When you talk about Donetsk Oblast like a hot cake that can be passed around," Oleksii Ladyka, a local journalist from Kramatorsk now serving with Ukraine's 92nd Assault Brigade, told the Kyiv Independent in August. In reality, language has never equaled nationality or political leaning. Before 2014, the vast majority of Donetsk and Luhansk residents identified as Ukrainian citizens. Polls consistently showed that most wanted to remain part of Ukraine. Russia has long exploited linguistic ties to justify its aggression — but speaking Russian does not mean supporting Moscow. A poll conducted by the Kyiv-based think tank Razumkov Center between April 24 and May 4, 2025, found that 82% of Ukraine's Russian-speaking population expressed a negative view of Russia. Years of neglect and war damage have also left Russian-occupied areas of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts with barely functioning infrastructure, leading to a water crisis in these regions in the summer of 2025. By mid-August 2025, Russia had occupied 19% of Ukraine's territory, according to Reuters. Luhansk Oblast is almost entirely under Russian control, while Ukrainian forces continue to hold firm in parts of Donetsk Oblast — roughly 6,600 square kilometers (2,550 square miles), including the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, with the battle for Pokrovsk still continuing. For Putin, full control over Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast remains a top demand. As the Economist put it, the real reason lies in Ukraine's so-called "fortress belt" — a 50-kilometer (31-mile) stretch of heavily fortified towns from Sloviansk and Kramatorsk to Druzhkivka and Kostiantynivka. This network of fortifications, trenches, minefields, and anti-tank barriers has been continuously strengthened since 2014. After Bakhmut was occupied in 2023, Ukraine redoubled its efforts to reinforce the line. Former Defense Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the Economist that enormous resources had been poured into the defense network, turning Sloviansk and Kramatorsk into "fortress cities" — logistical hubs and industrial strongholds that have so far resisted Russia's advance. Putin reiterated on Nov. 27 that a pullback of Ukrainian troops is his key condition for any ceasefire, even as Washington attempts to revive stalled negotiations. It would mean surrendering the very territory Moscow has failed to seize since the very beginning of its invasion in 2014.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The action, detailed in a state department memo sent to overseas missions this week, first reported by Reuters and then NPR, directs consular officials to deny visas to any applicant “responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the US”. The order, which state department officials have not denied, requires enhanced vetting of applicants “to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others”, Reuters reported. It will initially focus on applicants for H-1B visas, usually given to highly skilled foreign workers in the technology industry among other sectors, but is applicable to all visa applications, the news agency added. Whether in Latin America, Europe, or elsewhere, the days of passive treatment for those who work to undermine the rights of Americans are over.” According to NPR, which said the memo was sent to US foreign stations on Tuesday, diplomatic officials are instructed to turn down visa applications from anybody who worked on factchecking, content moderation “or other activities the Trump administration considers ‘censorship' of Americans' speech”. Despite having the support of many tech company billionaires, Trump has singled out the industry for criticism and reprisals for banning him from social media platforms including Twitter (before it became X) and Facebook following the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot in Washington DC. Many H1-B visa applicants, especially from India, work in the field of technology. This week's visa restrictions will have other negative impacts, according to experts. “I'm alarmed that trust and safety work is being conflated with ‘censorship',” Alice Goguen Hunsberger, vice-president of trust and safety at PartnerHero, told NPR. “Having global workers at tech companies in [trust and safety] absolutely keeps Americans safer.” In a statement, a state department spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on allegedly leaked documents, make no mistake, the Administration has made clear that it defends Americans' freedom of expression against foreigners who wish to censor them. He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Honduran presidential candidate Salvador Nasralla said last-minute interference from US President Donald Trump in the country's closely fought election had damaged his chances of winning and left him trailing as vote counting dragged on. Nasralla, a three-time presidential hopeful who describes himself as center-right, said in an interview with Reuters that Trump's surprise endorsement last week of the conservative candidate Nasry Asfura had flipped the race. Ex-Honduran leader thanks Trump for pardon on US drug trafficking charges Roughly 17% of ballots have “inconsistencies” and will be reviewed, according to Honduras's electoral authority. I don't know for how long, but he deserves punishment and the Honduran justice system has to prosecute and punish him,” Nasralla said. Asfura's conservative National Party forged a close partnership with Washington under Hernandez, who governed from 2014 to 2022 and was arrested shortly after leaving office. Nasralla said his suspicions of election tampering flared around 3:00 a.m. on Thursday when his team reported the election website suddenly went dark. When it came back online, “everything had flipped,” he said. His narrow lead had vanished, leaving him slightly behind. Fraud allegations haunted Honduras in the fiercely contested 2017 presidential election, with widespread accusations of manipulated vote tallies and irregularities. Long lines in Honduras as voters hit polls Honduras' election officials this week urged calm as they work to resolve complications with its rapid count system, technical issues affecting a web portal designed to display real-time results, and unannounced system maintenance. On Monday, with Asfura ahead in the vote count, Trump hurled allegations of possible fraud without proof and said there will be “hell to pay” if results were changed. The Organization of American States has so far not documented any manipulation and other experts chalked up the vote count delays to incompetence rather than fraud. “They all had a hand in building a pretty weak and broken electoral system and this is a byproduct of all that infighting that went on for weeks and months,” said Eric Olson, a senior policy advisor at the Seattle International Foundation and expert on Honduran politics.</p>

Alexis Wilkins, the FBI director's girlfriend and a country music performer, asked her security detail to drive a friend home on at least two occasions, three sources told MS NOW, formerly MSNBC. It is the first known instance of an FBI director's girlfriend receiving a dedicated protective detail. Mr Patel then allegedly ordered them to comply and, in one instance, allegedly called the head of her security team and shouted at him to ensure the request was carried out. Former FBI agents and senior law enforcement officials told MS NOW they believed it was troubling Mr Patel had diverted elite tactical agents away from SWAT responsibilities to act as Ms Wilkins's detail. “Not only is the assignment of FBI SWAT personnel to a security detail to protect his girlfriend inappropriate, directing these highly trained professionals to babysit his girlfriend's friend is outrageous, and demonstrative of Kash Patel's complete lack of judgment and integrity,” Christopher O'Leary, a former FBI agent said. “This is made up and did not happen,” Ben Williamson, an FBI spokesman said. House Democrats recently launched an investigation into Mr Patel's use of an FBI jet, requesting the bureau turn over all flight records amid reports the director used the aircraft for “date night” travels with his girlfriend, trips to sporting events and a hunting retreat. Mr Patel has defended his use of the plane, saying in a recent interview that he uses it “less than my prior two predecessors”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rinaldo Nazzaro says detention of suspected Base members in Spain justifies ‘resistance … by any means necessary' After Spanish police and Europol's counter-terrorism section arrested three suspected members of the Base – a globally proscribed neo-Nazi terrorist group – in the eastern province of Castellón, its American leader living in Russia was defiant and signaled further actions. In a text message to the Guardian, Rinaldo Nazzaro called the arrests another “example of political persecution” by world governments that are “further justifying our resistance to its hegemonic rule by any means necessary”. “It should be noted that the group's cell in Spain had its own public Telegram channel, which is unusual, where they repeatedly called on others to join the group, shared photos of weapons training and urged militant action.” In recent months, the Base has made headlines, claiming the July assassination of a Ukrainian officer in Kyiv and other acts of terrorism inside Ukraine. Similarly, the Spanish cell advocated online for “calculated ruthlessness” against its perceived enemies and to “acquire mountain land to form protected, self-sufficient and self-managed white communities”. A data dump of the Base's Spanish Telegram activities reviewed by the Guardian contains propaganda videos, photos, and other posts with what appear to be automatic rifles and other firearms. The Europol press release on the arrests showcases a confiscated weapons cache – items of which were clearly used in the same propaganda put out by the Base – containing what appears to be multiple firearms, a machine pistol, neo-Nazi paraphernalia, envelopes of cash, ammunition, combat knives, and shirts with Kaczynski's and Adolf Hitler's faces. “The potential ties to Russian sabotage operations in Europe, whether or not the cell members were aware of it, are also incredibly concerning,” said Fisher-Birch. Currently believed to be living in St Petersburg with his Russian wife and children, Nazzaro has long been accused of being a Russian intelligence asset – an allegation that took on more seriousness when his group started offering money for assassinating Ukrainian military and political figures over the summer in what many saw as direct collaboration with the Kremlin's objectives. The personal history of the New Jersey native, who formerly worked for the Department of Homeland Security and with American special forces as an analyst targeting jihadist terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan, has consistently brought with it questions. Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning But the Base's growing presence on the continent comes as Kremlin operatives are being tapped for sabotage missions all over Europe, targeting allied countries that are supporting Ukraine as it continues to resist invasion. Russian spies are increasingly paying either unknowing individuals in pre-established criminal networks or far-right activists to carry out those attacks. Both the Spanish police and Europol declined to comment on questions about the cell's potential links to Russian intelligence operations in Europe. But stateside, the Base hasn't lost its footprint, either. “What stands out about the Spanish case is how closely it mirrors the patterns we have observed elsewhere,” said Steven Rai, an analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) who has closely studied the Base's global growth in recent years, “including in the United States, where Base members are pairing their ideological beliefs with offline action, including paramilitary-style training, tactical drills and shooting exercises.” “These behaviors echo the group's earlier era between 2019 and 2020, when various members planned serious acts of violence before being arrested,” warned Rai.</p>

Ukraine's military intelligence agency, HUR, said its drones hit a Russian Su-24 tactical bomber as past of a series of eight "accurate strikes" on military targets inside Russian-occupied Crimea on Dec. 5. The attacks were carried out with long-range drones by the Prymary ("Ghosts") unit, HUR said in a post on Telegram. Since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, Russia has thoroughly militarized the peninsula, using it as a base for regular missile and drone attacks against Ukraine, operations in the Black Sea, and land operations into southern Ukraine. Since 2023, Ukraine has steadily increased its options for striking Russian targets in Crimea, using both airborne and maritime drones, depending on the target. Russian troops reportedly shot dead a Ukrainian Armed Forces soldier who had surrendered in the Siversk direction, Ukraine's military and the Prosecutor General's Office reported on Dec. 5. Later, a video appeared on Russian information channels showing Russian military personnel at one of the Ukrainian positions in the area. "The footage shows a Ukrainian soldier raising his hands and demonstrating his willingness to surrender, meaning he was no longer participating in hostilities. Despite this, the occupiers continued to keep him at gunpoint and probably opened fire, which could have led to his death," the brigade wrote on Dec. 5. French marines opened fire on unidentified drones flying over a French naval base home to nuclear submarines, Le Figaro reported on Dec. 5. According to the publication, overnight on Dec. 4, five drones flew over the Ile Longue submarine base, where French nuclear deterrent forces are stationed. Following the incident, a search and anti-drone operation began. The Atlantic Maritime Prefecture announced that it is opening an investigation. A group of Ukrainian children ages 2 to 17 returned to Ukraine from Russian-occupied territories in southern Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on Dec. 5. The Ukrainian humanitarian NGO Save Ukraine, which rescues children from Russian occupation, reported in a Dec. 4 Facebook post that 18 children were brought back to  Ukrainian-controlled territories over the last week. "Each and every one of them fully experienced the so-called 'Russian world,'" Prokudin said in a Telegram post. "It is a real miracle that the children were rescued." Save Ukraine said in the post that it has rescued over 1,000 children from Russian occupation thus far, but "thousands" are still waiting. Ukrainian drones hit Russia's Temryuk seaport in Krasnodar Krai and the Syzran Oil Refinery in Samara Oblast overnight, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 5. An earlier Ukrainian drone strike that allegedly damaged a primary oil purification installation has already limited the refinery's capability, being forced to "completely" suspend primary processing of crude oil and operate at less than 50% of its design capacity, the General Staff alleged. Ukraine's confirmation of its drone strikes comes hours after Russian officials and media reported them earlier in the day. At least one person has been killed and 23 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Dec. 5. Russia launched 137 drones at Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Fifty-seven drones made it through, striking 13 locations, according to the Air Force. In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed a 12-year-old boy and injured three people, Governor Vladyslav Haivanenko reported. Two houses, five apartment buildings, and a civilian vehicle were damages. In Kherson Oblast, Russian attacks injured 11 people over the past day, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported. In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks injured seven people, according to Governor Vadym Filashkin. Over the past day, Russian forces shelled settlements in Donetsk Oblast 30 times. A total of 157 people, including 30 children, were evacuated from the front line. In Sumy Oblast, Russian attacks injured 40-year-old woman, according to Governor Oleh Hryhorov. Over the past day, Russian forces shelled 39 settlements in Sumy Oblast 90 times. In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, a Russian strike injured one person, the local military administration reported. Russia has lost around 1,178,610 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 5. According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,396 tanks, 23,686 (+1) armored fighting vehicles, 68,907 (+94) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,843 (+34) artillery systems, 1,558 (+2) multiple launch rocket systems, 1,253 air defense systems, 431 (+1) airplanes, 347 helicopters, 86,900 (+424) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

This has led to lengthy wait times at many embassies and consulates for interviews to apply for what are known as “B1” and “B2” visas despite a surge in consular staffing. Nonetheless, he still encouraged them to apply for their visas “right away.” Posts “should ensure sufficient appointment capacity to accommodate spectators and other fans traveling for events surrounding the (World Cup) tournament,” said one of the two cables sent Tuesday. “These should take priority over all other B1/B2 applications, except those related to American re-industrialization.” Others to be prioritized include foreign diplomats, government officials traveling on official business, temporary agricultural workers, religious workers, physicians and nurses, and students attending academic institutions with less than 15% foreign enrollment. A second cable sent Tuesday to all embassies and consulates set out new criteria for considering H-1B visa applications, instructing diplomats to “be on the lookout” for those who may have been or are “responsible for or complicit in the censorship of Americans” online and elsewhere. Those visas allow American companies to bring in people with technical skills that are hard to find in the United States, and President Donald Trump has said he would slap a $100,000 annual fee on them. The department said evidence of this could lead to visa denial. It defined such information as having “adopting global content moderation policies inconsistent with freedom of expression, complying with global content moderation or censorship demands from a foreign entity and providing access to private data on American citizens in connection with content moderation.” Proof of this could be obtained from an applicant's resume, employment history, social media profiles and posts, and public statements or writings, the cable said, adding that the State Department was developing tools to make it easier and quicker to conduct these screenings. It noted that all visa applicants are subject to these criteria, but that H-1B applicants should be looked at most closely “as many work or have worked in the tech sector, including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression.” “You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,” the cable said, adding that “if you uncover evidence and applicant was responsible for or complicit in censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible” for a visa.

Harris, known for the Tony-nominated “Slave Play”, was arrested last month at an airport in Japan on suspicion of attempting to smuggle illegal drugs into the country, local authorities said late on Thursday. Harris, 36, was stopped on November 16 at Naha Airport on Okinawa island after a customs officer discovered 0.78 grams of crystal containing the synthetic narcotic MDMA in his tote bag, an Okinawa Regional Customs spokesperson said. He was immediately arrested on suspicion of violating Japan's Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Act. Local customs officials filed a criminal accusation with the regional prosecutor's office on Thursday to begin formal charging proceedings against Harris. Harris' representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether he has retained legal representation in Japan. Harris had arrived in Okinawa for sightseeing purposes, travelling from Britain via Taiwan, where he had a flight layover, the customs spokesperson said. Okinawa is a popular resort destination some 1,500 km (930 miles) southwest of Tokyo, known for its beaches and American military bases. Japan maintains strict drug laws with severe penalties for possession and smuggling offences. The country has some of the toughest narcotics regulations among developed nations, with even small amounts of illegal substances resulting in criminal prosecution. In 1980, former Beatle Paul McCartney was arrested after arriving in Tokyo with a bag of marijuana and was banned from entering Japan for years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump believes that the Ukrainian conflict would be eventually resolved and the United States works "very hard on it." "We're settling wars at levels that nobody's ever seen before. We got to get that stopped, we're working very hard on it," he added. Washington had previously proposed a 28-point plan for settling the conflict in Ukraine. The document caused discontent among Kiev and its European partners, who tried to significantly revise it. On November 23, the US and Ukraine held consultations in Geneva. Later, US President Trump said that the initial plan for a peaceful settlement had been revised to take the positions of Moscow and Kiev into account, leaving only a few contentious issues. He also noted that the number of points had been reduced to 22. On November 30, representatives of the US and Ukraine met in Florida to discuss ways to end the conflict, long-term solutions to economic and security issues, prospects for elections in Ukraine, and the territorial issue. On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, businessman Jared Kushner, at the Kremlin. The conversation lasted about five hours. Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Olga Stefanishina announced earlier that Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov, who heads the country's delegation to the settlement talks, would fly to the United States on December 4 for a follow-up meeting with US Presidential Envoy Witkoff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Toussaint, a Montrealer with Haitian origins, in his restaurant, 3 Pierres 1 Feu, on Wednesday.Andrej Ivanov/The Globe and Mail Soccer balls were not easy to come by when Eneck Louis was a kid growing up in 1970s Haiti. Undeterred, he and his friends sometimes played with oranges until the fruit burst and left a streak of juice on the clay pitch. “We couldn't kick hard, because it would hurt our toes!” recalled Louis. Celebrations rocked the usually deserted nighttime streets of Port-au-Prince after a qualifying victory against Nicaragua in November. Louis cheered the team from Montreal, where he now works as a taxi driver, part of Canada's nearly 200,000-person Haitian community. But his jubilation, like that of many, is shaded by worry about the country's continuing gang crisis and U.S. hostility that could limit Haitian access to the tournament. Group matches in Mexico and especially Canada would be a relief, because many Haitian fans won't be allowed to enter the U.S. thanks to a months-old travel ban that prohibits entry visas for citizens of their country.

Officials from both countries have flatly rejected the U.S.'s claims and appealed to FIFA. FIFA officials, who have sought close ties with Trump, did not respond to requests for comment. Fedora Mathieu, a Haitian-born immigration lawyer in Ottawa, said many Haitian-Canadians are already avoiding travel in the U.S. because of the immigration policies targeting Haitians. Her office has also been getting flooded with requests from Haitian migrants in the U.S who are trying to get out of the country, she said. It's all overshadowing Haiti's Cinderella soccer story, she said, at a time when the country desperately needs some good news. Fans celebrate Haiti's victory over Nicaragua to qualify for the World Cup in Port-au-Prince on Nov. 18.Odelyn Joseph/The Associated Press Already the poorest nation in the Americas, Haiti's gang violence and continuing humanitarian crisis have left it feeling like a “war zone,” she said. Even the very infrastructure that supports soccer has been under attack. In February, armed gangsters took control of the country's national soccer headquarters and training ground for its top players, the FIFA Goal Center, located in one of Port-au-Prince's poorest suburbs. As a result of the violence, which has displaced more than a million Haitians and killed thousands more since gangs effectively took over the capital in spring 2024, the team has played none of its qualifying matches in Haiti, instead hosting “home” games on neutral ground. Coach Sébastien Migné, a French national, has never set foot in Haiti. As FIFA adds constraints to World Cup draw, the possibility for inherent bias remains Many of the team's leading players were also born abroad, part of Haiti's millions-strong diaspora, including the French-born striker Duckens Nazon and Wolverhampton Wanderers midfield Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Still, some observers believe this improbable group could make a real difference to the struggling country. Soccer has helped catalyze political change in Haiti before, said University of Virginia professor Laurent Dubois, who has written extensively about soccer and Haitian history. This World Cup will not solve the country's gang crisis, but it may be at least a temporary salve for Haitians at home and abroad who have been bludgeoned by bad news in recent years.
