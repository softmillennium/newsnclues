                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But one place they were not so popular was at their dad's church. “The Voice” coach and season 28 advisor Nick Jonas told People on December 4, 2025, that their dad lost his job as a pastor because Nick and his brothers, Kevin and Joe, weren't exclusively singing religious music. Nick, Kevin, and Joe released their first album in 2006, but when it didn't take off, their record label dropped them. In the meantime, failure was not an option, Nick said, recalling how their dad, Kevin Jonas Sr., managed their fledgling band as a side hustle while serving as a pastor at Wyckoff Assembly of God in New Jersey. “I definitely felt a lot of pressure,” Nick told People. Our father also lost his job effectively because we weren't making solely Christian music and he was a pastor. In their 2019 “Chasing Happiness” documentary, Kevin recalled, “We were signed to a secular label, and we weren't making a Christian album. Jonas Sr. was essentially forced out of his position, stating in the documentary, “The day I resigned at Wyckoff Assembly of God, it was really devastating. The Jonas Brothers covered September with their dad! The family, which includes fourth brother Frankie, relocated to Los Angeles in hopes of finding a new record label and opportunities. Kevin told People that their 2007 “Jonas Brothers” album reflects the hard times they went through before finding success. “The fact that these songs were written in those desperate moments and then we kind of found our voice, I think, was really special,” Kevin told the outlet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A biopic that skips along the surface of its subject, deriving cliched psychological insight from its traumatized source, The Chronology Of Water sees Kristen Stewart liquify Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir into a expressionistic slurry. In her feature debut as writer-director, Stewart takes explicit pains to explicitly render Yuknavitch's pain on screen, drenching the swimmer-turned-writer's life—spanning childhood abuse, young-adult hedonism, and professional success—in over-styled and overindulgent imagery. Despite its relative formal boldness, The Chronology Of Water is as ineffectively elliptical and muttery as Stewart's first short film, the similarly aquatic “Come Swim.” In a shorter or more complex character study, that opaque aesthetic approach could bring the audience into its subject's world, or translate a chaotic headful of emotions and coping mechanisms into a blast of elemental feeling. For each adolescent horror experienced by Lidia (Imogen Poots)—mostly at the hands of her sexually abusive father (Michael Epp)—there is a direct corollary to come later in her life. Lidia finds an escape route away from her predatory dad and alcoholic mom in swimming, which earns her an athletic scholarship to a school out of town and sparks her bisexual awakening in a quiet corner of the locker room. Once at college, Lidia's painful early life manifests in rebellion—Stewart relays this, as she relays almost everything in the film, through fractured quick cuts of warm-hued close-ups. These relentless, repetitive, interchangeable sequences of pain, sex, and substance abuse border on masturbatory even when Lidia isn't literally rubbing one out. As the film nears her career as an author, and continues quoting at length from Yuknavitch's prose (when it's not listening to Poots recite passages at readings), its reverence for its source becomes hard to ignore. The literary voiceover from Poots, mumbled and under-mixed, evokes some of Stewart's most mannered performances, like her skittish oddball in Crimes Of The Future. Lidia's anger tries to guide The Chronology Of Water through its stupor, though this only breaks up the abstract haze with moments of too-stiff clarity, like a bleary-eyed boozer trying to oversell their sobriety when questioned. These more straightforward sections ramp up around the film's midpoint, when Lidia makes her way to the University of Oregon as a member of a writing class led by Ken Kesey (a goofily fried Jim Belushi), contributing to the collaborative novel Caverns. Similarly, Poots' subtle wariness around him, emphasized by the camera's shifting glance, is overrun by his recognizability—industry namedropping and diegetic admiration take precedence over more uncomfortable personal complexities. It's an initially striking effect, but its impact is shallow. Stewart applies an admirably experimental vision to her adaptation, but she can't translate whatever power she may have found in Yuknavitch's text to the screen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The truth behind Jay-Z and sister-in-law Solange Knowles' infamous elevator fight has been revealed. “I think that Jay-Z complimented [Roy] about the gown, and Beyoncé's sister felt that it was not proper, so it was a kind of drama there,” Lopez, 52, told the Daily Mail on Thursday. Page Six previously reported that Solange was drunk and had gotten into an argument with Roy upon arriving at the hotel, though our sources did not say what the disagreement might've been about. Therefore, his design didn't get much attention — until fists started flying later that night. Regarding speculation that Jay-Z had an affair with Roy, Lopez dismissed it as “silly.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Roy interned at Rocawear, the fashion label started by Jay-Z and Dash, before working her way up to creative director of the women's and children's lines. Jay-Z, 56, and Beyoncé, 44, have both alluded to his past dalliance in their music. And while the woman's identity has never been confirmed, Roy, 51, did herself no favors when she made a cheeky reference to the scandal in a poorly timed Instagram post. As for Jay-Z and Solange, they released a joint statement shortly after their altercation, saying they had “apologized to each other” and “moved forward as a united family.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, at least she's attempting to in her own way. Though the 35-year-old actress opted for long underwear at the IndieWire Honors Winter Film Awards on Thursday night, she seemed to have forgotten the clothing one normally layers on top. Practically speaking, we're not sure whether her take on the après-ski look was actually warm at all. The see-through long underwear was spotted during the brand's spring 2026 runway presentation, styled with a draped V-neck top. To accessorize, Stewart layered two diamond tennis necklaces from Fiametta and wore a set of lightly tinted sunglasses. Stewart is very comfortable wearing sheer outfits on the red carpet. And this past summer in Cannes, she wore a pair of Chanel tweed shorts and a short-sleeved jacket, going shirtless underneath. She topped the look with an ethereal sheer tulle skirt. It's like fitting yourself into someone else's perspective in the most pure way. It's a huge responsibility, and then that performance lives in another's art.”</p>

Porter, meanwhile, was one of Stax's go-to songwriters, penning many hits that Cropper helped bring to life, including Sam & Dave's “Soul Man.” In his tribute, Porter identified Cropper as one of the six people who served as the “cornerstone of what made Stax consistent and unique,” along with himself, organ player and bandleader Booker T. Jones, drummer Al Jackson, bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn, and songwriter-turned-superstar Isaac Hayes. “The musical unity meant that each person knew their role and lived up to it 24-seven,” Porter said. The songwriter praised Cropper's special ability ”to cement the musical pocket, with his own special flavor coming from him every song, every artist, every day.” Porter continued: “He took pride in finding a musical personality that turned that song into its own identity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In one form or another, John Sebastian knows you remember his songs. He knows you may recognize “Welcome Back” as a post-pandemic song used in ads by Applebee's, Major League Baseball, and more, or recall how it was sampled in Mase's rap single of the same name. But Sebastian is also well aware of the sometimes painful fact that not enough people may know the name John Sebastian. Unlike many of his peers from the Sixties, Sebastian has never written what he calls “a fucking memoir,” which could be one reason his name doesn't always ring a bell, even to his generation. But he did decide to sit down for interviews for I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues, a just-completed Sebastian documentary by directors Todd Kwait and Chris Andersen that revisits the highs (sometimes literally) and lows (the notorious Spoonful drug bust) of his life and career. “I guess my reaction was just glad to have somebody interested,” Sebastian says about cooperating. As the doc proves, Sebastian's career has been a particularly quirky one. Featuring interview with peers like Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Arlo Guthrie, Michelle Phillips, and Spoonful bassist Steve Boone, I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues does, in its way, explore some of the obstacles Sebastian faced. In conversation and in the film, he exudes the same beatific, genial, and bespectacled vibe he exhibited dating back to the Spoonful days; then and now, he's never been an archetypal wild-and-crazy rocker. Film footage of Sebastian with his father is a reminder that Sebastian also didn't quite have the requisite angst required by many rock stars of his generation. “As time goes on, it's an inclination for people to make me higher than I was,” he says. However, if you put me in mud for a few days and go, ‘Well, this isn't LSD, more like DMT,' I would've said, ‘Yeah, I'll see what it can do.' That was before anybody told me this would be a good idea to get up and play in front of a few hundred thousand people.” (Many years later, Sebastian says, he was approached about a career as a kids folk singer along the lines of Raffi: “I said, ‘Guys, I smoke dope, and I'm not going to look like I hide it.' I think that was good, because it only took about 10 minutes for them to figure out I wasn't their guy.”) See Lovin' Spoonful Members Reunite Onstage for First Time in 20 Years John Sebastian and Lovin' Spoonful Members to Reunite at Los Angeles Benefit Gig Woodstock Remembered: John Sebastian on the Sun, Fun and Tie-Dye Rock's Greatest Bootlegger: A New Pink Floyd Box Set Legitimizes an Outlaw recounting a cross-country trip with his wife, Katherine, and two friends. “I can only say I was madly in love,” he says now, “and it permitted me to get pretty goofy sometimes.” At a point where “nobody wanted me” after his post-Spoonful albums didn't sell, Sebastian was asked to write the theme song for a sitcom about urban toughs in high school called Kotter. (Sebastian currently lives in the house he purchased with that money.) He maintains that the band, which hopscotched around pop, jug band music, blues, country, and folk, was ahead of its time. “Our timing as a band was somewhat peculiar,” he says. When we were no longer a band, all of a sudden, about eight years later, people are saying, ‘Hey, this is like Americana! But in another instance of bad luck, Sebastian says that what we didn't see was an entire rehearsal of the temporary reformed band. “We're doing a rehearsal, and the Spoonful clicked in, like, wow,” he says. And they go, ‘Well, we had to save film. Then came that day in 1966 when Boone and lead guitarist and cutup Zal Yanovsky were busted for weed in San Francisco. Nobody ever managed to say, ‘Oh, so, these two guys were in San Francisco, and those two other guys were in Los Angeles, so we only promise to not fuck half of the Spoonful? As Sebastian tells RS, with evident melancholy, “I still am suffering the results of those decisions made way back when. “We were the best friends of John, Michelle, and Cass [Elliot],” he says, “but they knew, and we knew, that they couldn't invite us” thanks to the band's tattered reputation. (In the second issue of Rolling Stone, Ralph J. Gleason wrote a sympathetic rebuttal to the backlash, calling the episode a “terrible, tragic thing”: “If what Zal and Steve did was a sin, then it is our sin too. They are victims, just as the man who was fingered is a victim. In one way, at least, the Spoonful were ahead of their time. A version of the band still exists and tours, with only one founding member (Boone) involved, paving the way for many classic-rock bands to follow. “It could have helped me financially,” he says, “but I guess I didn't attach much value to what would be the enormous nostalgia market for all of our contemporary bands.” (He says he's seen the current Spoonful and that they're “very good,” although he has tweaked them for not fully re-creating the finger-picking guitar weave that he and Yanovsky perfected.) Cher Scores Near-Complete Victory in Royalties War, Mary Bono Vows Appeal Ronnie Wood Celebrated His 50th Anniversary in the Rolling Stones By Painting Them Two years ago, Sebastian did sell his publishing (from his Spoonful songs to solo tunes) for an undisclosed sum to the independent music publishing company AMR Songs. “I had to sell it,” he says, “because when you do the math and find out you couldn't make that money in a year working every day times eight, you start to go, ‘Jesus, I guess I should be thinking about my family here.' It isn't a great move, because as time goes on, everything is just skyrocketing in the world of monetizing the arts. But it's a decent move.” Last year, the jacket he wore onstage at Woodstock sold at a rock memorabilia auction for $64,000. Now that he's finally laid out his life on film, what does Sebastian hope people will take from I'll Paint Rainbows All Over Your Blues? Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Sean “Diddy” Combs is back in the news this week because a Netflix documentary put him there. But should streaming services really dictate which crimes we talk about — and when? With more than 300 million subscribers worldwide as of early 2025, Netflix is the most popular streaming service by a wide margin. True crime dominates with Netflix's audience, too, reaching significantly more viewers than established network true crime programs like “Dateline.” Netflix's true crime popularity is so great that the streamer consistently creates new headlines, effectively warming up even the coldest cases for audiences to feast on for weeks at a time. Related Stories Netflix Is Buying Warner Bros., HBO, and HBO Max Creating Cyborg Morrow on ‘Alien: Earth' Was a Team Effort Across Editing, VFX, Prosthetics, and Actor Babou Ceesay Not much is happening in court for the disgraced hip-hop artist right now. He's serving a four-year prison sentence in New Jersey, having been found guilty on two charges of “transportation to engage in prostitution” earlier this year. The streamer's role in illuminating that scandal seems personal to Diddy. “For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront,” read a statement from the defendant's counsel, per Variety. Combs has been accused of orchestrating a years-long pattern of sexual abuse, violence, and coercive control that hinged on exploiting his influence in music. “However, Mr. Combs rejected the proposal when Mr. Sarandos insisted he give up creative control.“ The four-page letter further characterizes “The Reckoning” as “Netflix's vindictive response to that rejection — an attempt by Netflix and Mr. Sarandos to ensure a one-sided character assassination, rather than a balanced and accurate portrayal.” Most notably, “The Reckoning” includes clips of Combs looking panicked and speaking on the phone with one of his attorneys just days before he was arrested in September 2024. One thing about Sean Combs is that he's always filming himself, and it's been an obsession.” But he's the biggest name to question Netflix's part in platforming true crime. Journalists and documentarians often run into rights issues when they rely on images or videos they don't own to depict real events. Netflix is no exception, and the streaming service, which denied any misuse and said Diddy's claims were “false,” has faced similar accusations on other unscripted projects. Diddy is appealing his two criminal convictions, and with somewhere between 80 and 90 additional pending civil cases against him, the ex-superstar seems to have bigger problems than who owns which videotape. That's powerful and convenient if you trust the company's programming and judgment, but also cause for concern if cable-cutting and social media continue to prop up entertainment as a real source of news, or the truth itself. Like “Sean Combs: The Reckoning,” these revisitations happened because of Netflix — and in some cases, that's inarguably been a good thing. In 2019, “Don't F**k with Cats” put the spotlight on some internet sleuths who actually helped investigators catch a killer. And with the “Unsolved Mysteries” anthology, Netflix routinely asks viewers for their help finding suspects still at large. Decades of schlocky unscripted offerings on broadcast TV tell us FCC regulations can only do so much to separate documentary storytelling from serious frontline journalism. But even protected by the leeway inherent to a straight-to-streaming publicly traded media company, Netflix has released every caliber of true crime caper. In 2023, the streamer came under heavy fire for forwarding baseless conspiracies in “MH370: The Plane That Disappeared.” But this past summer, “The Perfect Neighbor” made pioneering use of police body cam footage to produce a singular work that demands to be seen. And yet, swinging between exploitative and innovative projects, Netflix's approach to deciding which crimes its customers should “care” about bears a striking resemblance to its embattled stand-up comedy stage, which has repeatedly divided its consumer base. He's fighting from a weak position and, perhaps unintentionally, giving his adversary more authority. But Diddy's striking and strident objection suggests a legitimate fear. When Netflix chooses to cover a case, its version may be the only one that survives in a court of public opinion where the service is judge, jury, and executioner. “Sean Combs: The Reckoning” is now streaming on Netflix.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in theaters,” said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos on a call with Wall Street fresh off clinching a mega deal to acquire Warner Bros. “My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long, exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly,” he said. AMC and other chains are looking to reestablish a 30 or 45-day window to energize moviegoing that dwindled during Covid. The biggest chains often won't run Netflix films with truncated windows. The entertainment community and movie theaters in particular have been immensely jittery at this corporate combination given the streamer's short windows if any as they cater to their streaming audience. Exhibition's biggest trade group, Cinema United, came out with a blunt statement this morning opposing the merger, saying. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. Regulators must look closely at the specifics of this proposed transaction and understand the negative impact it will have on consumers, exhibition and the entertainment industry.” This mega-deal between Netflix and Warner Bros. would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office if films that are traditionally given a robust theatrical release by Warner Bros. disappear from theatres. In his comments today, after announcing the $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios, HBO and HBO Max, Sarandos said, “I wouldn't look at this as a change in approach for Netflix movies or Warner movies, for that matter. But I'd say that right now you should count on everything that has planned on going to the theaters through Warner Bros. will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros. And Netflix movies will take the same [path] as they have — which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. There are consumers that want to at least be given the opportunity to see a film projected in a movie theater. Why should they be forced to pay for a Netflix subscription just to see a particular movie that's just been released? He's looking to drive more subs for his company. Since when can we trust anything Netflix says? He's only committed to the stuff currently scheduled. Yes, that market contracted but it's still a great revenue stream, especially with Warner Archive and collector's market which is still solid. If Netflix is approved, I'd hope they'd keep their partnership in the physical SDS with Universal and instead work on releasing some of their older streaming to discs. And I've bought the select Netflix films on physical media as they're still better to view this way than streaming. Sarandos thinks he is sounding pro-theatrical but his dismissive comments about windows only display his obliviousness and encapsulate our industry's nightmare. They have slowly eroded the power of theatrical and trained people to sit at home and wait for things to stream. Netflix is a video company and filmmakers that care about theatrical should stop taking their checks. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a statement on Friday, issued shortly after Netflix and Warner Bros. made the takeover bid official, the UNIC said the proposed deal “represents a double risk” with fewer films being produced and fewer of those being made getting released in cinemas. “As elsewhere, cinemas in Europe rely on one product for their viability: films. Acclaimed Playwright Jeremy O. Harris Detained in Japan on Drug Allegations The loss of a studio “will inevitably mean that cinemas will have fewer films to screen for their audiences, leading to reduced income and significant cinema closures and job losses in the industry,” Laura Houlgatte, CEO of UNIC wrote. But worse than that, she argues, Netflix has shown “time and again” that “it doesn't believe in cinemas and their business model. Announcing the deal on Friday, Netflix said that it expects to maintain the current operations of Warner Bros. “including theatrical releases for films,” without giving specific details. Netflix is spinning the takeover as an opportunity for filmmakers and creatives to have access to both Warner Bros.' “renowned franchises and extensive library,” and to Netflix's unparalleled global reach, providing “more opportunities to work with beloved intellectual property, tell new stories and connect with a wider audience than ever before.” Any reduction in the diversity and quality of content arising from this acquisition, combined with the potential loss of cinemas and jobs, would have a profoundly damaging impact on Europe's cultural landscape.” The UNIC represents exhibitors across 39 territories in Europe with a reach of 43,500 screens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter That's kind of weird, as Warner Bros. is famously a legacy film studio. WB's composition in 1923 literally predates the advent of television, which Netflix basically upended when it switched from DVDs to streaming video. (Or at least, when it launched Lilyhammer, House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.) It's Official: Netflix to Acquire Warner Bros. in Deal Valued at $82.7 Billion Hollywood Blockbuster: Netflix Poised to Win Battle for Warner Bros. In his Friday morning acquisition announcement, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-CEO and former chief content officer, first shouted out (in order) his affinity for (and excitement over ownership of) Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Harry Potter — three very theatrically released films. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Sarandos said in a prepared statement. “By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends — with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. In the same press release, Netflix affirms it is committed to releasing Warner Bros. films theatrically — well, it sort of affirms that. “Netflix expects to maintain Warner Bros.' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.” To be clear, we bolded the “expects” there — but even without our darker, thicker font, that is heavy verb use right there. Shortly after the acquisition announcement, on a conference call with media analysts, Sarandos was asked about the subject of theatrical distribution. And Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is, some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for.” “For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world's attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come.” Paramount Skydance, the company that did not win the bidding war for Warner Bros., is feeling all sorts of feels this morning. In a letter sent Monday from Paramount's attorneys to Warner Bros. “Netflix does not have the same incentive to release films in theaters and will be incentivized to use WBD's world-class IP library to entrench Netflix's streaming dominance while also harming theatrical distribution, talent and moviegoers,” it reads. Like also: “Netflix, if combined with WBD, will reduce the number of films for broad theatrical release, further pushing consumers away from theaters to streaming and harming those theaters which are already struggling. Given that the co-CEO of Netflix has called brick-and-mortar movie theaters an ‘outdated; concept, Netflix ownership of WBD's studio would continue the trend toward more empty seats in theaters as Netflix shifts its movies away from initial runs in theaters.” (To reiterate, Netflix is not buying the Discovery piece of Warner Bros. If you still don't, Cinema United, the former NATO (National Association of Theatre Owners), is here to drive it home. But Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. “Netflix success is television, not movies on the big screen. Sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theatres is not a commitment to exhibition,” O'Leary added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A veteran actor with nearly 150 credits to his name, Tagawa was probably best known for his long association with the Mortal Kombat franchise, where he played villainous sorcerer/Kombatant Shang Tsung on multiple occasions. Prolific in film and television, live-action and voice, Tagawa was a reliable screen presence through the latter parts of the 20th century and well into the 21st (including a leading role in Prime Video's The Man In The High Castle, which allowed him to show far more of his range than many more villainous parts across his long career). Born in Japan to a Japanese mother and a Japanese-American soldier in the American Army, Tagawa spent most of his childhood living on Army bases around the United States, before his family ultimately settled in California. From there, Tagawa began to work at a frankly relentless pace, alternating single-episode stints on American TV with a lengthening laundry list of films. (Including playing an undercover Hong Kong narcotics officer who runs afoul of James Bond in 1989's License To Kill, and appearing in a major role opposite Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes in 1993's Rising Sun.) When it came to securing the signature role of his career, Tagawa famously didn't screw around: Legend has it that he arrived to his Mortal Kombat audition in full costume, and basically took the part of the game series' evil wizard by sheer force of personality. The role tapped into Tagawa's skill at projecting both menace and grandeur, as well as his training as a martial artist—to say nothing of his willingness to give his all in a truly committed villainous scowl. Tagawa's performance as Shang Tsung was beloved enough that it influenced many future incarnations of the character—often depicted as much younger than his initially wizened appearance, to match Tagawa—including returning to the franchise to reprise the role for Mortal Kombat 11. Despite the film's success, Tagawa's career continued after Mortal Kombat much as it had before: A mix of TV roles—including a lead role in a couple of seasons of Don Johnson's Nash Bridges—interspersed with films both big and small. (Now also incorporating an increasing number of voice roles into the mix.) Arriving in 2015, The Man In The High Castle was, thus, a rare landing point for an actor frequently on the move; as Japanese Trade Minister Tagomi, Tagawa tapped into his ability to project stoic calm to become a rare moral center point in the show's often complex alternate universe moral equations. Tagawa stayed with the show for three of its four seasons, following it with a stint as a recurring character on Netflix's Lost In Space reboot. Tagawa's death on Thursday was confirmed by a representative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like the rest of us, Alison Wonderland has self-doubts. For Ghost World (via EMI), her fourth solo studio which drops in full today, Dec. 5, Wonderland brushed aside the self-doubt, got answers, found the rush. “This one felt like my first album, where I really had so much to say to the world and go hard. The energy was back for me,” she tells Billboard over a Zoom. “I just really had a lot to give in a more extroverted way where the last album felt very introverted. The Beatles' 'Anthology 4' Debuts in Top 10 on 5 Billboard Album Charts Brian McKnight Jr. Claims His Father Refused to Tell Estranged Son Niko He Loved Him Before Dying of Cancer Much has happened in Wonderland's life since 2022's Loner, which crashed Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums tally at No. 9 on the ARIA Chart, her third consecutive top 10. Later that year, Wonderland (real name: Alexandra Sholler) launched FMU Records, and, in 2023, revived her darker, more industrial project Whyte Fang, with the release of a full-length album, Genesis. Wonderland experienced a miscarriage in December of 2024 that forced the cancellation of several shows, and backlash from gung ho types who didn't yet know the full story. “This frustration I was feeling,” she remarks, “I went f— this.” She returned home to Australia, and felt “really welcome.” Rediscovered her groove, played more shows. Ghost World was pushed back from a scheduled Oct. 15 release date to a pre-Christmas unwrapping, due to production delays with merchandise, vinyl, and other important elements. “My aim is to always externally communicate what I'm internalizing. I'm not trying to be a sad sack about it,” Wonderland tells Billboard.com. “A lot of the meaning behind this album was me trying to get excited about where I was again, and I did. Ghost World is really about me trying to find my place. Having the break between Loner and Ghost World, and doing Whyte Fang “helped me go back to my roots.” On Loner, she recounts, “I was so isolated. “It also made me really appreciate women, tenfold. I worked with a lot more women on this album.” Collaborators include Nina Wilson, better known as the three-time ARIA Award winning EDM producer and artist Ninjirachi, plus DJ Dave and Erick The Architect. Wonderland produced the album with Dylan Ragland, MEMBA and QUIX. Wonderland comes alive on stage, and can boast more than 800,000 headline ticket sales across her U.S. tours alone. In 2018, she wrote her name in the history books with a headline spot at Coachella, her fourth performance in the California desert, and has seven-times headlined the “Temple of Wonderland” at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. She'll hit the road again next year, in support of Ghost World. “There will be a big tour, I'm excited,” she admits. I think about it all the time to this day.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried are trading suspense for holiday-themed laughs when they appear in a special edition of “Celebrity Family Feud” this December. The actors, who star together in the upcoming thriller “The Housemaid,” will team up with their castmates for a festive showdown against a group of “Real Housewives” favorites. ABC will air the special Thursday, Dec. 4, at 8 p.m. Eastern. ABC will broadcast the holiday special on Dec. 4 as part of its primetime lineup. Yahoo Entertainment reported that the network plans to make the special available on demand shortly after it airs. Several outlets, including TV Insider, confirmed that the episode follows ABC's standard release pattern for “Celebrity Family Feud,” meaning it will be accessible to both cable viewers and those who watch primarily through streaming platforms. The Housewives All-Stars Holiday Special,” brings together Sweeney, Seyfried, director Paul Feig, Brandon Sklenar, and Sarah Cooper to face a team of Housewives stars. TV Insider reported that their opponents include Cynthia Bailey, Dorinda Medley, Melissa Gorga, Eva Marcille, and Alexia Nepola, all competing for charity. In a preview clip released to TV Insider, Harvey asked the teams to name a Christmas movie people never tire of. TV Insider reported that Feig guessed “Miracle on 34th Street,” which did not appear on the board. IMDb's news desk also reported that the holiday episode follows the show's traditional charity-driven format. TV Insider noted that the psychological thriller places Sweeney and Seyfried in tense, high-stakes roles as their characters navigate danger inside a wealthy household. Instead of suspense and dark twists, audiences will see the pair joking, reacting to unexpected answers, and working together as teammates. The timing also positions the special as a promotional boost for the film, which has generated buzz for its cast and eerie premise.

Seth's wife has an onion head, and he himself is a pale, flabby, blue-nosed figure that only vaguely resembles the contours of a real human being. And as Seth rattles on about the goal of the film — to make “something funny, beautiful, spiritual, political, complex, simple, and true” — emojis line up on screen to represent every descriptor.

Animated by Scriver, the film's psychedelic world is one with only a passing relationship to logic, populated with dogs shaped like peanuts and daughters shaped like cookies, where pictures on a wall can speak and time can jump from the present day to a future apocalypse and back again in the blink of an eye. We get a general sense of their relationship: they share a father, but Seth is white while the older Pete is indigenous, though the two were raised for some time together in the Kensington Market neighborhood of Toronto. As the two chat, Pete throws out a few stories he wants to incorporate into the film, starting with an account of how he got his own hand caught in a beaver trap. Some come from Pete and Seth themselves, as they go off topic to discuss Pete's youth as a teen in Toronto, ordering terrible pizza and slacking off with his friends. Some come from Pete's large family, consisting of nine children, 10 dogs, and a whole bunch of other relatives, who interrupt to offer their own tales or musings about life in Shamattawa. And some come from Seth, as his animation takes turns into the absurdist, from parodies of old video games to a commercial for a city made of toilets. Where one vignette ends and another begins is intentionally difficult to parse; this is a free-flowing narrative, where the storytelling is zigs and circles back on itself rather than proceeding in a straight line. Occasionally, it can veer on a little exhausting, but for the most part, the approach is soothing in its way, and endearing in how it fleshes out this family as a very rambunctious and colorful, tight-knit unit. The stories they tell, of rebuilding a teepee that burned or witnessing the wildlife mating, are lightly amusing and sweet, accompanied by a chipper, whistling score that amplifies the slice-of-life charm. Although most of “Endless Cookie” is cheerfully comedic, it also very much lives up to the “political” descriptor Seth aimed for in the opening. At several points, the movie exposes its politics visually, such as a memorable scene inside a supermarket where the frozen food aisles are filled with products like “Let's Eat the Billionaires Chicken Fingers.” Mostly, however, it comes from the real experiences of First Nations people in Canada, as shared by Pete and his family. Early on, a car radio reports on systemic harassment from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that has led to disproportionate rates of Indigenous people being incarcerated. One particularly sad segment, narrated by an elderly friend of Pete's family, discusses his experiences being kidnapped, separated from his family, and sent to one of the infamous Canadian Indigenous Residential Schools as a child. Obscured Releasing will release “Endless Cookie” in Los Angeles and New York theaters on Friday, December 5.
