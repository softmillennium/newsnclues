                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rubrik shares soared 25% on Friday after the data management company posted blowout third-quarter numbers and boosted guidance. The stock, which debuted on the market in April 2024, headed for its second-best day on record. Revenue jumped 48% from a year earlier to $350 million, topping the $320 million average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. In its announcement late Thursday, Rubrik reported adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share, while analysts had expected a loss of 17 cents per share. The company boosted revenue guidance for the fiscal year to a range of $1.28 billion to $1.282 billion, up from a previous high of $1.237 billion. CEO Bipul Sinha told CNBC's "Closing Bell: Overtime" on Thursday that the company's strength in cyber resilience and its recent move into safeguarding artificial intelligence agents is fueling its rapid growth. "As businesses are taking on agents, their biggest worry is, they don't know what the hell is going on," Sinha said. Rubrik had a net loss of $63.83 million, a loss of 32 cents per share, narrowing significantly from the net loss a year ago of $130.91 million, a loss of 71 cents per share. On an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Sinha said Rubrik is winning business by replacing legacy vendors. He said one of the largest banks in Asia opted for Rubrik over a long-term vendor, as did a Fortune 250 professional services firm, and the push is due to the growth in AI and the evolving threat of cyberattacks. "With AI, the cyberattacks have become more prevalent because the attackers are using AI," Sinha told CNBC. "So we believe we are in the early days of a very, very large market and will continue to grow at rapid pace for the foreseeable future." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Movie theater operators woke up Friday to the possibility of a new world order. Discovery announced a deal for the streaming giant to acquire WBD's film studio and streaming service, bringing an end to a months-long bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the assets. With Netflix as the victor, exhibitors are in a panic. Unlike traditional movie studios, the streamer has not adhered to conventional theatrical distribution, and there are fears that big changes could be coming to an industry that is still struggling post-pandemic. "It's no secret that this was probably the least desired outcome for many theater owners," said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association, came out strong Friday morning against the sale of WBD assets to Netflix. "The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business," CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. A half dozen movie theater operators who spoke to CNBC shared concerns that Netflix's acquisition of WBD would lead to a significant decline in the number of films made available to cinemas annually and, therefore, hit annual box office ticket sales. "Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite," O'Leary said. Cinema United said the deal "would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office" putting smaller theater chains and independent cinemas, in particular, at risk. "We are going to be pulling all of the levers we can because we think that a deal of this magnitude and the potential impact that it will have is something that everyone with regulatory and oversight authority needs to look closely at," O'Leary said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" Friday. A collective of top industry players sent an open letter to Congress detailing the potential economic and institutional blowback that could play out if the merger goes through. The letter, reported by Variety, stated that Netflix would "effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace" and could alter the footprint of theatrical movies and decrease licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows. Several exhibitors told CNBC that they fear a deal between WBD and Netflix will result in fewer theatrical releases and even shorter theatrical windows for would-be major releases. When studios merge, they typically decrease the number of films they produce, something the industry saw firsthand when Disney bought 20th Century Fox back in 2019. The theatrical business has struggled in recent years from pandemic related production shutdowns as well as dual labor strikes that halted film shoots and delayed movie releases. The industry still has not returned to pre-pandemic release numbers or box office ticket sales, and there are worries that it never will. "If you look historically, when legacy studios are absorbed by other entities, even in the case where those other entities are also legacy studios, the amount of movies produced for theatrical distribution goes down," O'Leary told CNBC Friday. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call Friday morning following the deal announcement that planned Warner Bros. releases "will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros." Sarandos doesn't plan to alter WBD's current business practices, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Still, he does plan to meet with theater owners in an effort to assuage any concerns and to explain his vision that movies should have shorter exclusive theatrical windows, the person said. For exhibitors, shrinking theatrical windows pose a major threat. The company has long held that its content is meant for its streaming subscribers and therefore should be delivered to them at home, on the service as soon as possible. That's left industry analysts wondering if the company will continue WBD's transparency when it comes to ticket sales once the deal is finalized. "We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in the theaters," Sarandos said during Friday's investor call. "My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly." "Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for," he said. Of course, that strategy could shift in the coming years. Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush, highlighted in a research note Friday that the theatrical slate has already been negotiated through 2029. "So any buyer would have to honor those contracts by showing the slated WBD films in theaters for at least the next four years," Reese wrote. One theater chain operator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid thoughts, told CNBC, "All exhibition can do is take Netflix at their word." Netflix will have to diametrically alter their corporate philosophy of streaming first. — CNBC's Alex Sherman and Stephen Desaulniers contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels. "Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power," the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB. "So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members," ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump. "Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency," Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote. "Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country," she wrote. "Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent." Pan added that her colleagues "redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies." Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does "not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System." They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified "a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials." Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21. Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have "solely adjudicatory functions," Katsas and Walker noted. They cited the "War Claims Commission," a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example. Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on "whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials," they wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. "This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused," said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. "To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants," he said. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. "We will see hepatitis B come back," he said. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule." In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is "reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine." The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and "creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns." Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have "never tested" the hepatitis B vaccine "appropriately." Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. "We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses," said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations. Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is "deeply concerned" by the vote, which it said risks "reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death." The company added that "there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children." In a statement, GSK said, "we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oil prices were steady on Friday, supported by stalled Ukraine peace talks, though gains were offset by expectations of a supply glut. Brent crude rose 41 cents, or 0.65%, to $63.67 per barrel by 10:07 a.m ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate rose 36 cents, or 0.6%, to $60.03 a barrel. "It is quite flat today and this week had a narrow trading range," said Tamas Vargas, an oil market analyst at PVM. These two opposing forces make trading seemingly quiet." The market is also assessing the impact of a possible U.S. Fed rate cut and tensions with Venezuela, both of which could boost oil prices, analysts said. Of economists surveyed in a November 28 to December 4 Reuters poll, 82% expected a 25-basis-point interest rate reduction at next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. A rate cut would stimulate economic growth and energy demand. A peace deal with Russia would bring more barrels to the market and likely push prices down," said Anh Pham, a senior research specialist at LSEG. "On the other hand, any geopolitical escalation will drive prices higher. OPEC+ has agreed to keep production steady until early next year, so it adds some support for prices too," he said. Markets also continued to brace for a potential U.S. military incursion into Venezuela after President Donald Trump said late last week the U.S. would start taking action to stop Venezuelan drug traffickers on land "very soon". Rystad Energy said in a note that such a move could put at risk Venezuela's 1.1 million barrels per day of crude oil production, which goes mostly to China. Prices were also boosted this week by the failure of U.S. talks in Moscow to achieve any significant breakthrough over the war in Ukraine, which could have included a deal to let Russian oil back into the market. Those factors kept prices supported despite a growing surplus. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The New York Times on Friday filed a lawsuit against Perplexity, alleging the artificial intelligence startup has illegally copied and distributed its copyrighted content. The suit, filed in the Southern District of New York, accuses Perplexity of unlawfully scraping The Times' stories, videos, podcasts and other content to formulate responses to user queries. "While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity's unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products," Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. Perplexity did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Founded in 2022, Perplexity is best known for its AI-powered search engine that gives users simple answers to questions. The startup has raised more than $1.5 billion in funding from investors including IVP, New Enterprise Associates and Nvidia, according to PitchBook. "Publishers have been suing new tech companies for a hundred years, starting with radio, TV, the internet, social media and now AI. Fortunately it's never worked, or we'd all be talking about this by telegraph," Jesse Dwyer, head of communication at Perplexity, said in a statement. The Times is already involved in another ongoing copyright suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, which alleges the companies improperly used The Times' content to train their AI models. In September, AI startup Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class action lawsuit with a group of authors who claimed that the company had illegally downloaded their books and others from pirated databases. That settlement makes up the largest publicly reported copyright recovery. WATCH: Amazon sends Perplexity cease-and-desist over AI browser agents making purchases We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The streaming giant has agreed to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming businesses for an equity value of $72 billion, the companies said on Friday. It's by far Netflix's biggest acquisition in its history and is one of the largest ever in the entertainment industry. The seismic cash-and-stock deal, which has a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, will bring together Netflix's streaming platform with Warner Bros.' century-old studio, HBO, HBO Max, and some of the most iconic franchises in film and television. The acquisition is expected to close after WBD spins off its Global Networks division into a separate publicly traded company, Discovery Global, which includes WBD's TV networks like CNN, TNT, and TBS. Netflix investors don't seem thrilled with the deal, as its stock slid 3.9% in premarket trading on the news. Shares of rival bidders Paramount also retreated by 2.9%, while fellow suitor Comcast's stock was little changed. He called Warner Bros.' catalog "incredible" and said that bringing together classics such as "Citizen Kane" with Netflix hits like "Stranger Things," "KPop Demon Hunters," and "Squid Game" would allow the company to entertain the world "even better." Sarandos said this merger would let Netflix give audiences "more of what they love" while helping shape the next century of global storytelling. Netflix plans to preserve Warner Bros.' existing operations, including its theatrical release pipeline. Several WBD employees said they were on edge about a Netflix acquisition. One longtime HBO software engineer said they were worried about their job if the Netflix acquisition went through. Their reasoning was that Netflix already has a top-notch tech platform, so they might not keep many software engineers if the tech giant came out on top and collapsed HBO Max's platform into its own. Another WBD streaming employee expressed a similar concern about Netflix and their personal job security. They said they weren't too concerned about their job security with a deal, adding that in past transactions involving WBD's assets, reorgs took a long time to come to fruition. Warner Bros. grants Netflix access to some of the most recognizable titles in modern entertainment, including enduring sitcoms like "Friends" and "The Big Bang Theory," as well as prestige television from HBO, franchises like "Harry Potter," and classic movies like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Casablanca." While Netflix built its empire on original programming, it has long lacked the kind of heritage intellectual property that more established studios, such as Disney, have. If regulators approve the deal, Netflix subscribers are likely to get a wider selection of premium content on the platform. Regulators are expected to scrutinize the deal closely. Netflix already has the largest paid streaming service by both subscribers and engagement, so the consensus among media analysts was that it didn't necessarily need HBO Max and its content. Many industry insiders thought Ellison's apparent rapport with Trump could help a Paramount-WBD deal get a headache-free approval process. Rich Greenfield of LightShed Partners made the case that Comcast should go all out to buy WBD's studio and streamer, writing that it was time for the company "to make a bold move to change the narrative around Comcast." Without HBO Max, Greenfield said its Peacock streamer would be "stranded without an obvious merger partner and at a meaningful content deficit." Instead, Netflix appears poised to acquire HBO Max and its large subscriber base.</p>

Delta Flight 208 took off from New York on Thursday evening and was supposed to land at Edinburgh Airport around 9 a.m. local time. It then changed course for Ireland, landing in Dublin just after 10 a.m. "Due to an IT issue with our air traffic control provider, no flights are currently operating from Edinburgh Airport," the airport said in a statement on X. Data from Flightradar24 shows 11 flights bound for Edinburgh have been diverted, mostly to nearby Glasgow. At around 10:45 a.m. local time, less than an hour after the Delta flight landed in Dublin, flights resumed from Edinburgh Airport. Delta could not immediately be reached for comment outside US working hours. Have your travel plans been affected by the Edinburgh airport IT outage?</p>

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is done talking about the cloud and is renaming everything after its AI software Agentforce — perhaps even the whole company. Salesforce slapped the "Agentforce" moniker on many of its products and services recently. And when the company reported earnings this week, there were updated names for several offerings. A Salesforce employee recently told Business Insider that the company might change its official corporate name to Agentforce. However, during an interview with Benioff late on Wednesday, the CEO confirmed this is a possibility. There's precedent for such radical moves in the industry, as companies shift focus to new technologies or strategies. Mark Zuckerberg famously changed Facebook's name to Meta. Google's cofounders also changed their corporate name to Alphabet. Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. He learned this during recent focus groups ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce conference in October. Instead, clients want to talk about AI agents. "I dropped the word cloud totally," he said. Did you notice I never used it in the keynote? We learned in focus groups customers don't talk about cloud anymore. They just want to talk about their agentic interface." Data 360 is central to the company's 2026 strategic plan, which Benioff also discussed with Business Insider during the interview. Salesforce has made a huge bet on AI agents. Some insiders have cast doubt on the initiative, but Wednesday's earnings showed some positive signs as the company raised its revenue forecast.</p>

Legal tech startup Harvey this year has bagged $760 million in funding and soared to a valuation of $8 billion. Harvey, which on Thursday announced the close of a $160 million funding round, says its products free lawyers from drudge work so they can spend more time on strategy and client counseling. But at this point, Harvey's ROI shows up in feelings more than spreadsheets. Law firms want the payoff to show up on financial reports and client bills, says Zach Abramowitz, a former lawyer turned technology consultant for the legal field. According to a Boston Consulting Group survey this year of more than 1,250 global firms, only 5% of companies were seeing real returns on AI. Investors have thrown $3.2 billion at startups in the legal field this year, according to a Business Insider analysis. Harvey alone has scarfed up nearly one in four of those dollars. Harvey builds software for analyzing and drafting documents using legally-tuned large language models. The startup has proven that lawyers want what it's selling. Every organization is seeking to nail down the value of artificial intelligence, said Winston Weinberg, Harvey's cofounder and chief executive. Time savings, he said, are the "first horizon of measuring ROI." "Longer term, industry-wide, you'll want to see metrics on transformation, profits per partner for firms, and ultimately revenue metrics for in-house teams." To prove it isn't just selling workplace satisfaction, Harvey recently hired legal-intelligence shop RSGI to run a study of 40 Harvey customers, from A&O Shearman and Paul Weiss to the legal departments of AT&T and National Grid. Most respondents said Harvey paid off in months, not years, with lawyers churning through work faster. And most said they'd be "upset or disappointed" if the tool vanished. What eluded firms was a clear way to turn all that enthusiasm into hard metrics. Only about a fifth of participants — six law firms and two in-house teams — said they had a formal way to track the return on their investment in Harvey tools. Most said they relied on adoption stats and anecdotal "power user" stories to track Harvey's usefulness. When asked how they measured value, 83% cited internal adoption, 75% intensity of usage, and 58% time savings. Harvey has clearly answered the question: "Do lawyers actually use this?" The open question is whether usage translates into higher profits or just nicer Tuesdays.</p>

For the last century, Caterpillar's calling card has been its trademark macaroni-yellow backhoes and bulldozers. At hundreds of data center construction sites across the US, Caterpillar — alongside Cummins, Generac, and Rolls-Royce — supplies dozens of these machines. With some capable of powering more than 1,000 homes, generators ensure that AI models and cloud software can run without interruption. These hulking devices, it turns out, are cash cows. Instead, it has ended up in the hands of builders, blue-collar laborers, and companies like Caterpillar and Cummins, which manufacture unsexy but crucial equipment. Both companies have beaten the S&P 500 over the past year — and their stock prices have spiked even more than that of many major data-center customers, including Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Plenty of non-tech companies have benefited from AI spending, including companies like Primoris and Dycom Industries that lay pipes and fiber that connect data centers to natural gas and the internet. Generator companies are particularly well-positioned: As hyperscalers race to build power-hungry data centers, the demand for backup and off-grid electricity has ballooned. "Power generation is a business that has never seen this kind of scale, in any way, ever," Tom Shepherd, a data center executive at Cummins, told Business Insider. About a decade ago, Shepherd oversaw a $50 million-a-year regional power-generation business in Oklahoma that largely sold Cummins systems to customers like hospitals and wastewater plants. He recalled just one large data center in his territory, run by Google. "There just wasn't the scale," he said. Today, Google's parent company, Alphabet, has more than two dozen data centers online or in development across the US. It has revised its planned capex spending for 2025 upwards every quarter, and now estimates that it will spend at least $91 billion by the end of the year. For manufacturing-oriented industrial businesses that have faced threats from tariffs, rising expenses, and persistently high interest rates, data center demand is a welcome bright spot. Business Insider previously used diesel generator air permits to estimate data center growth and found that if all permitted data centers went online, their electricity use could be as much as the entire state of Florida. Sales of Cummins' signature truck engines have slipped over the past year, but the company sold $2.6 billion of power-generation equipment to the data-center industry last year and expects that number to grow by 30 to 35% this year, CEO Jennifer Rumsey said on a conference call last month. Both hit all-time highs this week; Cat closed above $590 a share on Wednesday, topping the previous high set after beating earnings in October, and Cummins shares crossed $507 on Wednesday. In October, Morgan Stanley estimated that Cat's power-generation arm was valued by investors at 60-to-100 times its operating income. At Nvidia, the same multiple was 25 times; at GE Verova, another electrical-equipment business, the multiple was 28 times. Melissa Busen, who runs the electrical power division at Cat, says she's not worried. If one of them has hardships, she said, another will take its place. Cat broke ground last year on a $725 million expansion of its engine factory in Lafayette, Indiana, where it currently employs 1,900 people. Expansions are also underway at Rolls-Royce plants that build data-center generator parts in South Carolina and Minnesota. Data center construction in Asia and Europe is also a component of demand, and many generators are manufactured outside the US. Cummins said earlier this year that it planned to invest $200 million across its power-generation manufacturing sites in India, England, and the US. Increasingly, Cat and Cummins have been called on by Microsoft, Amazon, hyperscalers like Coreweave, and regional players like Joule for natural gas-burning generators and turbines that can run 24/7 for months or even years. Cat's Busen said customers don't just want to talk about engines and turbines — they want to talk about "a complete, integrated solution" to their electrical needs, including things like batteries, inverters, and control systems. The biggest limiting factor for now, said Shepherd, is "the physical ability of our society to build this kind of infrastructure."</p>

"I think it's actually more surprising than it's taken this long for Google to overtake OpenAI," Geoffrey Hinton, a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto who previously worked at Google Brain, told Business Insider in a Tuesday interview. Google is coming off the heels of its widely praised launch of Gemini 3, an update that some in tech said elevated the giant beyond OpenAI's GPT-5. Google's Nano Banana Pro AI image model has also proven to be a hit. Three years after Google reportedly declared a "code red" after the release of ChatGPT, recent reports indicate it's now OpenAI that is sounding the alarm. Making its own chips is a "big advantage" to Google, Hinton said. Hinton, who helped pioneer AI research during his time at Google Brain, said that the search giant was once at the forefront of AI but held back. "Google was in the lead for a long time, right?" Google was cautious, Hinton said, in the wake of Microsoft's disastrous 2016 launch of its short-lived "Tay" AI chatbot, which it took offline after it posted incredibly racist tweets. "Google, obviously, had a very good reputation and was worried about damaging it like that," he said. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has previously said that the company held back on releasing its chatbot. "We hadn't quite gotten it to a level where you could put it out and people would've been okay with Google putting out that product," Pichai said earlier this year. "It still had a lot of issues at that time." Just last year, Google had to pause its AI image generator after some users complained that results showing historically inaccurate images of people of color were too "woke." Its initial AI search overviews generated nonsensical advice, such as putting glue on pizza to prevent cheese from falling off. Hinton left Google in 2023, citing concerns about AI's development. "Geoff's work on neural networks — spanning his time in academia and his decade here at Google — laid the foundation for modern AI," Google said in a statement. "This chair honors his legacy and will help the university recruit visionary scholars dedicated to the same kind of curiosity-driven, fundamental research that Geoff championed."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors anxious about an AI-driven stock market bubble are focusing on the wrong place, Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist said. David Kostin said on the firm's "Exchanges" podcast published on Thursday that the bubble isn't in the soaring share prices of Nvidia and other publicly traded AI giants. Instead, it's in the private-market frenzy happening far from Wall Street's daily price discipline. Drawing on legendary investor George Soros's theory that rising prices often attract more capital, Kostin said private AI valuations are feeding on growth expectations rather than fundamentals. "As these firms are raising capital, the growth rate increases. Kostin emphasized that reflexivity is just one issue. He pointed to another risk from "circular financing" or "vendor financing," in which growth depends on outside funding that may not hold up. "At some point, the vendor doesn't necessarily have the same growth to be able to fund that growth," he said. That dynamic stands in contrast to the public market, he said, where prices and earnings have moved in lockstep. He cited the example of AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose share price has increased by 12-fold in the last three years — but its earnings have increased by 12-fold as well. Even broader valuation metrics don't appear to be in classic bubble territory. The US has seen about 55 IPOs larger than $25 million this year — a fraction of the 280 in 2021 and nearly 400 in 1999. "There is capital availability in the public markets, but not necessarily ebullient. It's there but not so dramatic," Kostin said.</p>
